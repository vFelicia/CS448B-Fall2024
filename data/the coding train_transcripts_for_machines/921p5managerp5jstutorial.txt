hello welcome to a video tutorial about something related to p5 called p5 manager now p5 manager is by chin how you thank you for making this wonderful tool I hope that it's okay that I'm making a video about it I am NOT an expert I did not I can take no credit whatsoever for this wonderful thing called p5 manager but I knew about it and I can use it in class the other day and it really helped me out so I wanted to make a video so other people would learn about it so ok so what is p5 minute or you guys might be aware that one of the things that I do it's a really bad habit sometimes when I want to make a new sketch I go to p5.js org it's a great technique here then I go to download then I'm like oh which leg download oh ok I'm gonna download p5 GS complete and I click on that and it download something and then I find it you can see look at me this is how ridiculously horrible I am you could see that I have done this is like big 95 the same thing I just download it and then I like opened it up and when I find somewhere in here like oh there's like empty example and I rename it or I copy it somewhere and that's like my new sketches i'ma do this is not a great workflow p5 manager is a commandline tool that you can execute from the command line what's the command line you know have you since some videos you might it uses it's built on top of something called node and I have another video that I'll link to about what is know but you don't really need to know what note it is you do need to install node to use this so you can go to node.js org install node and then you can use this node comes with something called NPM which is stands for node package manager which is a way to manage the packages you want to use with node and but why is this relevant because p5 manager is a node package a node is a serverside programming framework in JavaScript and there's a lot that we could say about things that you could do with it but we're not really doing anything with node whatsoever we're just lucky to bask in the glory and somebody else bothered to make something with node called p5 manager so if I've installed dode the next thing I can do is go here and I can run this command so what I want to say is NPM node package manager install I won't install something G G is an kind of an important detail but not so important for us right now it means I want to install this globally meaning it's not part of an individual project it's this thing that I just want to use always on my computer from now on p5 manager is my thing now so I can take this and I can say copy it and I can then go to here and I'm gonna just paste it in I could have just typed it might give me an error it might give me an error this might happen to you we're in a hope this error doesn't happen but it might happen in fact I mean good if it happens because if it happens then you'll see it happen and you'll know how to fix it oh yeah they got the error alright so what is the error now the air is permission denied and this is actually has to do with the fact that we we want to install it globally the if we'd salty means it has to go in the like depths of your computer where only the administrator whoever that is maybe you can like you've got to like get into the guts of the system files in all sorts of fancy places that you have to have permission for so there's a way to get permission to do that and the way to do that with terminal is by saying a sudo which stands for Super User do Super User do NPM G no no I don't know I don't know what the order this really matters install G was in back out p5 manager and now oh it asked for my password and good thing I think I know think I know the password sorry about that hopefully you're watching this and I'm now just reappeared and I figured out the password and entered it so I'm gonna run the sudo command for Hewitt can with the correct password so you can watch okay hey that seemed to have worked so now I have installed forevermore the p5 manager with note so there are a bunch of things you can do with the p5 manager and I encourage you maybe I'll come back to these if it's interesting or but I want to show you like these kind of like the simplest way ever to use it so the p5 manager will actually allow you to create a collection of sketches and you can you can serve them up and run us and like makes it like a little like web page with a like a table of contents of all the things you've made but and you should you could follow these instructions for that but I'm actually going to scroll down and what I want to do is just generate a standalone project so I for me in making examples and I put them in all different places it's less about a collection right now and then individual like standalone projects so I want to do this anytime I write now that I've installed that package I can just write p5 anytime in my terminal window now and it's gonna say look hey you've installed p5 manager zero point three point two so but whenever I want to run a specific p5 command like p5 generate that's going to generate a project and then I have to give it some specific parameters arguments of what kind of project I want to generate so what I want to do is I want to generate a bundle with a particular name and for short you can also just type p5 G B but I'm gonna be longwinded about it for the purpose of this video tutorial bundle and coding train will be the name of my project and I'm going to hit enter so now that this worked I realized I kind of did something pretty terrible which is when you first open at least on the Mac your terminal window it just plops you right into the root directory of your computer and that's probably not where I want to put my coding train project so you know this is a bit of an aside but I can you can change directories I could say like CD documents because really what I want to do is be in the documents and I can make a folder called something like p5 project which already exists there and I could say CVP five projects and then now what I want to do is go back and run this one more time to get it right I'm gonna run that one more time you can see it created those projects I can go back to the finder I can go into p5 projects and I can see look at what I've got I have now have a folder called coding train which really is just one project it's got the HTML file it's got the sketch J's file it's got that whoops which I just opened up by accident and it's got the the libraries folder with the p5 libraries so this is the way to create an individual single p5 project I can do this all the time now I'm gonna do it in one of my future videos I can edit and work on it that way and we'll always get the most current version to the p5 library and I encourage you to explore also the collection the collection functionality of this as well which you can make a nice little like what page it doesn't automatically with all your projects ok so thank you for watching about the p5 manager hopefully it's useful to you I will see you in a future video or you might see me using the p5 manager thank you very much you
