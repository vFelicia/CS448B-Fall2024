so do do do do do do foreign so do do do do well hello happy friday good morning welcome to the coding train with train whistle classic because i can't find my new custom laser etched train whistle i've got to just use this uh old one that i used to use oh but it has the best sound listen to that now i'm using some uh very fancy hightech uh artificial intelligence sound processing technology to reduce the echo that's in this room that i'm in because i somehow refuse i should just show you something here i mean i should just spend wouldn't you want to watch just an entire live stream of me kind of trying to attach these to the ceiling hang some sound blankets i mean maybe if i just speak like this is this better um was the whistle silent because i wonder i have noise reduction on and i wonder if my no sound oh this is so strange are you all hearing me please let me know if i'm coming to you loud and clear and live i'm tripping over things i have something exciting to show you actually though oh no i'm getting a phone call well this is an important phone call but i can't take it while i'm live on there i actually just got a really important text message which read what am i forgetting for the seder plate so i probably should answer that uh happy whatever holiday if you're choosing to celebrate any of the possible holidays that might be happening anytime within the last six months or the next six months you know if you're following a 12month calendar oh there's just so many ways that you could be that's just different and interesting we're from all over the world and i would like to hear from you in the chat tell me where you're from you can hear me but not the train and i say wave collapse function again oh i said it wrong again the whistle was silent that's insane wow the a okay hold on hold on everybody we're going to uh we're going to make something happen here that is completely insane uh i'm going to disable the futuristic hightech artificial intelligence train whistle suppression engine that i am running i see we've got south africa we've got ethiopia india indonesia this is incredible and and to think that i was like i spent by the way all of my prep time if there ever was any prep time for me live streaming was spent me working on a message saying i'm not able to live stream today and i was like i just have to do it it doesn't matter i have between 9 45 a.m and 11 45 a.m free even though i'm unprepared i don't know how to code a thing that i might like to code i have a uh i don't know what to do but i have a list of things because i was streaming on twitch yesterday and i made a list of things that i would do today so hold on i've got to get rid of this france nepal argentina new jersey venezuela nigeria brooklyn new york hello okay brooklyn uh uh oh i am not in brooklyn new york at the moment although that is where i do consider my home to kentucky usa chris sears hello denmark oh whoops hold on uh uh whoa oh now i'm getting some weird echo sound oh oh i i think i have the monitor on and it's coming out okay hold on boston sorry everybody this is too much where's my production team to help me navigate all this i got to turn the echo reduction off noise suppression so you can hear this just could you please stop distracting me with all of the amazing places you are around the world uh nvidia bro broadcast sorry for the sorry for the uh focus issues i can't i can't make it happen where is the software oh there it is there it is okay can i do this okay the noise removal is gone but the echo removal is still on so let's see how this goes ready everybody welcome to the coding train okay so i've got to um do something i've got a guest coming on in a minute uh before i get to that let me thank today's sponsor brilliant do you like learning do you like the coding train guess what i think you're also gonna like brilliant it's a website there's an app it's just got all of these courses and interactive lessons the thing is the thing that i like to say about brilliant which i think is really important is that you're watching me and i'm here tucking tucking tucking waving my arms around trying to get you excited about code and different things you might want to learn that's great that's a thing i'm glad you're here i'm glad you're watching but one of the real uh real ways to learn i think is to just get your hands in there to try it yourself and that's what i try to encourage you to do watch the video try it yourself but another way to do that is through interactive lessons online and i can't really think of a better platform than brilliant to do that so you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrade that lets them know that you found it through me there's lots of stuff you can do for free on the website and then if you want to get the premium subscription which unlocks all of their courses there's a really good neural networked one there's a really good like algorithm fundamental one you can purchase a premium subscription and the first 200 people to do so will get uh 20 off so thank you to brilliant for sponsoring the coding train today i'll come back in the middle somebody remind me at around maybe an hour to look at the brilliant website a bit more all right now let me move that um did you all hear the train whistle did you all hear the train whistle that's what i would like to know and while uh while you're waiting for the train whistle i am going to bring in our guest oh my goodness i have so many messages okay somebody list for me in the chat the things you need on a seder plate because that'll help i know there's a shank bone there's an orange an orange is a new thing on a seder plate which uh we do in my familia um okay but wait wait there's so many okay okay uh i i gotta put the passover stuff away i gotta let in our guest here um so hold on i'm gonna um uh the audio is okay uh hello sauber your audio is going straight through to the broadcast just so you know uh so before you say anything you don't want anybody to hear like dan yeah that shirt is awful why are you wearing it or something like that um but actually could you just speak i don't your video is not up yet but if you would just say hello i can see if the audio is going through oh so ironically enough the audio's not coming through so let me fix that no no hold on it might be my headphones no no no your audio is coming through to me it just wasn't going to the stream and now it is so what i'm going to do is i am going to um i think if i press this button here aha yes uh whoops i've i just i think inadvertently revealed my the zoom meeting id but don't worry there's a waiting room so all the people will start trying to get into the waiting room so you're now you're seeing me here uh talking to sauber i um sabres from the prostate foundation we've known each other for many years worked i've i've been lucky enough to get to participate in a lot of different initiatives that sauber has organized like uh creative coding fest uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten how many have there been uh almost 10 i think almost 10 not wrong um so can everybody hear sober okay yeah people are saying it's fine in the chat so um i think what i'd like to let cyber do is tell you about a few things that are going on with the processing foundation if you're not familiar with the processing foundation processingfoundation.org i can bring the website up while cyber is talking and um it's a it's an organization that i've been involved with for uh almost 20 years now that hasn't existed for 20 years so that's impossible but you know the software was existed before the foundation anyway um and so there's a bunch of things going on that i want people to hear about that you can apply for that you can get involved for and sober um as the education community director is that the right uh is is a great person to tell you about this stuff so i'm gonna i i have a problem with stopping talking so i'm gonna do it i can mute my microphone actually i just mute it and let uh lip sauber take it away for a few minutes sure uh thank you thanks for having me on uh this morning um hi everyone on the coding train um longtime listener and myself um i want to share a couple of programs that are coming up that you can apply to work with us that'll happen this summer they're really exciting and i would love for this community to put in applications if they haven't the first one is google summer of code and let me see if i can oh i can't share my screen but um maybe dan can pull it up look yeah totally yeah so um google summer of code is an opportunity to uh contribute to open source development uh google will fund your time we will provide mentorship and community and you get to work on some of our software projects and that runs uh this summer the application deadline is coming up really soon it's in four days on april 19th uh so if you're interested in google summer of code you know definitely go to the website that dan's showing you can also jump to our discourse which is a place where you can discuss your ideas and then please put an application if you have questions about how to do any of that you can send me an email at sabretprocessing.org i'll put that in the coding train chat in a minute after that and uh excitingly for this project google summer of code they've expanded eligibility which is one reason why i wanted to sort of let people know all over again about it uh so the only requirement is you have to be 18 and above um you have to be above age of 18 and new to open source there's a couple of minor eligibility requirements beyond that but it really offers a lot of folks a chance to get involved with us so i hope if software development's of interest to you you look into this april 19th is the application deadline the other thing i wanted to mention um this um also happens every year is the processing foundation fellowship this one is due on may 1st what is the processing foundation fellowship um i think of it as a way to like either build something for our community or with our community and there's a bunch of priority areas that we have identified things like ai accessibility continuing support which means that you're gonna take one of our old projects and kind of continue to build on it uh ecology uh has been added this year and uh beyond that you can also seek to make educational materials which would be a teaching fellow then you'd work with me and some of our teacher mentors and we would support you in making education materials and putting them out to the world this also comes with a stipend and mentorship and a community what else did i want to say about that i think that's kind of it for apply to that one you would just go to the processing foundation website and fellowship and apply there um and you have about you know two weeks left for that so also reach out both to me or directly to the foundation foundationalprocessing.org if you have questions about uh the fellowship i think that's it oh creative coding fest i think we're going to do another one virtually this spring um this is where we bring educators and students together and uh basically like a mini version of coding train with like 45minute workshops from educators a chance to get your hands dirty meet some of the people that are teaching this stuff uh and learned some little work you know some how to how to do a couple of projects um and what details are still being figured out if you're interested in that also email me starboardprocessing.org so that's the three things google summer of code processing fellowship and cc fast um how's that then did i did that that was perfect only thing that i would add is that because i said scrolling through the website a great great thing that you can do is check out the processing foundation's medium page which has a lot of blog posts about previous fellowships and previous google summer of code projects and that will give you an idea of things that people have done in the past that you might want to continue or just understand sort of what the scope is what's a reasonable scope and how people have sort of organized their thinking around different projects they've developed so that would be here i'm on the processing foundation website under fellowships right actually right here you can just see uh view the fellows from 2021 and 2020 but if i go over to the medium page we'll see there's an open uh post about the open call and then there's lots of uh wonderful posts about different things that people have done in the past digital accessibility uh p5 live um three layer cake cs cake that's brilliant uh internationalization support et cetera et cetera and so um obaro asks in the chat are the are these opportunities remote and uh the answer to that is a distinct yes so um you know in in in the olden days we used to try to do a lot of uh physical gettogethers if there was a group of people in a sort of like one part of the world that were relatively near each other maybe that's a thing we could do we want to foster community as much as possible but absolutely there is no physical location requirement for you to do this there might be some eligibility requirements like sauber mentioned that are google's um eligibility requirements for their program the fellowship is open to anyone anywhere in the world as far as i know um but um so just check all those eligibility requirements but yes you don't have to be in person for any of this um just checking the chat i don't see any other questions so um i'm gonna i can let cyber go on with uh their day and um i thank you so much for being here oh so many people have questions um uh can they uh um what's the best way for them to contact you the email you suggested email email is great yeah cyber at processing and then a general question would be foundation of processing uh would be uh either um yeah thanks for having me on dan excited to see what you make today we'll see yeah all right and i'm gonna watch the severance this weekend you could just text me all weekend with all of your takes because i'm i'm i'm obsessed so i'll uh we'll have plenty to say about that soon enough all right thank you bye all right i'm just taking a peek at the chat let me get myself back here how do you add the subtitles actually this is something that i'm really hoping to improve uh subtitles i'm just using google's automated subtitles for live streams for videos i have them professionally captioned or i do some editing of them myself or somebody who works on codingtrain things uh helps me with that but um yeah if you uh are a um a subtitle user i mean i i watch a lot of shows with subtitles although i my hearing is uh as far as i know pretty reasonably fine um but if you have uh feedback or thoughts about how the content i'm doing can be made more accessible um please tweet at me email me daniel at thecodingtrain.com um i would love to hear from you okay can you restart your neural networks from scratch there's it's probably not going to happen because i have too much to do all right let me talk to you very briefly about what's on my list oh and let me check i i think the twitter poll i put up ended so um let me just look here under my profile i've got like uh oh well i guess i guess the people have spoken and i said wave collapse function again it's wave function collapse this is not a good sign for me trying to do a coding challenge today okay um let's take a look at the the the actual live stream poll which i'm going to end um yeah all right all right people we're doing it so i have something to say which is that um i mean i the problem is i have some other stuff on this list okay let's give me let's say let's say i have to start wave function collapse by 10 30 at the very latest no matter what else is going on so that is 19 minutes from now i have to start it um i'm just looking to see hopefully there's some moderators in the chat um who can help with any of the spam here justin i'm not sure uh oh i i'm trying to match your name and your chat message with your twitter post it's a little hard for me to do that okay but um even though all i want to do is talk about severance at least take a peek by the way i i want to work on this during a live stream i'll probably do it on twitch um but uh take a look at the uur bot um which is a new bot that i've released on twitter um you know just just some people follow the pot not naming any names okay i'm very proud of myself i'm very proud of myself the crows off in the building of my the crows on the roof of my building scream like the sea and i know there's a storm coming i have lots to do with the spot if you want to contribute get in touch all right let's look at what else is on this list so i wanted to talk about some upcoming plans i have to reboot my twitter and discord bot series but wave function collapse so that's just going to put it just going to mention that and put a check mark next to it um i want to relearn apple to basic because i'm planning to do some videos with my apple two plus oh i have something exciting to show you which i'll show you in a second but oh i for did i put that on the list uh i don't think i um i don't put that i don't think i put that on the list but it's not gonna happen today because wave function collapse the collapse of the coding train function is imminent but i do have something i really feel like i should do live but i'm gonna punt it till later but let me mention it um and then maybe maybe you maybe you're all okay with just putting your trust and faith in me or maybe i'll just do a twitch stream just for this um but um i put out a survey i cannot believe uh to get some feedback about the coding train i am compiling the results and reading through the survey it's incredible there were over 2 000 responses to this which is just blows my mind um and there was an option in the survey unfortunately it's closed now so sorry sorry for you if you were just hearing about this i'll do another one uh where you could enter to win a sticker giveaway so i was going to write a little p5 sketch to pick the winners and do that live but wave function collapse wave function collapse wave function collapse way stay with me everybody wave function could everybody just like get behind me and all just stand all everybody stand behind me and cheer my name as i'm working on wave function collapse that's a severance reference i'll try to stop making everything of severance reference okay uh you should talk about severance who cares about it so first of all let me just get this out of the way if you are interested i give i have i have six more minutes before i promised i would start i kind of have to erase the whiteboard though so that's good and i got to set up my code so really i have like two more minutes then i promise no more severance content but for those who are interested one check out uh first we'll listen to the podcast uh which had a nice interview with uh michael chernus uh who is the inspiration or his character in severance is the inspiration for you know follow dr amanda r on twitter also the um world's leading severant social media influencer um the uur bot checkout uh inspired by the character uh dr rick and lazlo hale i'm working on it it's sort of an alpha but people found it i mean i put it out there and so it's no longer alpha people are reading the tweets um and then also check out a lumen dash industries.com where you can enjoy uh macro macro data refinement to your heart's content uh and i would sit here and do this for hours and hours like i do in my that's why i don't prepare for the coding trade anymore all i do is refine the data wave function collapse wave function collapse i got it i got it everyone just keeps saying it um and if you want to contribute to either of these projects github.com shiffman is where you will find the u the uur bot it's probably it's a recent repository um there it is uur bot it needs a lot of work um i haven't piled uh compiled issues and things that i want to do or written to read me so i need to do all that and then you can also go to github.com lumen industries that's the company that i'm hoping will well hire me maybe i'm not hoping i think that's a bad idea actually but um this one is a bit more organized with a readme and uh there are some active pull requests going on and a bunch of issues of things that are to be implemented so frau plays it every day oh you've made me so happy that's the greatest thing i've ever heard and we'll be i'm going to be happy later today even even when this uh wave function collapse thing goes horribly wrong because here's the thing i'm going in totally cold which is and this is not an easy just like oh i already sort of know this or like i understand how it works so i'll just sort of figure it out as i go all right so i'm going to move this over here and close a bunch of windows we're going to get started i do need to look at the um brilliant website in the middle of the stream so i can't forget that i'm just closing all these windows it's also it's cold in here it's such a warm beautiful day and i um but this this room really my hands are but i think the cold is good it's gonna i'm gonna keep my energy up there will be a musical dance experience to be had oh jeez help help me somebody i'm in the country in the boonies there's just trees around me and i have all these lights and cameras and people watching what am i to do okay um i think that okay so wave function collapse we're gonna go to the uh source i know you're not seeing my screen right now that's gonna um i want to go to the uh this is it okay bringing this back um okay now something that's really driving me crazy is that my audio is being monitored by uh and it's coming out i gotta turn i gotta mute the pc okay i think it should be fine simon says literally in the last hour tried to figure out how the algorithm works how did that go see the thing is this is a bad idea this is not realistic for me to do in the next hour and 25 minutes so this part of me is like i should save this for a day when i have almost a full day to stream or maybe i should like do a little bit more research first or and just do something else today but you the people have spoken and i said i was gonna do it so i i have a feeling i'm gonna go in as if so the process that i have now as i live stream trying to work through some kind of algorithm or project and then i while i'm doing that i record everything to disk and i have something exciting to show you two minutes left um and which i'll get to in a second um and um then that gets edited together uh you know with some cutting out some extraneous stuff adding some additional like animations or explanations if i record them later to try to make a somewhat coherent somewhere between 20 and 60 minutes is sort of my goal video called the coding challenge wave function collapse so i just don't think it's realistic for me to do the whole thing today but this is what i feel like why don't i get it started see how it goes i can return and record the rest later or i could just come back and do the whole thing over at some point i've had a little bit of practice i think that's what i have to do i i don't know what else to say um all right i'm just taking a peek at the chat sounds like a plan yep right sounds like a plan ah this whistle this you're hearing the sound now right it's incredible and it doesn't have any echo is that amazing all right let me show you my exciting thing i see that it is 10 20. uh let's see if this works uh so i'm in a new studio and i put a camera over there uh which now you can see hi that's the wide shot so this is by the way i wanted to just introduce you to my new setup i mean it's the same setup that i've been using for years and years and years i just keep remaking it and i have this new uh big space where i'm living now um and i've been uh doing a lot of work on it and got some new sheet rock and painted some walls and put down a epoxy of blue epoxy on the floor you can see that i have legs this is a nice standing desk this is where the streaming pc is over here you can see where the cameras are and this is the whiteboard camera which i think is uh working pretty well these days i do need to erase this and i bought i went to ye olde hardware store and i have a righty board microfiber eraser cloth this is all the content that you signed up for today oh come on you can't open it okay wait i think i have a scissors somewhere everybody we come back over here i'm just curious to see if people have any uh mystery solved yes uh okay i'm uh got my beautiful oh there's two of them which is good because i wanted to get a microfiber cloth to clean my apple ii plus computer which unfortunately the camera is not pointed at the wide shot if you missed that stream oh good news by the way for those of you who caught my stream when i was uh building and well not building but i was re rebuilding and turning on um my apple ii plus computer for the first time in uh probably i don't know let's see probably let's say the last time it was used was 1990 if i if i had to guess so 30 plus years oh we got it by the way this is the todo list for the macro data refinement you'd think i would have thought to erase the whiteboard before i came in here i think i'm going to need some water um excuse me get some water talk amongst yourselves i'm going to wet this cloth slightly oh no you know what i have because oh i have a um i don't know if you can see me i should put the wide shot back on but i have a um like a wet wipe type thing oh i just took too many so this should this should do the trick really fast oh my goodness yeah by the way this is uh my daughter's drawing she was in here drew that so sorry maybe i'll leave that there now i guess i have to i'm gonna erase it she'll be fine okay okay uh that did the trick i don't i don't have a trash can all right now i'm gonna maybe i shouldn't well caution to the wind here there we go okay the next thing i need to do is set up a code file um and let me bring myself over here oh i need to i need to i definitely need to make sure i'm recording to disk so please bear with me for a second while i pull that up uh okay hold on it's coming all right uh no remind me later about updating oh and uh you know what just start recording okay so that's recording i'm recording to disk now um okay let me move some things to the side here that are unnecessary uh okay um i'm sorry sorry i'm looking at my phone which is a terrible idea but you never know the one the thing is i was gonna stream this afternoon and i had like a ton of i i thought i had like three or three or four hour block but i forgot because of the holidays i have to pick up my kids from school early i've got um so there's i got some family stuff going on so this is my only free time and it's it's dwindling fast because as i don't know who it was who said it in the chat uh here we are um is the red theme on your browser new i don't know i don't know where that came from i have no idea where that came from but great question uh uh justin that's that's nice of you to say i hope that your daughter is enjoys watching and maybe is interested in programming someday or already it's programming okay i've got to find a good whiteboard marker and let's okay let's go whoops let's start setting up so i um i think that i should use for this i'm not going to use the p5 web editor this feels like a complex enough project that having a bit more space and making sure i have easy access to the javascript console is going to be important so let's go to the desktop let's make a directory called wave function collapse and let's open that up in visual studio code and so um my workflow videos could use a refresher as everything could but um this is kind of my code editor of choice these days uh and i'm just going to have two files an html file and a sketch.js file and the way i like to write my html file is by going to the p5 web editor and taking this and then cop pasting it here whoops that's in sketch.js we're on file pasting it here and then going into stats.js and putting in a setup function and a draw function uh and will just give us a nice gray background to start and then making sure that uh oh and then i would like to run i've been using more recently the live server um which um does a good job of just auto refreshing when i change the code although i don't always want that to happen so i might go back actually you know what i don't like that because i like to be able to dramatically refresh and restart the sketch myself so let's go to this okay that's fine and let me just make sure that uh it's picking up the new code all right we're ready to go um i would also like to filter out the warnings the thing is like i made that april fool's video with the anal retentive coder which um like four people watched and then like ever since i made that i realized like oh my god that's me that was not a joke that's what i do all the time i'm like okay no i can't have these yellow warnings here oh my goodness it's looking for a style sheet we must fix that and i never get to anything um all right i do not need the sound library and i also that's fine now the warnings are gone now okay um i can close this all right i'm gonna have a little i'm gonna try to warm up okay see um oh yeah uh yeah i know i i read that link um so there's a lot of really great resources let me just jump into this video and i apologize i have to um blow my nose i think allergy season uh is is happening for me okay um all right so i'm just gonna dive in i'm recording to disc um um and um so i'm going with my plan here it is what it is thank you for being here i mean i should the live stream the other thing is be part of here we go ready everybody hello and welcome to a coding challenge video i'm dan and i am dreadfully unprepared for this let me so the topic is oh it's an incredible topic it's called wave function collapse and i'm going to put up a bunch of images and different things and resources and links that you will all be in the description that you can go to to read about there are just so many examples of this incredible procedural generative algorithm all over the internet it's a new algorithm uh it was started it was i think 2000 the origins are 2016 by on the github username is mxgmn so all the proper credits will be again in the video description but if you're here to watch a proper tutorial about wave function collapse maybe go back to your search engine type in wave function collapse tutorial again because i don't think this is going to be it because i'm going in almost entirely cold i have read one or two one to three web pages about this algorithm i have seen many examples of what people have done with this algorithm and i am sitting here staring at the github repository for the original implementation which includes a nice explanation that i am going to attempt to follow in the next i don't know 400 hours and to be truth i'm recording this live right now there's people watching uh but i might get some help from the chat you know you tune into my live streams if you want to participate in that and uh i don't have a lot of time so i'm probably later on going to be wearing something entirely different because i'm going to have to come back and finish this another time i don't know why i'm trying to predict everything you yeah i could just redo this introduction later and when i know what happened and then i wouldn't have had to predict it let's let me try to describe to you oh okay this desk gotta lock these wheels better let me try to describe to you in a very sort of like loose terms my understanding of what wave function collapse is and i'm going to use my whiteboard for that uh i wanna there already is a processing four out it's i think alpha or beta but go check it out all right um how was that that was a fine intro right matia will do wonders with that i just want to make sure i'm actually still recording to disc yeah i think i can stop worrying about that the whiteboard camera i just i know i'm sorry but it's a little bit askew so i just want to fix that although is that did i do that on purpose oh i did that on purpose so that i can stand over on this side and the edge of it is here that's fine all right i think it's fine um all right my hands are cold oh you don't see the white board i mean in a way i should just when i'm doing the whiteboard i should probably go to this and in fact i could actually just have this up part of me wants to do it this way but i think it's good for you to be able to see uh the full picture and i've lost the chat yeah okay again i don't really know this algorithm so i'm probably gonna get some things wrong that's okay everything's going to be okay all right hold on okay okay the idea of the wave function collapse algorithm is to look at a particular image it's often something abstract like this analyze the patterns that appear in this particular image and use those patterns to generate a new image in the same vein or style of this one but the amazing thing about this algorithm this i mean what was i saying this might not seem like such a this might seem like a sort of everyday creative coding activity to you after all there's all these new kinds of machine learning and neural network and ai style transform and strength transfor style transfer and uh style gan and all these ways to generate images from one source as an inspiration but this is actually not using any of that it is an incredibly um i mean this is going to be really hard to implement like highly sophisticated in its terminology and its approach but ultimately its core it's actually kind of a simple idea and it has to do with this idea of tiles and not what i would like to call states although i don't know if this is entirely used as the proper term in the original algorithm itself and then the idea of collapsing these states um there's a term that comes up at in as entropy and this is from information theory it's sort of like one of these weird like nobody knows what entropy means so we'll just use entropy when we want to like sound like we're doing something smart but actually if you want to like learn more about entropy i would suggest to you three blue one browns videos about the wordle game which has some really interesting parallels to some things that are going on in wave function collapse i think but the idea here is that entropy we can think of as a term for the amount of information oh i know it i know it's a great example because i read about it in somebody's post online let's say we're playing sudoku and um how do you play sudoku i think you have nine by nine i mean well okay there's more i'm gonna fill in some okay all right all right let's say we're not playing sudoku we're designing a sudoku board and the idea of sudoku right is that we need to have all 10 digits 0 through 9 present and in columns and rows but i'm simplifying here let's just say it's like the simplest game of sudoku you could ever possibly play which is that i somehow need all 10 digits in this 3x3 grid so right now at present each grid has 10 each cell has 10 possible states the entropy of any given cell right now is a measure of how many how many remaining state possibilities could go in that spot so right now every single cell has the same measure of entropy same amount of entropy 10 possible states if i were to put the an 8 here suddenly well the entropy goes down to nothing because this has been collapsed that's the idea of collapsing these range of possibilities down into one it's decided and then the entropy is less for all of the others because there's only nine possibilities left now this is again a very crude and simplistic example because there's not a lot of variations of the sort of span of possibilities across a larger space that you might have in a full sudoku game but you're starting at the idea of what does it mean to build a pattern out of tiles on a grid where each tile has a certain number of possible configurations that could go into it and as we start to place those tiles they reduce the number of possibilities in the neighboring tiles this to me is the way that i think of understanding the wave function collapse algorithm just taking a short break here nine left nine left one through nine oh you can't oh oh that whole explanation was wrong oh i'm the worst what is facetime street i didn't really like it anyway so oh geez so let me ask you all a question i i think i should use the i think i should use a different example anyway that was a little bit weird and you can see how i'm not going to get through this today so let me ask you a question let me ask you a question was that a reasonable explanation of entropy the um entropy in a state function uh well okay entropy oh what i'm looking for is information theory uh just to make sure i'm kind of describing this correctly uh i've been on this website many a time uh more generally quantify the information event a random variable um entry provides a measure of the average amount of information needed to represent an event drawn so that's like um um yeah this is uh average amount of information needed so higher entropy means more possibilities right right i got that right it was a spoton explanation of entropy okay that's lucky i mean so i should i go for the sudoku thing again but obviously talk about the nine numbers not the ten i'm just so here's the thing i've been it's been like beaten into me over years and years and years of programming with a raise that i've got to talk about index values zero through nine which is a total of ten and i just like borked my brain there um all right um let's just try that again because that's not gonna go that's not gonna fly for uh it's a funny live stream moment but and we could oh also this looks a little blurry the whiteboard let me see if i can focus it a little bit better i think that's better let me have a look oh yeah that looks better why not use wordle oh yeah why not use wordle let's use wordle let's use wordle oh this is so exciting i can use wordplay all right the problem with wordle is i've been like ah is it like universally the thing is like i i'm going down a road of all right let's find let's use work i know the word all i think is two it's interesting it's too sophisticated like i'm gonna have to explain wordle so i got very excited about that but i think i should just stick with the sudoku um unnecessary closeup sorry about that 10 and no empty all right now now i'm still okay wordle is a great idea all right all right let's let's let's try it okay wordle has nothing to do you know what wordle is is is so related but i think sudoku is a little bit closer in the sense that um i think sudoku is maybe a bit more universally known um and i could actually i could make you know what i to make this more clear i think if i drew a slightly larger board it would actually make more sense so let's do that okay all right shoot see this is why i okay there's no way i'm getting finishing this today so i'm probably going to be redoing this anyway what time is it yes 10 45 okay 15 minutes here before i at least need a little break okay um let's take an example from let's take the classic game sudoku as an example that is basically the worst regular grid anybody has ever drawn in the history of youtube thank you the idea of sudoku is that we have a giant grid of numbers and any one of these cells in the grid could have a number one through nine in it and every single row every single column as well as every single three by three if i could draw this correctly oh put that in post every single three by three sub grid has all nine digits in it unique nine digits in it so how does this relate to wave function collapse and the concept of entropy entropy as i mention say this now i'm lost my rhythm of what i said before and not what's changing but alas entropy is a measure of the possibility space of every single one of these cells entropy in the information theory sense is a measure of the possibility space of every one of these cells so right now the entropy is uniform every cell could have nine possible digits in it if i were to start building a sudoku board i could just pick one randomly and pick a random number maybe i pick the number eight and i plop it in here now the entropy has changed for every single one of these cells remaining in this row and every single one of these cells remaining in this column as well as all of the cells in this top right three by three grid right they only have now eight possibilities left while the entropy for here is nine and if i were to put the number two here suddenly now the entropy is reduced for these cells so as the entropy goes down we have fewer fewer possible things that could fit in a given cell collapsing the cell is the act of picking its number its state it's done it's collapsed the goal of sudoku is to use information that you have gathered the entropy of every single state the entropy of every single cell start putting all the numbers around until you can solve it and if you find a cell suddenly that has no possibilities then you've done something wrong and you need to go backwards and try again this is exactly what i am going to attempt to do with the wave function collapse algorithm as applied to pixels what if instead of every tile in a so so if we take a graphics canvas that's say 400 by 400 pixels what if every single tile could have a particular color in it or a particular grouping of pixels a pattern so to speak what if i took that pattern from maybe this source image so what if i took this pattern just this little section of pixels and decided to put it here in the corner i've collapsed this one section of this particular image now if i could somehow based on collapsing this one reduce the entropy for its neighbors then i could select a particular tile maybe i only look at tiles that can go next if i if i've analyzed this image for what kind of patterns exist next to this one and only allowed me myself to pick those to either to put adjacent to this one then i could collapse those and it would ripple out i could keep collapsing others around it um okay um actually there is this amazing demo where is that it was sent to me shoot let's sit here hold on uh let me just find this in my direct messages um i i feel like i kind of botched that explanation but that's fine um just give me a second here hello discord where are you uh okay great all right i'm pulling this up this is an inter um ah right ah that's that's such a good dan writes in the chat um let me uh uh let me just read that entropy of certain cells will reduce which also causes the total entropy of the grid to reduce um so i'm just gonna sort of say that as the entropy of dif as the entropy of different cells is reduced the entropy of the total system also reduces until we find a solution and by the way this is exactly how you might approach an algorithm to solve sudoku or to solve the game wordle again check out three blue one brown's video on that this is just so related and it's got tentacles everywhere in the kind of stuff that i'm expecting if you're watching this video you're interested in this here is an incredible interactive demonstration of wave function collapse what it's showing is this source image these pixel tiles that you can find in the in sorry what it's showing is a source image divided into a set of tiles and each tile has neighbors next to it if i were to go here and pick like okay i want this particular okay sorry try this again don't forget thank you melissa no uh uh eight minutes i'm gonna do my i'm gonna take my short break okay when can i come back and finish this is the question i want to do this today i have to go though i mean i should check my messages a small chance i have something at noon there's a small chance uh um i don't see any of that um i'll check that again at 11 30 just to make sure my thing at noon is still happening okay okay this is an incredible interactive demo oscar stallberg this is an incredible interactive demonstration of the algorithm by oscar stahlberg yes i think i said that right we have a source image it has an entire set of tiles from that source image and we're going to build a larger image out of these same tiles shrunk down so i could start by picking any tile in the this image over to the right and copying over let's say i want to copy over this solid brownish tile and i want to do that in this one so i hover over that tile and i select it now because i selected why did it make the tiles below it brown i would have thought that wouldn't be possible because this would it allows it to repeat itself wait a second somebody explain this to me because i right i mean so for example if i were redoing the recreating the image i would pick this one and then now i have a reduced set of possibilities like i could pick this one and then i could pick this one why did this oh that makes sense why then that would be that but why underneath because wouldn't it show this one underneath what am i missing um what do these numbers mean oh let's see that's the number of the what do these numbers mean huh uh does anybody wait a second here let me zoom in here oh no this is different now so this is showing the possible the possible time i'm imagining these are the possible things that can be below it and how do i know which is the id for this like this is just saying the same one everywhere i'm so confused i'm looking at the chat there's no block that has brown on top and something else on bottom the numbers are color codes um what am i missing here oh it's the hex colors i don't think so right i thought okay let me reset this so let's say i pick this particular tile i'm so confused is it not actually is this a pre maybe this is a pre generated um um maybe it's not actually pulling the adjacencies or or is it using the or they're actually smaller because is it's actually do is this doing the overlapping method in which case like it's not visually exactly this it enforces matching colors across cell boundaries oh is that all it's doing so it's just looking for a cell that has the same color on the other side i see um check discord okay thanks simon uh uh the only possibility if there's a solid brown anywhere if there's a solid brown below oh okay so um um so yeah i think this is doing a slightly different method than in my head i was imagining which is that um it is actually matching uh this is pretty interesting this is like a different way of doing it which is really cool which is that it's actually just listing the color that's on this border and then the only things that can go above it are so like for this particular tile i got it the only thing for this tile the only things that can go below it are anything uh that's brown so this tile by the way has to have a brown tile above it to the left and to the right so it can have this it can have another oh i got it now oh wow i should implement it like this this is cool this is not the way i was thinking of doing it and simon is pointing out uh it's been about an hour okay i know thank you al everyone's reminding me simon is pointing out like i was going to so the post that i was looking at yesterday on my twitch stream which um um which is this one is a really excellent post and it proposes first there is a simpler version of this idea which um uh i was looking for a particular which is actually on sorry this page which is just looking at um this idea of a tile map generation okay so that's actually that's what so maybe i should do it this way which is what um all right okay so here's the deal there's the idea of the wave function collapse and i i'm clearly coming back and doing this another day but let's see how this keeps going but this is hopefully useful for all of you we're here in the moment let's just be here in the moment together and not worry about this video later that i want to make this is all part of the process and even if i just do a little bit today i might if i inspire you to like try it on your own or you want to send me some tips after and i'll come back and do it more all that's great so um but what i want to say is that i i there are two versions of this algorithm one which is just using straight tiles and one which is using overlapping tiles um and i think there's like very specific terms for these which i might not be getting exactly right and the idea of the straight tiles is more like sudoku in the sense that there are i have nine possible kind of like tiles and when i put one there it uh it reduces the possibilities i could go next to it because only certain possibilities can go next to it and typically like um in this particular demonstration uh which is not this one which is uh this one we might have some essentially preconfigured set of tiles with a list of possible neighbors um and that's this is um this is a nice way of do this is this is a a simpler way to do it but the issue with this is you've got to predesign what the tiles and rules are i mean maybe i could analyze the last with in this one i could analyze the last row of pixel last column or row of pixels to match but essentially i've got to build a json file or i think there's like examples of like xml files that list all the tiles and what their neighbors are whereas the overlapping model uh what it does is it takes an image and scans it and builds an array of tiles and then looks at neighbors and the reason why it's called overlapping is because we're not we're in addition to like taking this tile and looking at what's next to it we'll just move one pixel over and take this tile usually they're like three by three or whatever and then look at the one next to it as well so i i was all set yesterday to be like okay i've read this i should just do the simple tiled model and then part two our coding challenge uh a kodi challenge followup would be to then do the overlapping model which yields you more exciting i was like kind of like oh can i take a picture of this shirt and use it as like the tile generator um so uh the overlapping model is what you what sort of like feels more like magic because you just feed it an input and it analyzes it whereas the tiling model is more like i'm a game designer and i want to have like a a world that has you know each cell could be it's a 2d world and it could be brick if i'm building like a platformer game it could be brick or wall or like i don't know what the pieces would be so maybe what i need to do in order to do this video properly is actually design a set of tiles or use a preexisting set of tiles because now i fully understand and this demonstration is so awesome i was playing with this last night and i don't think i really understood it i just was enjoying playing with it and now i do and this is just incredible like if i do this like look at all the different possible configurations that come out just from this particular design um and um so um uh justin writes i'm looking at this from a game dev procedural dungeon generator um and simon is saying for tiled models you can make models where you scan an example image it's kind of like the game of life uh every tile is a single pixel so we could do you know that will work also um just so i could scan an image and have every especially if the image had limited colors like if this is a full color image with each tile could be a single pixel that's kind of an interesting way of doing it and then it only can have certain pixels next to it all right i'm gonna have to come so i'm hoping that this introduction is giving you something um i'm gonna talk about brilliant in a moment and take a short break uh and then come back and i'll have about a half an hour or so left and i sort of think about what i'm going to do but clearly this was a um as i expected is not going to in the next half an hour lead to the full implementation of this so um let me um i'm gonna do a break will be good for all of us it'll help me do some thinking about this and i'll read your comments in the chat but since you're all here with me let me tell you about today's sponsor brilliant i talked about brilliant to the beginning of the live stream i don't know if you were there or not so i'm going to repeat myself a little bit i make videos about different algorithms and concepts from math and science and art and all sorts of related topics and you watch them and maybe you try to make something after watching them that's a way to learn and the important part of that is you trying it and so brilliant is i think the perfect companion complement to the stuff that i do here on the coding train in the sense that it is a website full i'm going to just pull up a video of one of them this is the logic course it is a full of just many different courses around algorithms and computer science and math and physics and all of these topics and you get to actually try stuff like you could learn code without knowing the syntax by pseudo code and manipulating different kind of problems so learning logic learning algorithm fundamentals in it through interactive lessons is just a wonderful way to learn i always have to mention um the neural network course which just like you know if i could imagine the perfect like demonstration of the act the visual activity of a neural network of different videos that i've done using neural networks would be what's right here in this brilliant course and so if you want a nice companion if you're learning about machine learning you've been watching some videos you've been trying some python libraries maybe you've tried ml5.js you want to get deeper into some of these concepts the neural network course on brilliant would be great for you and sorry that it went to a black screen there um let me just go back to my computer and pull up brilliant i think that i'm logged in uh i am logged in um and um actually i was looking today at um so let me just quickly scan the courses so you can see you know there's so many uh you know whenever i'm looking for a new idea for a coding challenge i have this a list of ideas like a lot of them are now coming from brilliant especially this beautiful geometry course the logic course i referenced um it's great for parents teachers you know i've been actually looking at this with my kids which has been fun but i did actually notice oh it was i guess i don't know this nine plus i don't know why this popped up when i was looking at it the other day because this is an older one but um oh and i wonder if this also but there's a lot of stuff that deals with entropy and information theory like this one so this is a challenge right it's possible to arrange five square tiles in numbers one two three four five into a plus so the sum of the three tile column and the sum of the three tile row are both equal to nine let's think about this for a second if they have to equal to 9 the total of all the tiles would it be 18 no because there's a tile that is repeated so the the total of is 18 plus 18 which is 36 well the three has to go in the center right because if i put the two in the center there's no way i can make uh a nine like five and one is like to get to get nine i've got to do uh four and like four and three and then i can't get nine like the only way uh to get nine is to put three in the center four and two because six and six because i need six and six uh plus yeah i'm like having trouble explaining why this is my brain was working it out but do you see the connection to entropy right so like right now in theory without thinking about any of the rules of the system the entropy uh is uh you know measure would be five possibilities for every cell but if i look at the rules the entropy of the center cell is not the same as the others there's only one possibility it's three and now i've reduced the entropy down to two for each of the other the other cell so you know i could put um a two here and then that means a four has to have to collapse this to a four or if i put a four here this would have to collapse did i get this right let's just make sure i mean try it yourself by dragging the five number tiles into the plus i've made oh correct i guess i i did it and just marked it as correct um explanation let's look at this the sum of the row in the column is 18 and the sum of all the ti oh i i'm such an idiot i'm not i'm not an idiot i'm learning see it's don't don't say that don't be like me don't say that to yourself you are doing your best and trying and we're all figuring this stuff out did you see how i messed up sudoku earlier and i said there were 10 numbers um so uh yes of course adding up all of these gets 15 but i have to have 9 plus 9 is 18 18 minus 15 is 3 so 3 has to go in the center so it's so lovely to see then to try it yourself to figure it out puzzle it out even if you're just doing it sort of through intuition or some strange methodology and then see the explanation so uh if you're if you find this interesting if you're enjoying this please

chat what you think might be the most effective use of the next 30 to 35 minutes um and i will be back in um well i guess i'm gonna be back in four four minutes okay let's put on some intermission music i'm going to give you this mute my microphone ah sorry the music is muted because i'm in the wrong in this view all right let me just go to here so now it's this is the intermission you i'll pipe the audio from the music into that view later but also it's nice i put up a poll uh i see everybody's voting for a make up a tiling system i really should pick the red i shouldn't have made them i shouldn't have made i should have made the pull because i really feel like i should pick the sticker but we'll see do so all right um thank you again brilliant all right we're asking some questions here you're all hearing me and watching this right now okay so sorry i i'm looking over here because that's where i have my monitor for the chat what does make sticker winner mean so i can understand why you're probably not interested in the me picking the sticker winners because you know the number of you who might have entered to win the stickers through the survey is i think i'll just do that i'll i'll do that separately i'll just like twitch stream for like 15 minutes and do it i just i don't know why but i'm like hung up on the fact that i want people to believe that i'm legitimately picking them randomly i guess you know but so so i'll do that i'll do that just on the twitch stream um uh there is a little bit of an interest in the bot stuff so and i have exactly 30 minutes ish left um um i'm just checking if um oh uh um sorry i'm just checking to make sure there's a small chance that what i have to do although uh would be cancelled or changed so i'm just checking that but that doesn't seem to have happened okay so i'm to end this poll because i'm i'm getting uh the idea of it um and i'm just looking at the chat um um all right so let me come back over here to the computer oops so i i think it would make sense for me to just keep going down this road of generating a tile system and um i mean in a weird sort of way i almost want to just like copy this exactly but um but let me look here like i kind of want to just use one of these existing ones just to understand okay i'm trying to understand these because i i think it would help me to like do the algorithm if i were to pick an existing example the tiles have the same symmetry as their assigned letters or in other words what's fascinating about this by the way is i do a lot of teaching about markov chains with text and always comes up like well how could you do a markov chain in two dimensions with pixels this is essentially that and i i can't believe that i never really sort of made that connection before um what is this oh this is just showing it running but what i'm trying to understand is tiles have the same symmetry as their assigned letters with the systems enough to enumerate pairs of adjacent tiles only up to symmetry which makes lists of adjacencies for tile sets with many symmetrical tiles even the summer tile set okay like this is what i'm trying to understand here i see that these are the three possible tiles oh they're rotations also i'm like how could you get the the top and the bottom because of rotations and the adjacencies are ah however it's rotated um i just don't see what are the adjacencies why are we not seeing like the full enumeration of the adjacencies um chris ray asks to briefly explain the tile for the type topic for the new arrivals uh i'm not gonna be able to briefly explain it but it is uh this algorithm called wave function collapse and it is explained here and through other links i should have added them to the video description i apologize but you'll find a ton of resources here um but i'm just trying to understand um okay all right let me let me try to enumerate i like this one oddly enough so let me try to could generate a set of marching squares yeah i know i could generate an example image and do all the tiles that way i i just have very little time so i right now i'm just looking at kind of trying to just use this time to read and research a bit more like i'm gonna have to come back and implement this but i just want to try to understand exactly how this works so let's look at this one because i feel like this one is going to help us understand i'm actually going to go to this particular view so that we can kind of see all of this at the same time as i go over to the whiteboard okay so and and in case you're just tuning in this stream is going to wrap up in the next 15 to 20 minutes um i started kind of this coding challenge it's gonna take me longer but i feel like this is such an important and valuable topic for people interested in the sort of creative coding space that me dedicating multiple live streams to it and having a lot of material to use to edit together for a sort of condensed video about it it's worth the investment of time and i apologize to for the sort of limits that i have right now um so let's look at these two tiles i'm going to try to redraw them here so here one is essentially well one is blank or gray but we'll call it a blank and the other one it looks like this and i didn't dry sorry i didn't dry the whiteboard effectively enough and it's uh okay just try this again okay the two tiles i'm just going to put them over here i can't remember them but i can see them look like this and then another one is just blank so what i want to understand is if i have this particular tile this one what are the possible tiles that could go here here and all the adjacencies and there's only two possible tiles so clearly what the only possible tile that could go here is the blank one i drew a larger space thinking there might be multiple ones ah but here they have rotations so the tiles that could go here would be could be this but it could also be i'm drawing this in such a weird way so it could be this right so i think i want to try to draw i have a better idea of how to draw this so this only has one possibility this has two possibilities my drawing is kind of terrible right over here we have there's three possibilities right we could have this we could have this or we could have this right and then here is the exact same two possibilities is up there i mean if i didn't allow for rotations there has to be rotations so if i were building a grid of them and if it were just oh i didn't this markers died i need i'm sorry that i'm not looking at the chat right now this is one of the things i want to do is buy some extra monitors and things so i can sort of see the chat over here but um if i'm building this just making sure everyone can see me if i'm building a grid and i put this in the center we'll call this tile a if a goes in the center the entropy of like these i mean right now like is one two two three right so am i understanding the system correctly the first tile is a aaa b and the second is bbb interesting oh right so it would make more sense if i wanted to do this for me to think of it like uh to think of it like the oscar stalberg example where here are all the possible tiles okay i've got a better idea now sorry everybody okay so see i this is why i wanted to work this out oh racing everything is such a mess okay but i i appreciate all of you so much in tuning in and experiencing this with me because it's this is one of those things this is one of my favorite kind of algorithms that is so incredibly simple conceptually in you know in a manner of speaking but um is much harder to implement because of all the different parts and moving pieces but now i have an idea now i understand let's look at all actually all the possible tiles okay oh i really want to program this now it'll have to come later another time next time i'm i think i'm really kind of ready for this and i'm all right so look let's look at all the possible tiles this is so much simpler than i than i had and uh and then so there are five possible tiles essentially like we could think of them as rotations but let's not even do that right now let's just think of them as five so um and then let's think about the what what can match here so the the the side of a tile is either blank or it is a i know what to call this like a pipe a connection so we could call the blank a and the connection b and if i'm going to if i'm going to take a given tile like this one let's say i put this tile first and it's an a connection on all sides i the only things that can go here would be this or that because i need a tile with an a on the right and the only things that could go here are this tile or this one because i need an a connection on the top so i could have each one of these as a little image that i load and then i could have like a json file that basically for every image has an array of possible things that could go i could totally program this now if i had a little bit more time but this makes sense to me now and this is exactly what we're seeing in this particular demonstration it's just more uh sophisticated the top of the tee can butt up against each other too i'm trying to understand that the top of the t can butt up against each other too um oh yes yes yes i didn't see that great so this one can also like if i were had this this side could connect to here or this tile oh i want to do this so bad what time is it okay it is 11 30. oh that's way too much time uh right the tricky part is not the algorithm but all the data structures involved yeah i i actually to me this is very feels very doable because um it it's you're right there's not like some really it's not like okay let's look at back propagation okay well we need to let's talk about partial derivatives like looking at a neural network and how it's trained and the weights are adjusted like there's a lot of math uh and concepts that might be completely unfamiliar to you or like in my case things that i studied and maybe felt little bit of conf not kind of an understanding of but it's been uh 30 years i'm old um but this is like a really fun kid's puzzle and in fact it would be really cool to do like to print this out and to actually do make a physical version of this as part of a video um so i don't know what to do with these 15 minutes but i think um one thing i could do i'm just curious is i know i really want to make a version that analyzes an image for the tiles but now i'm back to thinking that it would be really nice to just start with some prefab tiles and a list of what goes with what let me take a let me take a minute to go down this road before i really have to go so are these is this like one image okay oh yeah um i don't know why this one is really cool too this one really appeals to me i can't exactly explain it oh this wait a second this is just one tile i love that we could do the one tile version that is wild uh that is wild sorry everybody for the spam in the chat um and i appreciate thank you alca who i see with um um i'm always we're always looking for additional people who can help um moderate um you'd want to join the discord and get in touch there um and there's sort of a process for that but um so i don't mean to just say like oh just tell me your name and i'll make you a moderator but um how about generating some square images so yeah let's go to p5 web editor and let's just look at very briefly how i might generate these images so i'm going to make a really small canvas that's 50 by 50. and let's move this over a bit whoops sorry i gotta i gotta just get rid of my discord because it has all these direct messages and things um okay so i'm sorry that i'm about to run out of time this is the one thing about street never mind okay uh i just like i i marvel sometimes about how if i were teaching a class at nyu which i'm on sabbatical right now i like obsessively prepare for like days like over prepare way over over prepared yeah here i am streaming on youtube too what is essentially a uh audience have a much larger magnitude than the 12 to 16 students i guess the tuition at nyu is kernel it's kind of uh expensive um all right sorry i got off track there so um let's try let's try making some of these tiles uh let's let's make the data i just want to make the data structure so what's a good uh just trying to think of how to i know simon you would tell me to automate this but i kind of want to do this manually just for right now all right let me try to recreate uh i think i want two two tiles uh where is that the thing is i could just make these images in photoshop i should be able to code them right look at this um what am i doing which one did i say i like i don't know why i'm obsessed with this one so let's try this one although um okay okay i could do this sorry i i the thing is i'm looking at the clock and thinking and you don't even see my computer i'm sorry the one tile version looks like a recent number file video yeah it's kind of amazing how this is like ten print actually also um um okay so sorry that i was um let's okay so let's let's just look at how i would generate a tile um and let's do um oh hold on let me turn now we're going to do a background actually you know i should do this let's i should do this with create graphics um and let me make this much bigger so you can see it a little bit better and um put on auto refresh uh so this this is going to wrap up in just a second but i just want to give you an idea of how i might go about doing this all right now i'm sorry simon is so right i always listen to simon everybody i should just draw an image and then like pull out the tiles but i'm going to do it this way just for a second here um i'll make the second tile uh and um okay eventually what is there some weird pixel density issue no oh no i know why i'm and these aren't with and height they start oh god i'm trying to do the most simple thing ever and i couldn't get it okay i made two tiles everybody hurry please thank you half and half um oh there's a new number file video about stitch patterns that's cool um sorry okay tile one tile two now um let's say in tile two now i wanna draw i'm gonna say rect mode tile to rex mode center tile to fill i'm just going to kind of use a green color tile 2 stroke 0 tile 2 stroke stroke weight 4 and then rectangle um tile to width times 0.5 tile to height um what did i miss here uh zero uh uh oh yeah no yeah tile two height times zero point five this is very silly what i'm doing but because let me just hard code this because these numbers are getting kind of crazy it's just 100 by 100 to people 50 50 25 50. okay um oh tile2.rex oh and it's a hundred what am i what's wrong with me the height is 100 and if i make it a little bit bigger yes i made two tiles everybody two tiles i have my soundboard back i gotta use it for something thank you everybody thank you welcome to the coding train where i stream for two hours to make a green stripe in a p5 jazz sketch now just just showing you how i can have auto refresh on it's saving a lot of files uh let's go to uh this but i don't need to save it because oh i really wish i had more time so i made this even simpler because this is only going to produce vertical stripes because you'll see in a second but the rules now are let's try to imagine this data structure and i think there's specific terminology that if i reread the wave function collapse algorithm page i'll have a better sense of but let's just call this i'm going to call this like the wfc and we have basically tile one so i can make this an array of arrays but i think i want a lookup table so i'm gonna have let's see i'm just gonna think about this tile one has four edges and um all right hold on how would i want to do this so like what if i had an array and each array had an object in it that had the tile the adjacencies like what would i call this the adjacencies j jacket which would be tile 1 is the first one and that's the image so i should say image i should call these image one image and the adjacencies i could say are four arrays of what could go of what is possible uh i think there's a sort of convention like this reminds me what was that video i did about sort of like northwest so north east south west i mean we could do something with diagonals sorry my nose is running um so the let me just call this oh yeah and this should actually not be an array it should be like like i should have like a lookup table like so i can say like here's here's what the image is and here's what the rules are for each one of these tiles like imagine if it was like this and the adjacencies are if i am this is tile a right the only the things that can go on the left so let's start what would be let's start with north and i'm going to go clockwise north east south west so what can go north here is just tile a what can go to the east is tile a or b what can go to the south is just tile a and what could go to the east to the west is also tile a a or b and then i can do the same exact adjacencies for b which is what can go to the north or south is only b itself and what can go to the east or west is a or b so it's actually exactly the same but um b here and b here so is this and this should be tile two is this a reasonable way to organize the data for something like this this is how i would do it just thinking about it now unfortunately i can't take the next step with this because i have to go but to me this makes sense and the next step would be to i mean come on how hard could this be um like what if let's just just we'll do like a little random walk thing for a second in a way let's just wear my 400 and this would be 25 25 12 50. we don't want to draw these tiles anymore so what if i had now um uh it's four by four or 8 by 8 so that's 64 tiles and what if i were to uh set them all up as undefined and then just doing this in a very hardcoded way real quick um oh i was thinking about something else for a second oh uh and i would draw i would do this oh then draw um that image x times 5 because 50 yeah each one of those is no it's 50 by 50 what am i saying so we're seeing nothing because but if i put in a particular well that's not going to do anything if i put this in aha okay so i got to deal with the fact that there's those extra lines there but that's fine but why is that uh oh because it's okay so now what i could start doing is i could have an algorithm that while they're still um it's funny that i'm actually doing the wave function collapse algorithm but in this very sort of crude quick and dirty way but i am recording this disc but i kind of like gave up on like the fullblown coding challenge energy i'm just like i'm half blown coding challenge energy right now that sounded weird um and i also really have to go uh so um but essentially like i could have some algorithm now i could put this in draw oh but these are not did i make them global variables that's fine so all right i have to stop this is very unfortunate but i really have to go and um yes le'veon and the idea here is that those those adjacencies did i spell adjacency correctly that does that looks so wrong right now search inst adjacencies there's a c a j a chances adjacencies there's no n there okay all right well i know what i'm doing later today i'm sorry that i won't be able to like live stream more of this i mean actually i think i'm gonna hold off because i really don't want to do this too much in advance but i think i have a much better idea now of how to come back and work this out so thank you for being here neil writes i'm just reading this if you write out the neighbor mappings directly then each time you add a square you have to add all of the previous square neighbors i'm not sure i fully understand that my idea for what the next step would be is i would pick one of these randomly then i have like a 50 50 shot like pick a random cell and put one in it and then i pick randomly up down left right look at what's possible there and pick another random one look what's left over up down if i pick to the right i'd only could pick up up down or to the right and i'd keep picking them until i fill the whole thing i think but i'm gonna stop this now because i gotta go so uh thank you for everyone for being here um this is wrapping up the live stream uh i hope that you enjoyed it and that this is getting you down the pathway towards implementing wave function collapse i am fully committed to this project i believe that i could come back and do the full thing in a live stream recording session maybe i'll do it as just like a extra members only session or do it on twitch now that i've already had kind of a live stream about it i don't know send me your thoughts and feedback to daniel at thecodingtrain.com or at um and uh do the cells with the fewer possibilities first yes yes yes so there's an order that i want to go in based on the amount of entropy right that makes absolute sense um not just a random walk um so uh check out uh the uur bot on twitter the macro data refinement program at github's lumen industries if you have no idea what i'm talking about that's fine but if you do you know come and join join me in my weird extra side procrastination projects um i will the survey is closed i will be contacting any of you who filled it out you'll get an email whether if you were picked randomly uh to receive stickers hopefully we'll send you an email if you weren't just so everybody knows and um yeah stay tuned there'll be more more coding train coming to you i i really appreciate all of you watching and kind of going with the flow as i try to figure out what it is that i'm doing on this youtube channel and oh there's a minute left in the song um so um we'll see i thank you to all of you who are saying thank you in the chat uh what's coming up next i i want i need to reboot i'm going to be making sequence tutorials about how to make a twitter bot with machine learning models and how to moderate the tweets before they get posted so that's coming up where is my notes other things to talk about ah if you are an apple two plus aficionado and know apple basic and want to get in touch with me to give me tips and suggestions um check out the processing fellowships and the google summer of code also um let me not forget to thank today's sponsor brilliant and that's all i have for you i will see you next time on the coding train goodbye this is for all of you we got this dot song and and oh are we gonna have a musical dance experience everybody it's time it's time for the musicals dance experience as always i always forget that this stock this stock let's stop this stock i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this i'm doing this like silently but my mic is very music won't go through it i'll see you all have a good day dot this dot this dot song never forget the vista somebody composed that song for me all right goodbye everybody stream going off i hope if you have suggestions or thoughts about this new studio setup i would love to hear them goodbye i'm finding the button to press where's that button to end the stream there it is i'm hitting it now goodbye i love you all the stream will stop immediately and you will no longer be live that's what i'm going for
