good morning this is my sound check what i would like to know is how is the balance between the background music and my voice because i will be singing today it's all my dreams come true how does this sound to you okay muting my mic we'll be getting started in approximately two minutes turn down the music my voice should be louder now perhaps this is better let me know when you can yeah we've come a long way in the year of 2020 though a lot of things sure we had a lot of whoops but we did a lot of coding and the processing foundation lets us keep the engine going on the coding train it comes along and then it takes you away that keep the train running at its best hello happy holidays welcome to the coding train somehow what seems to be annual holiday telethon end of year live stream for the processing foundation my name is daniel let's see i think it's just shiffman frankly i think that's how it's pronounced but you know i go i all the ways you might pronounce my last name i particularly like to say chief man and i realized that my camera position is a little off and my head is getting cut off um thank you for the compliments on my sweater uh oh there's so many things i need to talk about and i i should just start right at the beginning here but being very clear about what you're watching i have no plan no script no like well i prepared some stuff unfortunately i spent all my time preparing some music nonsense and um very little time preparing any code stuff but that's the sort of point of the coding train it is the act of coding on the train where you don't know where the destination is you might try to stay on the track somewhat because you don't want to you know veer off the tracks and uh this metaphor is not really working out for me right now hi hi hi everybody welcome so first first order of thank you um i want to thank will from america a new um internet friend of mine it's kind of a long story that i won't bother try to explain right now but will from america is um you can find his uh twitter and his website in this video's description is the composer uh music and lyrics of the coding train 2020 holiday processing foundation theme song that you just heard should i play it for you again um this song by will from america uh will from america and i were uh recently collaborating on a ai generated robot song if that makes any sense and uh he was generous enough to help me uh put together some music for today's holiday telethon i see perhaps i was hoping that there'd be a donation by now come on people my no script plan in my head involves a donation right now let's talk about why you should donate so first of all um if you've never watched the coding train before then i don't know what to tell you um this is me uh home this is by the way this is a momentous occasion because this is the first time i've ever done this annual holiday telethon from my home i am live from the attic of my home in brooklyn um um i'm getting an interesting message here from k weekman that i must bring up onto the screen here i have all sorts of new features here speaking of ai and music did you see the newest adam neely video no i have not seen the newest adam nealy video that is something i will definitely want to take a look at later thank you for that message um so um i have some holiday song treats prepared for you today all right the attic so this this we'll see how this goes i have a you know my microphone high quality microphone i have my high quality laptop computer i have my high quality camera i have my high quality lights and i have my rather low quality faltering very tired from this year 2020 brain to try to keep this train moving for the next couple hours um so maybe we should just begin with a song right this this this live stream is dedicated to the processing foundation all of the work of all of the contributors and volunteers and staff and directors and community everyone involved with anyone uh with processing uh processing p5.js processing.pi processing for android processing for the pi all the things uh this live stream is for you and we will begin with our holiday random number song hold on it's gonna take me a minute oh gosh i'm not i'm not prepared where's my producers okay hold on everything's going to be fine everything's going to be fine no 20 what's the year 2020 oh travel to the past to the future i don't know what'll be better here we go and here we go you better keep count you at least better try listen and hear my sweet lullaby random numbers counting them down i'll read you a list i'm rolling the dice not just pseudorandom that won't suffice random numbers counting them down four two six eight zero eight four nine seven seven eight eight nine three six five four six five nine nine two six zero six one five oh you better keep count you least better try listen and hear my sweet lullaby random numbers counting them down it's so silent up here it's my family could they at least like applaud the pawn from downstairs everybody slept so late this morning i don't know what they're doing having breakfast playing roblox uh walking the dog who knows and wait a second roberto joseph thank you roberto joseph who donated a wonderfully generous donation to the prostate foundation and anonymous donated 20. to the frosting foundation thank you so much so for every donation there were two donations there i will read to you some random numbers from my random number book and i got to talk about all the donations and what you get for your donations and all that stuff let's see if this works it's the first time i've tried this track there we go we're on we're gonna start with just from random page we're on page 147 everybody page 147 column 7 315 row row 8 2 6 5 2 1 7 3 0 9 2 9 1 eight one zero seven five four two eight five five seven three four okay that was thank you that was random numbers for roberto joseph's donation and now i would like to thank anonymous for their donation nine zero one six zero five eight zero nine eight eight two zero eight two two nine six four seven one six okay thank you for those wonderful donations let's get to the the tofu and potatoes as i like to say um let's get to the tofu and the potatoes and let me bring over my uh screen here oh what's going on here oh red button oh look no you see my secret lyric sheet oh no it's there um i am going to go over to the processing foundation website so why are we all here today we are here today to celebrate and raise money for the processing foundation i am incredibly good at by accident or perhaps on purpose talking about the prostate foundation for hours and hours and hours i do want to code some fun little projects today invite you in the community to join me coding these projects i also will be having dorothy santos the executive director of the processing foundation on the line um they'll be calling in from uh through some kind of amazing internet phone video technology the future is here um probably around uh uh 11 a.m eastern so i'm gonna keep my phone here we'll hope i'll get a text message when that arrives but what i want to talk about is if you have ever watched one of my videos you might have noticed that i'm using a particular tool to realize an idea to co to solve a problem to create with code and while i use many different tools probably the tool the set of tools that i use the most come from uh uh the pro come from the processing foundation so um we can go here and look at whoops the uh processing website this is the uh java uh um flexible software sketchbook and language for learning how to code which by the way i don't know if you can do this math but look at this year two zero zero one and we've got another donation everybody thank you anonymous who donated 35 hong kong dollars that's kind of cool all right four nine two four six one one four six five two five one zero two seven one four eight nine eight nine eight eight nine thank you for that wonderful donation this is going to be a real difficult exercise in me trying to keep myself on track because i'm going to take a break for every donation and try to remember where i left off um 2001 that means in the year 2021 i've got too many sound effects now the year 2021 do this math is the 20th anniversary of processing that's nuts it's actually kind of crazy 2001 also happens to be the year it's not the first year that i ever did coding in my life because i had done coding as a wee child as a emo teenager i wasn't very emo is that even the right word i'm so old um and a little bit here and there in the uh collegiate times of my life but i hadn't really in a sustained dedicated way learned to code until 2001 and i have somebody to thank for that who i just want to mention there's lots of people to thank but i'm going to mention john henry thompson one of my favorite people um john henry thompson inventor of the lingo programming language used in adobe director because that was the course i took in 2001 it's called introduction to computational media why am i even talking about this i'm way off track um but you should learn about john john henry thompson that wonderful fascinating um history um and i have a whole interview and guest video with um with john on the coding train as well but back the reason why i mentioned that is for me lingo and macromedia director was the predecessor too i just want to get this back up here predecessor to processing because while processing was started in 2001 um i didn't find it or discover it or learn write any code with it till well not too much later 2003 so i've had many a year um but um um at this program called itp that i've talked about you can check out the idp window show all this stuff but that's not what i'm here to talk about here to talk about processing the processing foundation whoa what am i what about what's happened uh let me close this out here so i'm telling a story it's a nice bedtime story know that okay and then and then from there i learned this thing called p5.js and now i do stuff in javascript okay that i don't have a plan there all right so actually around 2012 if i'm correct um i was one of the people who helped to form the processing foundation which is a nonprofit u.s based charity 501c3 taxexempt organization um and um it was you know forming the foundation if you know i'm speaking in my own words here was one of the reasons amongst many was to have a to to really have some sort of dedicated structure and framework for sustaining the open source projects and the community in the long term that is a very difficult thing to do is a difficult thing to do financially emotionally uh energy wise i know that many of you who are viewers have participated in open source projects maybe you've created your own open source projects so one of the ways the processing foundation sustains itself is through donations from viewers like you but i do really want to start here and emphasize how valuable all contributions are many of you watching are not able to donate maybe you can't even like use the youtube transaction feature in your wherever you are in the world today it's not unlocked for your country i do have another way that you can donate if that's the case maybe you don't have the means to donate financial support it's not something everybody is struggling right now uh or many people are everybody's dealing with different challenges so i want to acknowledge that and say that just the act of watching this being here giving some positive energy to the community making writing some code helping a friend of yours learn something about code all of those things are really important meaningful contributions that you can make and i don't want to over emphasize the financial aspect but it is a crucial key aspect um people who work on these projects need to be able to have the time to do it need to be able to be compensated for that time and we also have a lot of advocacy and education initiatives the fellowship program is one that i would love to highlight i should just notice note that the uh fellowship call for 2021 has actually been pushed back a little bit so the fellowships are going to occur in summer 2021 so i really encourage you right here right now if you've never heard of the processing foundation before if you've watched maybe a coding train video or two and wanted to know how can you get involved how can you find someone to support this dream project of yours um that's what the processing foundation is for and i'm just i love that the first one is coming up here is aaron davey because it's one of the fellowship projects that i know uh probably the most about because i worked with aaron on her twitch channel called cozy coding um i don't know when aaron is doing her next live stream if it would be so amazing we're just like this afternoon i could send everybody there um but um this is uh the processing fellowship program supports new artists new programmers new activists uh and uh and i don't know why i'm using the word new uh um people young and old who are working on projects uh to expand the uh community of of creative coding of processing and p5.js and i encourage you to continue uh to take a look at all these wonderful people who have worked on various projects and thank you anonymous for your donation to the processing foundation and here are your holiday random numbers am i gonna really be doing this all day i think i am three three nine four one four seven eight three eight one five eight three five five four six one five one one three one zero nine better keep count oh i'm out of breath already oh anonymous donated five dollars oh you could have left it keep going it loops it loops people it loops oh andrew ten dollars one zero one six two this is anonymous three nine one one five four five seven seven one two five one zero zero one six three five oh you better keep count all right that was anonymous next up is andrew hurley thank you andrew hurley for your processing foundation donation and here we are three 79322766523 nine nine three two six eight seven nine three eight six two six four eight two zero all right so let's get to the where i'm i'm i'm getting somewhere with this um i'm getting somewhere with this uh i want to go back to the home page and click here onto hashtag supportp5 so this is the uh donation uh page for this year i will note i don't even know how to express my utter amazement joy and just sheer shock perhaps even that you know i was kind of like oh kevin do my telethon towards the tail end of the monthlong giving program and i'm gonna push us over the edge we're gonna be right down there below 30 thousand of our goal and i the coding trade will push us over the top guess what already over are you over the top but guess but you know what that doesn't mean uh uh we don't need more donations from you so let's see if we can raise this up my goal for today is to uh raise 1 000 for the processing foundation and i will be matching that donation so we can make it all the way up to one thousand done the coding train will match uh that donation uh to the processing foundation now what's really quite exciting here is that with your donation and this includes the donations that you're making on youtube today um by the way is there an advent of code challenge today that's something i could work on um uh donors who give at the variable level with a uh 25 donation we'll receive a pack of 10 p5.js and processing stickers i mean come on look at those stickers oh i have some of them here but none of those beautiful ones i'm so excited for the stickers so um please um if you donate so quickly just to be clear about this if you donate through the donor box system or whether you're doing it through donor box or through the youtube button that's there on this stream page the money will go to the prostate foundation that's the important part if you donate through the donor box system you will definitely get your rewards because there's a whole system set up for that if you donate through youtube you will get a receipt by email and you should email that receipt to foundation processing.org so i think i can bring that up on the screen uh um let me just test my little system out to make sure it's working um i'm gonna just type this message in here and bring this up here oops no come on people um and back i go here there so that's the very long longwinded way of me putting uh foundation at processing.org um on the page so please if you donate through youtube uh processing foundation will get the funds but not a notification of your personal donation it comes as just one lump sum at the end of the youtube uh fundraising thingamabob so um you'll need to send forward your receipt to foundation processing.org okay now um tasercake wants to know do we get a random number readout if we donate on donorbox i mean yes i don't know how i don't promise i don't know if i can just sort of see the donor box list of people right now or how that works but if there's a way to do that i mean i could certainly refresh the page right we see that it's at 31 301 did somebody donate not yet but i i i kind of you know here i am on the youtube with lots of mixed feelings about being on the youtube so let's use if you can let's use that donation brian huang donated twenty dollars to the prostate foundation oh boy i should probably go to where i left off in the book and like go in order but here we go two eight seven eight four eight eight two nine zero five five three four three eight seven two three eight five five three seven one eight seven thank you brian for your donation uh to the processing foundation it is much appreciated and i think we have another one i think we have another one next keen some numbers for you nine seven two five nine six five five eight seven eight four three seven nine two one one okay um i'm seeing some messages about um uh donations if you're located in india i don't actually know where you know i'm relying on google's um charity system um and where it is uh um you know a feature on the website for different um countries and locations i don't actually know not keen you missed your random number have no fear we'll get you another one i mean what else am i doing today to be frank seven eight seven five zero one four two nine nine zero two two six seven four eight one six nine eight six nine okay there you go 18 thank you monsieur who says i love you dan hi dan can your vid can you shout out for me bass legend shout out i shout out i call upon the universe shout with me i don't think i should probably get in the business of doing shout outs whatever those may be oh sam h seemed like a good idea at the time earlier this morning when i was getting myself ready to do this we'll get some coding eventually zero five seven three four seven seven six zero two nine eight three zero nine nine nine six two nine nine nine five five seven okay so i i just confirmed that donations on the youtube platform are not available oh my god okay we've got quantum waffles maybe if somebody's uh anonymous maybe i don't need to sing them numbers eight one four six five three one one eight four two three eight eight three zero three six three seven seven two four three nine nine right oh anonymous donated 2 000 of some currency that i don't recognize give me a little help there with what that currency is this is for you anonymous i love you anonymous five eight two five four three seven zero zero four seven seven two nine seven three seven eight four three six nine one nine this brings me so much happiness and i don't i don't i don't have my thing up which tells me how many people are watching i'm a little afraid to look oh good it's not too many you know simon says eventually you're just going to get overwhelmed and guess what i think that's the point i think that's the point i want to get overwhelmed i want to get overwhelmed that means people are donating although i don't want to create a situation where i'm motivating people not to donate because they just so desperately want me to stop singing the random numbers but i have a feeling knowing the way the internet works the way that i've experienced the internet in all of my years on the internet is that people will want to torture me and even torture themselves oh boy i'm being uh all right so um so okay so where was i we were at the stickers i was at the uh 25 level at the 50 level you will receive a tshirt with a two color silk screen image created with code by anna carreras um if you're not familiar with anna carreras um somebody can drop a link to um ana's twitter by the way i'm wearing shorts in case you were wondering you know i'm in the attic it's very warm up here i've got my holiday hat holiday sweater i figured you know i could just wear a transparent shorts you know why not wear shorts i got no shoes on this is how i roll people this is how it's going um let's let's find anna carrera's uh work to feature them um here we go um about uh what uh barcelona creative coder um beautiful wonderful work with creative coding what i'm looking for is um oh yeah this generative typography stuff is quite beautiful so many wonderful projects so this particular piece um that is part of support p5 uh is an artwork um that you can get uh printed a two color silk screen image on a tshirt at the 50 donation so remember if you donate 50 if you donate through donor box that they'll the donation will get picked up but if you donate through youtube forward your receipt to foundation dot org at the loops level oh this is what i would love to have oh i'm excited about this one 125 donation you will receive a hoodie with that particular um with uh anna carrera's very wonderful and then oh boy i got a drum roll here now i gotta give a little drumroll here now we are getting down to the nittygritty to the functions level a 500 donation will receive an infinite objects video print do you know what the infinite objects video prints are i was not familiar with them i'm obsessed with them right now on their website late last night like looking at all the different infinite objects things i could buy things i could buy um it is what's known as a video print there they are these beautiful objects um that you can place on your mantle mount to a wall um and this uh particular uh infinite object's print is of the gif the looping animation by dave white otherwise known as bees and bombs so bees and bombs i'm frequently referring to on the coding train uh make do having very poor attempts to recreate various uh famous bees and bombs gifts and you can have your very own print uh video print video installation sculpture i might call it by making a donation uh to the processing foundation at the functions level by the way do you like the names of these levels i just have to bat myself on the back somebody will correct me if i'm sticking this idea from somebody else i hope the universe will strike me down i'm pretty sure it was my idea to call them loops functions erase and now raise you get what you already always just get anyway at the erase level you will be able to adopt you know kind of like how you have that sign on the highway that says adopt a highway only you can adopt a p5.js function or a processing function um and uh psy and i will work with you to select a code element from processing or p5 to create a video tutorial that will appear live on not live but will be uh published to the coding train hopefully in january i'm looking to do this january 2021 putting that out there into the universe these this reward this reward of a adoptafunction video tutorial i will be doing these in january 2021 i will thank you i will collaborate with you if it makes sense to do so and uh you know be kind to me try not to like um uh pick quaternions for example that'll be really that'll be really rough um but um um so if you if you make a donation at that level that um there you go yeah you know maybe maybe if you make that large nation maybe you maybe you'd much rather have this yeah you could get that you get maybe you could get two of them i don't know just saying just saying um i will be making videos anyway but i'd be thrilled for you to be able to offer this uh what might possibly be a motivation for people to donate to the products around asia okay um an anonymous recently was 2 000 korean wands thank you to arnoff who answered that question for me where are we what's our total so far i don't have i have all these dashboards up everywhere over here i've got the youtube chat i've got discord i've got this stream bot chat i've got my live stream health youtube dashboard thingymobra that tells me that uh there's 345 people watching this right now which is a little bit odd but be perfectly honest um and then i have my open broadcast studio i don't see where our donation total is i don't know i gotta get that up there somewhere okay all right now i think it's already 11 o'clock uh dorothy will be joining us um but i should not look at my email this is like i have so many problems my life is full of problems it's full of joy and happiness and a lot of that is thanks to all of you who are watching this right now one of the problems is i look at my phone while i'm live streaming that's like the worst thing that's the only thing worse than looking at my phone while i'm live streaming is looking at my phone ah now my phone's talking to me go away i would be looking at my phone while i'm teaching a class so i pulled a muscle in my neck i gotta do some stretching all right it is time for another song i have some i've surprised songs for you today um and this song will lead us into the very first piece of code that i want to write with all of you today on the coding train processing foundation holiday telethon let's just let's just listen to the theme song for a second while i get myself set up yeah we've come a long way in the year of 2020 and the processing foundation lets us keep think there's a donation martin rivera martine rivera thank you for your donation and for your donation here are your very own random numbers one five three six zero nine three three five nine eight six one seven three five three seven four seven zero three one four one seven three one four one appearing in the book of random numbers why is it transparent by the way that's kind of odd there's no green in this all right i was in the middle of uh i was in the middle of um getting myself set up for my next song so as i like to do on the coding train holiday telethon i like to embarrass myself as much as possible lest you think that i am singing for you because i think you think that i think that i can sing don't be mistaken i know that it's terrible it does bring me a lot of joy to sing even if it is you know out of tune or nasally or kind of like weird sounding my children are not so thrilled with my singing especially if it ever happens in public my dancing however they really do they don't like that either they did when they were little when they were so small they would laugh and they would smile and now just kind of like they try to like hug me as if hugging me will get me to stop which is nice it's a good way to get a hug what was i talking about anyway so i'm here to sing you this song very excited about this one this one is kind of holiday adjacent but i feel like it works and it's going to lead me into the first bit of code that i will write in today's holiday telethon i'm trying to decide if i can manage this without by the way i have two so thank you again to will from america uh who has helped me prepare all of these sort of backing tracks and the processing uh fundraiser theme song and and will so generously gave me two two versions of each track one with the melody being played out and one without it i think i might need the melody for this one so i'm gonna try cause i'm just afraid i'm just afraid okay here we go usually i play the this is the first year by the way of no musical instrument which by the way is a huge relief there i spend weeks practicing the ukulele here we go do you wanna code a snowman you we can color with rgb we can code a stack of circles and a triangle for a nose that's pretty sweet you've just got to use the lips stroke weight background and then add a fill that's white do you wanna coat a snowman it doesn't have to be a snowman okay bye thank you thank you very much to do this by yourself in an attic of your home i hear the like pitterpatter of feet there's like a dog and two cats and children playing downstairs and i'm just up here by myself singing weird oh thank god thank god i had somebody give a donation so i can move on from that thank you to anonymous anonymous for your donation to the prostate foundation you have won your very own random numbers two nine five four five three five zero five four four four two eight three one five three three two one four five three eight nine ah nothing like a little shrek shima to wake you up in the morning thank you another donation from anonymous four zero two zero nine eight three zero six three one one two four six three eight nine three three four nine i'm getting a little bit tired you know ordinarily i might start to think if only i had a studio audience of course we are there is this global pandemic thing going on so i am very lucky and very fortunate to happen to have this ridiculous i don't know if you can call this a job i do have an actual job where i get paid to teach classes i mean if you're watching this you kind of wonder like i don't know about that i don't know this person then on the internet that's a weirdo but um i'm very fortunate to get to be at home um and i know lots of people who can't who have to be at work who have to be who are teaching i have the teachers of my children have to be at work for when they have in person school and so um you know to the extent here that i'm here to support the processing foundation and this fundraiser is about the processing foundation i would really like to say a thank you to everyone who's you know been a part of 2020 you know 2020 one star review but um you know 2021 is right around the corner oh jon person john person thank you for your donation here we go again two five zero nine five four five two four nine five one six two seven six five nine zero zero one four zero six i'm also kind of noticing and thinking a lot of people have cohosts or they do a podcast and there's more than one person speaking or they they host a live stream and there's different people for different segments i might need to start thinking about that this is really i gotta keep keep things going here and get my mind on track what am i doing next i know what i am doing next what i am doing next is oh i didn't even play the one with the lower key that was done for me do you want to code a snowman we can color with rgb we can coat a stack of circles and a triangle for a nose looks pretty sweet you've just got to use ellipse stroke weight background and then add a fill that's white do you wanna coat a snowman it doesn't have to be a snowman okay bye um all right so we're gonna program a snowman in p5 we've got a nice question here that k weekman has passed to me um good question from the chat zachary macarthur asks do a lot of your students come into your class knowing you from your videos or does it usually go the other way oh by the way taran in the chat has something to release an album do i have an album cover for you oh boy hold on let me answer this question somebody remind me that i gotta share with you i was waiting for it to be christmas which i don't by the way i don't even celebrate that darn christmas holiday i mean i do because it's a long story i've got a very multiholiday celebratory family thing going on these days which is wonderful we can have all the presents for all the days of all the different holidays it's not overwhelming at all i really like christmas trees is it okay to admit that i like christmas trees hey i always say can we just get like a little teeny one tiny little small christmas tree just put it on the shelf put on the shelf next to the elf is that where the elf goes on the shelf i don't know um so this is a good question i would say that it really depends it's probably about 50 50. more so i definitely have students who have come into the class and will come into class and say oh um you know i like your videos or i've watched your videos i'm excited to be in your class blah blah that kind of thing i would say a lot of that however is not because you know they've actually seen them in in uh sort of accidental ways but because they knew they were going to take classes on maybe program with b5js and kind of did some research and have tried it before and so it's hard i think probably if you're kind of searching the internet for all of the resources ready to p5.js i imagine that a lot of my videos come up pretty often although uh there are so many other wonderful ones out there there are just like you know i mentioned aaron davies twitch channel so i i don't i want to list more but then i'm afraid of leaving people out so i will just uh hold that thought i'll put a pin in that maybe i can publish a list of you know i don't want to say like best p5.js or processing resources in 2020 but like some of my favs or whatever um thank you for that question um zack i have to say though where i do i mean not anymore because uh i don't know if you noticed global pandemic but um before uh last march of 2020 i would find myself recognized randomly most often in nyu tandon's one of the nyu tandon buildings which is the nyu school for engineering and people would be like flummoxed just to like why i was there um whereas in the uh the tisch departments which is the school of the arts where i teach um you know mostly know people already so they're not surprised to see me okay um we've got some is that some kind of norwegian currency that is amazing oh my god we're gonna get to that snowman thank you anonymous anonymous really likes to donate can we start coding at smithich i get it yeah i i feel the same way i feel like you three five three three four six one nine one two three two seven nine one zero nine four one nine six one nine eight two seven zero one one okay um rogue is asking a really important question does youtube take a cut from the fundraiser donations like they do from regular donations they do not from what i understand uh through the youtube giving platform this is very different than if you've ever done a super chat or a membership payment for a youtube channel those are commercial transactions that go to the creator the owner of the channel with youtube taking quite a large percentage of 30 um but with the youtube giving uh at least so i'm told and everything in the past that i participated in leads me to believe that it is true um 100 including all the transaction fees are covered go to the processing foundation and i can tell you it's true because i actually go to the processing foundation's mailbox and get the check that comes and look at it so and then deposit it into the bank into the processing foundation's bank account little known fact you're looking at the processing foundation banker right here although um many new uh exciting people are joining the processing community and processing uh who will be or i don't wanna i don't wanna like scoop any announcements so so yeah uh let me just check see if i any messages from dorothy um not yet so um i think we're good to go i'm gonna keep going and i am going to move on to writing some code so let's make a snowman so why are we making this snowman um let me get over to the coding train discord okay so uh here we are so by the way if you um haven't uh joined the i'm gonna put a link into uh the chat right now um codingtrain has a discord um you know since this is a processing foundation i'm doing this coding train live stream as a fundraiser for the processing foundation i should certainly mention um the processing forum you know one of the most frequently asked questions i definitely get is where do i get help with my code um i'm kind of an obsessive completionist and i try to answer every email that i get uh that has i've it's been about two years since i've actually been able to continue that up so if you write me an email with a code question chances are it will it will get lost into the ether of the of the internet but um if you post on the processing forum there is a helpful and wonderful community there that can help you with your questions about processing and p5.js and coding there's kind of community forums there's a post about the fundraiser if you have job opportunities uh art call for proposals or calls for participation in a conference or an art show though there that's a platform for you to use to post or to find those kind of opportunities but all in addition and these are separate things but the coding terrain is at the as the youtube channel itself has a discord so that's what you're looking at right here most recently in 2020 i've been working on a series of how to code a discord bot tutorial i have a song about box coming up soon um and um so i encourage you to join uh the discord and there are many um channels here under help and discussion in particular that you can ask questions and share work and join with the coding train community but the reason why i'm going there now is one of the things that i do when i live stream is i use this channel called links so schedules where i post updates and announcements about the live streaming schedule and then links is where i'll post links to things that i am talking about um during the live stream and uh k weekman here thankfully i already posted the processing foundation donate link um and now i'm going to show you two sketches prepared by members of the coding train community made in p5.js because as of today i am launching an exciting something as part of this fundraising initiative for us all to make p5.js holiday cards and share them with each other on the internet so i think we need a hashtag for this i'm not so sure how we're going to do this if we use twitter or instagram or the discord or what but um let's take a look at these so let's take a look at both of these sketches real quick let's look at this first one so first of all the um in in discord if i just type in uh the command snow globe i will get a link to this particular sketch and uh here we will see this particular sketch is made by coding train viewers and these are their discord user names saint plays 7380 and youfu042 isn't it great how discord you get a random number associated with your name it's everything i ever wanted for the coding terrain community everybody gets their own random number uh let's take a look at this one so this is a snow globe sketch so you can see it's got the coding train characters in it it has a happy holidays message and it has this snowfall happening there so what are some things that you might do how might you make your own versions of this is it that you create a design that lives in the snow globe can you make it interactive some way i wonder if you can make a mobile version where you should shake it up and it starts to scatter all the snow lots of possibilities with this sketch and i'm going to show you one more sketch now i'm going to go to um what's this one called holiday card hi dan hi everybody nice to see you very clever your use of emoji ah the utes okay and this is created by consti3204 on uh uh on discord who created this system by which to place a p5.js sketch inside of a card look at it opens and there is a nice tree um and then of course it's like a nice little webgl world and you can have my sketch so i think i might start with this one because well actually what i'm going to do is i'm going to show you the process first i'm going to make my own snowman i'm gonna make my own snowman and i'm going to make it in p5.js and then i'm going to try to put it in this card and put a message on it and invite you all the viewers to make your own all right how does that sound konsti 219 is in the youtube chat right now hi consti thanks so much for working on this okay so let's duplicate this oh actually so let's go to uh let's go to a blank sketch first doorway daniel oh how rude okay so what what um what should i do here i'm taking suggestions from the from those of you the viewers of the coding train let's see what let's i guess let's start with the most rudimentary idea for a snowman one of the things i would like to think about maybe here is parametric design so how might i code a snowman so that every time i write the sketch i get a slightly different snowman so there's some rules that generate the design but they're different each time but let's just make one um i'm going to click this auto refresh which i almost never do but i'm very excited to try it right now let's put uh we need a fill that's white okay that's looking pretty good so far um ah so kobe thank you um is uh um is saying that there's more information about how to there we're actually doing a little bit of a holiday giveaway as well on the coding train um and so you can submit your sketches as part of that holiday giveaway and there's information about that and announcements okay so um let's all right that's our first okay now what i want to do i want to have another one but i want to move it up maybe make it smaller pretty close i guess they should sit right on top of each other right so if this one is at 300 and its height is 200 then the other one is at well let's make this simpler let's just let's make this at one make the math simpler and then oops this would set them on top of each other but if i want to shrink it if i take it down by a hundred whoops if i shrink the circle to 100 and then move it down by 50 it will sit right on top of course i want it to be a circle okay this is going well i'm so close to having a snowman uh okay uh let's see now next um let's add one more let's move this one up to 50 and then let's move let's make it 50 in size and move it down to 75. is this the appropriate ratio of circles in a snowman i'm not so sure also i feel like maybe i need some more uh some more space to work with here uhoh um so let's see i don't know by the way no plan here i'm just trying to make a snowman with some circles that are white trying to follow my instructions oh my god it's getting warm in this hat with this holiday sweater on what should i do next people are really discussing other things besides my amazing incredible snowman design i think i need some motivation here what if we had the snowman like wobble if i attached some springs throw away daniel okay this is getting better larger oh look at that snowman okay oh this is getting good this is getting good people i think we're getting a good snow there we go this looks pretty good buttons carrot nose hat pipe okay so i think we need to turn this into an algorithm right i want to have the snow i want to turn this into an algorithm so what is the what's the sort of like key property that i would pick to sort of define and start the snowman i think it would be probably the size of the bottom circle so let's create a variable i'm just going to say no loop for a second to only run it once let's create a variable called r and that will be a random number between 100 and uh 200. and so that by definition will be the radius of the bottom um circle now should i do this i should probably write this as a loop so we're going to start with y is equal to the height of the canvas minus that radius and we want to draw three circles and so the first one will be at ellipse and let's just draw one first the first one will be at the y position golden ratio i like this idea rudra we're gonna let's let's think about using the golden ratio um y um and x is always going to be um the middle for right now yes uh uh okay yes this is where i'm going this is uh we got this uh suggestion from the chat from stieg specified snowman ball size coal eyes carrot notices percentages relative overall yes yes this is where i'm going we think alike we think alike thank you for this um and violet says it would look better without the stroke but that's a that's something i can make happen very very quickly um so uh y um x and then r times two and in fact uh p5 does have a function called circle so i can also just use that um so let's comment these out what's going on here oh you know what x x goes before y there we go okay so then uh r equals r times let's just let's just use 90 let's shrink it by 90 percent uh so let's make it 75 percent and then y minus equals uh oh i guess i um so first i should move y to the edge and then shrink it then move it to the edge again and we should get a two there we go so now right what i'm doing here is i'm starting with if i sort of zoom in here i start with this point right then i move by the um i move by its radius shrink the radius move by that's radius and then draw the next circle now what is the golden ratio we i was going to make a random ratio but this could be interesting to grab the golden ratio um let's see if i can get it as a decimal number uh i can't copy that uh irrational number solution to the quad should i just solve for it should we solve this quadratic equation i could say 1 plus square root of 5 divided by 2. we could do that so let's let's make a constant equals 1 plus square root of 5 divided by two is that the golden ratio and uh you know i'm outside of um i'm outside of setup and draw so i'm going to say this let's just see if i got about the right number here that looks pretty good but of course i want to divide by it so i need to say times 1 divided by golden so there's the golden ratio and now we just need to get the third there we go that looks kind of nice and it's sort of silly what i just did because um i could in fact just say 2 divided by this up here well i've made some really interesting things happen and all right so clearly the if i'm using this what is the sort of largest size yeah that's way too big so let's um let's just see what uh 150 gets us yeah 150 is the full size so that should be all right so now every time i run this i get a new snowman stack pretty good let's get rid of this stroke might be fun to animate this somehow not sure what color the background should be in this case all right there's our beginning of our snowman oh it's lovely it's just delightful cold buttons oh where do the buttons go the golden ratio is traditionally called fee yes that is true um um where do the buttons go in a snowman i should know this right if i look at like the snowman emoji is that going to help me buttons here okay let's put some buttons so now we need um if i equals zero so when we're on the first circle let's draw a um let's draw a nice little black circle and say are the you know i should really use translate so x let's just let's just draw a one button see how this goes r times like 10 whoops that's about the size of a button i think maybe we can make it a little bit bigger that's at the center so y minus r times 0.2 and y plus r times 0.2 okay how's that two buttons is two buttons good three buttons the circles should be overlapped i agree that makes a lot of sense it's gonna look a little better okay we can make that happen good suggestion from the chat good suggestion from the chat here what how do i want to do that um let's not go let's do like let's go like 95 percent of the way up yeah maybe a little bit more even how do we like this this is looking a little better maybe even more actually i'm realizing now that now that i've i'm overlapping them i think that's kind of nice okay oh we've got a donation thank goodness thank you so much to ddc for your donation to the bronzing foundation here are your random numbers four nine nine one nine one eight six four four nine two six seven five two nine six six one zero nine nine two six zero nine three seven one hey okay fractal twig arms oh yes we're gonna be making some fractal twig arms for sure okay now what is next what else goes on a snowman uh natto says random number of buttons oh you got me there random number of buttons oh tom lucas just when i stopped playing the i'm song thank you for your donation to the processing foundation it is very appreciated it is appreciated this much seven 23351044172 eight six zero zero six eight zero three two two seven nine four two seven nine hey thank you all right we are going to um oh and quick pause here tyler says can we get access to the donation rewards if we do donate here on youtube yes check the pin to comment on this video you have to uh all you need to do is email your google receipt to foundation processing.org we've got two more donations ad xm eight

count keep counting random numbers counting them down all right so um now oh my goodness just when i stopped okay okay oh okay okay oh dorothy's in the chat great dorothy we're gonna bring you in soon there we go okay hold on thank you to anonymous nine seven three five five six zero zero zero six one eight one six six five one three seven five seven nine four six one eight two six zero and also to craig road jr the processing foundation thanks you for your donation with these random numbers 35104 seven three two one six zero seven two seven two four six eight nine five four five two oh and franny knits you guys are keeping me low looking you guys are keeping me going here franny knits thank you for your donation here are some random numbers for you three zero two nine three three one three zero five nine six zero three zero two five seven six zero eight five ah ah zero one three zero three seven six three ah this really i'm telling you this seemed like such a good idea earlier today when i thought of reading random numbers for people who donate dorothy is here dorothy i would like to know from dorothy when it is how much longer you are available because i would i'm attempting to finish off this p5.js snowman and then i believe after that would be a great time for you to call in and talk a bit about the processing foundation um but i don't know i know you have some other meetings and things maybe today so let me know if you have a time that you have to leave by and i will make sure to bring you in by then everyone say hi to executive director of the pressing foundation in the chat dorothy santos okay all right we're gonna go with natto's suggestion of a random number of buttons so this is where i'm doing the butt so we're gonna need another loop so let's get a um number well we want at least two buttons and maybe let's go between two and four so this would be two three or four this should give me two three or four buttons and then i need um how much space do i have um well i guess i could do i'm doing this in such a strange way um but it's just the way my brain is telling me to do it right now so let's do this like just for the sake of argument um if i do this y um let's just do this just to y plus uh j times r i'm just going to do something really silly here for a second okay so every time i run this i'm going to get a bunch of buttons sort of spaced out by some arbitrary amount so what is the total length that i want to have the button spaced between so the total length that the buttons should be i'm going to make that basically r so that's going to be r so d r is r divided by the number of buttons and so this would be y plus j times dr so that's two buttons right so no matter what the buttons are spaced out but they're not centered so they should go this is like really kind of crazy minus uh r divided by r times 0.5 so this no no if r is the amount of space for all the buttons is it do is it different if it's an odd if it's only going to work if it's an odd number i'm confused give me an odd number of buttons gosh darn it there we go no why are my buttons not centered what did i get wrong here um so the button y location is the center plus what button number i'm on zero times the spacing between all the buttons um and then all right if i do that let's just make for sake of argument now the number of buttons three always so this makes sense i want to be move up by oh it's it's r minus one no no no it's the number of buttons three uh times dr half of that so why shouldn't that be minus r divided by two i went up i went all the divided by four am i just confused yeah it's four i'm not sure why but it definitely is four two so now we have a random number of buttons map would really make sense chris sears is telling me to use map oh my god map would be so would make so much sense here let's redo this with map i like the idea of redoing this with map just as a way to think about it let b y equals map j which goes between 0 and num to between r i want to go between y minus r and y plus r just just for the sake of argument here that's going to space them out how not exactly because if there are two then i'm only getting zero and 1 right why did that not work height minus two uh you know why diamond the diameter i know is 2r agree with chris sears wait what's wrong with my mapping um very happy with my mapping um why why is if there's two am i only seeing it one and this is also a good suggestion from i definitely want to add some purl and noisy randomness here and all that kind of stuff but i'm i'm just confused here if j is zero then i'm mapping why would that be in the center zero to two oh i see goes from zero to num minus one yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay of course thank you to i'm not really thinking about this because the buttons are zero and one so if no what just happened there oh my mother my other way was working this map not doing what i think it's gonna do um hold on let's just see this should be right with two buttons that's exactly right zero and one with three buttons there once so that's right so if i oh is it just being it's being covered up by this one it's there it's just being covered up yeah they're overlapping i see yeah i think let's use let's use point five there we go okay this of course of course so map actually works uh let's try making them random again but i don't think i think they should actually be like like that's not where you would have two buttons on a snowman i think there's just like an amount of space between the buttons um which makes more sense so it really is y minus uh dr times the total number y like i want a certain amount of length for the buttons to fit into so this all right i think this is what i want now the buttons are always going to fit in this like small area i have a different idea now i have a different idea everybody okay okay wait wait i think what should be consistent here oh wait we have a donation you saved me you saved me you have the same donation thank you thank you to uh keith a button class oh my god helps eight four nine eight seven two eight seven five nine one nine one seven seven one four seven three three two four five five oh okay i'm not sure why that didn't come through kobe okay um all right boy i'm really this is like a lesson in how to obsessively spend an incredible amount of time on on these buttons how to program a snowman in p5.js in over four and a half hours i have a different idea of a way i want to do this i want the buttons to be um separated right so there's a button size which is r times which is 20 of the radius there is a total number of buttons um and then there is the length of all of the buttons which is the button size times the total number of buttons but um and uh and we should have a little spacing so there should be um but i don't want the spacing to be yeah the spacing to be a percentage oh look at this so complicated um like a 10 a little spacing in between the buttons so i don't need this and now i just need um that the uh the buttons y location goes from 0 to num minus 1 to the center of it minus length divided by 2 and then the center plus length divided by 2. there we go so no matter how many buttons there are um the length is i i guess i want them to maybe i want it to be fixed actually the length should actually just be um r times 0.5 i'm gonna do that no that's still the same problem what's happened to me this is really bad i've gone off the deep man i'm going off the deep end top most button should be center aligned with the middle circle and bottom most should be central line with the bottom circle and the rest should be equally spaced in between okay i'm thinking topmost button the buttons go in between here oh i like that idea should we make this okay okay god i got it everybody hold on we're starting over we're starting over cut cut cut [Laughter] cut i have an idea i have an idea people just bear with me for a moment do throw away daniel everything's going to be okay everybody we're going to refactor this code right now we're going to make it work we're going to sit noon and all i've done is sing a lot of songs and yeah yes i this is it's gonna be okay everybody just just just take a deep breath i don't know go take a break get yourself a nice hot cup of tea some warm cocoa and i'll be i'm gonna be working this up dorothy are you still here is dorothy still here do i have a message from dorothy oh wait uh okay hold on oh oh sorry sorry i do have a message from dorothy um how about in 10 minutes we're gonna take a break in about 10 minutes all right so let's keep going with this um we're going to keep going with this we're going to say r equals this okay when in doubt make everything this dot i have a song that i'm going to sing as soon as i forget that this thought it's going to be very exciting then what am i doing here we i have the same sort of idea and we're going to make the snowball x y with r and then we're going to just want to get what i had before i need to build up some confidence here by making this object oriented um and then uh and then i just need to make the circle with no stroke um okay uh this is looking good people just wait till we have our button class we have our snowball we're gonna be able to animate stuff this is gonna be much better and then now get rid of all this forget about all that stuff just delete it just say goodbye sarah is there more genderneutral term than snowman i could use let's see here what did i miss people remember how we're going to make this into a holiday card from the coding train uh what did i miss what did i miss i'm getting some errors here line 76 snowball hold on let me look at this r is not defined r is not defined where did i forget r is it what i think it is i need to do this because i'm going to adjust it i don't know if i'm going to need that later um okay what's still the problem what's still the problem snowballs is not to find line 17 and it's happened everybody it's happened it's happened we have a new song for you to sing guess what everyone it's time to sing another song forgot the this dot it happens a lot my brain starts to rot my attempts at coding were all for naught without this dot you can't create the object this dot deserves but the utmost respect this dot is the one that i can't reject i think i'm falling in love i think i might need the melody forgot the this dot no up there there we go it happens a lot my brain starts to rot my attempts at coding were off or not without this time you can't create the object this dot deserves but the utmost respect this data is the one that i can't reject i think i'm falling in love forgot to start god's father's start okay why do i only have one snowball um sorry i'm getting a lot of like notifications i really should turn this off oh i'm live streaming okay where are the other where are the other snowballs oh oh look at this this is the mistake there we go okay so now once again we now have my snowpack ah darth taurus darth taurus thank you darth taurus for your donation and now for your donation you will receive your very own random numbers two three eight seven one six one six five seven six five five six one one six one eight four five nine three eight eight okay oh i need a break here um so for those of you who are not able to uh donate from your area and you want to donate please go to processingfoundation.org and go to support p5 here hopefully the donorbox system will allow you to donate and you'll also receive the rewards if you're donating through oh the blobbies is the blobbies are watching blobbies um if uh what was i saying um if you are donating via youtube you should make sure you forward your message your email receipt to foundation at processing.org okay let's see if we can add the buttons then i'm going to take a break and um i will um um uh i'm just fixing my hat here i think it looks better like this and i'm gonna let dorothy take over for a few minutes frankly just because i need to break for a second but i wanna i want to accomplish the buttons i cannot i can make the buttons happen okay where so now we want to add some buttons so let's make a button class so honestly the button can basically be the snowball um cannot access snowball before initialization that's interesting because i'm doing something kind of crazy here where i've got everything in one file that's fine so if you this is a little this is quite unnecessary but if you've never tried inheritance before with objectoriented programming here is a nice opportunity so i can basically say how do i do this again i think if i write the constructor and then call super basically the idea of creating a button is to give it an x y and a size and the only difference is and i can say um let's make this a color this dot color so the snowball is a circle that is white and the button is everything that is a snowball but just has a color that is zero yes i'm going full classes people i'm going full objectoriented programming this is my i'm going full update programming expression forgot this dot all right now i should be able to just make some buttons now i should be able to say okay because i've got two snowballs i'm going to say start you is snowballs index is the bottom one is number two is the middle one dot y end y is the middle one y and then i just want to i want to have some number of buttons uh we have a lot of buttons people we have between 10 and 20 buttons so we're going to have that many buttons and the um and i'm going to say buttons index i equals a new button at an x and a y so the the button the y the x is still just at this x the y the the y is mapping uh i which goes between 0 and num minus 1 from start y to end y and the size of the buttons are this dot r times ten so ten percent of the radius what have i done oh wait we have a donation anonymous anonymous has donated thank you very much six eight nine zero six nine zero four eight five nine five eight seven six two zero six eight seven three two five six all right thank you anonymous all right okay now uh what's wrong with my code here error line 86 i don't have a line 86 what's going on what's happening what have i done wrong are you hearing that by the way this sort of like noise just try something no i don't know what that is um okay let button extends snowball i made the most complicated snowman ever but i'm completely lost as to what the error is i'm going to look over here snowballs is not defined oh my god no are you serious forgot this dot it happens a lot forgot the this dot my brain is cannot read property one of undefined snozeballs there we go woohoo i'm back we're back baby the most over engineered snowman ever it's going to be worth it though where are the buttons where are the buttons people where are the buttons okay so let's let's not show these for a second all right now are we getting to here oh this dot buttons is not iterable line 29 oh this dot buttons buttons i'm falling in love with the studs buttons [Laughter] oh my god those are the buttons maybe it's too many buttons dorothy save me okay oh god that's what is okay we're getting somewhere i think we should have them overlap even more by the way yeah there we go okay snowman i have no talent for visual design whatsoever okay so um that's a lot of buttons i agree i agree i think i might rethink this a little bit but it's flexible now um all right we're gonna take a short break not really a break but i would like to bring in dorothy here to um to talk about uh the processing foundation so let me move to this here and i'm gonna just play the processing fundraiser theme song while i get set up to bring dorothy in yeah we've come a long way in the year of 2020 though a lot of things happened that weren't so funny sure we had a lot of whoops but we did a lot of coding and the processing foundation lets us keep the engine going on the coding train it comes along and then it takes you away into a world where all that and the passengers on board that keep the train running at its best oh all right we're just about there everyone whoops i've just got to fix a couple things um audiowise okay that's off um all right let me play this song hold on let me just play my waiting music here while we're waiting for dorothy oh i you gotta have to turn your audio it's like oldtimey radio shows where you're gonna have to turn your your radio down do you hear me dorothy yeah okay hold on all right nobody hears you yet i'm about to send your audio in i'm just getting this ready here how do i how do i make this look right very this is i'm running a highly professional operation here people okay hold on hold on close this window there we go perfect okay um i've got you up in the corner of the screen i'm gonna turn down the music here i'm gonna turn your audio on dorothy say hello nobody sees you yet but i wanna know if they hear you how are how is everyone ah okay your audio is coming through loud and clear so now i'm just going to close a couple windows here and i'm going to have the fundraiser page up i can bring up any other urls by your request and i'm now here we go in three two one and you're live hi dorothy hi it's this is quite surreal because i can't see anything else except me and my lovely cat here hold on hold on i'll make this a little better for you oh no i'm gonna i will now you can see me also i'm in multiple places on the screen but now you can see me hi this is so great i've been enjoying i enjoy the snowman or snow person or snow pal i've been seeing some some interesting names for the snow friend that you've lovely um i i thought the cold buttons would go in the middle circle personally with a nose and two coal like coal eyes but you know i don't want to add any more work to anyone um you know that would certainly make sense i don't know what what's happening to me today i'm like uh it's just been i think it's been a very long 2020 and all of a sudden like what seemed to me like the simplest thing in the world that i would not possibly need to prepare for in terms of like programming a little snowman design uh has turned into a quite oh snow pal i love snow pal i'm going to use that snow power that's a good one um i've i've really it's a you know i guess it's an example of what of of the process of what coding is like yeah no i mean i mean i guess and i don't want to take up much more time i know people logged on to see you dan so hey and i just want to say thank you first of all to everyone who's donated i think it's really wonderful as um i really love the theme song actually because we have gone through challenges this year but um i think it's been a really it's been really affirming to see everyone just joining the telethon but also donating so again thank you so much to everyone um whether whether people believe this or not this is like my days are filled with actually checking the foundation email um i am also one of the people that's behind seeing all the artwork that everyone makes uh so uh if it's me if or if it's if it's processing foundation that's like enjoying the art that you're making online via social or wherever i'm one of the people that um sees everything that you all are doing so i really do it's it i mean it sounds so cheesy but it like really does keep the work going um but yeah donating enables us to kind of do all of the programming that we have planned for next year such as the fellowship open calls is coming up next year so please be on the lookout for that that's a way to kind of work with the processing foundation and other you know um past fellows and mentors but there's some really big things we want to do in 2021 it's also the 20th anniversary of processing oh crazy so you know believe it or not we're trying to do some really big things and um yeah and we can't do that without the support of um of the community so it means a lot to to see everyone here today and uh i yeah i i don't know what else to also if anyone wants uhoh we just lost your audio oh if anyone wants to do a sketch of my cat sorry did you can you hear me still now i can yeah oh i was gonna say because my cat i i was gonna say i would love to see a cat sketch with a santa hat um i'm more than happy to and i welcome those sketches if anyone wants to send them directly i have no problem sharing my email but you could also just send it to foundation at processing.org because i am checking all the email by the way in the uh while you were talking there there were just a whole bunch of donations that came in and i'm being told uh you won't be able to hear this dorothy but uh breaking news breaking news breaking news uh i believe we reached the one thousand dollar goal of the coding trains fundraiser today oh my gosh i think it was your logging on to say hello that made that happen no i think it was i i think it was my cat and just you know um but yeah i i do i do also want to express not just um gratitude to the community but also to like the incredible team we have i think a lot of what you see what everyone sees happening whether it's the coding train whether it's um you know uh p5 dot js community you know handling you know um inquiries or kind of questions on our discourse forum and um you know from all the processing foundation or crosstalk community day organizers around the world like it takes so much to do the things that we do and so i again just wanted to thank everyone and if you have any questions again foundation at processing.org uh as dan mentioned please don't forget to send your receipt to foundationnetprocessing.org i'm actually going through all that email so um i will be um and then this time also i have to admit the um uh my apartment is not is no longer going to be the fulfillment center so you should be able to get things way faster this year but um yeah dan is there anything that you want me to um talk specifically about or no i'm just i was you were talking i was kind of like scrolling through various pages of the website um like to see and it's just like so wonderful it makes me smile to see all the faces and names of people who are on the people page of the processing foundation and that really only i think you know scratches the surface of all the different people that have been involved um if you go to the fellowships page and scroll through to see all the previous fellows projects another thing that i think is really important to highlight is the processing foundation medium where um there'll be long form posts from different fellowship projects and especially um um the the i can highlight i would like to highlight these create canvas interviews which are interviews with the um different educators um that's sort of been like a new thing that um a lot of new episodes of that came trying to think of what are the highlights of 2020 so i guess i don't even really have to think of them because if you just go to the medium page and scroll through you're really going to see all the posts over that um that particular year i mean i think another highlight that i want to share and we get so many emails i and again just to a test i ca i i go through all these emails um that i that are always asking how you can help and i think a big part of it is to you know using the forum uh posting your questions sharing your artwork sharing your artwork tagging us on social media so we know what you're making the things that you're doing i mean there's so many ways to to kind of celebrate you know all the things that we've done this year and this has been a really difficult year and i think um to dan's point considering that what the fellows of 2020 had to go through i really encourage you to look at the medium interviews that they've uh done with uh joanna hedwa our director of advocacy and as dan mentioned um listening in on the interviews that uh sauber khan our education community director conducted with educators from you know different kind of areas as well uh using code as a way of making artwork but also just trying to you know uh engage in social change and um yeah and this this year definitely we need to celebrate all of those accomplishments from the fellows to our team even to all of you to the community and to the contributors out there um there's so many there's so many of you and it's just it's like i i really am so thankful to be a part of this community um because i'm learning so so much also just side note dan i've said this previously i i would love an iteration of the coding train sweater for next year i know if i know people would totally like love that just you know just a side note yes i would love to make that happen i should get in touch with mariko who this was like a onetime thing i should pull up her twitter but she made a whole video about her process and like hand making and designing the sweater like um then this was i think from now two or three years ago and it's like i just wear it every year now but th this is why i was saying this over email what happens to me with this holiday fundraiser is it's always such a busy fall is so busy and so stressed so many things going on this is such a joy and fun to do but i literally like to start figuring out what i'm going to do the day before so one of these years i got to start planning this much further in advance we can have sweaters for everybody more guests uh more coding examples and fun things we're gonna have to remember that so somebody i don't know maybe someone remind me around october next year or when is it thanksgiving that's when i should be like that's when the christmas seat the holiday season starts i don't know but yes the sweater we got to make the sweater a thing i'm into that well you know you know in the philippines christmas decorations go up in september oh so i mean it's it starts early so we will figure it out we'll figure it out um but yeah dan thank you so much for doing the telethon every year and just all of the fun i mean i don't know what did you did you make a snowman last year i don't remember i did log on but i don't even you've done so many videos i don't even remember it's hard it's hard to remember because um i've kind of gone through like all of the obvious like holiday things like oh let's do a snowflake or let's do a tree fractal tree but i don't think snow i think there was uh one year where i did this like i was like playing with sketch rnn which is this machine learning model that would generate drawings i think some snowmen might have come out of that but uh no this is the first p5.js snow pal or snow buddy that um for uh for for the telesign so i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna make that happen so one last question for you dorothy before we sign off is if people are sharing um anything they make regardless whether it's from but i'm thinking in particular of anybody who's watching this live stream and is going to take that snow but snow pal code and make a much more real like beautifully designed version of a snow pal um how should they share it with the processing foundation on twitter just tag processing org what's the best way yeah tagging processing org on twitter or instagram um if you have an app you know it's interesting we get a lot of animated work and it's unless someone uh posts kind of you know a story on say instagram but the best way is also to if you wanted to submit to foundation at processing.org like an actual you know excerpt of an animation that you have i'm i can do that as well it's easier for me to to then share the animation because i know sometimes you know on on you know the different social media streams you can only share kind of an um like a screenshot or an actual image if it's reposted or reshared so um yeah that's awesome can share okay well we're gonna be collecting a lot of these in the coding train discord i know that there's a system and we've got like a holiday submissions channel i'm gonna try to pull that up and see but so so we'll collect we'll i'll help we'll sort of collect stuff and we can share throughout the next few days for the rest of 2020 share everybody's um holiday or new year's themed uh p5.js cards i would love that oh yes i saw that earlier and i was so excited i actually want to make a p5 holiday card yeah please do that and um i'm so excited to see everyone's work great thank you so much dorothy everybody big round of applause the sound effect is playing that you can hear uh a big kind of applause for dorothy and uh oh thank you for all of your work on the processing foundation here's to another wonderful year of processing community projects and initiatives and gettogethers and code and fun and all sorts of stuff in 2021 thank you everyone bye bye dorothy okay all right i'm back this is go i would say that i'm not maybe like a bplus for today's live but for the aplus for dorothy i'm just thinking about how i'm doing with this live stream today it's 12 30 we've been going for about two hours we had so many donations come in um but i uh so i'm not sure how to like um thank them all but uh give me a second here i'm gonna take just a short brief uh break just to get a couple technical things set up and then i'll be back to finish the snowman it's no pal so dog so okay here i am back um all right so before i go on to complete this uh snow pal um so wait i i have uh i'm sorry that stig stig your comment is so wonderful i'm gonna read it um if someone can repost it into actually you know what i can just do this myself stig i think you're in the discord in the members anything you post in there i can actually bring up onto the screen and i'm going to bring it up right now because i just copy pasted it over stig writes don't sweat about the snow buddy dan showing what an inherently messy activity coding is will help people just learning to code overcome their anxiety of having to make everything perfect thank you for expressing what is the mantra the point of view the philosophy of the coding train itself um i super super appreciate it and for all of you who are tagging me right now at discord know that a big sound effect goes off in my ear every time i get tagged so try to use that only for any sort of like important messages that i need to receive uh so thank you uh stig for that comment and for your support of the coding terrain and the processing foundation um all right so what i what i want to do is i want to quickly go and show you um so this is a this telethon is a fundraiser for the processing foundation you just heard from dorothy uh and i've been talking about the processing foundation thank you everyone's donated i hear we've reached our goal let's see if we can get it higher still people are still donating i'll probably still be here live streaming although i really need to go spend some time with my children um and um but what i wanted to mention is simultaneously sort of as part of creating all of these p5.js holiday cards that i'm doing as part of the telethon we are running in the coding train discord a kind of holiday giveaway so you can um in the announcement section you can find some more information on it i just wanted to show this is where i will be collect this is where you can post your uh holiday sketches so a diamond ore i hope it's okay with you that i'm showing your sketch it is so uh fantastic i just looked at it um this is the first submission using the um card template made by konsti so you can see the template is just has a title username uh click the mouse and the card opens is it the clicking the mouse that actually causes the card to open i actually have no idea and let's take a look now at this uh this example from uh the diamond ore on discord bounding polygon by or yeti oh look at this it's a card with this animation isn't that so cool look there's even a slider here so i can kind of uh i don't know what the slider does but it does something cool changes the force the boundaries and i can do toggle so there's a polygon here that i can toggle on and off i love this so i love this idea of holiday cards with p5.js animations let's collect these um maybe like making short like gif animations of them and sharing them on social media i'm in the market for a really good hashtag or that you could just tag the coding train and processing.org i'd love to be able to but i think a hashtag is useful because then i can just go to that page and see all of them so uh i'm looking for your hashtag uh um submissions now for how we're going to share this back to my snow pal okay so first of all i'm gonna i did like snow buddy but i'm gonna change this to snow pal just because it is a less typing and i don't know why i put a capital b there that seems unnecessary um and this will be whoops what did i just do here so this is a new snow pal this is my pal pal what did i do wrong oh right and then i made that because i had to be crazy about this um there's an error due to snowball it's no pals no pal oh no that's snope that's still snowball oh my god i've lost my mind what's going on i've ruined everything snowball's not defined ah there we go there we go there we go okay we're back people we're back here is our snow pal all right so the buttons are flawed but i'm gonna move on from the buttons and now we just need to probably um put in a nose let's see if um let's just make the note let's just have the nose be a vector like a vector object with a position and i think probably if i just take and put a rectangle there and say fill where is my oh this dot nose let's quickly add a nose yay there's my nose uh why is the y oh because the y went up um all right so let's just say uh if i've really done this in like such an insane way uh if let's see the nose is let's put it in the middle of the last snowball zero one two this dot this dot it's so quiet there we go okay there's my there's my three to six i'm saying i'm being told to use fewer buttons okay that's starting to look good okay now the nose should really be a triangle so let's make it a triangle so how do i make a triangle triangle this knows x knows y this nose dot x this knows dot y i'm just gonna hard code in some numbers like one point down and then i need one more let's uh so i need x and y y down then x plus like 20. and let's go back to the right this is what oh that's pretty good like see that's what i'm kind of going for with the nose maybe it should actually be pointing down yeah that's better maybe so it should obviously be bigger so no um i need like nose width is this dot r um this dot r times uh 20 percent okay that's though that's the height interesting um and notice how i didn't make a nose class even though i really showed up based on what i'm doing let's just make it uh the height 10 percent there we go that's pretty good for my nose i'll take it sort of sizing according to the uh the snow pal now we need some eyes um what should i do about the eyes buttons should i get a little image of buttons we're just gonna we're just gonna put two more circles i gotta wrap this up people uh okay so that's my uh nose now and i think actually i for right now i would like the um our snow pal to generally be larger so i don't want to have a super small one okay um now let's see um all right so we make it orange orange that's a good idea the the could someone give me could i please request an rgb value from orange oh try the color 255 140 comma zero okay let's try that for the nose um 255 140. ah that's better i like that thank you um okay we're doing well 93 57 13 i'm also being told um 93 57 13 let's try that 93 57 13. that's too dark but i thank you for this oh my sound is off sorry everybody that's when you're supposed to use the notification right that's when you add shiffman me when my sound is off yeah yeah i'm gonna wait for the chat to catch up with me having realized that i i hit the mute button by accident but look at this look at our beautiful buttons all this shape and missized oh i love mars snow pal i love our snow pal okay chat come on catch up catch up chat catch up to where i fixed it okay um now let's see what they need some eyes i'm really getting tired of doing this um okay it's back it's back it's back you gonna hear me right okay um what what do snow men look like oh ooh look at this a scarf well that's so much oh i need little a little mouth a little okay we're gonna have to do this we got to go through with this everybody all right so i think the buttons i can use reuse the button class for the eyes and the mouth let's do that so oh i have an idea let's have the snow pal sing along with me oh this is gonna be fun okay i've got an idea everybody this is great uh okay so now i just need to let's add some eyes let's say the left eye is a new button um where am i let's see i want this is the top snowball xy so let me this is the head so let's just put that in a variable so i can say head dot x head dot y so now i have the head and the left eye is head dot x minus let's just ahead dot r uh here head um okay so we're going to make a head a head as a button at x minus the rate half of the radius and then at um head dot y sorry and a right eye which will be uh plus that and then we can say this dot buttons push push those two eyes in no oh i need an r for them um i need a size let's just quickly type hard code in a value look at those eyes they're beautiful i guess they should be also and that's too too far apart those eyes are okay that's a little bit better their size should probably be that's pretty good 10 of the radius and then their y should be also offset uh okay yay okay now we've got our eyes now for the really exciting moment this is going to be so fun let's make a little sine wave for the mouth so i've really done quite a number on the code here i just want to be able to see this see these variables i don't usually do this but i want to be able to see this written out so i left and i right those are the left eye and right eye now one thing that i'm kind of got all over the place here let's put this into a variable is offset because that i think would be useful to just have in a variable and then also let's make a a head r which is head dot r times 0.1 so this is for the buttons in the head okay so now we're still in pretty good shape here try using an arc well i could use an art but i want to put the dots an arc right right right an arc it doesn't need to be a sine wave yes that's sort of silly i was thinking of actually having its mouth oscillate as a sine wave as because i'm going to make the snow pal sing this is this is going somewhere people it's going places it's going to snow i got to make the fractal tree hands oh it's okay we're getting there it's only 12 50. okay how are we doing donation we haven't had a donation in a little while i got to keep me going here gotta gotta gotta fuel the train i have a little bit more coffee that's quite cold here i hear the pitterpatter of children's feet alright so now we've got to do a loop hello i do okay i gotta finish this i'm making a snow pal but i will i'm gonna wrap up soon but i've gotta make this snow pal something go away daniel okay now what i'm attempting to do is use polar to cartesian coordinates to trace the path of the mouth in a little bit of an arc so i'm going from the angle 0 to 180 degrees let's see if that works so and i have my ridiculous um way of making a an eye so that i should be able to say this dot buttons all right let's just let's make a let's make a mouth button there's a new button that goes at x y with some i'm just going to hard code in a size and this dot buttons push um mouth so oh they're all up here look at that there they are up there so i need to offset them by uh head.x head dot y there see look at that so and offset needs to be times two i think spread it out more um there this is what i'm talking about [Laughter] looking good so the question is so i should use map i think like i probably want to have a fixed number of these and then i'll map the angle so let's just say this is how many is this one two three four five six seven let's say we have eight so let's try doing it um for let n equal zero n is less than eight and plus plus and then um instead of this let's let the angle be map n which goes from 0 to 8 0 to pi and this should say angle and what did i get wrong here now what did i mess up here n which goes from zero to eight zero to pi what's different what did i do oh i have an extra like curly there we go so it's off by one because it should this should actually be seven there we go um i but maybe i actually shouldn't go all the way to the side i don't know how to use half of cosine and sine it should look more natural yes 0 to 120 with 30 degree offset oh interesting so i could go from you know 0.1 to pi i'm just doing like arbitrary values here um and then this should be head r but it should be a little bit smaller that's pretty good um all right i think the nose should be a little bit i don't higher what i'm doing here okay oh oh boy the nose is cutting off the mouth okay i think we're in pretty good shape here this could this could this could use some work but um it's fine i also just feel like generally um can i get away with a 200 what is 200 like off the yeah 200 is way off 150 is the maximum right no i don't know what i'm doing here let's let's let's try this okay i'm not going to get too caught up in that all right here is our oh we need to offset all of these they should also like and it's too bad that the nose is like cutting off the last one there but um i'll live with that we should offset we should we should adjust these all with a little bit of randomness i like that as well you know what it should be the buttons where did i make it should hear the button itself should give itself its own little bit of randomness right so rather than whoa uh rather than rather than me have to figure it out for every single one since i have this button class there's no reason why wherever it might be where is the button class do i have a button class snowball button yes there's no reason why i can't say something like x plus equal random like let's give them all a little bit of offset every single button and probably the amount of offset should be based on something and then the size but like a 10 percent adjustment whoa that sees like that offset is like crazy for the mouse now mouth so probably the randomness of x should be some uh some amount of r itself so let's just see right so that makes sense because like they're much more off for the larger buttons so now okay this is going well here is our snowman yay okay i'm excited has no hands everybody's telling me it has no hands it's going to have hands make the nose a little bit smaller i really the the nose is kind of awful i need to do something about this nose but i'm going to leave it right now you know this is code that all of you can improve and make better all right let's add the arms so all i need is a fractal tree oh how convenient look at this fractal tree and if i go over here and i run this looks pretty good probably something like this would be a nice arm and we can make it have a little bit more randomness to it let's grab this code let's get this branch function whoops let's get this branch function go back over to our and we're going to say give it a constructor gets just a starting point and maybe a starting angle and so this dot x equals x this dot y equals y this dot angle equals angle and then let's write a branch function and oops so whoops oh it should have an initial length and then the show function will recursively branch with its length okay now um okay there's lots of interesting things going in the chat but let's let's see so so what's i've got some syntax errors first of all too many brackets maybe okay so now this branch first i'm going to need a push and i'm going to need a pop because all that translation and rotation is going to need to be selfcontained then i'm going to want to translate to the x and y and rotate by that angle to start and then call branch so let's see if we can make a arm so let's add we've got head and buttons and mouth and nose let's add a left arm there's a new arm at i'm just going to give it some arbitrary location for right now negative 100 uh 200 wait what am i doing i don't know where are we i should translate to like the center let's let's just try 100 uh 300 and length of 100 um and let's say this dot left arm dot show okay so we've got some errors what went wrong boy a lot of like helpful error messages for me here but it's too much call from line two one nine and draw um i think something has gone has gone wrong here something has gone terribly wrong um uh so i i think my snow pal has to go into a different file i i've suffi i've completely um we need some more javascript files here snowpal.js i can't follow this anymore and snowpal.js let's make one more call just parts parts.js parts.js and in parts i will take the arm the snowball and the button um and put that in here so this is helping me understand what's going on uh this should say pal all right we are back but what is this error that i'm getting uncaught angle is not defined i have a feeling it's this forgot the this dot it happens a lot my brain starts to rot my attempts at coding were all or not without this dot you can't create the object this dot deserves but the utmost respect this dot is the one that i can't reject i think i'm falling in love oh branch is not defined ah this dot branches rotate was expecting a number the confusing thing is there's too many okay oh oh i didn't give it an angle okay hold on i see i see what's going on where's my snow pal i need to give it the constructor gets x y length and then angle the angle is not important right now i just thought i might need a starting angle and now parts um stroke zero there we go the arm is there okay so the reason why i did this is because i was imagining that here when i'm creating the arm i'm creating the arm that first of all that's much too large then i could give it an angle to like point it in a given direction there we go that's a starting angle and then now its position should be we'll call it body equals it's the second snowball so its position should be um arm x is body dot x minus body dot r and that should be arm x and arm y should just be body dot dot y right there it is and then the angle should be more like this and it should also go further in like it gets stuck in so body y minus so arm y is body dot y um no no x this is still x uh times times 1.2 no oh my well times 0.8 there we go okay there's the tree now i want to do some more stuff with this actual tree um which is and i think i'm gonna i gotta slow down a little bit here because there's an infinite amount of stuff i could do but i would like to sort of see what happens if i give it a stroke weight of two just to make it a little bit thicker okay there we go and um this angle i would like it to be slightly random yeah so this is good i guess it could be broadened there we go there we go so we can see giving that a little bit of randomness i mean i could really do more with varying the tree um i should probably give myself a little bit more width now um no reason not to do this and there we go okay so now we just need to put now we just need to do the other arm we're so close people we're so close uh where was i it's no pal let's make a right arm which is also at everything's the same except okay and now um show the right arm okay but now i just need to put it on the other side so that should be so this is left arm x right arm x a plus okay it's our snow pal and p5.js all right there is one more thing here that i would like to do so i want to take off the no loop which is going to cause some problems oh actually i love that that's not what i meant for it to happen but it is kind of awesome jazz hands it's a snow pal with jazz hands um can i give myself more room there we go and then the snow pal can also be quite a bit bigger okay now reduce the number of fractals of the arms it is not looking nice could this be made into a coding challenge probably um okay so now uh what do i want to do so let's go over i was actually going to fix this weird jitteriness and do something different with it but um i kind of like it all of a sudden um but we could try having yeah this might that's a little bit better i think um okay so now i am going to hit save by golly change this to snow pal and we are wrapping up today's live stream telethon fundraiser i'm getting to the end i should put a hat on it yeah you know i'll i'll improve it later because i gotta it's after one o'clock i gotta get going here um we're going to sing a few more songs on our way out today okay um thicker branches yeah i could see that i could see a good argument for that okay ooh jazz hands jazz branches jazz branches is exactly right that is definitely jazz branches now we are going to going to look into the magic of microphone input we are going to create a microphone variable i don't need this sketch anymore i'm going to add in this variable mic mic dot start you guys just want this computer that's it right or do you have activity for me to do a meeting okay i'm coming i'm coming i'm almost done give me a second i'm really wrapping up soon um okay mic dot start uh okay oh whoops uh mic equals p5 audio in you wanna play the drums okay now get mic level and let's just just for the sake of argument just to see if this is working um let me turn this let's close this hello oh yep hello i'm gonna turn off this auto refresh okay so now as i talk the background is getting brighter but that's not what i want to do pal show volume so what what is going to change in the whoops huh what oh background okay what is going to change when i sing okay i think the arms should certainly move everything should dance i don't know how uh how far i'm gonna be able to get here but let's see um i think i can probably add this into parts let's just take the volume as a parameter that gets passed into all of the show functions arm snowball button there okay so now let's just try arm for a second so what i was thinking of doing was for creating i mean i could use random seed i could have an array i think actually though it makes sense what if this is just zero yeah okay i've got it so the angle goes from zero to um shows volume branch volume branch gets the volume uh angle volume i don't like hello no no no no oh right what what happened number yeah yeah that's a number what did you get show oh is it undefined because i have to go into the snow pal the snow pal needs in its show function to receive the volume it's like probably just using a global variable would make more sense but i'm stubborn i'm going to pass it around to everything hello up yep yep yep yep okay why why still am i did it just like get some nothing like the first time i'm gonna i'm not gonna worry about that all right let's go to um here hello oh boy that's a little bit much hello hello hello why i understand why i'm not getting like a nice i mean it's kind of like before oh i i see i need to do this hello whoa this is so weird could have sworn what i was doing makes sense what have i done wrong right if i go back to i go back to this i don't remember what i had i guess it gave me a much wider range right that's kind of what i wanted um seemed like such a good idea what is the volume new one to 0.2 to 0.5 right forget the this dot so weird i guess the volume like i gotta look at what values i'm getting for volume oh these these numbers are tiny tiny numbers tiny numbers oh oh i see the problem i've gone insane and now i that volume has to keep going because i'm not using oh no wonder okay i see i'm not continuing to pass it of course okay um it happens a lot yeah okay all right uh i don't need to console log the volume anymore forget the this dot it happens a lot okay that was good now okay now we've got our jazz hands going this is so close so close to being done all right let's go to the mouth the mouth is not uh is a button i think we can just all right i'm gonna i'm just gonna uh this inheritance thing is kind of silly here but let's um let's do a offset uh let's quickly just see what all the buttons look like if they shake around what what it just happened here people oh i need another bracket i'm so tired okay okay pretty good okay okay i kind of only want to shake the um so i think that i'm gonna i'm gonna separate out the uh in the snow pal this is a little bit ridiculous what i'm doing here but buttons and then um these are these are the actual buttons the eye and the mouth are different so let's actually just say let's make a mouth separate a separate mouth array so that i can do this okay here we go finish okay so there it's all still working but i believe now if i don't want these now if i go to parts and here if this is uh if i map volume times 100 call this range uh now hello oh yeah okay only the mouth and the arms move they move quite a bit hello yay i'm singing sort of um and this hello i'm trying to make i was trying to make the um the size a little bit bigger too hello yeah there we go okay let the carrot also shake oh that's a good point i should be letting that carrot shake okay there's so much more that could be done here but i have to stop and i think also it's nice that the snow pal is a random size uh every time i start the sketch but um let's just make a larger one no are you serious how did that what did i do oh because there's this r uh whoa what oh no no this is what i'm trying to do there we go okay so it's always going to be this size and so much more could be done but i have to move on it's been a long long day and we have some more songs to sing so you know the funny thing is i would i had this idea that i was going to make a karaoke bouncing ball thing with the lyrics that'll have to come another time so i want to put this into the card but before i put it into the card let's just see if we can make this happen um okay let's put put you over here hello are you are you allowed to have my microphone please have my microphone you have my microphone okay we'll just leave this here um now where is our next what songs have i not done yet oh boy
