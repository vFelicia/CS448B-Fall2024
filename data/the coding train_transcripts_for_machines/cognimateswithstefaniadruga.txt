I think I hear us right now by the way all right I better walk over here uh hello everyone happy Friday good morning good evening good night I know it's all different times of the work times a day all over look there are Legos here today this is super exciting I attempted to just go and play with these Legos right now but I have to pay attention to you the viewer and talk about what's gonna happen on today's coding Train episode for funked required what's the word I'm looking for train whistles I think all right so I'm very excited today is a special livestream for today this Friday with a guest kind of rapidly put together at the last minute I will be back next week with continuing my word to vet to toriel's and other things but today we're going to talk about kids and AI and education if you are a teacher or if you or someone who has kids or work with kids are a part of a family which a lot of you are probably then this might be of interest to you so today's guest and I'm gonna in a minute check the chat picture this is actually working so I apologize if you can't hear me or something is going wrong I actually don't know about it but I will look in a minute but everything looks okay okay so today's guest is Stefania Duga she is a recent alum of the MIT Media Lab she is from Transylvania and she has created a project called cognate switch is a open source platform for an AI education so I could say so much more because there's so much more to say about Stefan and her background but rather she present that to you and the you can always of course check this video's description which there's not a lot there right now but after this live stream ends we'll add more links and by ode but there is I think a link at least you should to find this website and a tweet about the cognates project from from MIT in the description right now that you can click on so what's happening this is like one of my regular live streams and we're just going to be here for an hour or so stephania will show a variety of different things we might have to take a break to figure out some technical thing it will be informal I will be monitoring the chat so if you have questions you can ask them in the chat and then sort of when we're done this will be an archive that will in theory live forever how long YouTube lives for on the internet that you can watch and there also might be so we might we may try to like pull out some of the tutorial portions of today in two separate videos that we can upload either on the coding train or in a different platform that stephania would choose okay so I think that's all I have to say did I forget anything so I'm just gonna bring stuff right here there she is I'm gonna go and wander the chat if there's a really important question you can ask it I'll interrupt otherwise I'll mostly like keep track of questions for the end okay Frankie I'm gonna talk wer decide over here come over here thank you so much for the kind introduction I'm actually amazed because then pronounce my name correctly she never happens I was defined yeah nice to meet you I am just graduated from MIT Media Lab and during two years there I've been working on this project called cockney maids which is like a playmate and a learning mate and the goal of this platform which is opensource by the way is to teach AI to kids and allow kids to customize train their own AI models and teach like program smart devices they have in home and learn more about this technology so the overall mission and goal of this project is really to democratize like who gets to create with AI and you're gonna ask me why are you doing this and it's kind of crazy to teach a high scum placated machine learning is complicated why should we teach it to kids and I'm going to say that it is necessary because for the first time we have a generation that is growing up with this technology just like I grew up with the Internet in my small town in Transylvania and we have more than 47 million smart devices in homes right now that kids are talking to and when I started my my work at a media lab we did a lot of research to actually understand how do kids perceive these devices do they trust them do they want to learn from them do they want to program them and we published a lot of this research and then we figured out that actually a lot of the kids thought these devices like Alexa or I don't know go home are more intelligent than they are so we were like what if we give them tools to actually show them how they work and in that process they would learn how to demystify a little bit what artificial intelligence means and how smart are really this smart toys so we built this platform Cockney mates which is available online that's the link copy mates that I mean it's a research project some of the things I discovered while preparing the demo today don't work but some of things do work and it's open source so you can help me fix it it has it's building on scratch which was developed at MIT Media Lab as well and it's open source but we created an entire series of extensions specifically for AI education so when you load when you go to collimate the caca means that I mean you're gonna see this website let me make it a little bit bigger and then if you actually want to start programming straightaway and trying it you can click on this launch Cockney mates which will take you to the code lab and in the code lab on this plus button you can kind of see what are some of the extensions we created so anything from programming your Alexa if you have one at home to actually play with the camera your computer or tablet has to do color detection or just you know program a robot like Cosmo if you have one we wanted to provide extensions that are a lot of fun for kids and usually kids love Lego and we can do like like Lego we do as well but we also wanted to allow kids that don't have access to an Alexa or a Cosmo or a depo to be able to learn these skills as well so some of these extensions are just like webbased and others are also like for IOT and robotic platforms so before talking too much about this I can show you what are some of the things that we could do and on our website we have a collection of projects I'm gonna start with the first one which is like called make me happy and in this project if you click on on it you can download it download the starter project and then go to the code lab and upload it file upload and then let's see where did I put it and in here you will see what are like all the elements of this platform which as I mentioned it's building on scratch so on the left side you see what are all the blocks that we can use oh yeah I forgot to say that we the way we do coding and the way these platform works is by using this like blocks which is like visual programming language is called and it all builds on a block Li open source grammar from Google and it's very similar to Lego so just the way we plug and play with Lego we can plug and play with this blocks so the idea for the blocks is that you don't necessarily need to know how the syntax of programming language like JavaScript or Python but you can just read what's on the text of the block and start to create your program in here this is called like the stage in in the middle and then you can start to put them together and when they it's actually very satisfying when you put two blocks together you get a sound I don't know if you can hear it yeah you get that beep so on my left side I have all these different blocks let me see if I can zoom to show you yeah I cut I have like a library of different blocks that allow me to control my program in the middle I'm like the movie director I put these blocks together and I can start to create a story or a game or an animation and on the right side I have this output where right now you can see me and a character I am I don't know why that's the case but we'll figure it out I think we added too many extensions so right now what we're going to do is basically go through the steps of this project and I'm going to show it to you just the way I do it with kids so we have this character which is nari and nari is going to react to messages we're telling it so if we're telling nari like we're gonna start with something very very simple so then what should we tell that nari to make her happy like give me a phrase well I've determined would you like something to eat so right now we're going to go when we click the green stuff the green flag we're gonna have nari be thinking because she doesn't really know what we're gonna say yes first and then we have a block where she's asking us to tell her something and my answer I'm typing here is going to be would you like something to eat it's very thoughtful ya know it's very thoughtful we could do it like an entire chat pod and then let's see what happens when I click enter she should be happy and she is happy also if you want to have just the interaction we can make this bigger and and do it again but you know this kind of program only works if we say that specific phrase right would you like something to eat oh yes thank you eat I ate the letters because I would like some letter sweet yeah so this is like very limited in terms of like how much we can interact with nari what if we want to tell her all sorts of different things and make her react happy based on that so for that we actually made this other extension called feelings we used to call it sentiment and then we realize that kids don't know what sentiment is but they know what feelings are so that was interesting so we have this feeling extension and in here there is a block that it's saying what is the feeling of the text so in here I could just try it out let's see how this block works so if I would copy paste the example we just had in here and do we what do we think do we think this is going to be positive or negative or neutral what do people in the chat thing would you like something to eat is that positive or negative or neutral okay okay so usually like when I add a new block and I don't know what it does like I can just try it out so in this case I'm gonna try with a different phrase so I know for example that if I pour it awesome that should be positive so let me see if that works and yeah that says it's positive and if I say not great that's what happens then negative but if I say most people are positive okay okay next time okay so let's try it do you have a do you have a guess do you think it's positive negative or neutral neutral I'm gonna get a neutral true but let's see it's positive oh my god that means our library doesn't work very well no but it is like this is what we do with kids is like what do you think made it positive like what word and how can we probe that right so we see now that this block can actually pick up like sentiment of phrases we're typing or saying so in my program going back if I want nari to react to all sorts of things all sorts of messages I'm going to give her we can just go in here and instead of saying I want to see if the answer is a specific phrase I'm just going to always check what's the feeling of the different answers where we're getting and if that feeling is positive then I'm gonna make nari happy and if it's negative I'm gonna make her sad and you know this kind of conditional like all of these blocks we're using here it's already a bit complicated so sometimes when I start with kids I don't even start with this I just we have this block that is called a hat oh yeah I forgot to tell you that all of these blocks have names based on their functionality so this conditional I just use this is called pants because it has like you know looks like pants and then this other block here it's called a hat because that can trigger like an entire action so I could do this in many different ways like everything with code we can do it in many different ways so I could be when text is positive just make Mary happy and when text is negative make Neri sad or I could do it like with a conditional and the other cool thing with these blocks is that is very very fast to to remix so I can just duplicate that entire collection of blocks let me just make it a bit smaller so you can see so like this I can make nari react when it's positive oh I already have one else but I could also like right now we're only dealing with positive and negative we don't have anything with neutral so in that case we can say if the answer is neutral then there you should say something like oh I'm still thinking or we would make her still be thinking and I don't need an else here I can just do a simple if I'm improvising guys yeah I have a quick I have a question there's a lot of people are asking this in the chat so I thought it yeah we're clarifying yeah I'm seeing a lot of comments like oh this looks just like scratch or is this built off of scratch so can you can you explain and so can you explain the relationship between this and scratch and is this kind of like then if I was a scratch user I could bring this in as a library basically or how does that work yeah so scratch is waking right now on scratch 3.0 which is using nodejs and it's working on mobile any browser and the code is open source it's on github so we build on that code because a lot of the kids are very familiar with scratch blocks and they recognize it straightaway and they know how to play with it but then we build on top of it and created all of these different extensions unfortunately right now you cannot add this extensions on the scratch website you can only use them on the clock teammates website but hopefully in the future they will be added on the scratch like library of extensions as well if you are familiar with scratch and scratch extensions I actually published a few extensions on the previous version of scratch so if you go to scratch extort these are the oldschool extensions and you can see in here some of the extensions we've done for a I like the clarify which does image recognition and then there was another one for a robot and micro bit and so on the tricky thing with this is that it requires flash so it only works on a desktop and with the new 3.0 scratch which I believe it's coming out in officially in January but it's in beta you can also try it online then you already have this new nodejs implementation and this new kind of library of blocks I don't need that was a simple enough answer but the short answer is we are building on top of scratch you can't import these extensions yet in scratch but you can use them in carbamates for now awesome thank you yeah so let's go back to our program and see if this works so let's start from the beginning click the green flag and we can say nary anything so you if you want to give me a positive or negative or neutral all a boy and actually unmute my microphones they probably could hear me through your microphone but all the board is what I said okay so let's see how she reacts strike and I don't know what happened tell me something all aboard so she should be either happy or sad or neutral come on Mary work with us okay so let's try it here it's neutral oh I see oh yeah she does what we told her to do of course uh debugging by the way is the primary activity of f3 was on the coding tree yeah so we said if the feeling is neutral she's gonna be thinking and that's what she's doing so let's actually add something there so we know that this is neutral we could make her say something or we could make her play a sound let's make her play a pop if it's neutral so let's try again all aboard yep so that was neutral and now I want to try like something positive the coding train is fun let's see yeah and she's happy so with all of these things I just wanted to show like a very quick simple example but as you can see it's much more funny if we do it together so because I want you guys to give messages to nari what we're gonna do now and this is like where the majority of extensions and doing this inter platform like connecting everything makes a lot of sense and it allows us to play with many different parts of the web and the physical world so what we're gonna do now is we're gonna add another extension so instead of me giving Mary examples I'm gonna ask you guys to do that so for that we're gonna use on other extensions with wheatbelt which is the Twitter extension so instead of me typing here and doing typos I'm gonna let you do typos if you tweet to the coding train train we're going to analyze the feelings of your tweet and based on that McNary react so I'm just going to add it in here so instead of asking a question we're just going to put the tweets you guys are sending and actually because we want to see what the tweets are I'm also going to make her say the tweets so we see them on the school on the screen and let me find us a block alrighty so first she's gonna tell you to tell her something and then she's going to show what you guys are tweeting so I hope people are gonna start tweeting with the coding training yeah let's give it a try so to be clear they should tweet at the coding train or just a hashtag oh we could do both okay but for now I did it with the hat or with those like I'll do one first at least yeah I did one with at the coding train we can also do hashtag coffee mates afterwards or the coding drink okay I sent I sent one if people again like people won't yeah they'll be there about 30 seconds behind so stuff okay so that's right and I'm livestreaming come watch how is she reacting to that oh yeah it was neutral so she played a sound let me make her see that's so we should we can give her personality so if it's neutral she can say okay I like that and then if she's happy she can say that's awesome and if it's sad it's like oh no tell me something else all right so it's gonna be the same tweet I can also try to treat here hopefully someone else okay has tweeted okay I like that so this is the neutral one let me tweet from here oh there there are okay let's try it alright so let's see get the latest tweet from the coding training oh yeah I'm still getting I'm a live streaming maybe it's like a little bit of a lag is it getting the tweets that the from the coding train and not people at mentioning the coding train maybe yeah I think it should be people mentioning it but coding train because that's the that's the last tweet from the coding train which is I'm livestreaming okay we can test that very quickly at the coding train great go back here yeah I think it's only getting the ones from the coding training so let's do the hashtag that's my bad sorry guys if you can use the same tweet you had but use a hashtag instead of at so we're gonna try that instead and oh yeah this this works so actually if I just change the ad with a hashtag they should be seeing the tweets that you guys have sent so let's give it a try tell me something oh do you guys see what happened it was so fast that we couldn't see it so we need to add a wait time so we can actually read what you guys have tweeted laughs good it's hard I haven't done this in a while okay the coding train up oh wait we'll put more weight because one second is not enough to read it let's do two seconds it's good not to have it on for two yeah so far I'm watching everything is aok pretty nice audience in general tell me something TGIF think oh she likes that she's happy okay we are we getting a new one let's see it's the same one okay I'll try one last one let's try with a negative one just to see if it works so tasteful toasty tweeted I have very mixed feelings so hopefully that would be neutral oh yeah let's see if we get it that would actually be a very interesting example choo choo choo cocky meets rocks like that before are two nice examples thank you for playing along so this is kind of like how it works like you saw we started like with I don't know five blocks and then like initially just kind of give an example and make the character react to a specific phrase we we said like what would you like to eat and then we wanted to create a more natural like interaction like talk to nari the way you talk with a friend so for that we use the feelings extension so it can analyze the feelings of different messages that we would send and then we added the extension which makes it social like the Twitter extension allowing all of us to play this game together and you can imagine like doing this with kids is much more fun than trying to deal with the lag and all the other complications of life coding but the idea is that it opens up a world of possibilities and you so right now only a character on the screen reacting but when we have also like a lego robot reacting to what we're saying or cause more robot or things that are in the physical like a microbe it showing a heart you can imagine that the world becomes a playground and all of these things can be combined in many different ways now from our perspective or you know customization perspective if we play with this a little bit longer you're quickly going to see what are the limitations of these like feelings extension and then we're gonna start to think okay who trained this extension what kind of examples did they use why does it pick up why doesn't pick up sarcasm or why doesn't it pick up you know more like backhanded compliments and things like that so that comes like a natural transition and question for kids as they're playing along and poking with these things so we build like also on the clock we meet website you're gonna see these links or tji and if you click on it it's going to die oh wow that was so slow so so basically once they tried existing AI models it could be for vision or for text or for many other things then they can start to teach their own and maybe you know a child would one nary to laugh at his jokes or like get like a very specific insider Joe you know message that he's sending so he can go to the tji page over here and this is building on top of IBM Watson and it allows kids to create I did yes no problem so yeah the caca meet Studio built on top of IBM Watson and it allows kids to create their custom classifiers so if they don't want to use already pre trained model that exists online they can make their own with their own examples so in here we could do this make me happy project and start writing example is just like what kind of text I would like Mary to recognize as happy and what kind of text I would like Mary to recognize the sad or maybe I want to add another category where it's not neither happy or sad or neutral it's more like I don't know weird messages right I like weird stuff so we can kind of give much more nuance to instead of black and white and like cats and dogs or we can start to add our own examples and then once we have five examples for each of these categories click on the teach me button this will create a classifier then that we can use afterwards you know a copy mates game by adding this text extension so it's it's all like coming from like okay let's do the fastest thing that we could do so we can have a game or an interaction that it's fun and then like peel off the layers and start to understand what are some of the things like how can I influence how this works and how would I like to customize it and what would I like to create I had an example with vision as well but um I don't know how many more I'll try to show it quickly that one is using color tracking and we have one that is drawing and one that is playing a game I don't know which one I should show drawing or like right now that you mentioned you might have to show both okay okay if people will want to see the other one now that's true okay so save the falling again you guys try this at home there on the website and this one what it does is that it's using the color tracking extension which allows us to basically pick any color we want to track so what's happening here is that if I start the game you're gonna see like these guys are like falling we have it's from that expression of it's raining cats and dogs it's quite literal and I'm tracking the color red so technically when I'm showing red I can start saving them so it shouldn't be falling anymore before I was working so it's not saving them so that means I need to change my red that I'm tracking so it's probably a little bit darker and if I want to have like a precise color peeking we're going to make the video not be transparent so we can actually see the full color and then we can actually go in the video stream and pick the color that we want to track so if I click in here I have this color picker so I can say track this kind of red so normally hopefully I'm saving them so if I'm not showing that red they're falling and it's sad and then when I'm showing the color they're like so going back so yeah that's kind of like saved a falling how to save the following game works and then you could do it like also with ping pong or multiple colors like where multiple objects and maybe you want to do something like oh when I'm wearing this color I want music or things in my house to start in a specific way so we did a project I will show it to you here very quickly where I keep on talking about physical things which I couldn't bring with me today to show hopefully in future demos but this is what it looks like when instead of having only is happening on the screen you have things happening in the real world so this is a project where an entire room is reacting to how you describe your dreams I had a dream that I was in a magical forest we get the bubble machines and beautiful colors and like beautiful music so she is just describing what kind of dreams she had those get analyzed with feeling extension and then things start reacting to it but if we don't want to talk and we're just wearing a specific color things can't react to that as well yeah this is showing how we can program Alexa and let me quickly go back to the other one with the drawing let's see if I have it call our drawing many things are gonna change also like you see right now I'm like AB loading and downloading in the future we're gonna have a link where you just click on it and you would load the project automatically this is tracking green which is all behind me let's see if that works yeah so when the extension sees the color that we're tracking this little guy will start drawing so let's go back to our red over here and we're gonna try it and then start the project so he's just floating around that drawing and if I show him red he's gonna start drawing on the screen and we can make him play music as well or I don't know maybe just only draw with the color that he's sensing and things like that so I just wanted to show examples of like how we could play with vision and with text and create interactive projects because I think like the biggest thing like if we talk about what two kids after scratch right we're after coding if you have an Alexa at home or if you use Yui or it's a very different paradigm I think for for everyone and especially for kids is you start to understand the it's coding is not just a set of instructions that you're sending to this devices you start to understand that especially with AI and machine learning in the in the loop you have more of a conversation so the more you talk to Alexa the better it should become recognizing what you're saying we're picking up your accent or personalizing the answers and I think in the future like the reason it is important to teach this to young people it's because they need to understand this fundamental paradigm shift of going from just sending a set of instructions like making a recipe for a pie to actually understanding how a feedback loop works what if like for nari to make nari happy we made this game right and I keep on giving her examples but then Dan starts giving other examples because what makes them happy and what makes me happy might be different how do we negotiate that right and how do we become more aware of what we share and where and how is that being used so I think these are all part of the underlying concepts and goals of trying to provide these playful tools that would allow kids to get a better understanding of how these technologies work and yeah and that's what we're trying to do with cocky mates and there's lots of resources I actually just published a blog post about the project as well and you can hear maybe well well I don't know if you have any questions but I wanted to quickly show how kids explain it because I think they do a much better job than I do so here's what a I looks like for sevenyearold let's see I'm gonna skip through the part of the video where I'm talking over here this is on YouTube it's called kids teach AI a little humanity would calculate and let's see what they have to say about it who decides how its applied to benefit society we show children how a robot sees the world how does it learn to recognize objects how does it know to recognize words for you a potato we also allow them to be able to teach a robot or a computer I'm gonna give you ten examples of images and then you're gonna learn what a gesture is so every interaction you have with it it's kind of like a conversation so you are having this learning companion discarding me that is learning with you and teaching you at the same time so we were programming robots you could play rock paper scissors you did rock paper scissors into the camera and on shoot you did one of the motions and the camera did one of the motions it's like rock paper scissors shoot the computer gets like better as you play the game cuz like that we might not know everything at first but if we keep trying we get better everyone has heard about like machine based learning or artificial intelligence and there was a certain no questions asked for a lot of the more techsavvy parents as I could go for it technology is gonna be a huge part of their lives much more so than my life if it's scary for some people this AI technology I totally get it but as a parent and as a teacher I thought it was really important because these are skills that 21st century kids need to have when they understand this idea of a feedback loop that the more information you give to a machine or a robot the better it becomes Neela how smart are you it really allows them to understand how machine learning in AI is different than just coding so I think this is a very powerful paradigm for children so they understand that when they have an Alexa at home or smart assistant everything they do the way they talk to it gets fed into the algorithm so the machine is actually reacting to them right now we don't have basic AI literacy we don't know what k12 AI education should look like so we have the opportunity to really shape that at the Media Lab we believe that should be done in a handson way children should work as part of groups in community they should be able to share ideas and they should feel empowered by tools that allow them to build real projects that matter to them well my dad was young he bought a car and take apart let's see how it work so you teach people's that young how these things that grownups mostly program how it works yeah so basically AI for kids it's like the cars of their generation and if a sevenyearold can see that hopefully we can all to see that I won't stop here with it yeah I do have some questions so I can come slide around the other side of you actually so I'm curious that to me that quote is so kind of amazing and so wise of this sevenyearold sort of like think of that that just came right from that that boy just sort of thought of that so we asked them like why do you think so I should mention that that video was made a month after doing workshop school right so it wasn't like they just didn't yeah it was like actually what they remembered after one month right when we went back and the Jimmy who did the video with me from who's the videographer from Media Lab was like why do you think you're doing this like why did why does it matter and he came back to us with that quote about cars like how his dad took apart a car yeah and that it surprised him that you teach people so young how these technologies work right and from you know it's so profound because I think a lot of times we kind of like because we are product of a system of education yeah we kind of limit what a child could learn at a specific age right winning actuality we see it like you see it with your kids and I say kids that I'm working it's like they learn it's such an interesting problem too because with a car it's a physical thing taking it apart means physically manipulating the metal the wires the pieces and a computer you could say the same thing oh learn how an Arduino works or a micro troller learn to light up an LED is in a way that aspect but with a machine learning algorithm you know what is taking depart me you know ultimately if you look if you think about like a neural network and you look at taking that apart well it's just a whole bunch of numbers and how do you unpack you know well and I think in many ways maybe what it is is taking it apart is like looking at the data kind of understanding what the data is and and watching it break I think is the only way to understand lock how why how it works or why it works because when it when it just works then it feels like magic breaks you can understand why did it break now I understand how it works a little bit absolutely and too quickly and on that I think you know when I showed the teaching AI to Google engineers they were like this is not they're not doing the model they're just adding the data they're controlling the weights and how many right layers and I'm like this is and I'm like you're right that's the next and it's like it is like a very good question he's like what primitives and what we tinker with right and I would tell you that especially for kids like this idea of a cockney made it's much more profound that I have a character on screen or it's like you are we are creating embodiments and stories that kids can relate to and we saw that in the data because like I've been doing research with 450 kids long term like six weeks in schools and community centers and and when they talk about what they learn he's like yeah it's like that project with the robot when you teach it to be out like this and this is how it works but they are creating this embodiment of what does it mean to learn how to recognize what's in a picture right and I agree I think it's like a really it's a new question an interesting question you know if you'll if you try to look sort of like a Google AI education you know this was like seminal course might be like and Andrew Ames Coursera actually learning course where you're starting from you know linear regression and so what are other and no that's amazing and fundamental and really meaningful and important but is that the appropriate entry point for every context probably not and so what are the other context what are the kinds of reasons why and how and that people kids or adults might want to learn about machine learning and so one of the things that I love about this especially it really relates to like the program ITP where I teach is this kind of I think the core concept or values like learning through play and so you know how and you know and I think so like how what kind of toys can you build what kind of like games can kids play and I think that's like fundamental and really exciting about this work and the confusion part you know I was very cool so like I learned so much from doing business school it's like they always do things that I never expect so they would train a classifier with images and they were like okay we want to distinguish Kirby's of course that's very important from dogs it's like but now we want to confuse it can be fine like hooker be that looks like a dog or can we put a dog with sunglass and like them going through this process of like how can we confuse that AI and like having fun with it and at the same time like discovering like what are the boundary is right and what can this do and what can it not do or how do I teach it and I think that's amazing and I want to have provide more opportunities for kids to because when we start to go and tell them like have you guys heard about AI and selfdriving cars and the kid would say like that's boring driving a car it's fun yeah we need to start from your interest and what they love cool so I do have a bunch of questions I might have missed by the way cuz I was listening intently might have missed some of your questions if anybody is in the slack Channel and there was an interesting question could also tag me and I'll catch that more easily but some of the questions I have is and let me let me actually ask this one because I think it's a sort of key one so is there a specific and this comes from George Dow um it's there and I'm rephrasing the question but is there a specific target age that your let that cognate is designed for and kind of like what are the sort of limits of that like I mean I can imagine like you know me I could play with it I would have fun I'm 45 but you know what it was your sort of target audience there and what has been successful with different ages that you found yeah so I say my tesis and all the research is online we could put links in the description descriptions and we published a lot of papers it is for kids of six and a half to fourteen but we are expanding that so creating a bit more advanced features for high schoolers and a bit more simplified features for younger kids but right now like the core of the research was with kids in that age group and their parents and teachers as well so we did a lot of teacher training and we did workshops where we would invite the parents as well because it's so important we realized I should I should mention this was like one of the things that surprised me the most like in this workshops oh yeah and I put some drawings of how very young kids describe like signing it's like Dora the Explorer and the dots connect what I think I like so record sound coded what happens but yeah we basically videotaped everything that kids were doing like we wanted to go past this novelty effect because if you go to a child with a construction kit or robot or of course you know they're amazed and everything is like the wow effect in the beginning but if we go to schools actually like three or four times per week for six weeks then we can really start to see what happens when the novelty of technology wears off how much can we engage these kids and how far they gonna go because the measure of success for me in terms of learning is not only that they know what model is or how you know sentiment analysis works or how computer vision works but it's also like a diversity of projects that they would create and how to use this like tools and concepts to actually build the world around them so we are like a measure of success it's not only like oh I have the definition of this it's more like are they building like very different projects are they tinkering with this are they playing with this are they you know breaking this so going to schools we videotaped everything that kids were doing then we coded we did like logistical regression we coded to see what were the factors that matter the most in them understanding these concepts and changing their perception right to become a bit more skeptical and more critical and the number one factor that mattered most was collaboration and it was significantly more impactful than at the time they would spend coding or the prior experience they had or it was like how much they would talk with their peers and like how they would like basically develop their ideas in like arguing or saying no I think it does this or like I actually think it's not like gonna remember you because so it was fascinating that and and I do think it's so important to design for collaboration and for jobs and in that context the conversations kids will have with their parents at home matter a lot yeah cool ok so if I ask that question Oh another question which I guess is sort of a quick one maybe in a way which is that does any of the stuff that you're working on with cognates is it just design for mobile devices smart phones or is it all needs to be done from like the browser desktop so it can be used its perspective so it's no js' it's in the browser right now we don't have specific apps when you say it's no Jess I'm just not I'm just curious does that mean so the servers and is is running node so as the client is doing stuff it's like sending the data to the server then it gives the results back so that sentiment analysis that it's doing is actually happening on the server which is interesting to think about the possibilities that you could also have it happen on the client now with the tensorflow Jas and some of the other stuff that working on here ITP with the ml 5 libraries one big limitation of the current implementation is that you need to have a WiFi connection right and in a lot of schools right now face that's not always available so we want kids to train their models with text or images but then be able to download them and use them locally so that's something I'm working on right now is like how do we use these models with tensorflow light and other implementations locally and for the mobile part we're also talking to App Inventor to port some of these extensions in that inventor and if you have ideas like Oliver Cody's online yes actually somebody did ask like where is the github repo maybe the point people search coffee meets on github it's the first result it's all there I can also show it here do you have specific kinds of contributions that you're looking for like missing pieces are there like fix the bugs and build new extensions because like some of the cool stuff we've done more for art and creativity with style transfer so we made an extension for style transfer for images and for audio it's not published yet because it's very heavy in the background yes like it can't be done now in the browser so we have a meaning she who did it just recently a guest video all about that the training has to happen separately but once you have the model yeah you can use it yeah so new extensions like actually the simplest way if you are a developer and you want to contribute is to go to the coffee mates VM it's where all the meat is we have the GUI which is like the interface but the VM is like we're all but you might have to make that a little bigger for people yes so the link and I'm totally standing in front of it but yeah me too actually we can do whoops how do i yes there you go so if you go to github Media Lab carbamates VM and then in here all the extensions are in their own dedicated folder so if you start with the one that I showed you today like the sentiment it's basically one javascript file and each of the blocks is fine like we define like what the what type of block we're using is it a hat or is it a reporter and then each of those blocks is basically calling a JavaScript function that in this particular case I'm using this NPM this node library called sentiment here and it's like basically going to that librarian saying like look at this string if the feeling is positive return true and in the feeling it's like very very like very simple so even with this extension maybe you want to add another block or maybe you want to change the language or maybe you want to actually play with the scores that we're using here right and it's like oh you know that example you had oh yeah the one with the food would you like something to eat that wasn't neutral right it was positive like what can we do two more maybe we actually allow the kids to play with the score right so yeah and if this I'm just gonna put the video back because people always complete but it's gone for too long that complaint is the wrong word they'd like to see it's very nice this is super interesting I like seeing this now like peeling back the curtain I realized that how amazing this is in terms of repo just if for somebody who is working on some machine learning algorithm to be able to have that running in JavaScript to be able to just suddenly have this other frontend to it that a kid could access and you know one of the things I'm I don't know I'm not sure if this is that the node package I'm thinking of but the one that I've looked at quickly but I think that it might be the same as using this like that a fin 111 list which is a familiar it's a big long list of words that a group of researchers decided gave weights to positive and negative scores and one of the things that I have done with my students here there's a build a little example where you could change all those weights and add your own words and so that would be like you know Jimmy and that could be a signature that could that you know you could imagine the same way of that you're showing kids that they can do the image train an image classifier does that I'm and so that I'm also wondering is the image classifier stuff is that also an example of what you're doing it's like transfer learning so it's already starting with a pre train model that transfer time yes when you're working with kids they're not going to have the patience to wait for an hour right well also you won't necessarily have a data set that's large enough toward it but it's still conceptually they're going to learn about all the vocabulary and the steps and it's very in line with like the teachable machines projects and Google and the stuff that we're doing with ml5 so I I didn't I knew there were connections here but there's even more one of the things that I'm thinking a lot about now is like what are the experiences and play patterns and you know what Katti batti is that kids could do it in mobile that they couldn't do it a lot and we were talking about this it's like your phone already has so many sensors it's crazy and where we have it with us in our pocket all the time so it's like what if I make a game where he's like tracking if I'm sitting too long in one place and he's gonna start like vibrating but like I build that with blocks right or if I'm teaching it like I want you to recognize that this is my pattern of what I do when I go to ITP right and tweet this and whatever or just with gestures kids love like with micro beta does it has an accelerometer and they love to again this Packard was describing this as body synchronicity and it's actually fascinating like how complex how much kids could solve complex problems if they can project it to their body so if I need to like code and algorithm where I tell a robot to draw square if I pretend I'm the robot and I think like what do I need to do to draw the square it's so logical and it's obvious so how do we bring that experience to other concepts right yeah that was a long no no no you're fine right this whole channel is me just talking too much so there's nobody else to say anything with us here so there is another question which I did grab which is a little bit offtopic but since you're here and I know the MIT Media Lab is its own thing and the MIT is a huge University but someone did ask I'm interested in attending MIT as a fresh freshman I was wondering if you could ask her about time there any tips for someone so you have any tips or thoughts about like the experience of going you know as a student from another country and coming to MIT what was your experience like in a minute or two maybe this is too big of a question to demystify what it means to go to a place like Media Lab or NYU or and I think a lot of the times I would look to the project that were coming from there and I was like oh my god like I would never you know be able to work on this or get there and seeing people's pathways and demystifying that it's been very helpful so whoops what we we made it to an hour we did it's so it's a long story I could explain to after because I talked about it incessant Leon someday I'm gonna fix it or get a different camera but at this point it's just like I'm so used to it being there it's like a ritual right so I wrote a blog post about this and I'll share it but I will I will tell you that I think in my case what really helped is that if you work on something that you're passionate about you are going to do your best work and then also be playful about it and be open about it like and it starts very early it actually starts extremely early the reason I'm doing this with kids is because I realized like when I grew up in my small village in Pennsylvania we didn't I didn't have access to all these things I had to learn it much later in life I'm 32 now and you know to get there like I had to go through so many filters like first generation to be able to study abroad and first gen'l'men get scholarship here work at night here like a lot of the things where it's like if you enjoy what you're doing and you're playing with it and you're having fun then you are going to do it for a long time and you will eventually get where you want to get and I think if there's one thing that defines MIT for me is that all the students and people I met there are extremely passionate about what they do and they are driven by learning because you never stop learning like that's the other thing that I think especially in this day and age we talk about kids but it's actually everyone like we never stop learning so I know this is very broad I'm happy to talk to you it's a good answer so well obviously we'll put this in the video description once later and anybody watching this later will see it but just cuz you mentioned the blog post a few times can you point people to that URL right now for watching and actually I can paste it into the chat so while you're pulling it up I will also pull it on yeah so this was just published so if you google kids teach AI a little humanity it's on medium and I should have made a short link it's no problem cuz I'm gonna paste it into the chat yeah so it's a medium we go great yep it's a bit long but um thank you 14 minutes to read I think you can read for 40 minutes and if you manage to watch this video for an hour it has stories of an astronaut in there so yeah certainly one thing I'm really curious about next time this was an interesting it not an experiment really but this was a little bit different than the usual content in that I don't have an audience that I know of there's a couple younger kids that I've heard from who do actually watch some of the tutorials I have but most of the audience I'm is you know adults or high school or college or or beyond so but I'm kind of curious are there any parents out there with kids are there any teachers out there who are thinking about how to integrate technology in the classroom and topics like AI and how to discuss those things and so definitely get in touch leave a comment or on Twitter if you're thinking about using cognates or if you're an opensource enthusiast for sure know a lot of you are and it did contributing could certainly leave a comment or get in touch and I think it will make sense well sort of like look at this after because I you know an hour is a nice round number for a video from we probably couldn't could like get all this material but we'll see if it makes sense to kind of also just break it out like some of this code examples you're sure day you showed us like a short tutorial that could be a standalone video as well so anybody's any feedback or suggestions about that I will hear from Matthew who does video editing for the coding trainees not able to watch live today but he'll he'll watch it later and I used to get really good feedback from him so I think you know for me it's like it's been quite a learning journey to let go and be like this is not perfect but we're building it together so I look forward to see what you're gonna be doing with cockney mates and yeah I also look forward to hear from your feedback and this is just the beginning it's it's fun I yeah awesome thank you so much for being here and let's see so I'm this stream it's going to shut off when I press this button over here that turns it off I actually have a little bit more time than maybe I thought I did so I might come back in a little bit for just like a short I'll do some short coding thing try to do that once a week and then I will be back again next week with your regularly scheduled program this is a very strange life that I have now that I'm always in a room talking by myself to a camera it's nice that you're here with me at least today okay so thank you for all of your questions I'm really sorry if I missed anyone's question in the chat still learning how to figure out how to make all this stuff work and I will see you all soon good bye and I said it wasn't the kids Channel wait I have to find the place this is the awkward thing this is no we're not this is actually live day we're still on until I hit this button and also after I hit this button it sometimes actually still streams like a it's about thirty seconds so happy now we're really leaving bye
