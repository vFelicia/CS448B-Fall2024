okay I'm back by the way in between the last video in this one suggestion came in in the chat to say like oh you know be easier if you just had a bunch of buttons so like I could just click whichever button yeah I think the color is so if this is like ah its greenish to me I'm gonna refresh oh that's also greenish that's purplish that's blueish right so I just click the button and it submits and actually probably when I hit but I do that I can have it then pick a new color so what I need to do is now is send the send the color to firebase alright so I'm now logged in to some arbitrary Google accounts called coding rainbow live and I'm going to add a project and I'm going to call this color classification and I'm gonna accept all sorts of and agree to all sorts of things I'm gonna hit create project I'm gonna wait for it to do its thing okay continue a new Frederick's is ready alright really get started ah yes add firebase to your web app perfect okay so what I need is this stuff so let me grab this and go to index of HTML and and by the way there are so many things that could be done to improve the interface here and I should probably work on an HTML and add CSS and all that stuff that's not the focus of this video so I don't at me is what I'm supposed to say but you should at me though I'm okay with being acted at at act act at will just be nice be nice alright so I'm gonna add this stuff so I'm gonna add this script tag for firebase and I'm actually just going to take this and I'm gonna put this in in my peace with my p5 code I'm just gonna actually just do this at the beginning of setup okay so now I'm connected to firebase I don't know let's let's see what happens hit refresh yeah it's not telling me anything but should be good yeah it's something's happening here okay great now I need to by the way I need this send data to go with all these buttons so I should be able to say buttons dot length and I should just be able to say buttons dot mouse press a buttons index i dot mouse pressed send data so this is the assigning this send data event to every single one of those buttons and guess what right here I'm gonna just say console.log this dot HTML so by the way so when you use the p5 mousepressed function and give it an event that event is bound to the Dom element upon which it was called and referenced in the keyword this so and then HTML is the text of the button so this should if I do this we can see whatever button I click I get the label in the console that's good so now I need to send the data to firebase so gonna tell me how to do that here okay so I could start to look at the firebase documentation but I'm gonna and you know I could go back and watch my firebase tutorials because I completely forgotten how to use it but I do have one of my examples and this example here has some code in it which send to firebase so and it's actually quite easy for me to do this I just want to need to create a reference database I'm gonna call it like colors or something I need to put some data in it so let me grab all this code here and I'm gonna grab this code and I'm going to put it I'll link to that particular example as well I'm gonna just put it in here I'm gonna use let and I'm not my example that I made before the firebase tutorial is about fruits but I'm gonna do a color I'm gonna say color label of the databases color database and I'm going to call it colors the data that I want to send is has an R and that is and I need these then to be global variables if I want to be able to access them so so I'm gonna make these global variables and give them an initial value I'm actually going to put this though in a function called pick color I think that'll make everything nicer I'm gonna say function a pick color and then I'm going to create an object with oh I could use that what's that thing called and es6 now where I could just make the object if I want the R value to be are the G value to be G there's a way to do that the B value to be B and then I want the label to be this dot html' so this is the object this is what I want to send to firebase the red green and blue value and the label so then I'm just going to say let the particular color be the color database push push that data and when it's finished oh it's going to give me this like key which is interesting to see because everything has this unique every record in a database has a unique ID so I could look at that just to see if it's right and I can have this callback finished something went wrong I could you use console dot error or data save successfully and let's see so let's let's do console dot log saving saving data and then also log the data and let's see what happens okay so now I'm going to go back to here and that that to me is pinkish and oppressed pinkish database is not defined oh yeah line 49 Oh firebase initialized so what did I not do that I did in this particular example when I initialized it oh did I create I have to create a database object so I have to create a database object from after I initialize firebase so let's go and do that that's a step that I missed and I mean that's going to be a global variable called database now I'm gonna run this again that looks very greenish to me and saving this data 5220 665 with this label it generated a key but permission denied so now what I need to do is do something to allow myself to write to the database I'm gonna do something not so great but I'm gonna do it anyway so I need to change the permissions that are in my firebase project so how come I've lost where that is probably understeer project settings color classification where is it users and permissions now I have to be thoughtful and think about like the privacy and security of the data which is a really important point but again in this sort of like thing that I'm just working on and try to just get to the finish line here and with a trivial data set I'm going to at least just sort of open up and make make the data base easily writable without a lot of security rules so let's see so I need to go to firebase and I need to go to your two database and actually I don't even have a real time database available yet so I need to do gets to heart hid and then look at this so make your database private by denying all reads and writes which is something that you really that that in many cases you're gonna want to do start in test mode anyone with your database reference will be able to read and write to your database I'm gonna hit an able I am gonna add one more thing to the I am gonna add one more thing to the rules so and thank you to me I am so me from the chat I can add in a rule for color data I'm gonna add another rule and let me zoom in here so you can see what I'm doing I what I want to do is I don't want to let somebody overwrite somebody else's entry that they already put in and so if I say dollar sign entry and then I set the write the dot write property to not data exists and again you can look through the documentation to see all the different things let's see does this is this right here I think I've got this right color data open bracket close bracket dollar sign entry open bracket close bracket dot write not data exists this should hopefully give me a little bit more protection I'm gonna hit publish and now click back to database Oh get started where is it well maybe I have a good I haven't written any data yet let's now run this again what is that that's kind of brownish I guess there we go looks like it's saved the data successfully and let's go now back to here and see what we got there we go colors and here it is there's my first data point I could go and add a bunch more reddish Oh what I wanted to do is then also have it pick a new color so as soon as it finishes data saved successfully let's say pick color and we'll get a new one right because it's going to pick color pick color should also draw the color so that's greenish greenish bluish bluish greenish purplish greenish oops oh I messed up but that's okay reddish greenish okay so I think we're done this is finished I'm going to put this somewhere on the internet maybe clean it up and add some interface stuff to it just here we can quickly see we can quickly see my data set these are all the things that are ventured so far with the RGB values and a label okay so now what I'm going to do between now and the next video is I'm gonna let this live for a bit try to collect the data I might have to clean the data a bit which I'll talk about put it into a spreadsheet figure out what I want to do with it but but and then I'll see you in the next video and I'll start to work on building the machine learning model to actually train the model based on this data okay thanks for watching and I'll see you soon you
