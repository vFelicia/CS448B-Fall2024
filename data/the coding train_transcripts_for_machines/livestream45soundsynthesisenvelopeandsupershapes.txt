hello good morning welcome toing rainbow with me now uh I'm here again live streaming I hope this is working and before I get started I just want to kind of like like awkwardly bouncing um can you hear my voice this time can you hear the music also and is the balance between those two things okay please let me know in the chat um so welcome uh my name is Dan I'm here again this morning at the school for poetic computation here in the West Village of New York City I think I'm going to stop the music um and I'm broadcasting live uh to do a coding tutorials and other goofy embarrassing weird things that I can think of or not think of to do today um so uh if you happen to be watching this as an archive on YouTube I recommend that you check the video description uh where you will find uh time codes to where various things happen during the course of this video also whatever happens in this one to two hours that I'm here live streaming um video tutorials will get edited out of this content as separate videos so if you're watching if you're sitting here watching and looking at this there's this 2hour video I can't possibly stomach this uh you can turn this off and go outside and uh uh have a bike ride or um a nice um you know piece of fruit and enjoy the sunshine if there's Sunshine where you live or you can also if you wanted to watch something on YouTube you could look for the edited videos in my YouTube channel so I'm going to take a look at the chat balance is good everything sounds great awesome um so let me talk a little bit about what I am planning to do today so I have been um doing a series U I've been doing many different series but most recently I've been doing a series about working with sound a uh working with sound and programming and coding and in particular in JavaScript in the browser excuse me using the p5g Sound Library so I'm going to continue that today I was very lucky to have a uh viewer contributor colleague friend internet social media person that I have been in contact with who created this wonderful uh website in GitHub repository I'm showing you the link right here it's sfx doxyz arof far of st.ca uh created this sound effects repository um and there are all sorts of fun my goodness that one's actually not scary but uh a little free and open open source in away sound effects you can use and I can say to you hello and welcome to with me power um and uh anyway so you I got lost in my own thoughts of playing with these sound effects so uh at some point soon by the way I'm planning to set up a whole separate soundboard that I can just like press buttons on and play so if you have any fun sound effects you think I should use during these live broadcasts please uh make them and send them to me they can even be bastardization of my own voice uh messed up or whatever okay um so but anyway the I'm showing this to you but what I'm very excited about doing today in this particular live stream is actually putting this away because what I want to do today is talk about sound synthesis how to make sound from nothing so here's a way you could do sound synthesis and you can see why I'm here doing tutorials about coding because really all I wanted to do was be in the musical theater but I I I can't sing I try I could sort of play the piano rather poorly I played violin for a while I love you know Musical theat theater it's one of my favorite things someday I'll find a way to bring this all together uh which is maybe today but uh um anyway sound synthesis that's a thing that you do with your your voice and you make your vocal cords vibrate and it makes the air vibrate and there's this sort of wave that's a vibration I want to talk about how that works as much as I can possibly understand it in my own head uh and look at code examples to make that happen in code in which case you could program an interactive piano something that uses you know some mathema I algorithm to play a tune all sorts of exciting possibilities so that's one thing I want to look at today uh another thing I want to look at today I think is to continue um my I've been doing a bunch of different coding challenges generally about topics in maths um I since I have an international audience I feel like I'm allowed to say maths because that's how I like to say it um and uh all this kind of stuff looks quite scary and you know gut uh it just looks scary and like uncomfortable but um I'm here to do more videos about them to make the these maths Concepts friendly hopefully um and uh what was I going to say ah yeah so I I did something about something called the super ellipse and I said after the Super ellipse I would do something called the super shape which is this formula and after that I would even try to do uh super shape in 3D so I'm building slowly carefully with some neurotic tritation towards seeing if I can make this stuff in processing um but uh today I hope to get to this particular formula and what it makes and how you program it um so uh I'm looking at the chat and so far there's one vote for maths excellent I agree it's the correct way I spent uh one uh almost one year living in England and uh uh um had a wonderful time there so welcome to all you UK uh visitors viewers invite me invite me to come visit your fine country I would love to come again uh uh okay so what was I doing ah so let's let me so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a momentary break from just kind of talking and uh I'm going to dance because this helps me clear my head and get some energy going my moves were much better last time um and what I'm going to do is I'm going to start getting set up so uh I need the Adam editor and open that up um I uh I'm going to close this move this project sorry I've got a bunch of random things open that I don't need to have open uh this I do want to have open and what I'm looking for on the desktop here is p5js sound so I'm going to just copy this play song and I'm going to to call this sound synthesis 01 and I want that to be open in atom that didn't work uh okay great and I'm going to close these uh I don't need this uh file anymore uh move to trash I'm going to go here I'm going to get rid of everything in this sketch to start from scratch I really should do this before I turn on the video and then uh this is my I'm can keep this open this is for later I think I can close these and remember them oh oh oh I forgot to mention uh if you're interested this is my uh if you're interested in more you can go to coding rainbow.com there there are buttons for you to sub subscribe on YouTube uh I also am running this thing called a patreon where you can subscribe to participate in a slack Channel where a bunch of us discuss and answer questions um H about the channel uh here's my most recent video which was about the Julia set and uh oh you can also if you want to know when I'm doing live streams you can uh put in your email here I you know I send out emails every once in a while giving you an update about the next time for the next live broadcast okay so I wanted to mention that I can close this tab I can close this tab and uh now I need to go to Local Host ah so I need to run my server come on uh terminal and go back to Local Host and I'm looking at um okay uh come on where am I there I am now let me run my server and sound synthesis okay we're in good shape um one thing I want to do is make sure I'm using the most recent version of P5 uh so I'm just going to check also o March 4th no this is this is distinctly not the most recent version um so let me update that uh apologies for doing my setup during the live broadcast but uh so I'm just going to yeah this is the version I want to be using by the way 0.5 this is the version at least I'm using today 0.5.2 as of June SE whoa that's today there's a new version as of today it never happens that's very exciting good thing I check so let me download that uh and now I'm going to grab uh this libraries folder and I'm going to go to my sound thing that I'm working on and paste that in there and hit replace close all this stuff stuff out refresh it's still running go to Adam and we should see uh I think I crashed things by I don't know what I did but let's force quit Adam and come on force quit there we go and uh now I am going to uh ah Oliver is asking did I record to dis yes I have ooh new there's a new instagam API I'm looking at the chat uh yes so a couple things uh I didn't know that there's a new Instagram API I all my examples that work with the Instagram API I'm using like a really old Instagram API the reason I'm using that one is because it doesn't require o off which is this like oh I I forgot I have a new thing to talk about okay I'm gonna get to that in a second what do I look at all my file okay hold on you guys in the chat getting are making me all crazy yes I am recording to dis um I am recording recording to dis I am 10 minutes in recording to dis yes um okay so hold on time out time out time out okay so first let me just get back to where I was I want to uh I want to have this sound synthesis example open and you know what I'd rather actually just open this full directory into Adam uh where's seriously Adam is not a thing here that I can just drag to what is what is what is this world coming to uh oh it actually even opened okay June 17th ex excellent okay now there's my sketch okay I have something to talk about okay couple things one is the reason why this I was reminded of this is that um okay so somebody asked uh in the chat I don't remember who whom Who ah I was doing so well I got panicked okay somebody asked uh um somebody asked about uh Instagram API so I do have some examples and I'm actually going to show you where these where one of these I have't probably in a variety of places I probably even have them in the coding rainbow code repository but I'm going to go somewhere else I'm going to Google something called programming from A to Z uh shiftman see what this gives me um okay I'm looking for boy the actual correct link that I'm looking for shows up nowhere in Google which is a bit of a problem but this this will do right now I'm going to look for this particular GitHub repository shiftman toz F15 I'm really getting sidetracked here but uh I have a point to this now I'm also going to since I know what the URL is I'm going to go to shift. github.io toz F15 so here is a website and you can see this site holds my notes and examples for the ITP fall 2015 course programming from A to Z this is a course about programming in JavaScript and programming with text so it's all about what happens when we do when we the people who are doing doing the programming when I when you uh think about creative applications of text essentially possibly even without Graphics this could be this could for example a a piece of this might be sentiment analysis I'm going to read this speech by a politician and try to determine whether it was a positive or negative speech this could be about generating poetry uh through algorithmic ideas uh analyzing and and analyzing and generating text in Creative algorithmic procedural ways using JavaScript that's the core idea of the course so one of the pieces of the course is working with apis so that's here under week four and here there is uh an example for working with the Instagram API so I'm curious I wouldn't be surprised if this example is broken right now let's just see so I'm going to click on this and I it's got the Tor term generative in there I'm going to click search see what happens in the console okay so it didn't work so I have a feeling based on uh what was written in the chat that the Instagram API changed I was actually using a very old Instagram API that didn't require this kind of un awful uh server side uh authentication called OA so I need to look into this but the reason why and and possibly do a new tutorial about it the reason why this reminded me is I have what I think is possibly an announcement which is that also related to somebody else's um uh question in the chat isn't it patreon so um yes so there is something called um um there is something called patreon it's like a Kickstarter like service I'm going to click on it here and what I have is that uh for people who join patreon I have a a private slack channel so this is a a way to do some fundraising for my channel uh for expenses that I have as well as possibly someday in the future I really haven't broken even yet but uh generating income from doing this now one of the things uh in the fall in September I go back to um teaching at a place called ITP it's a program at Tish School of the Arts New York University there's 200 students it's a master's program this course there will be a site that says A2Z F16 so my plan in September if I can make this happen is to make so every single one of these weeks if I go back now to here if you look at all of these weeks I want to as it's a 14week course or you can see there's 11 weeks of content I'm planning to make YouTube videos about every one of these topics regular Expressions Markoff chains closures node and twitterbots Chrome extensions I'm going to make weekly videos about these topics so everyone will have access to that if you're watching the live stream or subscribing to my YouTube channel and what I would like to experiment with is so I I'll have I have about 16 or 18 students taking the course in person at NYU and then if you are subscribed to the patreon in the fall what I'll do is uh post the assignments in the slack Channel as well as provide a form for people to post their their their when they did the assignments and have a discussion uh and answer questions about those assignments so what I would like to attempt to do is teach the course both in person at ITP as well as in the slack Channel um and let me let me be very clear about something I have a particular point of view about this and I know I'm going on way too long about this but you're here watching so you're listening you can turn this off if you want um to me the course itself is not the content I mean that that is part that is part of it in truth of course but to me the course itself is the thing that happens in the physical space of the people being together discussing the content so to me I I'm going to take the content and make that videos the the uh I will you know be talking about the content and presenting that content in class as well but that physical inclass thing is the class so I want to see if I can create some sort of uh online community that uh an experiment and also having that seeing if I can get that experience somewhat through this online community whether this means I need to try doing some Google hangouts or whether the slack channel will be enough I don't know but um this is my idea for the fall so um when you contribute money on P um uh okay anyway so there's a discussion about patreon versus Patron and maybe I've written it incorrectly on the website I'll figure that out later anyway so I don't want to go on for way too long about this but I'm this is what something I'm thinking about if you have ideas and feedback about how to do this well um please let me know okay so uh it's also like I've been this has been on my list of topics to make videos about and I can't figure out to find the time for it so I'm kind of all this stuff I'm now putting aside I'm going to do this this stuff weekly in the fall since I'll be teaching this course I feel like it's good Synergy ah boy do I hate boy do I hate that word but I'm gonna say it Synergy okay um all right so off that so now let me go back I am uh um uh so okay here I am let me get back and ready now for looking at sound so I'm going to start with sound synthesis today um okay is there something on the back of this tshirt there's not good um okay uh so here I am here's the example that I'm going to program here is my outline so I'm here on sound synthesis and now I want to look at something so I want to look at something with you guys so I have a uh PDF I had I this morning I decided okay I'm going to do sound synthesis on the live stream today so I better learn how that stuff works because I'm not really an audio file audio person audio expert so I'm I assume this is going to be one of these situations where all on Twitter for the next 24 hours I'll be posting all sorts of Corrections of things I get wrong and I was kind of Googling around reading stuff about sound waves and that sort of thing and then iiz oh I think I have a chapter that I apparently wrote with help from many other people uh um in the learning processing book book about uh act uh learning code with this thing called processing about soundis this so I thought what I would do is take a minute to kind of look at this chapter on sound this section of a chapter on sound synthesis read a little bit of it with you guys it's kind of like do you know there's a there's a television channel here in New York it's called New York 1 and one of the things they do I don't know if they still do this that I absolutely love is in the morning they'll read the New York Times the newspaper to you so you could turn on your TV and have a I don't know it's a soothing Voice or not reading the newspaper to you I always love that such a like quain uh thing that you just think wouldn't exist in the world anymore today so I'm going to uh read some this book to you um in order to review in my head uh some of these Concepts wave forms frequency pitch period amplitude uh and sort of understand how what those concepts are and look at applying those Concepts in code and my trajectory is and give me some feedback in the chat if you want basics of sound synthesis so creating a waveform and hearing that waveform manipulating that waveform in real time with maybe sliders or something then looking at what's something called an envelope which is a way of kind of having u Way of creating a synthesizer in a way so that that you're um uh you have a sort of a sound fading in or fading out with an attack there what's an envelope allows you to make something that sounds more like playing the piano or playing an electric piano and then looking at how if you know the specific frequencies of certain notes and you know a specific Melody you can have a a sketch play that Melody and maybe I'll even do something like use an L system to generate a tune or something like that uh okay uh Alvaro in the chat writes please sync whatever you're going to do with something you already did I don't know if I completely understand that comment um but I do mean for this to tie together as a sort of series of sound tutorials so there is kind of a narrative here Loosely okay so um let's let me review I need to review some of these Concepts in my head before I begin the actual coding tutorial so I'm going to read to you from my book okay so let's think about I'm actually not going to just really read it okay so let's think about a physics of sound so the first thing you need to understand is physics of sound sound travels through a medium sound exists uh most commonly air this is something that I wrote but also sound can travel through liquids or solids and as a wave so if a speaker vibrates Ates you know if you pluck a string and it vibrates it's creating that wave to to travel through the air and arrive at your ear and so um you know a common form of a wave would be like a sine wave let's um let's come over here for a second oops this camera is off this is me by the way practicing the content of the tutorial because I have to uh and I I guess I'm going to um I'm going to erase what I have here I'll take a peek at the chat in a second so if we have this idea of a wave this like a pure form of a sort of perfect wave might look something like this this is actually a kind of wave that you'll see if you graph the mathematical function sign and so this is like a wave that could travel through the air and this wave uh would have things like an amplitude which is the height amplitude the height of the wave it has things like a period so a period is how long is one cycle of the wave so you can see here that like this is a full cycle of the wave it repeats so this would be the period how long did it take for the wave to repeat itself like in time uh and then frequency is like one divided by period so how many repetitions in one unit of time so something like 60 hertz that's like 60 repetitions in a second I think I think I put this in the book okay somewhere here uh Hertz one Hertz is one cycle per second okay audible frequencies typically range between 20 and 20,000 Hertz um okay so then I think I think that's basically then the idea is that we want to create and this is processing code I'm going to have to do the p5js code but the idea is to create an oscillator and then you can set the frequency and amplitude so you're essentially configuring the wave and hearing it uh okay uh um angular frequency is clearly better than frequency I don't know what angular frequency is so if anybody wants to fill me in on that you can let me know okay sorry I lost my uh ah I sorry I I have this problem where I'm trying to have the chat zoomed in and I screw it up I just want to check I'm just curious um uh let's see here if anybody's watching in twitch I think I might stop streaming to Twitch um because I there's only four people watching in there um but we'll see okay so where am I here okay so um so this is the idea so let me see here let's look actually also now on the p5js website uh um so this ah okay so this is how it works you make an oscillator set its type fre frequency amplitude start so I think I'll be doing this in an example and if I click what happens oh click oh look at this you can like ramp its amplitude to 05 over 0.1 seconds I think that comment is incorrect because it's point over so that's interesting there's lots of interesting possibilities there um can you hear that so that's so uh let me just I'm just running on the uh on the p5js website if I change the frequency to like 400 click again now there's a nice little so the amplitude was set in this example the amplitude is set to zero and then so interestingly enough let me set the amplitude to zero without this fade in just curious to so you can hear there's a little bit of a clipping right as it starts so that's why it's nice so this is something that I can add to my example if I put like five seconds it would then over five seconds and let me uh actually set I can barely hear it so let me set the amplitude to higher over five seconds can you guys hear that and now it should be fading out over five seconds I can't tell anyway I'll I'll fiddle with that when I make the example okay so and now the other thing I want to look at is P5 oscillator uh reference so I think actually for sound I want to go here and then I want to go to P5 oscillator and um start stop set type so these are the kind of types sign triangle Sawtooth or Square and I you know from my understanding is it it's just sort of describing what the waveform looks like so uh let me see if I can get this right triangle I believe is this I'm going to do this again in a like a video tutorial that's probably Triangle Square would be like this maybe what's Sawtooth let's look that up uh saw tooth wave aha so saw to oh look at this here's a nice here's a nice image of all the different waves so these are the different wave forms s square triangle and Sawtooth and they'll have different um uh different audio um sorry I'm angular frequency is usually used for fft and the like in real applications it's more intrinsic avoids factors of 2 pi so yeah so that's beyond the scope of this particular tutorial video I know my camera went off ah I still haven't figured out the magic magic lantern settings for these cameras um okay uh ah yes okay Alvaro is insist is is uh is mentioning syn yes I'm going to do the uh super shape today before I leave it's about 1115 I'm going to do the super shape today yes um okay uh okay so these will have different audio qualities wonder what this um uh and I don't know that in uh yeah and then here are specific frequencies for certain musical notes and then I'm getting into the envelope thing okay uh and then this is uh this is the sort of midi conversion okay so maybe I'm going to get into all of this noise is something we can talk about but I might skip that okay great so I think I'm ready for this first tutorial in the chat I'm going to erase the Whiteboard get myself set up with the code if I've missed anything fundamental do you think anybody in the chat think so like core sound synthesis uh please let me know uh okay so I'm coming over here oh by the way how's the focus on the Whiteboard uh let me know in the chat I I don't feel like checking it but I will if I need to okay yeah and somebody in the chat mentioned Chuck um uh sorry I'm looking at the I'm looking at my phone this is like the worst thing you know by the way the worst thing you can ever do as a teacher in a real classroom is be like excuse me I'm getting a text students do not like first of all it's rude but I don't know why I think I could do that on the live stream the problem is it keeps buzzing and I'm worried that it's like an important message about uh you know something wrong with the live stream but I'm putting that away okay um I I have no idea what's going on anymore coming back sound synthesis okay so I'm getting myself ready um ah yes um Trevor in the chat writes reminds me of the program language dedicated to sound a Chuck which also has some lessons on Ken yes so one thing I should mention is if you are interested in audio as a form of creative expression and in particular computational audio and programming with sound um I'm not suggesting by any means that p5js in The Sound Library is the sort of perfect most comprehensive place to do this um in fact there are audio environments like Max MSP Jitter um which is a commercial software there's Chuck uh which I believe is open source and free actually have no idea if that's true and there are courses online courses and actually there's a great um Sam uh there's someone named Sam and his last name is uh he does great YouTube videos so we'll post a link to it in my this video description uh Tara Tara uh anyway Sam does great Max MSP video tutorials on YouTube you should check those out I'm sure they're going to be much better than this one the the there's a couple things that I like about using P5 GS one is I'm already using it for other stuff so it makes sense to it here the Sound Library which was created by Jason seagull is excellent and has a lot of great features and it also means you can do the stuff in the browser so if you want to do sound stuff in the browser uh JavaScript and the web audio API and p5js is great there is also I should mention a sound library for the browser called tone.js uh and I don't I certainly won't be today using tone.js but certainly if you're interested in sound synthesis this is probably something you want to take a look at but I'm going to look at the basic except M P5 Jazz ah pure data thank you uh mat uh mentions pure data which is an open source uh uh data flow programming environment much like Max MSP which is free and open source um okay uh so here we go so now I just need to I'm going to keep this image up in case I want to reference it uh I want to um here's some possible screenshots for for the sound synthesis tutorial thumbnails that's that's one possibility since there won't necessarily be a lot of visual this is another one some thumbnail possibilities for mat who will make a thumbnail uh let me find the YouTube uh Max tutorial his name is Sam YouTube Max MSP let's see if this comes up yeah I think this must be is it dude 837 uh yep that's Sam it doesn't say his last name but that's fine this is Sam and this is his YouTube channel dude 837 uh give him some more subscribers uh if you're interested great Max MSP tutorials okay uh now where was I gotta get into the the the uh okay so here we go let me uh uh close this out this is good to have open the oscillator uh reference page I'm going to keep this open uh to make that a little bit bigger I don't need my patreon open I don't need this open I need this open sure sure actually I'm going to close this right now this I want to leave open uh here we go and then now uh this can go away and this can come up and I think now I'm ready to start so what should be my opening image um actually maybe I will have this as my opening image actually view uh table of content sorry everybody I'm like being overly how do I get rid of that okay hide Side Bar there we go um that's obviously really important what I'm doing right now okay so this will be my opening image thumbnail possibilities okay um oh yes and you can program um in JavaScript in Max Maximus you can program in Max MSP with like JavaScript okay U let me cycle the cameras I'm very excited about this tutorial it's not something I'm ever really taught before feel super comfortable with but I hope that people will find it interesting and use useful and I have everything going so I'm ready I've got my button to go back and forth I've got my mind which is has many flaws to it and I think I'm ready okay I'm processing tshirt and here we go okay I clean my glasses and here we go so I'm going to do what I hope will be about a 10 to 15 minute tutorial on sound synthesis in p5js and I I'm going to mostly try to avoid looking at the chat while I'm doing this tutorial this will get edited as a a separate Standalone video and then uh when I'm finished I'll look at the chat to see if you'll have comments or questions or Corrections okay here we go I'm doing this from scratch without I I just want to want to look at one thing just to have my mind refreshed new P5 do oill okay okay okay here we go hello welcome to a video tutorial about sound synthesis sound synthesis in the browser in JavaScript using the p5js Sound Library okay so what is sound synthesis the idea here unlike my previous videos where I loaded a file from a sound and played that sound whether it's music or a sound effect boy do I really wish I could okay hold on sorry I couldn't redo this because um oh I I because I'm a crazy person I gotta I got to be able to uh what's a good sound effect here yeah that's a good one okay um oh actually I'll just use the coding rainbow coding rainbow okay I'm doing doing this again sorry okay here we go try attempt number two hello welcome to a video tutorial about sound synthesis in the browser using JavaScript using the p5js sound library now this is a uh one part of a continuing series about programming with sound and what I'm going to do in this particular video which is quite different from my previous four videos is instead of loading a sound from a file like some music or perhaps playing a sound effect like good rainbow what I'm going to do is instead create in a way sound from nothing sound synthesis now of course I could do sound synthesis myself me me me me me me me okay I can't sing it's terrible um but this is the idea my vocal cords are vibrating and they're creating a vibration that vibration is traveling through the air uh and it's actually going into a microphone the microphone reads that vibration records it then it's coming out of the speaker of your computer which is vibrating and then traveling again through the air and eventually into your ear so this idea of a sound wave is something we need to talk about this wave that travels through the air how can we in code synthesize that wave create a sound and then control that wave to essentially play a melody play a tune allow create an interactive piano all these types of things are possible with what I'm going to show you how to do so the first idea is really to think about a sound wave so let me um let me come over here and there are a couple key Concepts which I think are quite important so what I'm going to draw for you here is something called a sine wave now I'm sure I am not drawing this exactly correctly but if you take the sign function the sign function being a function from trigonometry where is if you have a triangle and you take s OFA it equals the opposite the length of the opposite side of the triangle divid the hypotenuse of the triangle so you can go and look at all my trigonometry and triangle tutorials and stuff somewhere else that's not really relevant for here what's interesting is if you if you think of this angle as a value that's changing over time and we're to graph that you're going to see a wave pattern like this so it's a perfectly symmetrical repeating wave form a sine wave and if that sine wave travels through the air you're going to hear a tone now a wave has certain properties one property is amplitude so if we can look at this is like the top of the wave and this is like the bottom of the wave and you could think of that height as something called uh amplitude so the height of the wave and now the height of the wave is actually is actually a volume so the higher the wave the louder the sound the amplitude I mean I'm sure there's like a very fine nuanced scientific distinction between those terms but we can think of it for right now some will yell at me in the comments in the chat and I'll feel very embarrassed and sad and that I got everything wrong but anyway so amplitude that's the height of the wave now another key part of the wave is something called period so period and I'm going to uh like this is the amount of time or the length between a the length of a full cycle of the wave so you can see from here this top of the wave all the way to here is one full cycle that just repeats over and over again how long it took for that cycle is the period um and in the case of sound we're really thinking about time and seconds how many that that wave like how long did it take for that wave form to um to wave so to speak now one divided by period one over period is a term called frequency meaning not how long for one cycle but how many cycles per second and this is actually a measurement you've probably heard uh Hertz so if something is 60 hertz that's a frequency of 60 cycles per second and this is key because what we're going going to do is set we're going to create a wave with code we're going to set its amplitude we're going to set its frequency as a value in hurts and then listen to it so these are the concepts what I want to do now is look at how do I in JavaScript create this waveform and control its amplitude and frequency okay let's go and do that now so coming over here uh I think I'm back over here uh and here here you are here I am I'm gonna play some music for a second just to get my mind up okay that's good enough uh and I'm going to minimize this I'm going to open my browser open over here and I'm going to go to this is an example I've running so I have a completely empty blank canvas I don't actually need a canvas for this example I'm just doing stuff with sound I'm going to go back to the code and I'm actually just for the sake of argument going to make the canvas a little bit smaller so it takes up less space on the page okay so what do I need to do first I need to create a sound wave so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable I'm going to call it wave and uh technically the term for a wave in p5js Sound Library is oscillator a wave being something that oscillates much like plucking a string right you pluck a string it oscillates like a wave and it vibrates through and and and pushes that wave through the air up to your ear you hear a sound okay so what I need to do is say wave equals new P5 do oscillator so this is a new object you might not be familiar with P5 do oscillator um this now I've created an oscillator object so this object exists it's up to me to turn it on and turn it off to set its frequency to set its amplitude to configure that oscillator so to speak uh one thing that I think is important for me to mention is that here in index.html um you know I I have a reference to the p5js Sound Library you can't really see it all the way there there we go um so you need to for this to work you need to make sure you have the P5 do sound. JS file loaded as part of your project um so now I'm back to here the other thing I think is Worth showing you and I have it here is the reference page for P5 doos so this is something you might want to look at on your own time and review there's actually a nice little uh example on this page but I just want to show you here are a bunch of the functions that I'm going to start to demonstrate to you start stop amplitude frequency set type connect disconnect so there's a lot of P all those things I showed you about manipulating a a a song file MP3 file that you load and play there's similar things going on here so one thing that's really important though is this idea of set type so look at this I talked about sine waves but you could also have a triangle wave a Sawtooth wave or a square wave and I actually have an image here I was going to draw these as diagrams but I'll just use this image instead so what the waveform actually looks like uh is going to determine what the sound sounds like and and of course the world is your oyster in terms of possible ways that you might be able to do sound synthesis but P5 by default allows you to create oscillators of these four forms sine wave Square wave triangle wave and Sawtooth wave and this image uh comes from uh Wikipedia and I believe this is a Creative Commons license image I better check that but hopefully I'm uh but I'm pretty sure it's available to be using this video and you could also use it as well anyway okay so u i I'll post a link to it in the uh description okay so so we'll try a bunch of different forms but let's just start with a sine wave so the first thing I want to do in my code is say wave. set type uh and I believe uh I need to pass in a string meaning a word in between quotes a sign being sine wave the other thing I could do is set the amplitude uh oh by just saying amplitude I'm going to set it to one and then I can say wave. frequency I'm going to set some frequency let's try uh 300 whatever that might sound like and then I'm going to uh ah play it I think I need to say uh play play or start I'm not sure let's look at the reference page uh it looks like start starts the obsil and there's a there's a there's a a Nuance to this function which I think will be interesting to see so I'm going to say say start so let's uh refresh this sketch can you hear that a nice tone let's go back it's very hard for me to hear it the way I have the sound configured for let me make this 400 that sounds very similar what did I do wrong uh so maybe that frequency function isn't correct uh let's look let's look back frequency uh okay I need to look at the chat I lost the chat 261 626 sorry everybody sorry I did it again I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I'm so sorry I can't the stuff is very quiet for me um yeah uh sorry everybody I won't do that again I had a very bad feeling that would happen I in the um when this gets archived I need to remember to add an annotation uh that um warns people that that's about to happen about to happen um okay so uh I won't do that again first of all let me make it quieter doesn't sound like a sign way uh I'm gonna I'm gonna come back into the I can't oh I muted the tab okay uh oh interestingly there's probably the I know what the issue is um shouldn't be out of draw so I think there's an issue which is like a kind of very classic JavaScript problem where it probably takes some time to actually create the oscillator and it's not ready for its frequency to be set yet so um if I put this in draw you're going to hear the difference so um probably the same thing with yeah that's a little bit quieter right okay all right so um okay um uh okay uh sorry everybody okay I I think I'm now okay what clearly what I need to do is build in a button to start and stop it because otherwise it's going to drive everybody crazy um oh docs impli has to be after the start call oh so maybe that's just the issue thank you 400,00 yep thank you Oliver always Oliver always okay so um so I'm before I go back into the tutorial I'm going to add a uh I'm going to add a uh I'm going to just add a uh uh I'm going to add a button so I can quickly stop a sound uh uh I guess I should do this in the tutorial maybe I'll do this in the tutorial um wonder if it says if wave I wonder if this works oh you know uh wonder if this works yes that's not a function I need my own boo variable um I just want to add this in here okay so I just wanted to add this in here because um um and then also I have a reason I've done way too much outside of the tutorial now this is probably a bad idea but let's see how that goes what why is that not working do I have two function draws oh yeah causes Distortion okay okay sorry everybody is this okay what I have now please someone in the chat tell me that what I'm playing right now is okay and won't hurt everybody's ears okay great okay so um whoops I'm going to go back to the tutorial now I I think maybe what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to take this and put this up here okay okay okay great thank you everybody thank you for your patience uh I'm going to cycle the camera since that was like a bit of a break here and now I'm back okay so the things that I'm going to do I'm going to go back into and this will get spliced together as a video tutorial the things that I'm going to do first I'm going to mention how you have to have start first which it says in the documentation if I just read it then I'm going to um show how I can change the frequency then I'm going to mention how I have a button there and I'm going to put this stuff with the playing Boolean variable and then I'm going to start to do some stuff like at a slide to change the frequency I'm going to talk about um what um yes so Oliver asked can I not just set the amplitude to 0 five or zero on the button press yeah so I'm going to do that and actually I'm going to do I I'm going to actually change that live on the Fly think and just mention that as a one solution instead of start stop um so um and then uh um what's and then I want to what's 440 is a right and then like something like 261 is like middle C yeah okay but I'm believe this is 400 oops okay um okay everyone so and then I'm going to okay so here we go I'm going back try 432 is a I actually have in this PDF a chart I I'm not going to worry about that right now because I'm going to do um I'm going to do um I'm going to do a whole tutorial about musical notes as a separate video but okay so let me come back here okay back again there was an issue with the order of these operations so setting the amplitude and setting the frequency will not work unless you call those after start and it actually says that in the documentation I just didn't read that properly so what I'm going to do now is go back to the page and I'm going to refresh it you can hear that 400 and I'll mention that 400 440 the frequency of 440 is actually the musical note a can tune your vial into it now can you hear that that's the musical note a if I'm right and I'll just metion that if I make that a little bit higher if I say 1,000 you should be able to hear that that's quite a bit uh higher so let me go back to this and actually let me just turn the amplitude down to zero and there you go now you'll notice in this program because I don't hopefully I'm not blowing anyone's ears out that um that there is I have a play pause button so while I was taking a break there for a second to figure out what was wrong I added that button let's just look at the code so very briefly there's just a button that says play and pause there's a function called toggle associated with whenever that button is pressed and then in that function I have a Boolean variable that's set to either true or false based on whether this Boolean variable playing and then in draw I'm either coloring the background pink or gray depending on whether that bullan variable is true or not so if I if I go back here and run this again you can see playing that button toggles the background so one of the things that I want to do show you is that I can actually just take this code right here and I can put that here in uh in the toggle function and then I could actually say wave. stop here in in in the else so right now what I want to do is toggle this that oscillator on and off so I'm going to run this do you hear it I think you do wait I don't hear it I don't know why I can't hear it anymore oh the amplitude is at zero so let me turn it back to zero 0.5 okay now you can hear it right on and off oh I think there's like a low hum uh anyway hopefully the sound is fine uh so okay so I can toggle that sound on off now there's a couple things one I should mention is uh you don't actually have I don't actually have to start and stop it what I could really just do is you know start it right here in setup and I could immediately set the amplitude to zero and then what I could do here is just uh and I could also set the frequency here in setup and then what I could do is just set the amplitudes so I don't need start I just want to set the amplitude to 0.5 or set the amplitude to zero so I'm going to run that again I'm turning off now one thing I'll mention is do you hear that little like clipping each time I start and stop it there's a quick clip of the sound that's because this oscillator comes in at full amplitude immed immediately so often with a sound like this it's a little bit advantageous to kind of fade it in very slowly and there's actually the amplitude function and I believe starting stop there is an optional second argument so if I put in like one as a second argument it's going to take one second to fade in that sound or Fade Out that sound and I could put in 0.1 or something much shorter if I want but let's take a listen to that did you hear that fade in very hard for me to hear it because it's very quiet out of my speakers but hopefully it's piping through the sort of YouTube recording system and you can actually hear it okay so hopefully you heard that distance now let's talk a little bit about uh let's do one more thing I think which would be worth doing what I what I think would be worth doing is let me create a slider and I'm going to say slider equals create slider and now I need a range so the audible I believe an a a reasonable sort of audible range of frequencies is between like 20 and 20,000 perhaps but I don't want to blow out your ears I'm afraid of doing anything too crazy so I'm going to have a range a frequency range between like let's just say 100 and 1200 which I think will be somewhat reasonable and I'm going to start at the musical note a 440 so I'm going to create a slider and in uh in draw what I'm going to do is I'm going to say wave uh I somebody is I usually when in the chat if someone's blasting with Emojis I know that something's wrong but I don't know what that is um so uh wave. frequency I should U frequ qu uh slider. value so what I want to do is now at least tie the frequency to a slider and so first I need to play it you can hear that so you can see as I can change that frequency on the fly so this is the basic idea I can synthesize a sound as a waveform I can fade it in I can fade it out I can change its frequency I can change its amplitude and I want actually let's just briefly maybe I We'll add like triangle wave or Sawtooth wave or Square wave just to hear what some of those sound like but mainly what I want to do in the next video is talk about something called an envelope and an envelope is a way of kind of crafting around that oscillator a sort of musical attack a fade in a fade out and that's going to make allow us to configure the oscillator in a way that might sound more like an electric piano or a particular kind of musical instrument I'm not we're not going all the way there to that and then I want to talk about what are specific frequencies of specific musical notes how do those relate to a concept called midi and how might you create a program that sort of generates a tune or allows a user to interactively play uh piano okay so um um so what I'm going to do here is Let's uh so I think I'm done but let's just uh let's just look uh before I go let's look here at um the oscillator object oh I'm in frequency uh uh oscillator object what I want to look at is uh this so the options for uh set type typ sign triangle soft tooth or Square so let's just try a triangle wave um and he what that sounds like see if you can hear the difference has a kind of different quality to it and so what I recommend um that you do one thing you might think about as an exercise is can you create a whole interface an interface for changing the wave form for changing the frequency for changing the amplitude what happens if you have multiple oscillators can harmonize so this you know there's a lot of bunch of things you could try here and I also want to remember to make sure I do something where we visualize that wave itself so where the wave is drawn on screen so I should I should make that happen at some point too okay thanks for watching the sound synthesis video I look forward to hearing your feedback in the comments and the chat and all that sort of stuff there's no there's no chat I guess action after it's over bye okay um oh so I forgot to remove the stop function fun call that's what Alvaro is saying oh yeah I did thank you so that was a mistake but you know ah so it wasn't fading out properly H that's too bad here let me record a brief addendum this will go this will go on the end of that video it will get edited in thank you mat uh okay hello video epilog I realized I forgot actually to remove wave do stop in here when I was showing you that you didn't need stop that you could just fade the amplitude down to zero so I'm going to actually take that out and I'm going to go back I'm going to run this again hit play hit pause and pause is probably the wrong word it's fade in fade out and I could make the text of the button change all sorts of stuff I could make this better but at least that was a brief correction okay thanks for watching this video okay okay thanks for that correction all right how was that any feedback any questions it's 1150 um um let me look at my list here so I think that counts for this particular topic and I think that I want to look at envelopes I need to add something to this am I allowed to edit this here no this is like my public version of the slack file um I think I have it on the other I want to add something I think which is visualize the wave um hold on if you'll bear with me for a second I'm GNA try to add this to my todo list wherever that is uh impossible to uh sound tutorial outline uh I should be able to add here edit this is not very interesting because you can't see what I'm doing and I also can't figure it out this is a list of keeping these list in the slack Channel and I don't see how to edit this add reaction view public link open a new window let's try opening a new window yeah let's me edit here so uh visualize Soundwave so I want to add that hit save hit refresh I don't know why it didn't show up here but I added it to my list over there okay I'm not going to get too caught up in that let me check the chat again uh to see um uh let me look at the chat so uh so Michael berer uh post something about the solar system 2D example not working because of the recursion I'll have to check into that oh not working in p5js that was an example I made in processing um rosling in the chat writes if it's not too off topic would be awesome to show one oscillator star times another one okay interest interesting it's not too off topic but it's a bit beyond the scope of what I'm prepared to do with these basic ones but maybe remind me later um and then uh ah Darth yes I saw your comment about the train generator not working I'll have to check into that when you change the width and height I'll have to check into that I probably have it it has to be square or something I'll have to fix the codee for that um can you natively mix multiple sound files in processing do why would you do it in Native ja or would you do it in not native Java okay so one thing I'll mentioned that's just um um kind of something to sort of think about so I'm using p5js there there is also a processing Sound Library which has a very very similar API as the p5js one and you can do a lot of this stuff and you can actually mix uh two different um sound files I believe in the processing version okay any other questions or feedback I think I want to do another I think my my what I would like to do today is um at least so in the amount of time that I've left it's about noon I I I you know I have about another this has been going for I have about an hour in me I think I'm I'm definitely going to have to take a pee break at some point um but uh I have maybe an hour uh in me more so I think what I want to do is do envelopes and then do the super shape um that's kind of my plan for the rest of today um so sound envelope so let's go look again at my learning processing chapter and somewhere in here so this I wrote okay so this by the way hopefully this is accurate this is a chart which shows different frequencies for different notes and an envelope is something okay a more sophisticated I wrote a more sophisticated way to simulate a musical instrument playing a note can be accomplished with an audio envelope an envelope controls how a note begins and ends through four parameters I hope that's right attack time that's the beginning of the note like the moment you hit it on the piano so how long it takes for the volume of the note to go from zero to its peak volume sustain time is how long it takes to play sustain level is the peak volume of the during its duration from Attack to release and release time is the length of time it takes for the level Decay from sustain level to zero okay um Carlos by the way asked in the chat can you do am and FM synthesis in p5js probably uh and I need to um uh okay so this uh so let's look at now I'm going to go to the reference and let's look at um P5 envelope uh and this uses something okay so let's read this um this is a kind of envelope known as an adsr envelope attack Decay sustain release well that's a new song for us attack Decay sustain release that could be a song Lynn Manuel Miranda I am not not anywhere close um okay so an envelope can control an oscillator frequency huh set range to change the attack release level use set asdr to change the attack uh okay so let's look at an example here probably where you create an envelope you set its adsr attack level release attack time Decay time sustain percent release time and then attack level release level I got to understand what those are uh um those must be the amplitudes and then uh and then what you do sorry sorry sorry I'm figuring learning this is the envelope is the thing that you play oh no no envelope. playay so how this is kind of what one of the things that's a little bit often a little bit confusing to me about the P5 J Sound Library is that it looks like it will tie these two things together by default like nowhere in the code do I say use this oh no no there it is amplitude is with the envelope okay so that's how the envelope is tied to the oscillator so the oscillator so let's um and uh okay so let's see what happens here uh oh click the way you guys hear that so attack level release level attack time Decay time sustain percent release time so if I were to edit this and have the release level be 0. five for example it releases not to zero okay so that makes sense the attack time if that were like a full second you can hear it takes a second and if I make the Decay time the release so what's the difference between deay time and release time wait I wrote this so this is sustained to I I I call these different things attack Decay sustain release boy I maybe my book is wrong um attack so I don't want to actually look at this right now um because this is wrong but I it got me going this is a this is a good thing to so let me understand this before I make the video attack Decay sustain okay I should be back I'm going to check the oops ah I'm in the wrong place here I'm going to check YouTube chat uh to see when you if you're watching on YouTube and you see me again let me know um also uh can you hear he my audio is it's not doing that horrible looping thing anymore and then I unfortunately I had to re all my settings got lost when whatever crashed so I got to play some sounds again I don't have it within me to do my ridiculous dancing thing this is me being like tired dancing after like an hour of live streaming um somebody can make a gift out of that I'm sure H uh how is uh that is the level fine between those two sounds okay hold on I uh I did get some water okay so here I am again I kind of lost my momentum and energy but hopefully I can gain that back um and let me come back here to where I was the fortunate thing is that did not happen um it did the the the sound issue this has happened to me before I don't know why happens there's something going on with I have like a lot of different USB connections into the computer and I noticed when when this happens like the mouse the keyboard stops working but I can remote desktop into the computer something going wrong with like all the USB connections get on the fritz maybe I need like a USB hub or something anyway um okay I think I might actually be broadcasting to Facebook now because it didn't work before but so hello Facebook this is actually the second half of a live live stream if you're watching um the full thing will be an archive on YouTube at some point if you want to go over there and look okay um all right so the thing that I'm on is 1215 I've got about 45 more minutes I think to go here I'm going to see if I can get these two things done I want to do a video tutorial about audio envelopes and this is my new reference for an adsr envelope um the attack is the um how long it takes to get up to its attack volume then the Decay is how long it takes to get to its sustain volume and then release is how long it takes to go down to zero and so then if I look at the P5 example these are the attack time Decay time sustain percent release time and then this is the attack level but shouldn't this be the sustain level right no that's the release level so oh this is the sustained volume got it ah so it's not it would go so what happen happens if you don't set the range this is my question so like for example right now I have an attack level and a release level so what if I just make an attack time and a Decay time and a sustain percent but if I take out if I don't bother with this is there some default yeah so it must be there must be some default levels so this is really confusing because there are three there are three different volumes amplitudes there's the first amplitude the sustain amplitude and the and the end amplitude and then there's three different like moments there's the attack how long it takes to get to the first volume the second one and the last one okay um all right everybody so I think I'm ready now to do this tutorial let me keep this page open you definitely uh this page I'm done with this is a good one I think is there a way I can I just want to kind of I think I want to do this if possible this is better to look at okay so this is a nice diagram also that I think I will use instead of having to do my own uh uh this is the reference page for envelope so I'm going to come down here might need this as a reference uh and this is oh okay so now what I need to do is go to the sound folder so this is going to be sound synthesis O2 and uh in atom here let's open up sound synthesis O2 so what I want to do is um get rid of the slider simplify I don't need this playing thing anymore I need a button I need an oscillator um and let's set it the sign and get rid of all this um okay so I just want to simplify this to oops uh Sis 2 playing is not defined false okay so that is that working for you guys it's fading in and out okay okay great I don't see anybody yelling at me in the chat that anything has gone horribly wrong so I think I'm ready for envelopes yay envelopes yay envelopes I need some energy envelopes yay attack a d s r a it's like I'm like a cheerleader a d s r attack Decay sustain release okay all right I think I'm ready for this uh yeah definitely don't quit my day job uh that's for sure uh all right so let me erase this over here okay by the way sorry I'm over here erasing the Whiteboard I just uh needed a break from the camera so okay okay coming back going to have a little water here I am hello this is even better watch this let's see if I can make this happen going up an escalator okay uh um all right so let me do I dare have this diagram open when I begin this particular video uh I guess I will okay let me cycle the cameras and I'm going to get this done okay here we go okay oh yeah we need a screenshot thumbnail okay those are some thumbnails okay um here we go one it's really hot in here I've been doing this for it's a hot day in New York okay I'm recording I'm streaming and I'm ready hello welcome to another video tutorial about sound synthesis and in this video I am going to look at something called an envelope it's you know if I had an envelope in front of me here I would open it up and reveal the winner of I don't know what some sort of bizarre coding tutorial awards show thing and then I would thank my mother and my father and would be very awkward the orchestra would try to play me off but that's not what I'm doing here today that really did not need to be in this video but anyway but envelope this is the reason why is this the the thing is this envelope thing that I'm about to talk to you about is a really quite lovely and simple idea I got to just start over there was too much nobody wants to watch that at the beginning of video okay it's so hot in here I'm dying okay I'm gonna I'm gonna do a revised version of that joke GNA keep it I'm Gonna Keep the joke I don't have an envelope wait let's see if I can find one oh actually you know what I totally have an envelope because I have some tax forms there's got to be an envelope in here right got like tax forms check reimbursement from the dentist Insurance ah here's an no there's no envelope all this paper you guys really just want this tutorial don't you okay sorry here we go I thought I had an envelope a prop I I just I just aspire to use props I didn't I don't have an envelope I'm looking around oh wait wait wait look look look envelope okay here we go ready everybody hello and welcome to another sound synthesis tutorial this sound synthesis tutorial is about envelopes and the winner is oh no I don't know what I've just done the winner is the p5js Sound Library okay no not about that okay what I'm really here to talk about is this kind of envelope and this looks like kind of a very scary weird looking diagram but I'm actually hopefully going to make it make sense to you in this video and I've lost my marker here's the marker um what I want to talk about is something called an adsr envelope and envelopes are used in the world of sort of sound synthesis as a mechanism for adjusting the way uh the playback engine enters and exits the sound and the and so you can essentially configure you know in the previous video I made this oscillator object that played a sine wave and the idea I'm going to wrap that sine wave in an envelope open up the envelope and put the sine wave in it and that envelope is going to configure how that sound and and you can get very sophistic at with this to make sounds that sound more like one or different kinds of musical instruments but really for us in this video I just want it to sound kind of like a electric keyboard in a way you're electric is it really electric I don't know if that's what you say but you press the key and you hear the sound go bu sort of attacks fades in and Fades out so uh in p5js there is an object called a P5 envelope we had a P5 oscillator now I'm going to add a P5 envelope we're going to link them together and the reason why it's called an a Sr envelope is because there are four stages now I have that diagram here but I think in order to understand it it would help to for me to try to like draw that diagram um so there is a a which stands for attack there is D which stands for Decay and there is s which stands for sustain and then there is R which stands for release okay now the interesting thing about this is there two kinds of things that are involved in an envelope there's stuff that's measured in time and there's stuff that's measured in amplitude so uh and interestingly enough attack Decay and release are all amounts of time so attack meaning the moment you press the key on that like piano or keyboard or whatever that's attacking the note so how long does it take in time to get up to what is what would be uh thought of as the attack amplitude or volume the level okay so attack is how long does it take to get up to that decay is how long does it take to get down to its regular volume so there's a volume like it could be loud at the beginning and then sustain at a different volume so that's how long it takes to Decay and then sustain so this is time Decay is time sustain is actually of amplitude a volume so this is how loud is that sustained level so this is a value measured between zero and one kind of percentage of volume um and then release is also a time to for how long it should take to get to fade out to its release amplitude so we have what's interesting here is we have the attack time the Decay time the sustain volume and then the release time interestingly enough though we need an attack volume and a sust and a release volume the attack so let's say the sustain volume is 0.5 but when we attack it we want it actually to ramp up to 75 then fade down to 0.5 and then fade down to zero so there are two values missing from a DSR which is the attack volume and the release volume and in P5 when you create the envelope when you say new P5 actually you just say um P5 envelope sorry there are two functions I can't remember what they're called I think one is called set a DSR and you give it four arguments which are these values attack time Decay time sustain level release time and then there's another function which is like set I'm going to come over here and quickly look it up in the reference uh set range okay uh then the other function is set range and boy this pen is not working very well I don't if you can read this and those are those last two volumes this attack level and the release level so we need to configure this envelope so let's go into p5js and now make that envelope and configure it coming over here hello okay so you can see by the way now we might understand this graph this this chart a little bit more attack time then Decay time what's that sustain level and what's the release time okay um now so let me go back to my code this is the by the way so this is where I I kind of have an example built off of the one from my previous video where all it does is play an oscillator do you hear that I think it's playing the musical note a 440 HZ and then I can turn it off with this button so what I want to do is instead of just having it be just the pure oscillator that just plays forever I want to create and I'm going to just make a variable called e n v for envelope I just I really just want to use props envelope is kind of a lame prop but it is a prop nonetheless then I'm going to say here uh I'm going to say envelope equals new P5 do envelope and I'm going to say envelope dot what did I say set a DSR so now I need those four volumes values attack Decay sustain release attack Decay sustain release okay so attack is uh let's just say we're going to have a05 seconds for the attack then we're going to have 25 seconds for the Decay then our sustain volume is going to be at 0.5 and then uh the release time is going to be 0.1 so I'm kind of making these up the arbitrary configuration then I'm going to say set what did I say set range so I want the attack volume to maybe be at 8 so a bit louder and then I want that release volume to be down at zero because I want it to fade all the way out so now I have if we look at this code I have the envelope and I have the waveform so I need a mechanism by which we I connect the envelope and the waveform together I want that you know this is the waveform this is the envelope I want to take the waveform and I want to put it in the envelope oh that really made sense over here okay so the way that that's done is with the amplitude function so typically with a waveform I would set the amplitude to like zero or 0.5 or one but actually what I want to do here is set the amplitude to that particular envelope so now the This Is How They are connected the waves amplitude is set to the envelope and then in this play function I actually don't need all this toggle stuff because all I want to do is just say envelope. playay so I want the envelope to play it's going to play that oscillator wrapped in all the configurations of the envelope so let's see hopefully this is going to work I'm going to refresh it oh P5 envelope is not a Constructor new P5 do envelope what did I get wrong there so let's have a look at this page um new p5v so it's not the full word envelope it's justv okay thank you very much EnV for short then I'm going to go back to to my program going to run it do you hear that now does that really sound like playing a note at a keyboard I don't know if it does let's mess around with it let's make that attack time uh very very very short let's make the Decay time also uh shorter and um yeah so let's make the attack volume like a little bit louder so we can sort of hear and maybe the release time can be much longer do you hear that so there's like sort of a loud pop and then a little bit of sustain and then it fade out so you know now hopefully this explains the idea now you can to your heart's content I might suggest make a sketch tie all these to like buttons or text boxes or sliders configure the envelope uh have it play u change the frequency each time you play a node have a slider to set the frequency you can sort of set something up to test how this works and to kind of get good at and I'm sure if you research like standard a DSR values for particular instruments you might uh try it with a triangle wave instead of a sine wave you're going to be able to maybe control how the sound sounds a bit more now I should mention by the way you know I'm doing the sort of basics of generating tones with p5g Sound Library there's another Library you might look into at some point called tone.js um which also has a lot of uh a lot of features for doing this kind of work and pushing it further but what I want to do after in the next video is show you now how to keep track of a an array a list of different musical notes how to set an envelope and have an oscillator and play A Melody and possibly you know also a Harmony at the same time so now we've got the basic idea but how do I turn this into something that actually will manage time play notes or be interactive that the user could press keys on the keyboard and play certain notes that type of thing and I'll do that in the next uh video tutorial which I will get to at some point perhaps if you're watching this at some point in the future it's already there okay thanks for watching goodbye okay um I think that work could you guys hear that I the one issue I'm having is uh with the way I have the sound system set up I can barely hear what the sketch is playing but I'm pretty sure it's piping in through the streaming recording system so ah oh oh oh thank you Alvaro Alvaro is um is uh is is is giving me a correction which I think is really important um yes it was audible um uh so I want to read this I'm just going to read alv Val's comment sustain level is the percentage at which the amplitude stays while the key and the piano or keyboard synth is still down the release time is the time it takes to fade out when the key is released so I wonder what default amount of time it's considering the key pressed when I just say envelope. playay in p5js maybe I should make a little addendum to that video does anybody know the answer to that if only Jason seagull were watching this video in the chat right now he would be able to say so hold on I have to look trigger release you should also talk about trigger attack trigger release okay okay I'm going to make an addendum to this video this is my new thing uh okay let me take a look at that in the uh reference page ah so play tells start acting on a given input sound object an envelope right okay ah okay I will explore this I'm going to just add a one sentence explanation at the end of the video um but and then I will I will explore trigger attack and trigger release in a separate uh video possibly in one of the next ones thank you Alvaro for that correction that's a really important one so let me get to your comment so I can I'm going to do a quick addendum which can get edited on to the end of that video it's a new thing that I'm doing okay um okay oops I'm back again with another addendum one thing that I never actually talked about was uh how long should this note sustain itself and you notice that's not really actually a variable anywhere in this uh there's no there's no sustain time there um so the reason that isn't is because typically the way these envelopes are implemented is if you're thinking about playing a piano or keyboard s the note is sustained as long as you're holding down that key um so uh in uh some default amount of time I guess is being used but there is also the functions trigger attack and trigger release so you can trigger the attack instead of just calling play you can actually trigger the attack for that envelope and have it sustained for an arbitrary amount of time until you Trigg trigger release and that allows you to do a few more things uh with how you control the envelope and the playback and I I'll try to do an example in a later video which uses trigger attack and trigger release okay thanks for that little extra note or watching that extra note that is thank me for the extra note I don't know okay uh okay um uh Mouse down and mouse release listeners okay so let me make a I'm not going to do that right now that would have been good to add to this but uh I'm going to just make a note of that in my whoops in my um so so I need to do uh trigger attack trigger release Mouse down Mouse released listeners or Keys okay thank you Alvaro for that excellent uh addition I just put it in my notes I don't know why let's see if it shows up here um yeah so you can see it there uh yeah so I I made a not here that I will I will do a video I I'm done with the sound stuff for today because it's already 1240 and a lot of people requested the super shapes thing so I want to make sure I do that today um and uh what was I saying um um but I but uh so so far basically I've done this much so far I think yeah so I need to do this I want to visual the Soundwave Melody generator or like uh let me uh Slash piano keyboard uh demo and let me hit refresh here whatever I don't know why it doesn't show up here immediately okay uh let me go back to the chat let's see uh whoops I lost the chat there's a discussion about artificial IAL intelligence in the chat going on yes I have I'm of a mind to at some point do some machine learning uh tutorials if you looking for this content um my two recommendations would be uh look into the work of Rebecca febr I I hope I'm pronouncing her her her name correctly she has a Caden course called machine learning for artists I'm sure if you Google Rebecca febr machine learning for artists you'll find it um and also you can look up the work of Jean kogan and if you also Google Jean kogan machine learning for artists um I don't remember I don't know maybe one of their courses is called something slightly different um he has a uh GitHub repository in a set of screen captures with a bunch of different tutorials and I know that the um Rebecca febr in particular had developed something called wekinator which is something that I would like to at some point maybe make some tutorials about but you know to me um Rebecca and Gan are some of the people who are doing the sort of primary work in this field in the sort of Arts context and I would uh look into their work um in particular and I I'd be glad to try to be inspired by them to make my own tutorials but it's certainly not something I don't feel but but but I do have it on my list it's it's certainly been requested a lot um okay um uh the in with regards to Oliver writes with regards to the sustain time in play the default for that third parameter is zero okay interesting um okay so now ah so I'm done with the sound stuff so give me a minute everybody um I would play you some music in the background Gooding power um while the music's playing I need something more relaxing I need a relaxing music option or I could just do this uh I'm going to try to get my set up to set up set myself set up to do the last thing of today which is the super shape so what I need first is super shape Paul Bor it's so hot in this room I can't wait to be done uh so I've got the formula there uh I'm going to go to coding rainbow I'm looking for super oh I already interestingly enough I guess I did it already uh uh so I'm going to copy the super ellipse and call this super shape live so I guess I have one that I'll check and then I'm going to go in terminal where's my terminal uh Upp a directory uh coding rainbow uh run the server again uh go back to here um so let's look at apparently I did this already let just see here yep okay so this is something I practiced with so this is the super shape code uh basically but what I want to do is um start from here which was my super ellipse example and and let me go there and uh did I just close Adam super shape live um look at the sketch now I kind of want to look just briefly at the code that I did already just to like get my uh okay right so I'm these are the variables then I get M from a slider value and the step is one I remember this now and then I'm still doing this thing where I'm doing the loop and setting vertices calculating the formula uh and then calculating R and uh then getting X and Y from that okay because I just need a point for every angle and then also here okay so um I think I should be able to do this let's let's find out uh okay ah boy it's hot okay I can do this this is this is it is um 1243 I hope that this will be uh 15 minutes or less and that um oh good thing I noticed this this is an issue that I have to fix this particular folder for whatever reason H that's weird I don't know what why oh okay no no I'm fine okay okay here we go everybody N1 N2 N3 and M those are the variables okay I can get rid of this I didn't give credit to this diagram but oh well I can get rid of this one and I can get rid of this right now and oh I see it synchronized the super shape ellipse with some oscillator now I finally so that that's a good you know honestly my my I it's a great suggestion I would love to add that to the tutorial to me that's sort of like an exercise to do once I have the particular code written so I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to control it with a slider and certainly you could then take that value that's controlling it and use like a sine wave I did that with the Julia set yesterday so the the Julia set code actually has the same code to do that um does this super shape allow you to change the vertices of the shape at different points um well I'm going to just do the raw algorithm and then I sure and then when I'm done with that you guys can ask some questions in the chat you could see but I hopefully you guys can like make your own um uh ideas and versions out of this okay so let me go to here and uh this should be good um is both the equation of the sphere and ellipse and even the super ellipse given here the general formula for the super shape is um okay okay okay okay uh all right everybody settle down this is the last thing I'm going to do today I have a long list of things I'm going to get to as I'm doing these live sessions every week once a week or twice a week uh you can join the uh patreon and the slack where I have a particular Channel which is dedicated to discussing the topics that I'll do in future videos okay so uh here we go I'm going to cycle the cameras um and uh one thing I need to do very briefly is just clean the Whiteboard uh in case I want to use it so I'm just doing that right now out of view of the camera okay out of view of the camera there we go everything's still working audio wise etc etc I hope so and I think I'm ready I hope this goes well um okay okay I don't know what people are discussing in the chat I see lots of messages going by ready here we go hello and let me start over I'm so tired hungry and so hot in here last thing here we go hello and welcome to a video tutorial about programming something called the super shape ah look at that formula in I'm going to do this in JavaScript going to use the p5js uh formula this is a topic which is a continuation of a previous video that I made about the super ellipse I'm essentially going to use the exact same code I had in my previous super ellipse video and turn it into this other more elaborate formula called the super shape the super shape uh is an this is Paul bork's uh website I'll include a link to it in the description this is a page documenting how to do this from 2002 and the equation is something based on Johan gilis Giles I'm not sure if I pronounced that correctly um and you know this is these are formulas that are designed to try to simulate and create different kinds of natural forms and eventually if I am strong enough if I'm courageous enough if if I can manage it I'm going to in the next video finally look at the super shape in 3D which allows to start creating forms that look like this sort of stuff but at first we just want to see if we can make these 2D like forms with different parameters for this particular formula so let me come back and here is the formula okay so what's the core idea here um let me come back to the Whiteboard here for a second the core idea if you've forgotten is that I have this idea of a polar coordinate system so I have some R and some angle and actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to iterate over every possible angle from zero all the way to 2 pi and actually you can generate interesting super shapes by doing this multiple times so going like from 0 to 2 pi like six times um and what I'm going to do is with this angle I need some way of calculating R so that for example uh if if one of the super shapes might look something like a flower that R is changing based on the angle in a way like it's oscillated almost like you could just sort of do this with a sine wave like you could say you know R equals s of the angle which is that actually giving me like a backwards headache because there's so much wrapped up but anyway you get the idea I need to calculate R from Theta and in fact that's what this formula is doing it's saying 1 / R equals all of this stuff and fi being the angle or I'm saying Theta that's I think that's the Greek letter fi or F or I don't know everything's going wrong today and you know I can flip this one over R equals that so R equals that so I need to figure out a way of getting this formula in my code it's going to be a bit awkward I'm sure I'm going to make some mistakes but the other thing that's really important here is that looking deeper into this formula there are four constants oh A and B by the way ah okay so there there're actually more than four constants there's like six I think there's a b m that's not six yeah it is a b m N1 N2 and N3 So based on those values you are going to get a variety of different um of different results and you can see here if I look at this page you can see with different values of M we got these different results so hopefully I'm going to do this correctly and we'll see the results that are in that that are on this page so let's go to the um let's go to the code and this is actually just the code now that I picked up from the super ellipse um and you can see I'm running this here this is the super ellipse which is just changing uh one particular parameter to create these different kinds of ellipsoid patterns and I am now going to go here I actually don't need this particular function and I'm going to the thing that I'm going to leave in here which is the most most important thing is this so ultimately what I need is begin shape and shape every single angle and I need to get an X and A Y and I need to draw that vertex so this I need uh and then I'm I'm not going to worry about the slider thing right now we'll come back to that later what I also need is I need to have a bunch of constants so I'm going to say I have N1 I'm going to have N2 I'm going to have N3 I'm going to have M and I'm I'm going to have a and I'm going to have B now for Simplicity right now let's make everything one and obviously you know you can declare and initialize variables all in one line in all sorts of fancy ways but I'm just going to be very explicit about it those are all of my constants so I need to go back and forth I need two screens really because I really need to refer to this formula quite a bit but I think what might make things nice and actually you know Paul Bourke has a code for doing this here and I guess I could check it if I get confused or wrong something wrong but what I think would be useful to do is to create a function I'm going to do that up here and I'm going to create a function called a super shape and it gets an angle so this function receives an angle maybe I should call it Theta a for angle doesn't matter so it receives an angle and it needs to return back um uh R because that's what I'm trying to calculate so at the end I want to return R so let's see somehow and and I want to say VAR R equals 1 so let's just say right now let's say this is my function and then what I want to do here in this code is I want to say I want to say uh VAR R equals super shape of that angle and then I need to say x equals what R * cosine of that angle y = r * s of that angle and if I wanted to I could also like scale these up by some arbitrary value and I'm going to make that a separate variable like radius uh just to scale them up and I could probably build that I I'm doing something like ridiculous right now but I I'll fix this later um because it's returning one so the idea here is I should just see a circle okay great so this is working the idea here is that I have a function that takes the angle and sends back a value and then when sends back that value I do it for every I do it for every angle and I get this circle now of course I'm getting a perfect circle because no matter what the angle comes in I'm just returning one and now what I need to do is I need to get that super shaped formula in here so let's try to do that together and hopefully we get something that looks about right so I'm going to go back to Paul Borg's site one more time and so there's a bunch of things I need to calculate one is 1 / a Time cosine of m / 4 time Theta am I really going to be able to remember this h I'm going to call this uh I need some like I'll call this part one uh one oh I did something terrible so there's a constant called a so this I don't want this I want I want this to be called I'll call this Theta so one / Theta time cosine of m / 4 uh times that angle that's not Theta that's 1/ a Time cosine of theta which is the angle times m / 4 okay so that's this thing in here so then I need to take the absolute value of that and then I need to uh raise it to an exponent which is N2 which is to the N to power that's part one now I need to do part two which will probably be somewhat similar part two is 1 / B * s of the same thing to the N3 power okay so what did I say 1 divided by B and sign those are the only things that change and then this obviously needs to be part two part two this is N3 part two part two okay so now I've got that formula there in two different parts by the way this I think is a useful thing to do you got this big elaborate formula rather than to try to write it all out one line of code so divide it into Parts okay so we got that now let's see okay now I need to add them together so I'll say part three equals part one plus part two then I need to take the square root of it so I can probably do that just in this line of code square root right and then I need to multiply it by N1 so I just need to say N1 times that so that's that so oh and this should be part three with no space so this is mostly like me just like getting that formula in here okay I think we're pretty good shape I think I'm doing this right please please please now what else oh one / R equals all of this so if one divid R equals all this R should equal one divided by all of this right I could just flip that so I should be able to say uh and and actually I don't need this bar R equals I should just be able to say return oh there's a dangerous thing that could happen here return one divided by part three now I'm a little bit afraid of a divide by um of a divide by zero problem so I think I better put something in here like if part three equals z then return zero I don't know if that's correct we'll look in I'm oh and wait this is not n times wasn't there something no that is what yeah maybe this is right okay so I think I got this right and maybe there's something else that I did slightly wrong but but let's see if this is good enough I have a working version of this I can always check it if this doesn't seem to work right okay here we go so let's just see what happens now if I actually let this be and let this go oh and by the way I add this like radius thing uh equal to 100 I don't need I don't need a separate variable okay so let's now run this and I oh look at that that's promising so I got something that looks right but it's a slightly different uh slightly different shape so let's actually go in let's go to Paul bork's Page and um How do I get over here let's look at okay let's look at an example with n1al N2 equal N3 oh if m is zero I should get a circle let's at least test that so let me make m equals z ah perfect I got a circle so I think I did the code correctly so now if I go back here and I look at with all these equal to one but if I have m equal to 5 I should get that shape so let me uh change m equal to 5 and run it again close do I have something wrong this looks a little bit different um that's a little distressing um pause time out I'm gonna see if I have a problem because um let me check my other example I'm just going to see if if I did it wrong in both examp examples or the other one so the other one if I set m equal to 5 and oh this is uh annoying I'm just checking my other one oh you know what it might be I might not have as much resolution in the number of Point what's the root wrong the N1 root oh it's not the square root it's the N1 root ah thank you thank you uh I can't believe I made that mistake what a terrible mistake I just read that super quickly yeah this is not the square root it's not N1 times the square root it's the N1 root apologies for that so let me go back here and let me just make sure this power of part one 1 / N1 right this should be right that's the nth root of the two things uh let's see there we go that looks better and you know what I'm not getting um it doesn't look exactly right because I don't I'm I'm not doing I could do more points like if um here like this is so arbitrary like I'm doing this in a silly way like you can see now if I do more points I get a better version of the shape so I'm going to fix both of those things okay so let me put that back and what did I have uh what did I have in my function I had this N1 * square root okay so let me go back to the incorrect version there we go okay if I make the power negative1 divid by N1 you won't have to invert it later yes there's always a short hand thank you good suggestion okay back now I figured out the error so I had a major error actually I completely read the formula incorrectly this is not the square root of all of this times N1 this is symb this this the way that this is written means it's the N1 root of all of that added together in other words if N1 is equal to two then it's the square root so I really need to fix that in my code so let me do that briefly uh really quickly so instead instead of N1 * the square root I want to use the power function power takes something and if this is like to the n1's power part 1 plus part two to the n1's power if I say 1 / N1 here this is part one plus this is the N1 root of part one plus part two so I can do that and then if I do it again we can see aha now I have the correct shape but you'll notice something look at this there's like a weird like mistake here and you can see doesn't look exactly right here so one thing I've done very not carefully and let me fix that here is that I just decided in my Loop down here to just say ah let me look at every single angle start at zero go to 2 pi go up by 0.1 well that's not very thoughtful because 2 pi isn't necessarily perfectly divisible by 0.1 and it's not that many points I could say 0.01 and I'm going to increase the resolution of what I'm drawing much more you can see now it looks much more like that super shape but I probably would make sense for me to be a bit more thoughtful of it uh thought thoughtful and say something like a I want to have a total of 500 points and then I want to have the increment the angle increment to be 2 pi divided by that total and then I'm going to always go up by that increment so if I just do it that way then I can say this is 500 points that's what I get with 500 points and I could say something like oh whoops I only want 10 points and if you see that you're going to see it still looks right but there's only actually 10 points in there and it's there's much less curvature because it's drawing big straight lines between some of those points but this is I think a better way of being able to control this you know with 100 points looks like this so like what how many points do I really need to get kind of like a good resolution on that shape and when I do this in 3D we'll need some sort of mesh I hope I can do it in 3D okay so let's look at this now now I have this slider down here let's at least do something like tie that slider to a particular value so for example what if I were to say so one thing I want to do here is one thing that's interesting is that I want my I want actually the increment values of M to be uh incrementing by one so I want to start with an m of five and I want to go between 0 and 10 uh and then what I want to do here in the draw Loop is just say m equals slider. value so we can just sort of make sure things are oh oops. value make sure things are kind of working you can see now you can see as I move the slider that shape is changing and we're seeing we're getting exactly what is written or depicted on this Paul Bor website so you can see m is four I should get that m is five is that now I can see okay what are these shapes here what if I have n1al N2 N3 equals. 3 um now I could change all of these and obviously I could be much smarter about not having uh three separate variables uh if they're all the same value and now we can see what does this look like you can see now I have this particular kind of shape and you can see what it's doing as I change that value of n M so I'm going to stop here because I could continue doing this forever I could say oh let's make sliders for all the different variables let's try all of these different possibilities let's see can we get all of these different shapes so this is what I would encourage you to do and by the way you don't have to tie them to sliders try tying those variables to like a sign function um you know I could do that really really quickly right now like for example if I have uh I'm going to have a variable called like uh oscillate oscillate equals z and I'm going to say m equals uh you map sign of oscillate which goes between negative 1 and 1 to some value between 0 and 10 and then I'm going to say oscillate goes up by 0.1 and I'm going to refresh this you can see now this is happening that's happening very quickly but automatically so let's let's make it go up much more slowly and you can see here what's happening is it's kind of like changing that value on the Fly and the shape is kind of like wrapping around itself unfurling and furling so there's a lot of possibilities here I could add HSB and make it a rainbow but I encourage you to explore this play around with it see what types of forms you can get and uh eventually at some point I will get to that next video and try to do this in 3D to get a lot more elaborate forms okay thanks for watching this particular video and I look forward to uh seeing you in another one in the future byebye okay um so thank you guys uh uh for watching uh today it is 104 p.m. I don't remember how long this stream has now been in two parts so I'm going to uh um um going to have to do something with maa's help uh certainly to like possibly edit them together and publish the archim as one long video um but hopefully you got something out of it I think I got three new tutorials today basic sound synthesis sound envelope and uh this uh super shape so uh I also have another video tutorial that's in the backlog so this stuff will get um uploaded and over the weekend and early next week I'll be releasing these Standalone videos uh one at a time uh by the way if anybody's interested in the patreon and the slack Channel I offer download uh Google Drive share access for all of my video files if you want to watch this stuff online you can subscribe to that uh I'm going to just take a look at the chat for a couple minutes to see if there's any um to see uh to see if there's any comments you could randomly multiply each vertex by a number between zero and two and look really spiky says Michael that's a great suggestion you could use pearlin noise for example um uh I by the way I did pee when I had that sound issue and I restarted the computer I ran and peed so I didn't make it this full two and a half hours without peeing which doesn't really happen to me very often uh uh um so by the way um mam says they're waiting waiting for the genetic algorithm and machine learning series soon I 100% am fully prepared to do machine uh genetic algorithm videos but I was kind of waiting the Caden course that I have running right now the next session that opens up for genetic algorithm videos so unfortunately I don't have uh I don't have ownership over over those videos to put them as part of my YouTube channel um maybe that's something I can work out with Caden but um you'll be able to check that out Michael ask are there streams every day unfortunately there are not I would actually I mean I do have this sort of like pretend weird fantasy of moving to the country and having a garage and just doing this every day as my job but currently I work I'm I'm on summer break right now but I work fulltime at New York University at a program called ITP um over the summer now I'm I'm kind of able to do this twice a week um there I'm going to be a way for a week in July and a away for a week or two possibly in August in which case there will be no live streams but I'm committed to having four live streams per month that's what I'm sort of saying for the patreon that I have going um and my goal is to in the fall to be doing this once a week and actually be teaching my NYU courses along with this video series online so but we'll see how much this grows and whether it's useful or interesting to people maybe I'll become a person who does this every day at some time um but until I'm making enough money to uh support myself I don't think every day is is realistic uh okay uh there's oh oh yeah so Darth I think you're still asking about the array index out of bounds exhibit I will try to take a look at that at some point um uh if anybody uh wants to take a look at that uh there's an issue apparently with the code that I posted for the terrain generator where if
