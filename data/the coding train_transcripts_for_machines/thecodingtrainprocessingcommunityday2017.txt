hello apologies for this hat but I a kid too I was wearing it earlier I can't take it off because I have terrible hat hair okay what you're about to watch is my session at processing Community Day which was a day that happened past fall in Boston I'm posting a video of my session on the coding train YouTube channel mostly so that people see it and know to go to the processing foundation YouTube channel where all of the talks and presentations from all the different fellows and different artists are all there available for you to watch so I will include a link to the processing foundation's youtube channel subscribe the processing foundation to watch all these other videos you can actually just stop this video right now and get over there to watch them all there but if you want you can keep watching and my coding train session from the processing day will be happening next enjoy Thank You tae Yoon thank you to you for having this weird idea to try this I I want to first say that I have no plan which was to keep it on I at one point I sort of thought oh should I make some slides and like have some sort of like presentation and then I realized it wouldn't be an authentic and plus I you know it was easier for me to just relax on the train and not try to make up too much of a plan I'm going to attempt in some way somehow to recreate this is very weird that there's people here it's actually quite nice and and I may be that this is now then gonna be the new thing forget about this internet thing so I thought I I thought I'm now I'm feeling very uncomfortable for some reason so I thought I would doing something I like to do that helps me feel a little more comfortable and read from this book which is called a million random digits anybody have anybody have a request of which page you really like alright this is page 300 and I'm gonna actually go to page 322 and you can see we can figure out why at some point but hmm ten thousand four hundred and three oh wait it's story time twenty seven thousand five hundred seventyfive ninety five thousand nine hundred forty two actually feels less weird to do this by myself in a room with a camera than with ax people out there but eighty six thousand three hundred and thirty one forty five thousand four hundred sixty seven seventy five thousand four hundred sixty seven forty two thousand three hundred seventy seven twenty seven thousand six hundred eighty one fifty one thousand three hundred fifty nine and ten thousand okay thank you that was Jeb preciate you humoring me for me to attempt to do that I I also I brought this train whistle because I don't know I thought that would help um so what I thought I would attempt to do usually I spend at least forty five minutes doing absolutely nothing and then eventually I get to some coding tutorial but since I have a watch here since I'm this is only supposed to be about 45 minutes in its entirety I thought I would start by actually trying to code something I'm looking to work so so look so to the theme okay so first let me talk about something the theme one of the themes for a community is clouds I don't know clouds community but cloud is one of the themes of processing day and you might not actually be aware if you look at my name tag on but if you look at your name tag each one of your name tags has unique generative cloud created with p5.js and so what I'm gonna do is pull up right now this where do I want to go so I want to go to community clouds so this is a github repository so first of all by the way if you happen to have a laptop with you and you want to like pull it out and like code some stuff along I'm gonna walk through making something and posting it to this github repository but this is a github repository called community clouds and if I scroll down I'm gonna go to this link right here I'm going to open that new tab and here you might recognize on let's let's do something like processing you might recognize like as I click or I think if I use the arrow keys it's gonna scroll through all these different cloud designs and you might recognize the cloud design that's on your nametag is one of the ones up here and these are all have all been submitted by various viewers or processing programmers and artists and different people so right here we can see this is I was looking for the one that's the one that has the Train on it but this is a nice one by merging D H and you can change some color and change your name and I think even like download an SVG did that actually work let's go see what's there there we go so this is what was used to generate the clouds that are on your name packs the actual names are handwritten in the font I'm told is Danielle that's the font yeah Danielle wrote most of them and I think a variety people wrote them so what I thought I would do today is kind of try to do make a cloud design and then this clouds by the way made by Simon who is a seven year old actually he's just turned eight and he lives in Antwerp he's homeschooled and likes to watch coding videos all day long Simon I wanted to just give it shot out to Simon because he's a very dedicated viewer so I'm scrolling through these oh here we go this is submitted by Niels Weber with a nice little cloud in the Train alright so we're doing this I guess aren't we so what I'm gonna do I also had this crazy idea that maybe I would try to do this at the same time in processing and p5.js I thought if I had like a multiple monitor setup I could kind of like do them both at the same time that won't really work but I can go back and forth three into two so I'm gonna try to come up with a technique maybe we're gonna try to make the cloud look something like this you can code along if you want and then Astro after a little bit of time what I'll try to do although maybe I'll just mention this right now is there is a on this repository there's JavaScript file called generators J s me i M so me that's in our internet handle me I am so me created this system so if I click on generators J what you'll actually see here is that this is just an example if you write a function and that draws something and you can actually even return some values to define a rectangle of like where it's safe to draw text but that's actually not even important just this writing a function to draw something and then you add this line of code called register with the name of your fun the name of your function the name this is this could probably use some help to be a little more explanatory but I think this is supposed to be the title like processing day cloud and then this would be the name Daniel Schiffman or however you pronounce it so and by the way Jared Schiffman who was mentioned a bunch of times this morning I should point out spells his name with the C which i think is the correct spelling so I apologize for my the falling of my name it's no see no relation although I've ever been in the same room at the same time so there's an Internet conspiracy theory for you okay so let me go on here this is not going nearly as well as I had imagined it was gonna go alright so let's try this so I have this idea thank you taehyun for king down this whiteboard which i did have a black mark for at one point a hairless so i thought it would do in order to create a cloud so right now you see there's a p5.js sketch and it's got it's just using the ellipse function so the ellipse function draws a circle and one day one one way we could think about a cloud i think and by the way i sort of also had this idea of people could like shout out suggestions yes like go see if that works i don't know maybe that was a bad idea if we think of this cloud as assertive we think of this circle is having a radius I'll call that R the distance between the center and the edge there is a way that we can compute all of the points around this circle based on an angle relative to the xaxis maybe I could call that the Greek letter theta which is often used for signifying an angle could also just say angle but I can compute all of these points by keeping the same radius and changing the angle and that way if I do that I can use these functions that are in processing in p5 called begin shape and n shape said all these vertices and I could draw exactly that same circle so that's what I want to start with if we could draw exactly that same circle then we can as a group are just me I don't know come up with some interest interesting ways to think about moving the these points a little bit around because what is this cloud other than an ellipse with some kind of like points of the ellipse kind of moved a little bit down it's actually interesting to think about I was thinking of using a sine wave to start with the sine wave is a nice pattern that looks like this it's actually just realizing if we take this bottom part and flip it up just thought of this actually while I was sitting in the other talk we could flip it up and we might get something that looks kind of like this which would be perhaps closely resembling this cloud and I and I have a feeling that one of these I'm sure if we scroll if I scroll through these it would find one that does exactly that but okay so what do you guys that good idea any suggestions yes pearly noise okay so that's good so we should definitely let me make a list here Perlin noise is probably something that would be nice to fold in here so one thing that's interesting about all these clouds or most of them at least is website I lost that URL is that you'll notice I don't know what I if I'm kind of like typing the name here oh no it's giving me a different cloud each time but if I was keeping on the same that's interesting way to spell processing if I was keeping on the same cloud each one of these will render itself a different way cuz it's a different algorithm so you know I might first start with the cloud that just looks the same every time but this idea of procedural design how could I have an algorithm that that its essence is the idea of this cloud but it's going to be different every time it's run all right let's let's go go to p5 the way this is actually the p5 GS web editor presented by Cassie earlier this morning and lots of other people have contributed to this thing it's amazing I haven't been using it in my videos yet but I hope to eventually soon but Cassie said go for it today I'm very excited to try so one thing that I'm gonna do I'm not even locked let me login oh boy do I have it I know I have an account that I use for teaching that wanted the class that I teach now it's called ICM so let me do I don't know the password that's really not good all right usually this is the point where I would like waste about 20 minutes like trying to look for the password for something while people are still arguing about whether like C++ or Java or something is faster in like the YouTube chat that's generally what it what it is um okay so do now is I'm gonna start with this idea of begin shape and you shout out if you can't read something or if you have a question cuz this is like instead of like a live YouTube chat that I'm kind of looking at trying to answer questions you are real people with real voices in in real life they are right good point all right so I'm gonna just start I'm just gonna do something really simple just to start like through the really basics I'm gonna say vertex 100 100 vertex 200 100 vertex 200 200 just to see that this idea works vertex 100 200 so what I try to do there in my head is kind of think about the points of a square so you know 100 100 200 you can see this path that gets filled and one thing I do here under n shape is I can add clothes and now it closes it so it's sort of hard for you to see this because of the projector quality but if i zoom in you can see what I've done now is I've unpacked the function that draws a square and I've drawn it with individual vertices which means you know I could do something like if I wanted to this first vertex could be determined by where the mouse is so that's so I have this dynamic shape so what I want to do now is which time do I have I will refer you to my video tutorial you go out in the hallway and watch it about polar Cartesian port now that's not a good idea so what do you need to in order to do that we need to do a little bit of math and the math comes from a field of mathematics called trigonometry the study of the sides the relation ship between the angles of a right triangle and the sides of a triangle you know what I drew this kind of poorly but this makes a triangle here so if this is an angle and this is the radius of that circle I want to calculate that points how far to move across the X and how far to move up why and I do I wasn't Joey I do have a video tutorial where I go through this in a bit more detail but the it turns out there's a really nice formula for that which I can say x equals R times cosine of theta and y equals R times theta so the reason why it's you know I kind of like this idea of saying oh and by the way let now I don't know what that means exactly but that person because you're wondering I think you're on switch I haven't fully wrapped my head around but someday I'm gonna be a constant person very good so let R equal and I should probably say something like radius I have a bad habit of using one letter variable names so if I say radius equals 100 and I say angle equals and look there you want to say 45 degrees wouldn't it be nice and I'm gonna get rid of this now I mean we're gonna need begin shape and end shape again I'm gonna put this console down here just give myself a little more space wouldn't it be nice if I could just say something like point radius comma angle and we're at that point it's there is that so I drew a point but it's a value excellent matter what I call a variable name I could pick up I could call it you know unicorn and puppy it's not gonna draw a unicorn it's just the name that I made so what I want a p5 and most computer graphic systems only think in terms of Cartesian coordinate systems which is the XY stuff so that I can take those formulas and I could say let X equal radius times what did I say cosine of the angle and I can say let y equal radius times sine of the angle I'm trying to check the time and and then I could say point X comma Y and then where's that point now that's mutters at the book oh there it is so where is it actually is it 45 degrees from where so let me draw a line from zero zero to that that'll help us see it a little better stroke wait for and let me say line 0 0 X Y so what actually happened is I'm drawing it at a rotation of 45 but not degrees so that's the other thing I have to remember is that most computer graphics programming systems don't you know I might think of like this is 180 degrees this is 90 degrees of this like that's how I intuitively think of angles in a unit of measurement called degrees but most computer graphic systems using you know metric called radians insert link to other video tutorial about radians maybe I don't know so you can I don't if you can insert a hyperlink on a whiteboard but I just say hyperlink anymore is that a thing so but one thing I can do with p5 which is rather nice is I could say angle mode degrees so I can actually just have it think and turn and now you can see oh it's actually a 45 degrees it's actually you can see that line is at a 45 degree angle but I want to think about this from the center so one thing I can do to do that is I can say translate I better save this it's too late now and I think we're gonna by the way hoping this session we're also gonna debug a little bug the web if you have Auto refresher on it kind of crashes so they were and all of you can file everyone can file a github issue all together at once it'll be like a four unknowns okay so what I'm gonna do now if I can retain my train of thought is all right I was saying translate so first of all I'm gonna save this let's first I'm going to make it give it a name this is called process processing Community Day cloud let's do that and I'm gonna hit save now incidentally if this is a little bit hard for you to just like memorize or track down but if you go to this link right now which is alpha editor p5.js org slash ICM sketches and then this crazy sequence of characters you will actually open up the code that I'm typing it won't update in real time we don't have some we don't have that kind of fancy realtime mindmeld thing going on just yet but if you want to start with the code that I have you could certainly do that and if your log if you've logged into your own account the thing you can actually do is you can say implicate so you actually won't see an option for save because you're opening a sketch from my account you'll see an option called duplicate which you can then duplicate and then save but we'll see we'll see how well things work for your using this so I'm gonna say translate with / / now there it is at least I'm drawing this line from the center and what would happen by the way if I just made this angle a global variable and I just said something like angle + + so we can see this line is now spinning because I'm just changing the angle the radius is not changing if I made the radius a global variable I don't know if this has a point to it I was gonna are actually just make it a random value if I made the radius something random you can see it's doing that as it's spinning around so right now I'm just showing you how to trace that path but instead of doing doing that as an animation what if I did all of the points around the circle a one time through draw and to do that all I would need to do is say for what let angle equals zero angle like you can't not do this out typing eye angle is less than I don't know 360 degrees angle plus + and let's try to see if I can create a little bit of additional space here so the code is visible oh that's not gonna be enough space for this and then if I do this and then I know what I'm doing anymore oh let's get rid of this angle plus + and do this there we go and the radius is changing like crazy okay there we go so now you can see I've drawn all those lines I don't want them to be lines let's look at them as points there's so many of them which is kind of unnecessary right now let's go 5 degrees for every point there we go you can see so I've traced these and by the way interestingly enough if I say well I was gonna say X radius but another term for that might be with but it half with I know what's call I'm gonna call it X radius that's probably like a weird thing to call it and Y radius if I make the X radius 200 you can see this is now how I now have an elliptical path okay we're somewhere let's make it even lower resolution 15 lets save you save as like 15 times we keep all of our old versions where we've been okay so now what I want to do begin shape and shape and vertex made a circle because can we be done now it's very kind of you to applaud the sort of badly drawn circle that doesn't so let's add clothes it is interesting to see here let's add also just for right now let me say no fill and then we can see here and and then I'm gonna I'm like overly neurotic about spacing I'm gonna move that over a little bit so I'm tempted to translate this into processing because I said I was gonna do them both but maybe I'll try to do that more at the end so now we're somewhere Amen have any questions or thoughts or ideas yes strokeweight and no Phil are those always global or could they be tied to specific objects it's a great question so those functions they they almost they set a global state in a way so it's they this there's a state of no way you can almost think of the p5 or processing system as there's you know a person with a marker or a big bag of markers who's looking ready to go I've got some thick markers some thin ones a bunch of different colors so every time you would set something like say fill 255 comma 0 0 processing the brain would kind of go and pull out the red marker it's gonna use it continuously until you say fill something else so it's they really do apply if if I only if I put stroke wait for no fill everything I draw on this entire sketch will have those but if I had something at the bottom where it was like oh I'm also drawing you know a little rectangle at the top right corner oops by the way I translated the center to the center which is easy to forget that I've done that like why is that not in the top I was thought it would be the top left but if I wanted to put it in the top left I could say like 200 200 but the point of what I was saying is now if I give this a different setting so to speak you're gonna see that we've got red there now so it's really up to you to manage that to figure out like I want I need to collect pieces of my code together and ultimately a nice way of managing that is with something called one way of managing they have something called objectoriented programming which I am avoiding for the sake of today other questions or ideas yes oh yeah make that a variable yeah yeah so that's a great idea so actually that's what I mean so this should you know you could I think you could make the argument that anytime you see a number that's not written as a variable you might want to make that a variable but you can adjust it and play with it and actually one of the really things this is one of the things I love about p5 let's do this I'm like all right like what I gotta get to the cloud part but let's say I made that a variable and I called it and by the way I've done something kind of weird and awkward here which I put my variable definitions in between set up and draw it's fine step size equals 15 so we can see this if I make this step size and one of the things I want to try to do right now is I'm gonna say I'm gonna create something called and this is something you can't easily do in processing okay hold on alright now I can't live with myself anymore I'm gonna move this up here it works either way and this should think this one's probably supposed to be Const I think it's was VidCon somebody will teach me about Const after this slide are equals create slider and this is part of a library that's part of did it appear anywhere hold on let me give it some numbers 0 oh we're gonna do some debugging hold on 550 25 do you see a slider anywhere over here oh wait let's try it stop and start okay maybe oh the problem happened or let's look at the console oh good where I was worried that we wouldn't have any bugs oh no bug here okay we must go to level 2 here view developer here comes console okay so I think we did actually so this is the bug that let me go to github right now I'm gonna show you I I really would love help figuring this bug out I know that Cassie would too and I think it was originally reported by Kate who's at UCLA and was a google Summer of Code student worked on WebGL Kate's awesome so I'm gonna Kate haul them back so hold on processing p5 I love that this bug came up live oh no at website editor web editor oh my god there's too many do I have the URL memorized I do okay so now I'm gonna go into issues and I'm gonna look down here this can't save sketch sketch corrupted so this is an error that we could see that I posted so one thing here's the thing about filing good and helpful bug reports I'm not saying that I've done this but he's hard for you to to follow to read some of this text but you can see Kate first posted about this error had the same error I tried to I figure out I noticed that was only happening when auto fresh related and then hey this actually was during class I had a different github account we kind of figured out that this code caused this error but I think what would be really useful anyone wants to take this as a project under themselves for the afternoon would be to try and maybe do a screencast and like leave the JavaScript console open put Auto refresh on see if you can figure out an exact sequence of characters to type in the web editor that causes this error to happen I will tell you that right now if this error happens for you you're this strategy to get around this error is this is very fancy select all copy refresh reload and it'll be at some state before it broke ah look at that the single apostrophe oh yeah I know I'm a little afraid to use my pathetic soundboard effects too much but so I wonder if I've already broken it again but I'm just gonna do a paste and then I'm gonna try doing this now we have the slider so what I wanted to show you which is exciting about you working in the browser is you can get some of these interface elements for free essentially this is just a plain vanilla I guess is what's offered a job as a Mel five input element a range element it's a slider and P five the Dom library has some nice hooks into that so I could say here step size equals slider dot value so now if I do this we can see that I can kind of like work with the resolution of that particular and I and at what you might be wondering what is this range this is the range so the range is between five and fifty and the default value is 25 so if I wanted to kind of and I didn't want to put it at zero if I put it at zero I've got a problem because if this value ever gets to be zero we're gonna have an infinite loop browser crashing thing okay so I made that a little thing we can play with that should be interesting let me give it a bigger range just to and start it something like this okay got to keep moving here it's three o'clock yours I'm like I have to leave and go home for dinner but that's not what's happening now so I'm usually never mind I don't know how many's actually watched one of these live streams that really don't recommend that you watch them you can watch the machiya by the way is here you can raise your hand and the audience he helps with all of the video editing from Enys from originally from Montreal yes but living somewhere else in Canada right now okay so what do I want to do here okay so let's try this sine wave idea now interestingly enough I'm already using like sine and cosine so this is kind of this crazy thing going on whereas the idea of the sine function the trigonometry function sine is that it calculates the value of in a right triangle of the length of the opposite side of the angle divided by the hypotenuse which in this case is y divided by our sine of the angle equals y divided by R and so you can see how this formula is just another way of writing that but it just also so happens that if you take the sine of a value and you just increment that value over time you get a number that oscillates between that's positive 1 and negative 1 smoothly and it doesn't you could this is sort of a wave pattern this is this would not be smooth this would be perfectly linear like a like a triangle wave I think it's sometimes called somebody who knows about sound or something will know something about this whereas this is more like a sine wave so what I want to do is apply the sine wave somehow to this X radius and Y radius so I could probably reuse that angle because I already have this value that's incrementing but let's kind of be safe and let's just I'm gonna this might be a bad idea but I might just have a different variable called a and what I want to do is I want to basically say that X radius equals I'm gonna say 200 plus some offset and Y radius equals what did I set those values up as originally I mean these should be local variables now clean this all up laters fine so what what I say 100 plus offset so the idea here is that I want I need to have some sort of offset so that's no offset that's an offset of 100 just making every radii bigger but now if I can have the offset oscillate differently so between plus one and negative one so if I were to say sine of a times 20 and now the angle is the same and sine of 0 is what is that one zero somebody knows it's very stressful to do math in front of a live audience try it really it's like some people are good at it's not me okay so so but now I can increase that angle so I think what would be interesting here is to say something like this yeah let's increase it more yeah let's increase it more let's oh this is looking great now there we go that looks totally like a cloud right oh my god it's terrible so it's no I didn't change it to degrees everything is now in degrees so so interestingly enough I have a feeling that the step size is gonna be our friend here oh we want it to be smaller there we go that kind of looks more like the sine wave you know I probably could if I just kind of got rid of that stroke rate of four it's gonna appear so much much smoother now so I'm gonna I'm actually going to just for the moment let's give an initial step size of five and okay so so here's let's at least try the what I like to do with my youtube channel is make really ugly stuff because I don't have any talent in that area but at least kind of hopefully explain it somewhat well and then people with talent make it beautiful so that's sort of what I'm hoping will happen here because I haven't um but let's at least go this one further step a couple further steps one is let's think about the absolute valley let's think about never letting a sine oscillate back down to negative one so what if has its oscillating towards negative one it stops and keeps going right back up I think we could achieve that instantly with the absolute value perfect maybe I should prepare these in advance that could be good let's make the canvas a little bit wider just so we can kind of see this better and we can you know we got some variables we can play with here to do so all sorts of strange things all right so this is the basic idea let's just pretend just there's just because I want to add the sort of Perlin noise thing and think about some ways to make it smoother and we could try curve vertex that's a way to maybe smooth it out but let me at least let me at least show you you were following along and you you arrived at this moment and it still has that weird red rectangle over there which I almost feel like we need to leave in because it's like it must mean something right I'll comment it out so one of the things I can do now is I can go to here let's see so this this this is a this system which generates that website if you have never made a pull request before on github this might be a place for you to give it give it a try I was this is a hopefully fairly friendly so you do you know if you haven't done a pull request before so this is the URL I guess I'll try to like publish all these URLs or beat them or something like that or this will get recorded anyway you can't find it it's github.com slash coding trained community clouds and you would have to you do have to have a github account but once you're signed into your account when I'm logged in as myself somehow that's gonna be a little bit of a problem but that's fine there's this button right here so for only 1995 doesn't cost anything I have tutorials on get and github that you could get outside no I don't but if you want to know more about getting it up I also have some other tutorials but so without the full story what I basically can do is this edit says I want to propose a change to this file so if I click Edit and the MIT Media Lab magical internet will then land me in here and I can now I'm in a text editor I'm gonna zoom in so you can see what I'm doing and I'm gonna write function I'm gonna call this PCD cloud and I'm just gonna braid a function with an open curly bracket and a close curly bracket then I'm gonna rather it with terrifying way oh I'm go back to here and I'm gonna think about okay what have I done let's see one thing that we could be sure about yeah the sliders gonna be a problem there's a few things that I've done I don't have this translates gonna be a problem mmhmm it's okay everything can be fixed later so I'm gonna go grab all this code and I'm gonna just the code that draws this design idea and this is for a fixed design I'm going to now come and paste it in here and there it is so let's look at this a little bit okay step size was try five and probably these variables need to be eyeball in code and just assuming it's gonna work it's generally not a good idea why not you should you just live on the edge okay so here we go so now what I need to do is I also need to register this function so I'm gonna say what did I call it PCD cloud I'm gonna call it processing community day let me just call it pc d pc d cloud and then this is by processing community heard dispel in front of people okay so now I'm gonna go I'm gonna go down now here's the thing I have this nice fancy button because of all this power that I wield on the internet now I have this button that says commit changes which means it's going to commit directly to the master branch which is Matt that's just a fancy word for that's the actual code that's running on the webpage oh there's a question yeah oh I spelled it wrong I'll live corrections this is awesome usually I usually I I find out about it like two weeks later and I have a sleepless night of some can I totally messed up thank you so now I'm gonna go down this is very hard to do this all with zoom let's see let me zoom out scroll down up scroll over here okay so you won't see this option because you unless you're me which might be an interesting like Freaky Friday thing right but you you could what you'll probably see is some variation of this but basically want to propose this I'm gonna simulate not being myself in proposing this change and actually I don't know me I am so me who has been they've been helping me manage these pull requests might actually be in England somewhere live on the internet not watching this but waiting for me to do this because I mentioned I might try to do this and maybe it'll get maybe it'll get merged so I'm it proposed file change and once I do that you think you're done but it's like reminding me okay this is live from processing day I don't have anything else to say still live from processing day and I spelled live wrong this is an ugly cloud that I made it's not ugly let's not be mean to the cloud this is a cloud that I made as an example it's a view to all clouds are beautiful okay so now I'm gonna create the pull request I'm gonna request me I am so be to review it and then I'm gonna hit create pull request and one of the things that we've created this poll Chris I can actually just go and merge it maybe I will one we could do just as sort of see as I could say file change one thing that's nice here is if I were the one reviewing it and I could say you know maybe you should learn about Const which is definitely a comment I get a lot and add a single comment okay so so yeah you can I forget that you can't exactly see what I'm typing so this is the idea so I have now made a cloud I have registered pull request I don't I'm not going to merge it let's what do we have like ten more minutes here so I think what I do is I would like to either take questions which could be just about anything like I can step out character but if there is no it's just me but I could read some more random numbers but um but I can answer questions that are more meta if people are interested in like about teaching or processing or about how this like what YouTube stuff if you want to ask I could also take a few I didn't get to the Perlin noise suggestion which is like an excellent one so I might leave that as an exercise but if there's some time or you have a suggestion I'm happy to try it but let me see what questions there might be yeah yeah good great question so one of the reasons why the web editor isn't fully out there it's like cafe I think said like open secret or something it's because we a we haven't taken the time to announce it and make sure all the people have put so much time and work into it get our have a nice moment to get credit for all this work and also because we haven't fully documented and information about how to use it but that question easily could come up so this is all we hosted on Amazon Web Services so I don't mean to get so technical here but it's running there's a it's an AWS instant so there's a server and it has your account your name and your password stored encrypted and so your code is saved database associated with your account you can if right now if I wanted to do file download it will download a zip of all of the code and another thing that I'm not showing you here if I go over to the here as you can see this is actually these are the files associated with this particular sketch it's just a CSS file if I wanted to add that which I'm not it's an index.html file which has references the p5 libraries and then this is the actual code that I'm writing and so the reason why you know we make these kind of decisions when we talked about this and gone back and forth but the idea is that that is not open at first and this is meant to be a platform you know I like to think of the audience for this as like it's three hours on a Saturday and people want to learn something about programming and make something and be able to share it really quickly on so I I'm tempted to keep showing you all these other features but eh I want to let others who have actually developed all these features show those when the time comes and also I would just be here for hours if I started like thinking about all that weird right here yes yeah yes so the intention is for that to always be true I mean currently right now I'm sorry there is no distinction between public and private sketches in a way like everything's private because you could never find it if you don't know the URL but on that in the other hand everything is public because there's no nothing's hidden behind anything if you have the URL so the intention is to and actually this has been a really amazing tool for me teaching in that hike work on an example in class I used to jump through all these hoops died for like email it to the students or like posted to github or I've custom it now I just send them an email after class with links to five sketches and of course there's you can imagine so many more possible features in terms of a classroom I've seen soon on here in the audience here who's developed something called open processing which is via has a lot of similar features to the web editor but is much more geared towards the social aspect of being able to collect and share and teach with collections of sketches and this really read the moment is just focusing on kind of editing the code editing experience yeah but so definitely if you're teaching there another web editor that we definitely check out is open processing org yeah I'm gonna long time ago I made if I google video lesson documentation Schiffman I think this Sun comes up with a blog post from this is from 2013 so this is pretty out of date but the system I'm using is mostly the same so I so what I have is this actually used to be my all this is my office at NYU but I found a closet that had some filing cabinets so a page that painted a wall green have a standing desk and a computer and a machine and a camera so everything goes through one mac tower the camera input the input from my laptop the input from the mic and I'm using software I used to use software called Wirecast which is commercial software for live broadcasting and I recently started using something called open broadcasting studio and so this is that so you know I don't know to what you know I kind of have jumped through all these hoops to kind of have an elaborate setup in terms of a green screen and live compositing and like you know iPad was sound and this to try to be escort of goofy and creative with it as possible and the truth of the matter is there's no reason why I couldn't just download this right now turn on my webcam you know put my face in the corner and live stream me doing this I could have just done that from this room right now maybe I should have done that but so I would encourage people if you're interested too don't you just to like try it and I'm happy I can be helpful to it the things that I've really been trying to do and I promised myself I wouldn't open up my YouTube page in this but there's no other way all right revert your eyes for a minute I guess I just have to revert my own eyes all right one of the things that I'm trying to do is have more and more guests so if I go to playlist quickly we're gonna get off of this before this even starts playing playlists yes Oh YouTube by the way YouTube this is very YouTube is great yeah YouTube it has its issues it's been wonderful for me to be able to discover it but I think if I click here it gives me all playlists no save playlists this is nuts I ran to this the other day created playlists it's just showing me featured playlists there we go I would like to look see here's tiga I think was somewhere I saw thought I saw his face no I saw Claire's face who's dying so I've been trying to have more guests here we go guest tutorials and interviews and sorry there's Claire look so this is something that trying to do more of which is there's two aspects of this one is that studio that I have in New York I'm opening it up at the moment for like students and other people who work at NYU to use it if anybody is interested or know somebody wants to make a video tutorial and I'm opening it up for people to make video tutorials and own and take that content anywhere they want I have discovered that people seem to enjoy publishing a tutorial through my channel just because it has now it has this sort of builtin audience it has you know pros and cons there but so one of the things I'm trying to do is create opportunities and think about ways for more voices and faces and people from different backgrounds and places in the world to be able to make tutorials as well so that's um that's one thing that I'm really interested in and was kind of in a way the original idea for like setting up this more prop this studio thing yes yeah I'm asking him to talk about how yeah how how you think pedagogically about sort of individual horses races versus this kind of years long per grant and right hopefully more years yeah it's it's a really good question and it's one that I really struggle with and don't have like a clear like oh I know I know how it all works this is it but it's definitely I'm trying to find it by I do think of what I'm doing with these video tutorials as something very different than something in a classroom setting or you know protected this is very presentational but what could be more like a workshop setting in person it's my hope that these videos support classroom settings but and they and I and mostly a lot of times what I end up the videos I think of as in a similar way as similar to how a textbook might support a classroom setting but certainly one of the things I aspire to do more is less like it which is which is weird for me to say because it's basically that all I do on the YouTube channel but less like let me just show you how to do stuff and talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and more let's try something together let's let's ask the questions let's try to solve it together so more interactive workshop exercises in class type stuff and part of the reason why I like try to do these videos in theory is to try to allow more time for that in class to have fall back to some more presentational content if that's a useful way to learn it and one thing that I do think is really important to state is that everybody learns in a different way and that while these videos are hopefully useful to met some people they are not useful to other people there's you know questions around accessibility of course as well I'm you know not all these videos are captioned so this is something that I really have to hopefully we'll continue to be more thoughtful about engage more people with to try to figure out better ways to to reach more people and be more inclusive yes hi first thing I want to say your some and I want to be like you when I grow up okay thank you would you have as an educator but you have like some kind of high level advice for other people who are trying to teach these techniques of using programming and being creative and being expressive in other settings oh yeah classrooms or even on other online practices yeah do you recommend other people yeah well to be very broad and kind of openended about it I would say to me the things that are important for me to keep in mind or don't make any assumptions about what people know every and like just and so don't make any assumption what people know slow down let things have time to breathe and and then just try to find the stuff that you're excited about and show that excitement through teaching so I think that when you're excited about trying something the people who are part of the learning process will be more apt to be engaged I think about learning that as well but really I just that I think it's really difficult and I fall into this trap all the time I was saying API the other day and in a context like over and over and over again and finally somebody said what's an API and you know I'm you know that person like took a lot of courage to ask that question because that person probably thought no of everybody else in the room knows and I'm the doesn't like you're all wondering what API is maybe my video tutorial on it's like this is like my sales pitch here but I'm so this something I think yep to create an environment where people feel comfortable doing that is really important I'm not saying I know how to do that something I aspire to do or try to do I saw there was another question here yeah it was actually quite similar to that one but it's more like what do you think are qualities of a person who's trying to be an educator that people recognize you as being kind of like successful is at being able to transmit kind of like this high level or or technical stuff in a approachable way and that's what I think that people really appreciate and what if you can what can you extract from your experience that might be that people might be able to kind of like translate and incorporate into their own I don't know yes difficult questions I mean one one thing I would say is that it's always helpful for me when I get feedback from people saying oh the way that this was or something this didn't make sense to me or this did and I'm kind of accumulating that knowledge and iterating so I think that having some kind of dialogue and feedback system is certainly a part of the prop I mean for me I you know I would and it's hard to you know I would learn things the best once I had to teach them so I think it's kind of having that a you have to check I don't know what the right way to phrase this is because but you know I think maybe if I just think about this kind of trigonometry stuff for a setup for a moment like this might have been stuff that when I was first learning to code I was kind of using and sort of understand but until I had to explain it to somebody I didn't feel like I maybe understood it myself I understood it in a new way once I had to explain it to someone and I spent a lot of time just helping people individually and that's actually still my favorite as much as I love doing this YouTube stuff and it's kind of like insane and and interesting and this weird thing that's kind of happened to me for my life but I the thing that I enjoy most is like oneonone helping people with code stuff it's just so and I think that's where I am as a student I was always helping other students so I think this one thing I would say if you want to get started and think about teaching teach to one person you know that's like a really good comfortable and interesting and rewarding place to start practice like I mean I'd see be like I I I don't know if I taught this course where I machine learning is kind of like this field that I'm trying to figure out if I can teach and I tried to do a course at ITP in the spring that I felt was kind of a total mess and I hadn't experienced that for a while because it's kind of doing the same thing over and over again so it's to remember that you have to do things more than once and get kind of practice and figure works yes and you can shout it out if reliable all right yes so this is a really good question also I'm all sorts of conflicted confused feelings about this so I'd like to try to explain this as transparently as I can so on the one hand I'm lucky to have this fulltime job that allows me to experiment in weird directions working at NYU so it allows me to have the time to do stuff like this without it being like a primary source of income at the same time I you will notice that I do have ads turned on on the videos and I Drive a small income from that and I have this patreon which is like a Kickstarter but like a monthly thing so I'm interested in experimenting with these models in number one to learn about them do is its earning the extra money is useful I also use the money I'm rip Matt mentioned matcha here and some other people who I sometimes can get to work on different projects putting it back into the channel I've been trying to figure out a system for paying guests honorariums so in a way I kind of stumbled into this small business and a you know at this point it's really a small small business but it might grow beyond that and I haven't figured how to manage that side it's a side project that I maybe do once a week I'm just I feel like lucky if I made a few new video but that other boob creators they do really do this fulltime and it's a whole there's a lot to worry about and figure out and YouTube you know I also feel conflicted about using YouTube as a platform it's been great for me and I've reached a new audience that I never knew was there but it's also a very specific audience of people who want to youtube and that comes with the limitations and so and how to make the videos more accessible more broadly and how to create financial sustainable models that I can continue this that other people could also do this is definitely something I'm interested in I hope that answers the question so far yeah yes so I've heard a lot of different subjects most recently being she learning I was kind of just wondering two things hey have you decided what you're gonna do next be what drives you to choose the subjects is it feedback etc yeah so at the moment mostly I make my decisions based on like things that come up in class that week so I teach on Tuesday and Wednesdays and then I livestream on Friday and I usually like I'm scrolling down notes of like oh I didn't get to this or this injury so I'm trying right now it just sort of works best for my life like alignment as much as possible over the summer I had planned to kind of like branch out into machine learning and kind of got tripped up there I had my school accidents I didn't mean to make a pun there we go but so I kind of fell behind on that I guess I'm what one of the things that I'm really trying to do is make sure that the tutorials and channel are watchable for the beginner kind of always so it doesn't mean every video if you've never learned program before you just walk in and like watch it but there's some sequencing and there's some different levels but to me that's the thing I really try to keep in the back of my hand because some of the loudest voices at least in getting suggestions and comments of what people want me to cover I think are people who have more experience or making a before feel more comfortable requesting or asking so it's hard to find that but I know that there's I know that there's quieter voices out there who are who want and enjoy and learn from the really beginner stuff so I'm really would love any suggestions or ideas on how to better manage kind of like choosing a contact but I think I probably supposed to wrap up I don't see like somebody right because I don't know if anybody has their eye on the schedule but maybe I'll take one more question I me there are no more questions oh yeah your channel in the first place yeah well first first I was recording my actual physical classes and I thought well what if I record those and students could watch them back if they miss class or in the evening or something and that didn't really work it was an interesting document but it wasn't it didn't have didn't work to watch unless you were in the class basically and they were long and they were messy and then there I was worried about privacy and other people in the video so then I started making some videos just for my courses and just trying it out and trying different ways of doing it and at one point I think I had made like I looked this up the other day I don't know some of these are private and unlisted videos but there's over 600 videos on my channel it was kind of insane but I think at one point I had made a hundred videos I was mostly putting them on Vimeo and somebody said emailed me and said I really like to watch this on youtube because they have the 2x teacher by the way if you watch me at half speed my kids were six and nine their favorite things to watch me die laughing I don't think they play rugby night sound really drunk or something it's very bizarre like be on half speed but anyway somebody want to watch them at the faster speed which Vimeo didn't have and so I just dumped the catalog there and you know YouTube has more of a system for people to find videos based on whatever and so at some point I thought I would try livestreaming somewhere in there you can find this like livestream number one test you can watch that where I was trying to figure out I think it's actually a Google hangout is what it is look like I'm gonna screen sharing and stuff like that so it just was a step by step kind of thing yeah I probably made the first video tutorial though after I had been teaching for like seven or eight years it was like I was doing this from the beginning great I think I see people like coming in which by means we're especially the by the way the best part of today I think that's gonna be these lightning talks for people in the community I was looking at the list and seeing all this exciting stuff so I definitely don't to take any time that could be 340 yeah but we should probably give 10 minutes for people to get said about stuff so I think our time is good if you didn't get us kur I'm like the merchandise person first all you should there's processing stickers I put some coding train stickers out there I know people like stickers so that's only why I mentioned them not because you need to take a sticker it's okay not bigger but I do have some extra ones in my backpack or something people are looking Sixers and up or to hearing any feedback or and that sort of thing so thanks everybody
