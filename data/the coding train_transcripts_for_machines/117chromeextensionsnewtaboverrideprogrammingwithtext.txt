okay I've got one more probably more than that but at least one more thing to show you about Chrome extensions I'm gonna show you about overrides what is it override so first of all if you use the Chrome browser and you ever hit command T or new tab you get this default page which has a Google search and like shows you some recent web pages that you've been to this is something you can override you can create your own web page that appears for a new tab and there are lots of examples of Chrome extensions that you can get that show you pretty nice things and daily affirmations and stuff like that you can also override the history page and well something else where do you find out information about this it's I'll include a link to this in this video's description this is the documentation for override pages so you can override the bookmark page the history page and the new tab page I'm going to override just the new tab page and the way that we do this is by adding this code here to the manifest.json so I'm gonna copy this and I'm gonna go to the manifest JSON for a new Chrome extension I'm gonna get rid of the content script I just copied one of my previous ones I could get I don't need a content script as part of this and actually it wouldn't make sense to have a new tab override that also had a Content script I don't think so and I want to override new tab and what I want to do is point to my HTML page and I happen to have associated with this project this is my example number 6 a folder called sketch and it this is a p5 sketch and as an index on a HTML page so what I want to say is sketch slash index at HTML I am going to just say function setup create canvas 200 200 you know background 0 and I'm gonna say I'm gonna add something here like h1 hears a kitten cuz people make a new so I'm gonna add some stuff to the HTML and to the JavaScript just to see that this works now what I'm going to do is go to my extensions page I am going load the extension I want to load my example number six ah great I got an error what is my error looks like I have an extra comma here and it's telling me that I don't have valid JSON so I should be able to go back to my manifest.json get rid of that comma hit save try to then say a retry that worked and now I should open a new page yep so every time I open a new tab I get that webpage so let's make it do something a little more interesting let's say let's let's actually not have a canvas you obviously have an animation just say no canvas I'm gonna say R equals a random number between 1 and 6 because I actually want you know I'm going to say between 0 & 1 2 3 4 5 0 & 5 I have what I have is and then I'm gonna say a create image kittens / r + dot jpg so what you might notice is that I have a folder called kittens with 5 images of kittens all named 1 through 5 so I probably should have started naming him with 0 but I could just add 1 to it so I want to create a Dom element which is a kitten image and show it on the page so I'm gonna do that and I'm going to and we might have an issue I mean I'm just waiting to see what happens I'm going to reload the extension I'm gonna make a new tab up whoa that is and it worked well now here's the thing I should probably size it and I'm just gonna say image size window with window height image top position 0 0 so I mean this is some silly I should probably be more thoughtful about CSS and all that but I'm just going to use some p5 code to size the image to the page and maybe I'll get rid of the hears a kitten message now I'm going to reload again and now make a new tab or every time I make a new tab I get a different kitten yay so this is how you do a override so now the world is your kitten oyster think of what you might make something that checks the today's weather if you want to make something practical something that shows something beautiful something that reminds you of an important message anything that you can think of you can make anything you can make a webpage you can make as the new tab override thanks for watching subscribe like I'm supposed to say at the end of the video this was a short one so maybe you might actually hear me you
