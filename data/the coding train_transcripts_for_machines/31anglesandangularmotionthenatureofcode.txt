oscillation this is the topic now that we're going to look at in this section of videos part three it's math it maps to if you're following along in the nature of codebook chapter 3 we're going to look at oscillating motion what does it mean to have something that moves with a period with a frequency swinging of a pendulum the bouncing of a spring the plucking of a guitar string the the waves of water what types of things can we model in nature with oscillating motion and we can see a nice example of this this array of pendulums this is something about that by the end of this section of videos you could model inprocessing we're actually going to look specifically at how to model a pendulum and then you could make an array of them all starting at different times and this might be an exercise you could think about doing at the end of this section of videos but so before we could do any of that okay so oscillating motion waves pendulum Springs that's what we're talking about but to be able to really do this stuff and actually to a really important topic that we need to have in our bag of tricks when doing computer graphics programming is we need to know something about trigonometry what is trigonometry well this is a right triangle a right triangle has sides right side side side it has angles the relation to study of the relationship between the angles and sides of a right triangle that's trigonometry and we need trigonometry to do lots of stuff on the screen we need to know about sine cosine tangent and it's also going to allow us to do some nice stuff related to oscillating motion figuring out angular motion angular forces in terms of looking at a pendulum so trigonometry we need to we need somewhere to talk about trigonometry this is the place this is the time before we can even talk about trigonometry which will really be in the next video though I just want to think about basics of angles and processing how do we rotate something based on an angle and how might we model angular motion could angle be a position could there be an angular velocity in an angular acceleration that's what I want to look at just in this first video to get kind of started here so you're probably familiar with angles right here is a 90degree angle here is a 45degree angle you know I'm guessing if you're found your way to these videos you've probably done some stuff in processing and realize that processing in most computer graphics environments look at angles in radians right 90 degrees is PI divided by 2 radians 45 degrees would be PI divided by 4 a full 360 degrees is 2 pi so I you know I want to just take a brief 30 seconds here and cover what is a radiant it's kind of like it might be a little mysterious to you well the thing about a Radian actually is it's quite simple if you have a circle with radius equal to one one Radian and I'm not sure if I'm drawing this to scale one Radian is the angle at which the length of this arc is also equal to 1 incidentally with a circle of radius 1 the in the length of the entire contour the circumference of that circle is 2 pi so pi is this magical number that just kind of appears beautifully out of the circumference of a circle and we get and in radians are this very convenient convenient unit of measurement for angles it's not perhaps not as intuitive to us because we're used to thinking in degrees but the more you program the more your brain will reverse itself to thinking about radians ok so that's what we've got angles and radians hey that's pretty good so we should be able to rotate something right if I if this is a rectangle if I want to rotate this rectangle by 45 degrees or PI divided by 4 radians I should be able to get this rectangle now this is not a lesson in 2d transformations to do this rotation you're going to need translate you might need push matrix and pop matrix to figure out a lot of this stuff we're going to incorporate that into our code let me briefly say that if 2d transformations are not familiar to you what you probably should look at is processing org learning scroll down I would suggest looking at this particular tutorial I'm standing in front of it 2d transformations so this will get you it go pause go look at this tutorial if transformations are not familiar to you but so what we need to do to make this happen is translate to the object's location rotate by that angle and then draw the object okay so let's actually make that happen in a processing sketch and we're we're going to talk this I think it could be a short video I'm excited we're going to talk just about looking at angular motion velocity and acceleration okay so let's come back over here let's open up this processing sketch so I have this premade processing sketch which just draws a rectangle in the center right so this is the thing we're talking about with transformations you might think oh I know I'm just going to type in rotate here and say pi divided by 4 and now run it again and what's going on here it's like down on the bottom it's not in the center it is sort of rotated so what happened is rotation always happens around the point of origin so we rotated that search square around I can't do it around the origin up there we want to rotate that square around its center to move the origin to the center we need to use translate so I'm going to say hey translate to width divided by 2 height divided by 2 and then and then rotate by that angle and draw the rectangle at 0 0 and now we see we have a rectangle rotated 45 degrees exciting okay remember we there's probably about 10 15 videos about motion position velocity acceleration velocity is the change in position over time acceleration is the change in velocity over time well an angle is in many ways a position it's the angular position of that square now interestingly this is actually simpler to deal with because an angle is a scalar quantity it's a single number it's not a vector but we can apply we can have one variable to be the angle another available to be the angular velocity and another variable to be the angular acceleration so let's take a look at that what if I at the top here say a is some angle the angular velocity is some amount and the angular acceleration is some amount now what are the rules of motion velocity changes position acceleration changes velocity this is exactly what we did in our update function in our movers logan velocity add acceleration but we're just doing it here with angular and with with we're just doing it here with angular's with angles let's run this sketch nothing happens but of course if we actually put in we say hey let's give ourselves a little acceleration we can see okay come on that's a very small acceleration right is it turning what's going on here lost my mind ah you know what would be nice it would be nice to put the variable in here okay so that was a little bit of a mistake you know I had PI over 4 in there still but now we've got a back in there we say ok so that was not such a tiny little acceleration you can see how quickly acceleration adds up in terms of rotating by radians but you can see here we go we're getting faster and faster and faster we could use constrain to put a cap on velocity lots of things we could do we could also just really quickly right now just to kind of polish off this example I could say hey let me actually calculate the acceleration on the fly by mapping Mouse X which goes between zero and width to a number between negative 0.01 and 0.01 let me add if some extra zeros in here to make it smaller let me run this and we can see here now if I stay in the center there no acceleration if I go this way we're going to start going that way if I come over here it's going to slow down stop and come back so you can see how I'm modeling the motion the rotational the angular motion of an object the same way we modeled linear motion throughout Cartesian space angle is angular velocities velocity angular accelerations acceleration so you might sort of wonder how would we then apply this to to one of our previous examples and I think it's worth just pulling one up if I grab this example if you recall which is which was our a track array of of movers that are attracted to a singular attractor in the center what if you wanted to give these objects a little bit of angular motion well if we go look at the class we can see we have location velocity and acceleration each object has those three variables to keep track of its motion throughout this Cartesian space so what if I just went back to this example we did and grabbed these three variables let's give this object now in addition to having the vectors for its motion throughout space we have three angle three three scalars for its angular motion and I could go and I could just I could go to its display function and I could add the transformation code we need to so that we can rotate the object and we're going to now once we've translated to where the object is we've got to draw it at zero and notice the use of push matrix and pop matrix in this object this object is going to perform a transformation so that it is at a location and wrote and rotated we want it not to affect any of the other objects it just needs to translate and rotate for itself so we say push to save this transformation state do all our weird translation rotation say pop to restore so this object is kind of has its own transformation state okay now that we've done that so much for short video over ten minutes now that we've done that we can run this and see what it looks like okay so one thing is circles and not so much you don't really see the rotation so much so let's let's let's change these two rectangles and let's say rect mode Center let's run this we can see we've got rectangles there of course we didn't at we didn't add the angular motion to our sketch we need to go and say what's that motion algorithm for angles it's this so now in our update function just in the way that we add acceleration velocity velocity location we need to do that with with our angles velocity the angle angular acceleration the angular velocity we're now doing that both with the objects angle and with its and with its a position so if we run this now we can see they're all spinning now here's the question though how should they spin and there's lots of ways and simulation ways we can kind of get it we could get further into this but what I want to just say here for the second for the moment is what if we just did something simple and just said let's calculate its angular acceleration according to its acceleration along the x axis and I'm going to divide it by 10 so you can see here we're get something that appears somewhat dynamic that the that the annular the way that it's rotating is related to how it accelerates horizontally now that is a completely arbitrary choice but you might try and as an exercise you might try to build this in such a way that can you get it to appear realistically like as if it's sort of spinning throughout space and as it slows down it spins back the other way what happens if you use Y what m/s you've used the magnitude of the vector the angle of the vector there's lots of things that you could map to that object's acceleration you could also think about forces if there was a wind force with that wind force the hore affect its rotation in some such a way I don't know that there be wind in this example but you can sort of see where this is going so this this video all we really did all I want from this video hopefully it worked was to kind of get a sense of right what is an angle angles can be used in an object's rotation and angular motion the same way we modeled motion in throughout space twodimensional space we can that same concepts we can we can use through with an angle with angle s position angular velocity and angular acceleration okay and in the next video what we're going to look at is actually start to understand a sort of look at the details behind trigonometry what does it mean then to take the sine of an angle the cosine of an angle the tangent angle and how might that affect some of these systems that we build okay there we go that's it for now
