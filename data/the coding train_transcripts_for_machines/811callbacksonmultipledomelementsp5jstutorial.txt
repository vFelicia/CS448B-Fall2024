hello there's a siren don't worry it's I don't think it's coming for me although sometime I feel a little bit hot maybe I need some medical attention anyway but I'm here too and making a video this is a really this is like a really good topic and I totally like started talking about a siren but here's the here's the here's a scenario this scenario will come up for you in your life if you choose to make things that happen in a webbrowser let's say you have this page that you have designed and it has a whole lot of content on it harab pages and pages of paragraphs paragraphs paragraphs and everything I'm saying we do with any kind of Dom element and maybe we'll add some other kinds of Dom elements to an example that we make but the point of what I'm saying is you have a lot of things on the page and let's say what you want to do is whenever you take your mouse and you hover over one of those elements it is highlighted in some way so in the previous videos we looked at how you could use this function called select all to somehow gain access to all of those elements by a particular tag or a sub selection of those elements by a particular class now one thing I think I should clarify which someone asked to me in the time between I was making these videos is where does this function come from is that part of JavaScript or what so as with just about everything I'm showing you I'm using the p5.js Dom library but all the p5.js Dom library is doing for you is calling a bunch of native JavaScript functions for you behind the scenes so this is the kind of thing you could do with p5.js you could do it without p5.js you would just need a different function it would be like document get elements by tag or query selector all sort of the more longer winded syntax and you might need that someday when you are looking to do something that's not part of p5 and I'll get to that in a video at some point too because that seems like an important topic there's also other JavaScript frameworks like jQuery that have all sorts of silly big functionality built into it but I like this thing called p5 that's what I'm using and so that's that so that's where this comes from now back to the problem at hand so what I want to do is be able to say let me select all those elements maybe by paragraph tag then I have this array of all of those elements and I want to assign those elements and event I'll call that event highlight now if there are three paragraphs I might be able to create a highlight one function and a highlight to function and highlight three function and I could just assign this paragraph this function and the other paragraph highlight two and the other paragraph highlight three but that's really inconvenient I mean if all of them should just highlight that particular paragraph why can't I just give this one function as an event to all of those paragraphs so what I want to do is start building this in code and look at the problem that arise and look at the solution to that problem oh this is good I'm excited okay so here is the example of that I left with in a previous video and you can see in this particular example there are a whole bunch of paragraphs now those paragraphs they're all paragraphs some of them are members of a certain class and one of them happens to have a particular ID so let's start with the one with the particular ID so the first thing I want to do is I'm gonna say I'm gonna have this paragraph variable and I'm gonna comment out this select all part for a second and I'm selecting the paragraph that has the ID unicorn and I'm saying paragraph dot mouse over I'll say highlight and I'll call this function highlight and let's and let's also add in that function let's add a little padding to it this like kind of obsessed with padding and I have this like song about padding that I'm working on you might know about you might have heard it it was in a previous video and then I'm gonna make a function called I don't know unhighlight which gets rid of the padding and sets the background back to white so right I have a function that takes that paragraph gives it padding enough nice color and another function that gets rid of the padding and gives it a background of white so mouseover highlight Mouse out unhighlight so let's run this and see where is that oh this is the paragraph that I'm working with a unicorn and rainbows what happened undefined is not a function hmm line 20 paris oh look at this what is what nonsense am i typing I'm just like making up code wouldn't that be nice so this would be an interesting feature 55 library but it doesn't exist what am I doing here those of you are probably yelling at me or watching this video what I want to do is call the style function and a prop a property of style in CSS that you can add is padding with a certain amount of padding there's no padding function have to call the style function apply padding with a given value okay so now that I fixed that weird error that I made we could run this and we could see here my mouse over none of these other paragraphs but look at this it highlights it's highlighting so this is like highlighting a paragraph as I move the mouse over it so that works only for this one particular paragraph now what if I were to say AHA I can use paragraphs right I can say I want an array of paragraphs by selecting all of the paragraphs and now I want to have a loop of all the paragraphs and I want to do the same thing mouse over highlight mouse out unhighlight and you know what I don't even need to select this one anymore so what I've done is I've said okay I just select one element and I want when you mouse over that one element for it to turn color a color and then when I mouse out of that element for that color to disappear and that worked so this is the code for doing that these are the two events now I know I can select all of the paragraphs with select all so in a loop I could assign all of them to have this mouse over event and all of them have this mouse out event is this going to work no no but clearly but the I wouldn't but I'm really we're gonna make it work that's the whole point of this video so here we go oh whoa cannot o cannot read stylepro so ah so I meant to leave something else in there so first of all nothing's working because like Hello in you know if you look at this what is this the highlight function always refers to that paragraph what is that paragraph it's the one that I forgot to select by unicorn let's run this again mmm right no matter what I highlight over it's always highlighting just that one will whatever I mouse over it's only ever highlighting that one particular paragraph mouse over this one that paragraph is highlighted mouse over this one that paragraph is highlighted why because in here the highlight function only ever refers to the paragraph selected with select unicorn I want this mouse over for this particular paragraph to refer back to itself oh this is gonna be a very hard problem right we're gonna solve this here's here's the lovely answer to this question p5 at the p5 library knows that this problem comes up again and again and again and so p5 is actually going to do something special for you what p5 is going to do is when you try to assign a function to when you assign a function as an event for a particular Dom element if you write the keyword this into that function it refers to the Dom element that the event is attached to this particular element so this same event can be attached to all of these elements and Matt drew like magic it's basically magic through magic the this keyword just knows which element is being referred to which element the event is actually happening to so again this is it's not actually magic it's code that's written into the p5 library that assigns the this keyword dynamically to the correct element and later in another video I will show you how you might implement that yourself if like something like p5 isn't doing it for you so let's come back to this and look at this what I'm saying is I can put the keyword this year so the highlight event is assigned to every single paragraph it this is a function that's called when you mouse over one paragraph or the other paragraph or the other paragraph or the other paragraph when the code is executed it's executed because the event was triggered on a particular Dom element and this keyword will just refer to that particular Dom element so let's look at this again and you can see now whichever one I hover over is the one that is highlighted so this is kind of a magic way of assigning a whole bunch of Dom elements the same event something that gets applied to itself by selecting all those elements with select all function by iterating over those elements with a for loop by assigning a particular function to an event like mouse over Mouse out mousepressed changed input all those other events we saw before and by using the this keyword so that the same function becomes reusable for multiple Dom elements I should note by the way that this would also work here like if I were to do something like what sort of nice about this is if I were to do something like var I equals you know zero I is less than a hundred I plus plus I'm gonna make I'm gonna make a whole lot of elements rainbow and I'm gonna give them like a random position on that menu is absolutely I'm just doing something weird here I'm gonna give them like an absolute position on the page like 500 random 500 look at this so what I'm showing you is not just for the elements that you make in HTML but oops I have an extra parenthesis here I guess so you can see look at this page now this page now I made all of these Dom elements called rainbow and they all have that event also so this is I'm not making like this like crazy nonsensical thing with like all these paragraphs some of which made in the HTML some which remain to JavaScript some which some of which are absolute position some one which are not absolute position the point is you can do all sorts of stuff now you know this is the power of programming sure if you just want to have like three paragraphs because it's these paragraphs from an essay you wrote you might just put that directly in the HTML page but if you want to fill the window with all sorts of randomly generated Dom elements and you want to assign an event to all of them you can do it this way so I've gone on for much too long about this but what I would say what I might give you as an exercise now is do exactly this and maybe do something that I didn't do which is that make a bunch of Dom elements assign them a given class select all of those and give them all the same event which apply some style to itself and see how this this keyword inside of your event callbacks will handle this for you okay good stuff I'm in the next video I want to look at the parent and child functions which allow you to while you're making a Dom element insert it into a particular part of a page which is very very useful and there we go sometimes this mouse doesn't work which is the thing I need to press to stop the video and I leak awkwardly still standing here
