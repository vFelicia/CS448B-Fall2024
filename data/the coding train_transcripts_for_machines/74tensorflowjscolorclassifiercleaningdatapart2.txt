all right cleaning my data part two that's where we are where I last left off previously your data whoa the suspense was killing you I know I had just retrieved all the data from firebase and I looked at it by anonymous user ID how many entries had been submitted by each user and I have a suspicion that some of these that submitted a lot of entries maybe wasn't actually a person doing it manually but and maybe like a bot or something flooding the database so let's try to investigate that and see what we can figure out so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna visualize the data I could visualize it by user ID there's so many things I could do looks think about it so there were there are how many labels so let me think about this okay this is my sketch I know what the labels are so let me just I'm gonna need let me just set up a variable called data data by you know color by label and this will be an object and the object will have empty arrays for each one of the labels so there was blue ish I should have a list of this somewhere greenish doing this manually I could have actually pulled the labels from the database but this will be simpler a greenish pink ish I'm not doing this in any particular order greyish red ish what am I missing purple ish there was a brown if if I go to my crowdsource color reddish greenish bluish oranges did I do orange I don't think I did orange orange orange ish purplish greyish brownish one two three four five six seven eight nine I'm missing one blue green pink gray this is not a very systematic way to take this red green blue orange purple but yellowish I didn't do yellowish okay yellow ish now while I am looping through the data which I did in the previous video I'm going to not worry about this users by count thing right now I will come back to that later what I want to do is oh sorry I do need I do want this so I want to look at each data point and I want to look at the RG so I want to look at the label and I want to say color by label and then I want a record dot label push and so I'm going to create a color let color equal I'll use the p5 color function to say record our record G record B color by label push color and now what I should have and I'm really risking breaking the console here is I should have all the RGB values listed by the label so let's look at that oops I'm in the wrong sketch right so we can see there's a thousand blues 16 there's only two 35 Gray's so one thing that's also important about what I've done with my data set here is I don't have a uniform amount of data points by label I have many more green ones and actually a Eric in the patron group made a point that the way that colors are picked the way my random number generator works or you're gonna be more greenish looking colors which is sort of interesting to think about but at the very least what I can do now is I could just draw all of the colors so I'm trying to think of what I probably want to do like little rectangles and a p5 canvas maybe so let me add create canvas and let's make it 400 by 400 and let me let's do just one let's just start with Luis and I'm going to say a four let I equals zero I is less than so let's see let me say let blues equal color by label blue ish and I'm gonna look at all those and let's start with an X let's start with a Y let's say fill blues index I and then let's draw a rectangle at X Y that's 10 comma 10 will increase X by 10 and if Y is greater than or equal to width then we will a reset X back to 0 and increase Y by 10 now this is in very again I'm not being that thoughtful about this but in theory I should see now when I run this all the loose now why did it not wrap around oh if X is greater than width and I want to say no stroke and I could sort I probably would want to sort these two I could sort them by like brightness so we can see here ah look at this these are all the Blues that were submitted to the database so you know I kind of don't mind that the data has some noise in it I mean big deal the point of this is to crowdsource it and maybe training a model if there's enough data it will sort of filter out the noise but you know and the question is why is this here why is this here what should I do about that let's just look at some other ones let's look at red you can see ok what's interesting is I think these are in the in the order by which they were submitted there probably was a time period here where some like bad data was entered let's look let's look at green cuz Green has the most right that's pretty good so what do I do oh boy what do I do about this all right so great great points just came up in the chat right now one is a Luke B writes pretty good to have the outliers to encourage prevention of overfitting the neural network so this is actually true in you know one thing you have to watch out for is that your your model the model that I'm going to train to do this color classification what if it it just works so well with the training data that it doesn't work so well with new data and having a bit of noise in the training data can actually help with that another me I answered me rights make it so clicking on a pixel prince who did it the user ID that is and also maybe highlights all the other ones with the same user ID that I love so let's add that that's gonna be that's not gonna be the easiest thing but it's worth doing let me see if I can add that so okay so if I click the mouse mouse pressed I can I can like it's sort of like I would be in theory Mouse X divided by ten and J would be right this is where I'm clicking I'm looking for the I and J not the X&Y like sort of like the I and J of what I'm clicking on Mouse Y divided by 10 and then I should be able to get the index then by saying I plus J times and then the width divided by 10 again I really really really should be using variables for these numbers like 10 and putting putting in like an of variables for like columns and rows but let's just try this right now let's try then saying console.log and so let's let me make a I'm gonna call this color I'm gonna call this like label I'm just gonna call this label and I'm gonna let's let's go with a blueish to start again so I'm gonna use here color by label label and let's make color by label color by label already is a global variable so I'm going to say consult log okay so let data equal color by label that label and then I should go to a console log D data index I think this will be right and like make some mistakes here let's see what happens all right let me click here all right so I got something oh yeah so one thing that's like kind of unfortunate is oh I don't have the user ID I don't have to use so I got the color but I'm not actually storing the full data thing oh yeah so color by label this is what I need to do I want color by label actually to store the whole record we don't actually want to store the color let's store the whole record then when I visualize it I can just ask for the RGB values right because then when I click on something this is now that entry so I can see like right if I click on this we can see I look at this this user right I'm clicking on these they're all the same user this user Y gdq seems to have some faulty data so i could filter out this user i could do something nice where like as I'm hovering I highlight everything but I think I'm not gonna go that far I let anybody who wants to contribute to to I'll let you try that on your own maybe but so let me make a list here of users that I might want to filter out whether I'm happy to have the noise or not that's a question but let's let's let me just make this a little smaller it's a little harder for you to see it but I think it's going to be easier in terms of space so okay so let's look at a few more that are maybe like clearly not good same user it's all that same user I haven't found them that let's look up here a different user so this user also looks like it maybe has some bad data oops let's look at a different color let's look at let's look at what was like there is very little of greyish that's we couldn't this user is now suspect you know the thing is a user might have missed clicked so unless I see it consistently yeah I'm not gonna the user could have missed clicked all right so you get the idea okay so you get the idea now there's so many ways that I could be more thoughtful about this and add more features to work on cleaning the data but let's just say for right now and and people are suggesting like I could algorithmically like I could actually evaluate the numbers and see like compute the hue and see if the hue match is labeled but I don't I specifically do not want to do that because what I specifically want from this is this idea of human perception of color and I don't want to use math because I could create my own dat data set with math of like putting colors into certain buckets and in a way I don't even want to do what I just did right here which is eliminate certain users and I and I probably should just visualize what I should do with these users now is actually actually let me do this do what these users now is I'm actually just going to look at all of their entries and see so let's let's add that as one more thing you can stop watching this video and just go on because I'm gonna build a machine learning model in the future videos but if you want to keep watching I'm gonna do let's do one more thing like let's take this user and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to comment out this this drawing thing that I'm doing and I want to create a I want to say color data by user I'm going to make that an array and I just want to say if record user ID equals a particular user then I want to say a user user data and I could build an interface to do all this would be so much better but I don't really have time to do all that this particular series so that might be something exercise you do for yourself user data dot push the record and then down here I could use this exact same algorithm oh but you know what I don't want to do it that's what I want to do I'm gonna use Dom elements now I think I'm gonna say for let color for let entry it's an entry like of user data I'm gonna say create a div I'm gonna just make a div and then I'm gonna say div and actually let me let me create a div with entry dot label in it so let's just try this whoops not the string and let me get rid of the canvas so these are all these are all of this particular users entries I maybe I should sort them by let's sort them by the label so let's so let's say user data sort a comma b return a dot label greater than B dot label so this is whoops oh and I don't need to say return if I use the arrow syntax I've really just off the deep end here in this video I'm gonna I think this is right that should sort it yes there we go so we can see now it's that's weird just pausing for a second there's a great comment in the chat from Sam D could we separate out the different things into functions by color by user by whatever classifier rather than commenting out lots of stuff yes this would be an absolutely great thing to do so I'm gonna publish this and I would love to to get user comments and user submissions of like making a nice interface for this I'm but I'm trying to figure out why it didn't sort this right now okay these are strings so this is going to give me a true or false but the sort function wants like a negative or positive number so I'm actually just gonna break this out I know I could do this with those ternary operators but I'm just gonna say if return 1 else return negative 1 and this should this should do the trick right so let's take a look at this now there we go bluish greenish reddish so we could see this is now sorted by that particular user and then all I need to do is add oh I need to make something that color box I guess I couldn't make that a div that lives inside a color box size 10 comma 10 and then color box style these are all p5 Dom functions background color are argh oh now this would be a great time to use those template literals because what I want to do is say RGB entry entry are entry G and what happened its entry dot B right this is CSS for making an RGB color I believe let's see how this works what's the chance this works yeah okay oh but uh now what I want to do is say color box parent and I want it to be in line so how do I do that color box style displayinline what it is no who well you get the idea there's some of these because you can see it's pretty inconsistent there's just the colors are just so wildly different that I think we can kind of say that this user we can filter out and I could look at some of these other users now like let's look at this user where did I let's look at this user everything seems to be a blueish that doesn't look like great data and let me look at this user and again doing I'm doing this so manually in my code could easily build an interface to look at all this grayish grayish greenish greenish brownish blueish blue yeah this looks too inconsistent so you know it's fine to have some way so I think we're done here you get the point that we're not completely done because I need to I want to just like create a JSON file of all of the data but I mean I'll do that in the next video cuz I don't know if anybody's still watching this right now so where I could add some background to the text and some padding that's a greater this is also the way I could visualize this with if I had any sort of talent or knowledge about CSS and design but you the viewer will hopefully improve this but you can sort of see the process of looking at the data visualizing it and getting a sense of it and now what I might want to do is actually like filter and save the data and I will do that in the next video which will be a very short one I think
