um oh you know what would be good hello we might be live streaming right now um are there captions that are appearing obviously nobody's looking at the chat so we do have a little bit of a bug in our system um here what i'm going to do is say i have it up on my computer over there so first let me say a quick hello just assuming it's working but yeah if somebody has a phone and wants to like just go to it you'll be able to see the live chat um my name is dan schiffman this is a live stream that's happening on a youtube channel called the coding train but this is a little bit of a special episode in that um we i'm going to show you the itp ima winter show so it i itv is a graduate program ima has an undergraduate program at new york university school of the arts it's where i teach where i make a lot of the video tutorials that i have on the channel um people are saying the captions are there and so um we're going to walk around there's all there's like literally six of us here right now and we have the most elaborate setup ever so there's this microphone i should i should point out that this microphone is not actually something that you're hearing right now this is just recording backup additional audio it's actually probably way too close to my face right now it should be more about here this phone attached to it is also on a skype call with a live captioner give yourself a shout out live capture in the live captions who is live captioning i have a feeling the live captions aren't going to work so well this is the first time we're trying to do it but we're going to do our best and then the actual audio that you're hearing i'm tapping the mic so hopefully you heard like there's messages coming in so what i'm going to do right now is i'm going to take this prop which is like our microphone speaker it's like this what's the thing where you have like the speaker box or the you know when you're at like a meeting and you want people to speak one of the times you have to hold oh it's the top one the talking stick this is the talking stick which we will pass around um so i'm going to pass over these are our student show producers um i'm going to let them introduce themselves and talk about the show and idp and what it is and whatever they want and i'm going to go check just sort of like the the analytics page and the chat and all that make sure things are and then we'll start looking at projects thank you to ellen behind the camera chelsea and jesse over here are helping and i'll hand this to you bye hi everyone i'm i'm patrick warren i'm a first year itp student hi i'm daphne i'm second year itp student i'm a lighting designer cool and uh so i guess we'll walk outside and check out the show right so we're gonna say what we're doing oh what we're doing doing whatever they want we did a beautiful map together of all of the projects on the floor this year special because we have a beautiful space and we have more than 100 projects so that's a lot of projects to go through for a visitor so we made a map that has numbers laid out on a floor plan and then a description no not a description the name of the project the student and you know it's color coded according to where it is in the so that was our job yeah do you want to add anything i think she is so that's it should we go look at some projects let's go okay i'm like so like i don't have my phone i don't have my phone because it's over there um so i guess i'll take this now and i'll i'll get us rolling and then we can kind of like alternate around all right so we're gonna attempt now to look at projects students are still setting up their projects um but uh maybe is the boxing glove in action all right let's go check out the boxing glove so uh what we're going to attempt to do is um so ellen i think like the closer you get okay the better just for the audio and then um you can we're gonna like keep the camera on you and the mic on you just to do like describe the project and then separately you can demo it because as soon as we're trying to like shoot video of demoing it we'll lose your audio sure okay say your name and your project and then a few sentences about it uh hi my name is punch punch revolution basically what it is is a machine learning gesture classifier on the under the hood but on the hood if as you can see it's a fun punching game where you need to complete a certain amount of tasks in a limited amount of time uh the entire technology is happening inside this very small thing over here as a demo and if somebody wants to try it out we can have a go at it should i try or do you want to demonstrate oh i can demo it yeah okay so basically if i need to make a significant enough gesture ideally it should so that's how it roughly books and the general purpose of the entire project is to uh go into us like early deep dive into like what can be possible just using people's gestures as a medium of interaction okay all right so introduce yourself say your names and a few sentences about your project hi my name is and this is our project general photography so basically it's an experiment we did like to figure out what's in between analog photography and digital technology so what you're seeing now is the result of our experiment so we ran a journey through from the very basic analog photography the pinhole cameras where you expose a piece of light sensitive paper to light over a certain period of time and then you can capture out light expose the paper and how it carves these like the traces of line on this piece of paper and then we try to reproduce the same process by using a digital way so basically for example we have a series of images and then we use the technique that is used in analog photography to expose a digital canvas with the images from that series of maybe for example for a performance in a dense images from a dance performance and then we did the negative analog negative of that these printed results which turn out you could have like this a piece of photography which is digital based but it has the texture and aesthetics of an analog photography and here's the video showcasing like the digital exposure process during the whole digital print like how it is made digitally yes okay i'm getting a bunch of this phone is buzzing like crazy which i assume it's not it's somebody who's instagram messaging this phone is it going today are you going today hold on there's somebody this is a an official nyu phone that i think someone left their instagram signed in on but let me uh let me try to look at the skype because i think the captioner is sending me some messages let me look at the chat all right this is me testing uh speaking directly into the money okay this is perfect shoot that separately and then move on to getting cool detail uh hi my name is noah um and um so we're trying to because we're we're doing like a lot of live streams let's do it at different things hi my name is noah i'm a first year at itp um and my project is sort of about uh video collage and machine learning fantastic but i don't know why i just did this yeah cool all right so give us a i give you a demo yeah okay so basically what's going on here are there our live stream streaming cameras on the floor and you can play with them so what i'm gonna do right here is if we look at stream three you can see all of us right now and i'm gonna make our heads appear on our sort of body collage so by using this controller come on oh right it's it's stream three i changed it to stream one so there we go in one second and there we go so now it's all of our heads as part of this so i can make our bodies show up too um stream three so in a second you'll see a big orange blob hopefully for shiffman's body i wore this orange sweater specifically for this demo let's see if i can get it to swap there we go so it allows you to play with these streams to sort of create a human collage if you know the game exquisite corpses um the colloquial version of that is the game that you play with drawing pictures that was an inspiration for this thank you thank you so we checked the blue blocks are you activated with your blocks you're having a nice like cup of tea or something okay coffee okay so tell us your name and a few sentences about your project so my name is demis and my project is basically a black puzzle game when you can build the correct sentence the animation is basically a hint about what is the sentence and you have to slide the blocks into the box to complete that sentence let's see can you show us a demo of it yeah so yeah and the tomato is bouncing and then you pass to the next sentence you have to use the green box in this case so you can remove this one this is basically like a learning tool for kids the cara no say that try again so thank you okay like my goals okay great great my goal is to like uh do as many projects as possible so with this previous years we would so i'm kind of we're just doing the rapid fire okay um tell us your name in a few sentences about your project and then we'll kind of go and look at some of the uh specific parts because there's so many yeah um hi i'm winnie um and so these are from my data class i'm from hong kong so i did a lot of projects about the protests and specifically focusing on the narratives um i'm really interested in nontraditional um approaches to protests um and the focus of narrative is because i feel like our ability to craft our own narrative is something that's really powerful and healing um so these are all different projects about um narratives and distances um yeah sorry um no so this two projects are about police and um protesters uh and so i have these youtube videos that i scripted transcript um from and i did these generative texts uh and also with the most common words i made these fridge magnets that people could interact with and then this piece here is all the protest information i have consumed from september up until now so as you hover you could see the articles and the brighter the box is the more articles i have read in that hour of the day and then the last one there is more about media rendering because a lot of times when we read the same information we could have very different interpretations so i was curious to see if i could create a system for us to even understand that um so what i did is that i create this framework where i have this article which is compiled by a number of prochina and prohong kong media articles um and i asked people to select the three most important sentences and then to type uh words and response and also pick uh the headline images that they think is the most appropriate and also ask a little bit about whether they have been following the protests and after they did that they could see everyone's responses thank you okay i'm gonna just uh because i'm feeling very paranoid i'm gonna see if i can get the youtube chat going on this phone also i'm just gonna check speaker has to be closer to the mic so we're gonna do our best let's see we're going to do a little checkin maybe you're saying a lot of important things in the chat so i don't know how to use this phone youtube search this is a really cool project okay good i'm more looking for people saying like the stream's not working i can't hear anything um but the chat looks good okay okay great no it's all going very well usually the chat is just full of people com not not complaining complaining is the wrong word very nicely providing constructive critique about what the technology is not doing properly but i think we might have finally got all the right pieces here all right yeah we come in here okay so we're kind of doing this quick uh rapid fire glimpses of everybody's projects so they can tell us your names uh in a few sentences about your project and then we'll also go around and shoot some footage more closely and i can see that it's much longer than it was yesterday yes i'm naila davis and i'm simone salvo and we also have another collaborator elizabeth perez who's not yesterday but together we all may say her name which is an interactive portrait it's commemorating the life of sandra sandra bland commemorating and celebrating her life so what we did was used um these this process called internal total internal reflection and we printed this image on lucite so the idea is that when you walk past the sensor it'll detect that you're there and when you say her name sandra bland this will end up printing if it goes well we've been having some um some some small technical difficulties with our ultrasonic sensor so as everything at itp this has become a um a prototype more than a finished piece and we're really learning through this experience of having people see it like what we would do differently how we would change it and also seeing how it changes as people interact with it for sure like when the first roll of paper came down it was like okay what do we do now right let's just leave it so i want to try to say it again say sandra bland p5 is hearing you but i guess you guys come back another i know you're gonna have to come back it's printed this many times there is a delay also so sometimes when you say the name it'll end up printing um but we've also noticed that this ultrasonic sensor in communication with p5 causes some type of lags that we can't necessarily detect and sometimes you know the the medium of digital media shows through and we get that we'll fix it all in post thank you great job congratulations thank you for sharing thanks guys hello tell us your name and a few sentences about your project yeah hi my name is and i work this with clingy it's called behind a toe so you have to go to the back of the tube to see the detector project so what can you just give us the explanation first and then we'll go look behind you okay um so people always look at the front of the talk and we want people to actually see what is behind and what's the relationship between people who have been passed away and people who are alive and visiting them so uh the movement and also the sound of the people who are alive will actually if that's what the topes movement be like we want to use this to talk about the relationship and discuss that so that's it instagram notifications hello uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project oh this is a vr project this will be hard but you can but there's you have excellent display of extra information fantastic it's marcel oliver yeah so it's my name and it's a vr project that's like based on compositional experimentation in vr unfortunately i'm not sure quite how to show it right you're welcome to look at it yourself yeah i'll come back i would love to see it um but yeah it's kind of a nonnarrative art piece thank you so we're doing quick uh summaries of people's projects i'm very excited about this so just tell us your name names uh maybe stand next to each other if that's okay um and then we'll get you doing a quick explanation then we'll also then show people the project oh yeah okay i'm chanel i'm eating and this is our game authentic or not um it is a cooking game that teaches you how to cook traditional indian and chinese recipes and now we can just show you the how it works push the button and then drum rolls so now we are choosing chinese green pepper with pork and you can either use your hands or spoon to choose whatever you think is right for the dish and then keep growing now is the [Laughter] to get the traditional recipes and learn more about our project on our website and if you get more than 60 percent we are gifting some indian and chinese snacks yes yes thank you so much yeah thank you so much all right uh oh we got all three okay tell us your names about your product hold on let's let's hold it take it from the top it's so fast we need the microphones yeah i'm sure yeah and we made our believable news project and this is an installation and and about fake news yeah and basically you can see the news before you wear these glasses and if you wear these glasses you can see a piece of news and it says hong kong high court band black holes in public space and where 30 people were arrested and this image actually looks totally makes sense for this uh news that if you change to another glasses you can see a different version of this news this is our secret here yeah i can touch here and trigger this and you can see another piece of news happening in berlin also makes sense for this image and if you change to another glasses and you can see also see another group it says customers in shanghai fight for shirts and people will don't know which is true and which is fake and after they say sing all of the news and they could share this news to other person and this is those three are the news they sword and if i want to share like a high court band black clothes in public space and i can just share it if i share it and it will tell you it is a misinformation or the real news and yeah the message you just shared will appears on other people's screen and the message you just shared with other people will affect other people's uh final decision about which is real and which is fake so we made this project basically we want to let people to know to to question the genuineness of the image because many people think the image actually are the evidence of the events so and so the second step for our project we want people to know that actually their behavior is affecting other people they are not only the consumer of fake news they are also the enhancer of the fake news influences yeah thank you thank you thank you thank you i like it we're all applauded all right we're just going to keep going through all these projects all right tell us your name in a few seconds about your project my name is jason and i'm the creator of this project it's called optimize optimize is a tailor made mouse designed to fit everybody's head so um so this is the prototype uh the electronics i made all the like industrial design and also in the tronics coating and everything i start from here it's a dummy mouse and i model it on top with playdoh so it fits my hand perfectly so i did some photogrammetry which is powered by machine learning and reconstructed the model into a digital scan of my hand and it turned into a real mouse model and get 3d printed so it becomes the model you see here so it's a ergonomic mouse and because a mouse is the most dependent peripheral which is uh to your hand size and grip so this is the perfect solution for me and hopefully it's going to be a business in the future thank you congratulations okay oh yes let's take a look at this oh can you guys come and talk about your project yeah okay let's let's let's get you giving a quick explanation and then we can try to demo it and get some footage all right say your name first too you do my name my name is cezar khan and our project is called the joys of being a screensaver and it's an interactive video installation with four channels of video and one rotary phone uh the concept is that a human is stuck as your screen saver and you can interact with her by calling her on the rotary phone and by her calling you on the phone and it's just the back and forth between the real world and the digital world between you making the character move on the four screens around you and fur making you turn around all right should we try it we got somebody trying it already this is so good yeah so she's behind me so that's so cute so now i call back right what number am i dialing you can dial in two five seven okay oh she's here that's it right i did it right hello all right we're coming over here tell us your name hello and a few sentences about your project my name is hayek my name is tonic our project called artifice is about we can try to testing that human can live with a robot in the future and robot can replace human or not so our concept is the test that you have to identify who is a human and who is a robot it's a mother it's like a turing test but in a vr environment so we try to embrace a human connection between two people in vr so i would like to demo you we need one person who is going to be the actor and one person is going to be the judge i guess okay and we need we need one we need one more to be a judge so your mission is try to help him identify that you are human okay but among the experience there's a lot of robots that look like you okay and try to pretend to be you okay so you have to give them a clue that hey this is me okay i'm the human i'm human i'm human you're a robot oh i'm a robot but yes that's right that's right so i will set you up here okay and i need one person yeah to be a judge right so in this we combine like we are experienced and server client so you're going to be the server you're going to be the judge okay so you don't have to do anything okay you just observe i can do that and uh and you can identify he's a human or not at the end of the game usually take off your headset and then you come out and say is that you all right did you see anything i see it yeah this is the point of view that you will see for me oh they're dancing dancing yeah [Laughter] yeah i was okay so do you know which one is a human i was thinking the one on the right but i don't know i can't tell you so you think the one on the right yeah yeah so how do you feel that you get tricked by the machine machines are too smart man you help him identify yes yeah i didn't you know i think i if i had a second chance i think i might have more of a sense of like what some strategy might be i was just even going into the vr headsets no disadvantage but do you think like his movement is different than others than other robots in the center well i guess i was thinking about the road on the right so i started once i like thought it was that when i started focusing on that one more um so i kind of ignored the other two after a while um i guess i was also trying to figure out how that would move from what i've seen sid isn't here but this is a really fun a little arcade i can explain this project or do you want do you guys know about this project okay so this is project from sid who's not here maybe we can come back again to introduce it but it's a it's a small arcade um that's built with an arduino inside and you can select a whole bunch of different games it looks like they're playing tetris right now so take a look it's really cute looks like we have a professional tetris player here okay let's uh should we go around here there is all right hello can you give us a couple sentences about tell us your name in a couple sentences hi i'm borah uh so this is variations on computational association i'm feeding in my artwork and the neural network is trying to guess what it's saying and then recreate what it's saying uh but the premise of premise is it has to create something so it has to take liberties and combining stuff that hasn't seen combined before so it's sort of inadvertently creating some abstract art in in response to my art which is similar to what we do how we react to abstract ideas if okay are you using runway yes this probably is quite involved yes but can you give us a quick summary of the game of the project and then we'll like shoot some stairs but i don't know we'll have time to play it but pretty much it's just an oldfashioned board game uh i'm trying to solve the problem of our major games i have to deal with strategy and family being together namely monopoly risk and murder not having to deal with war murder or or bankruptcy so my game is called jackrabbits and you play with regular poker cards and basically what you're trying to do is that you're these rabbits that live in this kingdom and not trying to find a king a queen and a jack to officiate the wedding in this in the in the castle it comes with tiles so every time you play you create a different kingdom a different board and in the game what you do is you navigate through it trying to find the royal cards so in that sense it's like you're collecting properties like you would do with monopoly but instead of like trying to get your your opponent to go bankrupt you're just trying to arrange this wedding before they do did you make all of these pieces i made everything and design and everything um it's made out of mdf and it's laser cut and this is just like a sticker photo uh printed with a inkjet printer and i built the digital version of the board with v5 which you can actually put together and rotate it i'll show you let me restart it the idea is that um if i still have to figure out how to get this into production maybe do a kickstarter but in the meantime i'll put this online and people will be able to play with their own uh poker card so if you have a deck of cards you don't need to wait for me to produce the actual board to be able to play john graves awesome great job i really want to come and play it yeah what you don't know is lachlan was our sound check person yesterday they've really rehearsed uh their project description not really but okay so tell us your name which you have already uh spoiler alert lachlan and uh a little bit a few sentences about your project hey so i'm lachlan i'm a firstyear student here at ima uh and so i made a website called gun funded and it's a visualization of the gun lobby's funding of u.s congress cool do you want to like screw i mean people can go what's the url for the project it's gunfunded.com so maybe we can get a little footage of you scrolling through it but yeah so on the website you can enter your home address to find your representative or you can explore so here we are in brooklyn um and so unsurprisingly our representative here is not funded by gun rights groups those received a little bit of money from net control groups but you can also see some of the top funded congress people or you can explore by state um and so like where i'm from in pennsylvania um you can you can see the total um and how the funding is disproportionately um goes to uh republican men in congress and so you can go to anyone's profile you can share these you can see lists of top senators representatives and more and there's also a view of the pacs that give money so you can see that um like in 2018 there was 22 million given to congress but in 2016 it was 58 million and so basically every year up until um just recently the graphs looked like this um because congress has received about 40 million dollars from gun rights groups and about 5 million from gun control groups and so you can also click to filter the list and see like how much money the nra specifically is given every year um or or any other group so that's gun funded and it's gunfunded.com thank you thanks hello will you tell us your name in a few sentences about your project yes my name is veronica alfaro this is a this is a breathing exercise so the way that it works is you squeeze the ball and you inhale at the same time that you release the ball and you exhale you're supposed to follow the pattern that this hexagon is giving you and there is also some sound coming out of the headphones that is also guiding your breathing so the idea is that people can have some sensory input at the same time some visual input to calm and relax and this is targeted for people with anxiety and who are suffering from a lot of anxiety before wonderful job i can attest i tried this yesterday and it really helped me calm down in a wonderful way thank you great one more time thank you yeah okay oh hello we're back let's go stream into this uh oh wait we've got a bunch of things that we'll come here first okay all right who's uh is this just just you emily yes okay so um tell us your name which i just said and a few sentences about your project okay hi my name is emily my project is called racing thoughts and it's a selfreflective experience it's really simple you're just asked to write two sentences about yourself who wants to try it it's a little bit different definitely okay we can we can blur out anything you write that's very i'm gonna ask people there's only like you know hundreds of thousands of people watching this right now yeah i think it's about 162. it's not anonymous type a negative sentence oh i could take over if you want i've got lots of negative things to say oh god no about myself the key to happiness is in accepting your thoughts all of them even the bad ones accept your thoughts don't become them understand for instance that having a sad thought even having a continuous succession of sabbath is not this is so nice so it says it took you 12.7 seconds to say something negative 4.5 seconds to say something positive racing cards by emily's hour thank you yeah of course this is really nice wonderful great job i had the pressure [Laughter] hello how are you okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your project my name is karina and this is frame by frame i'm trying to get people to collaboratively tell a story through gifts and so each person is contributing one frame to the story all right should we try to add one so this is the word and you'll have two frames with which to represent okay there was a little boy trying this yesterday so i have two frames and as more people come and add frames then you can read more and more of the story and try to understand based on their gifts and how people chose to represent the words and if you've tried to understand then you compare it to the original story it's really fun i wouldn't have thought you would get so much out of just two frames yeah but it's it's amazing it's really surprising how people choose to represent thank you thanks all right all right uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project my name is lulu and this is an installation that show everybody has a mountain on their original home and this is how it works and i have to tell the rock what is the shape of my hands and i want everybody to have a natural connection let's come over okay hello um can you tell us your name in a few sentences about your project okay hi i'm lee my project is voicemail so it's the wiser active mirror so when you speak in a blue microphone i'm going to reacting like with the mirror should we try yeah sure i'm going to combine cry for me and your favorite song don't cry for me louder my nostril is so beautiful it's really not it's not no it's not no i can't like you want to demonstrate yeah wow let's have you explain the project and we'll play through some of it we're trying to get through as many things i don't know if we can go through the full experience but let's see let's see how it goes okay uh so tell us your names why don't you all come stand together okay okay um and then and describe it first then we'll we'll try playing my name's nick grant you don't have to speak right into it i'm tina welcome to death is imminent but let's have fun in this four player game users must communicate with each other in order to fix its effective spacecraft all right so who wants to play we need four players we got people playing all right all right this is gonna be very hard to caption so for those of you reading the capsule.com put this uh this is the light for the captioner we're just gonna put that in the center and then we'll just go my senses tell me that the earth is in the state of despair it is cracking apart and mankind's time on earth is coming to an end we need to take off immediately i understand that you do not know how to operate a spacecraft that is okay the instructions are in your console because you need to do them before the countdown is over otherwise you will damage the ship too much damage and we will all die did you get that good starting preparation sequence in five four three two one new instructions you have 50 seconds new instructions you have 45 seconds uncovered cool foreign right all right still 10 live instructions you have 40 seconds no that's the bottom you're off to a great start the engine is new rios you have 27 seconds the motors are turning faster new instructions you have 24 seconds slide over the top slide uh is you can accomplish anything up you have eight seconds thank you for praying tell us your name in a few seconds sure hi i'm adrian bautista a second year graduate student at itv um i built this project called public message which is meant to explore you know how do physical locations and augmented reality shape public discussions um so basically i mean if you want to do a quick demo yeah let's tell us tell us the spiel and then because it's sort of sure the audio will be lost i mean i guess it's becoming more common now for air content to appear in public spaces from like pokemon go to the jeff kuhn snapchat collaboration but then the question of like who kind of controls that space like is it the platform or is it the people who create the content or is the people who actually own the space or if it's a public space is it the government um so just kind of want to kick out that conversation as ar becomes more and more popular more prevalent um so what i did was i built a little app where i'm just a simple qr sticker you just any smartphone that can read a qr it'll open up a web ar experience so there's no app you have to download or anything it gives you a little pointer about how to set it up start it and when you point it and so there's a little prompt and then you could always reply to say like i wouldn't i wouldn't like sponsor content on my door the content there so people can kind of discuss in a physical space that's there but not really there so yeah fantastic great job thank you uh tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project i'm jenny i'm a second year icp student my project is an ar audio visual healing system that take you through my love story in new york city and most of the stories happen in washington square park so the experience is actually mapped in washington square park and how the real experience is that you follow this transparent tube and it will lead you to a location where there's this big reveal of like selflove it's kind of like a metaphor of how when people are in relationship there's like tunnel vision they only see one point and it's like you know when people are doing are there focusing on their phone and it looks ridiculous for people from the outside and hopefully hopefully in the end with the big reveal people can take in the beauty of the world and we focus on themselves that's why it's selflove yeah would you like to try yeah um yes so the audio only comes through the headphones yeah yes so because it's mapped to washington square park that's why you can only experience the very last bit of of the experience like the revealing part and it's not mapped here so you have to be careful not to bump into people if you wanna try okay let's try for a couple minutes so do you see the transparency and how you play the audio is by putting a tube in the middle of the screen to make it solid that's the only time when the audio will play and then this is the the revealing part but yeah you can see where the tube is it's a very large scale so you can walk like way is it a circle it was supposed to be in the park so it would be a walk but just not so that's why i have the documentation video on to tell you what the real experience supposed to be like okay thank you let's come over here uh tell us your names and a couple sentences about your project i'm maya and i'm kara i our project is a data visualization that uses augmented reality to um look at housing unaffordability in the lower east side in manhattan um so why do you want to show your home yeah so um basically if you pick up this ipad um and you look at the map side um it's gonna show you a hundred people then if you click on this little icon in the corner it will bring up some facts so first it's gonna show you the median um side then it's going to show you what apartment rent the immediate income is in that same area and there's a pretty stark contrast of those two numbers and then it shows you how that actually affects people's ability to live in that area so it talks about this thing called the 40 times rule and the 40 times rule states that you must make 40 times a monthly rent in income per year in order to be allowed to rent so this is something that happens when you're applying for a new place so if maya goes ahead and closes it but we wanted to show the disparity of the people that are living in this area so slowly they start to fade away and this is to show you that of the population of 158 000 in the lower east side truly only eight percent of them would be able to live there according to the 40 times rule and so that's what remains thank you all right let's go over to all right hello there will you tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project and then you can demo it as well okay i'm eva i'm a second year at itv um and so i made a chrome extension that goes over a browsing page and highlights the co2 emissions that are produced during um during internet use internet browsing so i can show you if you want basically this chrome extension adds these bubbles to the tops of any webpage and when when you load a web page a new bubble appears and the size of the bubble estimates the grams of co2 that's produced um during that paid load um and then it sort of it calculates the grams of co2 produced during this browsing session and sort of tries to estimate the standard the miles that you could drive emitting that same amount of co2 in a standard car uh so all these numbers are very much estimates because it's something that's very hard to quantify but this was more sort of to show people outside of the itp community that don't really know about this to make them realize that the internet has physical consequences so yeah is it available in the chrome store not at the moment because i want to fix some of the numbers but um yes at some point and then i also just for fun um looked at the uh how many sort of api calls are made for twitter and like every second and then i also mapped my own um browsing throughout the week and just to see how many grams of co2 using my memories to see how much i'm producing how are you doing there ellen does your arm need to break maybe yeah because we could do some switching we could switch a room might recognize the song i don't know if this made it in on purpose or by accident it's still not sure it's a first coincidence i think of that i can download the patches okay there you go all right sorry to lead with that maybe all of you who worked on this could you gather in one spot and then um just tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay my name is roy yeah i'm karen so this product came from that we found the electronics are so fascinating so we want to change them into other playful machines and we found all these things in the u.s u.s store like we bought the old friendly and the old tables and the old turntable and then we made this fan into a record player and that telephone into a rocket mode game and that turned over into a bubble machine actually it's a happiness generator machine great should we try each of them one at a time yeah sure yeah so this one is it mocks up the experience of playing a vinyl player and turns it on and then this is for changing the speed of the music okay uh okay then this is the workable game if you press this button the game will start and you can use the receptor to watch them anybody want to try like this did i break it okay and then oh you are shooting the secrets cool hold on okay so tell us your name before you put it on or tell us your name in a few seconds about your project okay yeah so where should i be looking are you looking wherever you want okay but you can look here um i'm andrea and so my project's a vr project um and it uses vr to tell a poetic experience about sorry about kind of exploring flashbacks and what it means to have control over our own experiences and memory yeah wonderful does anyone want to try it off yeah yeah of course you've done videos so you can adjust the headset and the interaction's super easy um you can just press take your time let me know if you need help i think i'm good okay yeah so super easy it's just a mouse press here i'm gonna put it in your hand okay this is you're gonna want to go towards the end but as you go on maybe you're not going to want them it's weird that you guys can see what i'm doing oh oh there's more okay cool all right um so that man that you see is supposed to represent trauma so the first time you go through this experience it's like going and walking around and you make something horrific happen um and now this part is supposed to represent how memory will kind of try to understand that so the memory if you've ever unfortunately experienced something like that you might replay that memory in your head over and over again um and if he ever chooses to stop he can stop time and stop everyone from moving but he can never prevent what's gonna happen and so he is like looping this memory and it's i just thought vr was a really cool way to describe such a specific experience with our minds and allow people to become immersed and also think a lot about that experience in a different way yeah wonderful thank you great job i'm just trying to keep going quite um so my name is eric i had this project it's called bouncing ball karaoke and you basically have this ball and like every time it bounces it goes like one word further i can show it i lyrics and that's a pretty long intro 30 seconds and like um time you hit the words you get like one point uh so i would say like seven more seconds all right okay so i feel the battery kind of dies but basically yeah every time it bounces it goes like one more further um and i can kind of maybe show it like without you know yeah so i guess that's it it is still your favorite song uh no i feel this is a song that kind of everyone knows so but not everyone seems to know it actually like but i think like 90 of the people here know it so it's yeah it's it's a fun song and it's also like really difficult to sing it in like a karaoke bar but like i'm trying to make like everyone able to actually sing it by while hearing the voice the actual singer and trying to hit it on like the right rhythm um yeah and i feel better that gets showed like working i have to change the battery which takes a while you changed the ball right yeah so basically it was like a rubber band yeah yeah it was oh yeah you're so easy for you to replace the bathroom yeah it is it is and it was very close up like a working prototype with like fully uh rubber but yeah unfortunately it's just this um well yeah all right thank you so much thank you jake jake uh hi so can you tell us your name and a little bit about your project sure i'm jake sherwood uh my project is called climatescape it's a kinetic art installation to raise awareness for climate change and the human effect on the climate it's representing four future potential climate change scenarios going from best case to worst case so as you progress through the installation it gets more and more chaotic cool so do you want to demonstrate it this is kind of producing more tranquil uh softer sound and then as you get through it gets more chaotic and becomes scary at the end can you talk a little bit about what the rcp values are uh sure so the rcp stands for representative concentration pathways it's actually a data modeling set that the the intergovernmental panel on climate change is opted for scientists around the world to be able to have a baseline for modeling specific climate change data points but it has these four various scenarios which allowed me to kind of paint a picture of best case the worst case for what will happen in the climate if we do everything to kind of correct the problems that we have or if we do nothing and all kind of cool all right thanks very much we have to be very close because of this okay so where uh can you tell us your name and a little bit about your project yes uh should i see the camera yes okay hi um my name is jacob i work with chiwen she's not here right now so our project is called around us it's about something that around us also around the earth so you can see here so when you wake up you always check the weather or when you want to go new place but you don't know where it is you have to use the map like google maps or atom maps but all those technologies are based on the satellites but we never think about that so we want to make some awareness through this project so they're there so we use open source data called the union of concerned scientists based on these data we made three visualization so first one is the timeline shows the from 974 to 2019 how many satellite launches based on these four categories severe government and commercial and military and you can see there's some question marks in here because this open source data is chosen by them so we actually don't know how many satellites launched during this so we pick some random numbers from this data and we want to show the so there's something more beyond this data and also based on this data there's a called world map visualization it shows uh how many satellites uh own each country each countries oh and how many satellites so obviously united states lead this industry so there's some lagging in my computer but at final united states has like more than 900 satellites and the final one is called the satellite showing the what kind of satellites around earth so if when you hover the mouse to the satellite you can see the detail of satellite images and lifespan operators who owned these satellites and also we printed out this to as a some kind of trading card like mba or mlb like we don't wanna make this too serious we just wanna make people more like just fun and a little bit of awareness about they're there like something around us yes that's all great job thank you thank you this way hello my name is matt ross i'm a second year at itp and i'm here to to talk to you about your relationship with your data daniel do you think you have a problem with data hoarding yes do you just every day wake up generate google documents spreadsheets pdfs and even powerpoints that are just living and sitting in your cloud services yes so what i have here today is a simple outlet but it's not just a simple outlet this outlet is connected directly to the servers at google and what it does is it looks for any documents that you haven't even looked at in over two years so let's say you gave a presentation just two and a half years ago is that really something that you need in your life is this something that's really sparking joy this project is sort of my my first step in trying to have a better relationship with my data and hopefully all of our data and so what you can do here today is one of two things you can take the extreme route authenticate pull the plug and delete everything that's older than two years here is a video of me doing exactly that and you can say i have a lot of useless stuff here um that i haven't looked at but that's a little bit extreme so i have made an alteration to this to kind of let us take the first step into a more healthy relationship with our data so what you can do today is log in and it will find just one single file and it'll show you what that file is and if you're ready you can pull the plug and it'll delete just that single file and maybe just let you take a step towards having data in your life that really makes you feel good and that it's important to you would you maybe want to uh i would but i'm going to have to two factor in my phone's over here yeah yeah we might need it you know what uh just for this for the sake of speed i can do it myself and i'll delete a one of my own files live in live stream so i'll show you how it works so obviously a big a big issue is privacy and keeping things safe so this all the code is open source and you can see how everything is working all the credentials are only stored just for this the sole time of the experience and um all the browsers are in incognito windows no sessions or anything get saved so you start it up you have a nice ascii art you have a blank page log in oh there we go all right don't don't worry about that it's a friendly suggestion so here are these these this is just the amount of things that any google chrome extension would ask of you allow okay so now the script is activating and it's see it's retrieving all documents from a year and a half ago and i have 10 total files that i haven't looked at in over 18 months and this is a file called life retro which i think has some life goals from a few years ago you know what i'm here at itp things going well let me uh let me get rid of this so here's this plug and when i pull this i'll have six seconds to change my mind see it's going gold you can still change it i think deletion of one file and and that's the whole process yeah i wanna i've i this is giving me a lot of anxiety yeah i feel like i need to like fully dive into this at some point totally and uh you know it's we should definitely talk but we have we have another uh we have i have another project here that i've worked on with the lovely diamond alkas which is a lot less invasive oh what a nice segue yes oh let's come over here welcome to our partnership here you've introduced yourself and now you can introduce yourself and uh tell us a few words about your project sure i'm donna i'm a second here uh here at itp and i've worked together with matt we developed a new team called url data where obviously you can see healthy data starts here and we really wanted to raise awareness of the browser hygiene and the fact that we are constantly keeping our bodies clean and whenever we leave the public space we hand sanitize our hands but our phone is no less public than the train and our browser is no less public than the train or any place that we're visiting so we want to show you uh something that we've developed in the past few weeks i'm going to take my phone here and i'm going to scan this qr code it's going to send me to a safari webpage um nothing too fancy about it it's just the p5 sketch asking me insert your phone into the container now i'm going to uh turn on our machine and put this lovely little phone in here now all our goal today is basically to delete your or clear your browsing history so i'm gonna come here to this corel lovely perel and i'm gonna use it and if you would take a look here my browsing history has been cleared and that's it we really encourage you all to think about doing that every time that you use a hand sanitizer now do you wanna add something about this yeah again this is just the first step to having a cleaner more healthy lifestyle and just like healthy hands start here with bureau healthy data starts here with our machine thank you i feel like this needs to permanently live like on the floor next to the actual purell we also think we're gonna talk with it okay so you need an advocate for that yeah sign me up i'll sign the petition the easiest way is if you're oh look someone came with me is so i'm finishing setting up but uh these are my parents so we're gonna we're gonna try this out with my parents this is worth it they just got here from uh from houston texas welcome to brooklyn should we pop back and forth are you sure oh yeah yeah i'll i'll let you know when i'm putting okay great let's um vr is always hard oh there's a screen okay why don't we get a quick explanation while somebody is right is that okay can you tell us your name in a couple sentences about your project um i'm lillian uh i'm abby and um we did a vr experience that kind of explores yayoi kusama's she has a lot of installations that are based off of infinity so i wanted to kind of play with that concept in virtual reality which is a truly infinite space so we made a few different rooms that you can just explore endlessly and you can just get out whenever you want thank you for sharing all right can you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi my name is bo wong and i'm from stanhard and this is my project it's called the shape of evil and it's a detective horror game uh yeah so do we need any content warning or no it's okay i think we're fine this is a horror game if anybody is uh concerned maybe skip ahead one minute can you play somebody for us okay okay like you can see i'm controlling an agent now yeah and i'm investigating the accident here yeah i can find a dead woman here oh and i saw the information about this dead woman and while i'm present here queue against each different item thank you so much okay thank you thank you okay now we're ready over here all right can you do a quick introduction yourself first sure my name is nikhil kumar i'm a first year student here at itv the piece is a sound piece that is exploring a restless mind one thought at a time so when my mom starts uh she'll hear nothing initially but uh after removing each of these pieces and burying it in the dirt she'll start to hear more and more but she won't hear the entire musical composition until everything is removed and i'll just leave it at that i'm curious great okay okay left right just take a seat take your time and remove these one at a time and bury them here and that's it up well i think with 15 of them you basically never have anybody experience it the same way so they're they're hearing little bits and pieces of the entire composition as they remove things but now that she's removed everything she's going to hear the the full musical composition so it'll just run and eventually loop so people will ultimately get to the same experience but after taking everything out thank you thanks cool thanks right here tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project oh hi i'm rebecca and this is our like computer media final so this is kind of like a collective data visualization that visualizes your harvest as clocks the metaphor behind is that your clock is ticking so it's just like you're live and it's like more confidently looping and just it cracks and clocks and fades away so we want you just use your process like your heartbeat to create a unique part for you so let me show you what experience so gently put your finger tip on there so it will detect your harvest uh jump to the clock town so here you can see your unicorn there will be a unique plotting ticking sound for you and then you put your name here like my name is you will hear all kinds of so it'd be very beautiful to hear all kinds of like other people's lives like and we're very inspired by the clock installation part made by humans since 1920 98 and this is the thing thank you very much okay can we uh can you tell us your name and a few sentences about your project all right my name is ben mall i'm a first year ite student and uh i created a lighting designer stage assistant tool so you can test out your vision for a show before you so we've got a couple sliders on the screen so you can change let's say we want to make it a little more blue so you can change the amount of red here and it gets a little more purple and then we can move this light back and forth and change the shadows on the screen here yeah so you can move the shadows back and forth and uh the idea is that you'll be able to move both lights do you have a background as a lighting designer yeah i did some uh stage lighting design in college uh i studied electrical engineering but always loved theater so i always wish there was a way to test out what i was wanting to put on the stage before i got there so we're we're no longer at 721 broadway yeah yeah but we should definitely reach out and see if anybody in the design department therapy i definitely will yeah yeah great job thank you so much hi mom my dad okay tell us your name in a couple sentences about your project oh okay so my name is tiani um i also go by that my project is about using your face to play a video game um this game is called fake your smile and basically it's a game that forces you to smile in order to play the game um and then like would you like to try sure yeah okay so um it's um so you just use this camera to like um it will recognize your face and in order to start the game you have to do this gesture okay which is pop might be a little hard with the theme okay so um yeah so basically um this is how you play this game by doing this yeah and once the game starts every time i smile it will show the friendliness to the people who pass by and it takes four friendliness to actually make someone like you like oh no i missed it um but basically you have to and smile like which is not smile to regain the positive energy um so if i do this person like this person will become my friend now so that's basically how i play this game um and then just it requires the player to continue smile or not smile in order to play this game and then there's a final challenge based on how much smile you have um if you made one person like you you have to spoke your smile for 10 seconds and if you made two people like to have to smile for 20 seconds so basically the better you do at the beginning the harder it is to win the game at the end and now my challenge if i have to keep my smile otherwise the circle will start shaking and then in that case i will lose the game yay so that's basically how i win the game um and um basically um the longest for this game on that you have to hold your smile is 30 seconds yeah um tell us your introduce yourself tell us your name in a few sentences about your project okay so my name is look here okay my name is anna oh and i'm second year of itp and then recently i am studying a little bit more about the ar interfaces so this is one of my projects i'm a really love to drink wine but when i go to my store i'm not a wine expert so i'm easily lost which one i have to buy so me and my friends built this ar app which helps you your wine selection so first of all you can choose your preline preference first for example for me i like medium and i like vanilla and i like a little bit spicy taste and then you can scan your wine level yeah okay if you want to position later yeah maybe here okay so this mean is zero match with my preference so this is just okay for me this y model so what about this one this one also zero match with my preference so i might don't want to buy these two bottles so if people can find it's a happy face that means that wine bottle is perfectly matched with people's preference so yeah we are still developing in this area can you can you uh tell us your name my name is pablo and i made this joy detection mirror and it basically uses computer vision and ai to know what a smile looks like and it sees as well it lights up and you go through the infinity mirror all the way to the vortex so you guys want to try it if you get it to smile and light up you have the right to take one mnm if it doesn't light up it means that you don't have a soul so you might check that with your doctor um hey lit up i know you're smiling he's picking it thank you great job thanks guys do you have a placard oh hi i'm emily hey i'm billy and uh we worked on a web and mobile app that tries to show the relation between sound and color since they're both using frequency and the unit of hertz and other couple different pages that we can walk you through but then um here's a learn page um so the sound isn't working on this but what it's doing is um these are the color frequencies and it's showing the wavelengths associated with it and ideally it plays the pitch so on here you can see how the blue is higher than the red people can go to this site right now yes um it is el315 dot itp [Laughter] maybe wait a couple hours everybody there you go you can also send some signals so um people can collaboratively draw and once again it's supposed to play the associated page but people can just like make a little party page beautiful with colors super fun and then um billy here will demonstrate that yeah so this is reading the webcam we put it on the about page this is uh reading the webcam values across the pixelated image and it plays different midi values based on those uh based on the the pixel data basically so we're kind of mapping the colors to different musical notes here yeah thanks and i go by henry i'm a itb first year student and this is a project me and rebecca working on for pecan class and it's about how data can process through light and it's about how our daily action can be transferred and processed through like stage by stage so if users press a button about their activities and you see the visualization between like stage by stage like for example i'm pressing button about how facebook can using our data set from like collecting to exchange and to sell to other advertisement companies and how they will like analysis the data set then in the end it will become the advertisement back to us yep wonderful yeah great job thank you whoa all right so tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay so uh my name is jan um you can try according to it and when you get close to it you can like really control it by every centimeters this is and here like the perfect pattern that i hide it's like a david's card there's no projector it's just light not just led light just like led and cinders you um can you stand together yeah so just tell us your names first and then a few sentences about the project i'm stacey yeah i am monique i'm tian so this is a live vending machine we want to raise people's surrenders of protecting animals and how the endangered animals are feeling right now yeah you want to try it can you demonstrate it yes uh so you can see how many endangered animals are killed per week right now please insert the coin and start your journey of our machine pick any animal we prefer you picked the tiger so here you can see an animation the tiger is falling to the trap they won't get out but they can't because it's already been killed here you will get a product made by the tiger it's a leather coat also you're gonna get a receipt from the more information about the tiger yeah we'll bury this so intricate and like detailed all the fabrications oh yes i want my receipts yeah sorry it's a lot of information so it'd be time to pray yeah okay thank you hey how are you i'm good okay tell us your name and a couple cents okay your project i'm zeyel i'm a first year of itp this is called thirsty plant so thirsty fun is a millennial digital pond that's only been watered by my social media account activities um so the way that it targets the issue of like how teenagers always stick for likes and followers on the internet and this outlines this point always needs water so i can demonstrate it so if someone liked my tweet it goes the waters start changing and yeah it's also the collective flight installation that i want to show people how like this water got like changed or light got changed based on time based on different people on the internet everyone can contribute to this light source eric kind of like do this yeah wonderful great job thank you what did you guys all right some of you might by the way recognize this is psy if you're a member of the coding train who's coding trade community so i'll just introduce yourself and tell us a few seconds about your project yeah so hi i'm sai i'm the coding trained community manager also first year at itp so this project is called the black projections project and basically i built what i call like a portal mapping device so it's like a map that potentially could help you unlock a portal and it kind of talks about or investigates space time and how those are all connected to a lot of different moments that are happening um and you basically explore it with the magnet you move across the points and then different images are projected on the screen how are you sensing the magnet i'm using read switches so each point each little circle has like a sensor underneath and basically when you place a magnet over it that turns on or off and then each kind of point has a collection of images that are then displayed randomly on the screen do you want to demonstrate i'm thank you okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi my name is lenny and my name is by michelle so our project is called the pale blue dot and inspired by a article called yet articles called the pale blue dot by carl uh so basically uh the way he described the earth as they published uh saying the earth from the different perspective and uh i think that article is really inspiring um you never think earth as such a small and fragile thing that's tangible and because it's under our feet that we don't really recognize it so we made a tangible earth like with a really with a metaphor of the heartbeat by using the led dimming on and off to address the issue of actually our human action even though it seems to be really tiny but it's doing a lot to the earth and so on top of the earth there's some lollipop and when you take away the lollipop the earth will start to actually develop so it's actually showing that the heartbeat actually is being as not as lively as before and inside the wrap of the lollipop there's a message telling you that it's the representing the natural resource of lollipop and um but it's actually telling you that you can take away the lollipop like you don't have to feel guilty because we need to use the natural resources but it will be great if you can contribute a little back to the earth so we have like a hidden mission in this rack that you have to actually squat down to find the white box under the table and inside the box there is more lollipop that you can decide to plant one lollipop back to the blue dot so if you plan it back yeah it will become lively again thank you so much okay tell us your name and a few sentences about your projects okay i'm starting tomorrow second year and i have um like installation but it can be also simulated by a very simple method it's like like i said ultimate oil so it costs you that speaking space okay so big wave goes faster quite a small wave goes slower so it's very similar to the real world is and also i have some air to originally from there and also here but people knew that scary so run away until 99.8 percent people survive but even yeah but here also i have some another thing yeah i i just quickly assure you can we come check out your project okay tell us your names and a few sentences about what you made the name of our project is wink rocks and women and it's about penio who are basically deep su divers in jojo island but it also includes stories from mothers in mainland korea so you can listen to different stories through different objects by scanning the tag over here to the side of your headphones and what were your names my name is sue i'm katy sure oh no i don't want to put anything on there just can you talk a little bit about what he's hearing yes so these are just various stories from interviews um taken from kenyo in jeju island so it's just kind of about like the henyo have like a very ecofriendly approach to deep sea diving and collecting shellfish they make sure that they never over harvest and they have just like a collective community of like making sure that yeah they never over harvest and they collect trash but um sadly this probably is the last generation of this profession just because like younger women in jeju island are choosing not to like pursue this profession which requires just years and years of training so we just kind of want to give an homage to like the different culture that has kind of developed in jojo island where it's more like matriarchal than mainland korea um yeah that's kind of funny yeah we also wanted to kind of uh tell the story of kenya side by side with the story of a mother in seoul so more of the traditional patriarchal society and living in that society thank you thanks i'm good yeah stronger than i realized all right let's see oh boy we've been going for two hours now yeah yeah i don't know if we're gonna be able to get to everybody's project we'll do our best okay but we're here we're here for the takes okay tell us your names and a few sentences about your project my name is alvaro couture i'm nicole gernelling and our project is a object tracking installation that tracks objects to control different types of animations in real time so we have these spheres that help with all of the animations and yeah that's development after using the connect here to track the size of the spheres and the light the brightness of the spheres so we're getting a really smooth tracking of these which are being sent to the 3d particle system in unity and we're getting these realtime and they're both working today they are yeah they are all right it's time to take a nap okay uh tell us your name and if you sent us about your project hi i'm brent uh and i think work is for suckers um so i made this game about not working it's called stay in bed simulator the goal is to stay in the bed for as long as possible the game is controlled by the bed so you can watch tv in your bed you can also look at your phone in your bed and yeah that's pretty much that's pretty much the whole thing and what's the rule what's the record um the record i think right now is about 20 000 points which is roughly 15 minutes set by your very own alden rivendale jones um i have a feeling i could do very well i'm not allowed to right now thank you thank you uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay i'm david and this is uh my project is about reflecting the website environments as a physical environment to create a tree that based on the website environment and makes it yeah and then generate the image that represent the environment that the user know that the website they go into are exactly like the physical environment affect you mentally and physically so yeah by showing a tree so here's the here's the website so you can go to on any website but for now we have a frozen tomatoes last airbender reviews and as you can see it's quite negative and it's a there's a red leaves and yeah and the entire background is in is like lightning and stuff so it's quite sad to see but it just shows you that you're going into a scary website right now at least a scary comments but yeah and if you look at the for example like articles from like box and stuff it take a while to load but yeah it will it'll create a tree based on the article it views it's getting the analysis and oh yeah so the the websites have a positive like a positive and the negative it's very more positive and it creates a field and it has a tree that represents all the all the words that go into the website all right tell us your name and a few words about your project okay uh my name is julia fernandez i worked on this with isabel rican she's in california um and my project is supposed to talk about the absurdity of our faces and how strange we look when our face is dissected and how recognizable we are awesome should i try it yes you should tried it yesterday this one is fun oh it has trouble with glasses and sometimes discriminates on a beard sorry but there you are what's funny is when i take my glasses off i can't see oh i don't actually know awesome okay can you tell us your name and a few sentences about it yeah i'm shinjuku and my partner is alvin he's not here he's flying on the miami beach must be nice yeah this is my project it's called evan flow and it is a kinetic light sculpture and we're doing this it's like light is always perceived as a static element in our life so we want to kind of break the boundaries and explore light in the more vivid way so we're using this to this motion kind of using this motion to recreate the tangible and natural phenomenon of app and flow so this is like going up and down and material wise we use mineral oil and this is hanging spotlights so it's kind of recreate the effects of sunlight hits if you see it from the side you may see the wavy motion hi tell us your name and a couple words about your project sure my name is aydah and this is my project it's noise it's an audio enhanced optical illusion the the visual pattern is a vortex the center shifts depending on where you're looking at it so as the viewer moves around in space it triggers also triggers the audio changes in the headphone that corresponds to the direction of the moving center of the vortex cool thank you do you want to try it oh this is the music one is just tell us your name and a few sentences about your project okay hi my name and this is my project here it's called auto vendor it's a vending machine and it's crew project with davey and lachlan so it is built like a fake vending machine we were trying to do here is to sell animations so the slogan for this is snacks and work so we thought about like on this floor aside from the snacks what else the students need when they're frustrated or hungry so do you want to give it a try sure is so these are shot using slow motion screen and this is actually one of the earliest if you want to see recording the screen right now i'm sorry so this is actually like uh recorded using a stop motion and what we're trying to do here is some of the animations are like the machine eat the food itself so we were trying to go to think about the concept of convenience right now and try to link there was laziness it's like right now like the machine instead of it gives you food it eats itself but then we show this to everybody and they think that like the asmr like sound are very joyful and the teacher suggests that or you you guys should probably make just a cute machine as those animations and we're trying to make puns on that so that it gives you encouragement when you see the message that was going to say um go through the barricade and there are also some some others like i love you very much things like that so it's kind of cute wonderful thank you thank you so much it's time for the story again yes okay tell us tell us we'll go in and maybe watch it operate but maybe just tell us your name and uh a few words about your project my name is rita and this project is in collaboration with max the silva and it's kind of a choose your own adventure poem you can sit you put your headphones and you start it by saying high sailors and then it gives you a list of questions you can ask and you hear a story that will change every time you want a demo what do yeah you can just say hi do i have to say something hi sandler's just hi sailors hi sailor who are you where are you where are you why did you leave i think it stopped yeah okay i should yeah you can try it question we cannot hear oh she's here she yes of course i knew that because i did this yesterday yeah it used to also write to the other right right there and now we just said the question thank you yeah thank you for stopping by it started working by the way yeah it's all good thank you just tell us your name and a couple sentences about your project i'm sherry so my project is orange juice squeezer and my project is a smell interaction project which has the visual sound and smell coming out wonderful it smells so good in here can you can you can you demo it for us uh yeah so you just take a fake orange and press it on the squeezer there's juice coming out and smell come from there too there's no real oranges in this room yeah except for that knife it's real okay everybody careful thank you hello hello all right uh tell us your name in a few seconds about your project um very selfexplanatory my name is tyler uh yeah i guess it's really selfish explain it i created this goal stoppers project um it's running off opposed net in p5 and basically you're using your hands to stop the ball from getting into the goal i'm a big soccer fan i enjoy soccer and i feel like something like this in the real world would be cool to help goalies maybe you know train and you know get their agility going i think it'll be pretty cool so yeah this is my project can you play it for us yeah sure if it works a little bit better everybody's a little bit out of frame honestly image good shave good job you got to watch all right tell us your name and a couple of sentences about your project uh my name is wenjing um my project is called neither square or circle it's all saying in chinese is saying that you cannot like make a circle without using ruler so it means you cannot um achieve something if you don't follow some rules so i want to explore that definition and the space between definition and ambiguity so i try to translate that into sound and visual so i want to translate between square and a circle and the visual of e will translate it into the sound wave so from a square wave to a circle more like a sine wave thing yeah so that's the basic idea behind this it's beautiful and you're just projecting uh like a rectangle moving back and forth by projecting a line a line the shape is defined by the all of these yeah okay we okay yeah so all right tell us your name and a few cents about the project i'm skylar devos this is my project i called it liquid relationships um and it's about connecting with other people yeah like how what's the best way for us to demonstrate this student is to okay and do it okay who wants to try all right i was here yesterday with like six people doing it it was crazy yeah the more people you have the more fun it is i i should not participate because i shouldn't tell you okay are the things that are aquarium pumps this is a fish tank i had as a kid really yeah that is wild it's beautiful does it matter just like a little like so it works with at least 10 people i haven't found that's amazing it's very hard to show the vr project so all right i'm excited to see this in action all right tell us your names and just couple sentences about the project hi my name is ty hi my name is ashwin and this is our project it's a twoway shadow wall where you see the shadow of yourself as well as the shadow of the person behind it and when your two shadows overlap it creates music and we have created different sections which adds different filters into the sound piece so you can make play around the entire space and yeah just have fun with it so it's a different way of communicating with each other do you guys want to try it yeah sure sure yeah why don't you two try and i'll fail it's gonna hold do you want me to hold it if you say anything about the project say it into there the channel this one's live i tried your reactions there's no projections all right here we go only about like four and a half hours in all right no no no no but it's been two hours all right tell us your names and a few sentences about your project hi i'm tina i'm chris christina and this project is called one amongst many it's a physical data visualization representing women in computing fantastic yeah all right so what should we try you want to walk around through it and yeah as you uh pick up these orbs they illuminate to full brightness and you can see every woman that we chose is a cohort with a bunch of other women so we have computer scientists mathematicians as you pick an orb up and read about a certain woman other women in her cohort will also eliminate and as the orbs are interacted with over time they get incrementally brighter so the orbs that have been read a lot will sort of like increase invisibility and you can also see other orbs that have been read a little bit less yeah their placements are based chronologically on their years of accomplishments and their heights are based on their numbers of backlinks which identifies how famous they are so the least famous ones are lower to give the audience more accessibility to the information and yeah our whole concept is to kind of like uh give more visibility to these women and inspire young people to get into the field of computing because us as creators we felt like we didn't really know we still didn't know about these women until we did this project so it was a shame but it was really awesome and yeah we want to inspire the young people here can you tell us really great things about the board over there yeah sure um so this is a sticker board and like our idea is to kind of like have a piece of the project where the audience can leave a mark of their own into our project these are the four categories that are represented within our project and we want people who have seen the project to identify themselves within one of these circles whether they're computer scientists mathematician um creative or executives activists inventors or you know like a merge of different circles so yeah it's a little fun fun thing for them to leave behind thank you good job thank you uh just introduce yourself and tell us a couple things about your night uh i'm gail i'm a first year at itp and this is gil spurling by the way uh this is the interactive scroll um so it's designed to allow someone to interact with an ancient scroll physically so you can use these rods to scroll through they have a bunch of different ancient texts here which are in hebrew and then this allows you to translate as you're reading it if you can't read the hebrew language or um the text isn't legible this is what allows you to read you can scroll a little further so yeah this was a uh pcomp um project um sort of like a basic interaction design um it would probably work well and uh should i keep going no we're good thank you yeah wow this is yours right yeah yeah give us uh tell us tell us your name and a few sentences about your project hi i'm nick um this is a project with sid chow i'm nick greg um this these are uh it's called conversation which is a duet between two hanging lamps each of these lamps emit light when bitten so the idea here is that in a dark room where this would be the only source of light that this would sort of be tools for listening so that to keep a room lit while also having a conversation you would switch off between talking and otherwise biting or producing the light and so as you look also looking at the sort of mouth as the main switch point for the interaction now are you demonstrating this or uh here so that your your teeth don't go fully out but so yeah the other one's short shorted right now but you could imagine this being a popular tool for dark room in paris cool just tell us your name in a couple sentences about your project um we'll take a look at it yeah absolutely i'm julian matthews this is the hourglass um so there is climate change related data um correlated to um the visual on the sculpture do you want to do the honors or should i do it myself i think okay yeah you got your hands busy gotcha um so this is a statistic related to bees um if the bee disappeared off the face of the earth humans would only have four years left to live um there are some static ones another static one and then these require some user input this is meant to visualize rising sea levels so you can use a slider to demonstrate that this is the approximate hue of the flint river water during peak crisis a little bit terrifying that this was coming out of people's faucets this checks the air quality of any city in the world so wouldn't you want to give me a city this is this is showing paris right now it's moderate brooklyn new york let's put in brooklyn baby we're good but then you could also put in like shanghai for example and you get a not so good value in return um yeah it's been a little bit terrifying seeing people like laugh at that all day because it's actually terrifying but um yeah and then a couple more statistic related visuals and um that's about it awesome can you speak a little bit i might not be clear to people watching live can you speak to what is what this is exactly is not actually threedimensional for sure display um here let me slide around here sorry um so these are two discs that i actually 3d printed um that once it slows down i attach neopixel strips on the outside and with this motor down here it allows me to spin it at 450 rotations per minute which gives the illusion of these two globes great job yeah thank you appreciate it all right i think maybe we're going around to the hallway yeah all right so this is our lenticular portal room okay oh can you can we both stand next to each other i'm sorry now i'm totally just interrupting no we don't want to kick everybody out oh we're the worst okay all right all right all right all right uh just tell us your names in a few seconds about the project uh so i'm aiden uh fowler i'm nicole kellequito and this is our lenticular portal room so we're doing experiments with a lenticular lens which is if you've seen bookmarks that have moving images that's what we're working with here and it stretches and magnifies the light so we're doing different experiments here we have a threedimensional box um moving lenses that are rotating and then these flat sun rises over the ocean fantastic all right we'll try to get some footage for people to see all of them now and this one's a mirror so if it's reflecting the top and bottom um yeah cool and over here we're looking at like the bending of the lenticular lens um and also looking at the lens like when it's perpendicular to a light source um it's kind of creating an infinite uh color field if you look through it um and depending on how you're looking at it you can see the the light kind of creates these like pillars um and bending throughout the shape there's nothing there's nothing the best angle for the box there's nothing in the box shall we do the reveal of like what actually is inside it's an empty box it's an empty box wow the secret is revealed but there's a thousand leds in here did you guys do it oh no i thought they were individual and like yeah and this last piece over here is a separate um it's not lenticular this is called dichroic film um and based on the angle of incidence the angle the light's hitting the material a different wavelength of light passes through or is reflected and you can change the speed with this little knob down here so you can turn it from almost a video and then kind of stop motion you just do that again it'll get up super closer yeah amazing great job thanks for coming by all right available okay great um can you both just introduce yourself briefly and tell us a few sentences about your prize oh yeah hi i'm wen i'm from taiwan hi i'm kj i'm from korea yeah so this project is called goddamn voices so this is basically a garden system that is based on word recognition so you can choose the word from the library build and save it to a microphone and see how it goes so i'm obviously going to pick rainbow yeah you can't say it again rainbow so the rainbow or town that water and the water water pump and the light i know the the cheat code revolution revolution so you're trying everything because revolution is the most powerful word for us yeah so this installation is about like the power of words because sometimes it's too it's not as invisible so people just ignore it and want to enforce emphasize that this is so strong that people should pay responsible for it and you should be aware of it great job thank you thank you thank you can you tell us about the project yeah okay yeah because then we can if then we can go inside and the idea of this project is to let people to interact what they are doing in a routine life and um let them be aware of what they're doing because normally sometimes people are like doing their things on wealthy so it's the original idea of this project and yeah so we made a box which can reflect what people are doing in their daily life so we said some of the interactions in the real side room and every connection they're doing their room will be reflected in a small box and just just so we get it can you say your name in the name of the product yeah my name is and here is the creator of this project yeah just say your name so i'll find you funny pineapple yes you can go in but it's one person at a time well do you want to just take the camera in sure okay so you can sit down i yes so okay laughs time the chair's moving let's deal down that's beautiful very cool thanks sarah pop in there if you want to leave your shoes on you can just sit on the material and hang your feet hey hey can you guys introduce yourselves and tell us a few cents about the project oh yeah yeah get in there uh my name is gilad gillard um the project is called fever dream it is i'm gonna read off the thing a uh experimental light therapy to induce the participant into a fever dream and into another person's memories so it's based off of a personal experience that i had with a fever dream and uh built into an experience where people can try to be in that fever dream yeah built it with nick gregg uh partner in crime uh it's based off of a project that i did in uh called performing reality the class and that's taught by andrew schneider and yeah the best class i took at itp it's just about to start now if you guys wanna go in there yeah so we can kind of look from the side hey you you are asleep so you are in your body in another it's really intense you are yourself don't you move ready hello oh yes we're almost done come on in this is my project partner uh okay so stand next to me okay so standing next to each other so hey guys how's it going my name is sun liu and my name is chiang kao zhang and we are uh echo of silence as you can see here um our it's working right now so um as you could see earlier when we had the door open uh we left the noise streaming in uh the sculpture stopped all activities um and now we're gonna try and be quiet for a moment and see if something happens and if i keep making noise again and making conversation with you guys it's not supposed to be doing anything and if i keep quiet again beautiful yeah the inspiration basically comes from our own background as technology students we constantly make moving and talking machines and so this time for the winter show we were thinking what if we're making a project that would discourage all activities all the talking all the noisy digital distractions out there and just take a moment to connect more and listening you know closely more to ourselves to the people around us to our environment how would that sound like and how would that feel like thank you so much thank you for stopping by okay okay thank you thanks okay okay uh tell us your name in a few senses about your project yeah sure my name is na and my project's called confession room uh the purpose of is to show solidarity with sexual assault victims in china who were censored during the meeting movement last year so um what is the process of interacting with the project would you like to try i need actually i can yeah i can just play the audio a lot i think it should be fine but i probably could do some coding do mine um i think we just get like some shots of the project um and is there a place where people can find out more about your work online yeah sure so like basically you will hear some background uh story so when you after you sit down you'll hear some background stories of the movement and then it will ask you to read this passage which is the english translation of a real victim story i think this is unplugged i think it's i think it's supposed to be right and then you were reading to you just need to repeat that message and reading that into the microphone and if you get the words right the lies will show up and if you're they're saying they can't hear you're here and if you get the words wrong you will hear some really annoying uh highpitched beeping okay yeah i'm not sure if it works without the earphones he said it's much better now yeah i had just put it away i forgot what was going on okay there you go this project reflects that you turn it up all the way to movement in china last year sexual cell victims in the country have found it difficult to build their voices out as they are going up against not just the male dominant culture but also the government censorship the following experience might cause emotional distress as the address is sexual violence if you believe that you will find experience to be traumatizing you can choose to not participate if you're willing to proceed read this paragraph out loud repeat the words if you get stuck until the words are highlighted after you're done share your thoughts with us afterwards he drove me home did you get closer afterwards he drove me home and asked me to sit in the front seat stroking my hand he said to me in the tone of an elder do not mention what happened today to anyone i was just testing your moral conduct i only take students who are not just smart but also well behaved you pass the test you must have high morals i was too scared to say anything you've come to the end of this project thank you for giving boys to these victims now take a moment to reflect on experience you can scan a qr code if you like more information about the movement that was it thank you um and everything all right can you tell us your names and a little bit about your project sure um so my name is sarah and this is helen my partner um our project is basically uh we wanted to bring our beloved childhood games from the screen and out into the real world and so this is chompy right here um he it comes from mario kart 6 from nintendo 64. because it's one of our most loved games from childhood um and he basically sleeps as long as he's left alone and he doesn't detect a lot of people in front of him but as soon as the he gets any movement or presents he'll wake up uh he's asleep right now um he'll wake up open his eyes and bark at people because he's really cranky woke him up you shouldn't really look him up um and that's about what he does all right let's wake him up let's go oh he's up now there you go his eyes are moving um he'll start barking at you soon [Laughter] great job thank you okay hi can you tell us your name and a few words about your project yeah my name is pippa kelmanson i worked on this project with noah curnis he also has a project uh we made a heart that beats the beat of your own pulse um there's a monitor on the outside and there's a motor inside a elastic part um basically you just put your index finger on the pull sensor and then you can see your pulse be unreal time i'm glad that you have these freezer bags here it's good to keep that on ice walk by transporting organs and transplants and kind of bringing human elements uh yeah it's also speaking yes what is it made out of silicon silicon great job thank you okay sort i feel like we're at the nexus of these projects this is from the class called art toy design here at itp okay okay tell us your names and a couple words about your project my name is this is our steampunk coffee machine and it's designed that people to basically get that perfect cup of coffee that you need for the day because sometimes you just don't know how much coffee you need and you answer a couple questions and it'll tell you exactly how many grams of coffee you might want that day and also the type of coffee and the machine basically gets water from here it goes up and the water comes out and you can also get the perfect measurement for your coffee abby would you like to add a few words yeah sure so if you go ahead and follow me to where little sliders are so you can answer the first question is like how how are you doing today so you got like three options from great to dead basically and it's a and then how strong you like your coffee so whether you want a subtle to a bold cup and then what kind of rose profile you prefer light medium or dark and we actually have three types of beans which are from brooklyn roasting company so based off of your response to some of those questions um or the three questions rather on the first led screen you would get a display of which type of coffee to use and how many grams and then you would weigh out the amount of coffee right on the scale so now we've basically put the coffee into this filter here and are doing moreover coverage for the coffee how many how many cups of coffee have you made do you think that's at least 20 i think yeah between the two days um i would buy i would much rather buy coffee from you on a daily all right can you oh us your name and a couple sentences about your project my name is zach lee in our project called beste which which means composition in turkish and this is basically a musical instrument that has eight different monophonic synthesizers and we also have a realtime recordable sequencer so we let me show you quickly can i show you okay currently yeah there are some recording clips so i'm gonna clear them you can clear them by double tapping the clips and how it works is basically you just turn on the metronome and then while holding down the clip you and then it will be recorded and then you can even record your knob movements in real time too and then each rows represent different patterns so you can record different patterns and then arrange them in real time so it's very suitable for live performance i would say thank you so much all right just so for a minute here everybody who's watching we're going to do these two classrooms we're going to walk downstairs and just sort of see a few projects that are on display there and say goodbye all right everybody okay we all need a break but i don't know what we're gonna do about that okay okay um tell us your name and a few sentences about the project my name is and this project is called light it's about communication with physical i love separations so much so it's just how hard you press it right yes fully in costume this is great uh tell us your name and a few sentences about your project so i'm fernando and i'm creating this character called the firebird and to embody the character in which you put on this globus and i'm imagining here a performing arts context so depending on the gestures you make you get like different a different sound and also you change the position of this 3d object on the screen and you can like change the color of the object making different gestures related to the narrative i'm creating so you can make like fire and you get a red object or you can make a tree and you get a green object and you can make like this and this is bird so you can fly you can embody the fire firebird and fly around carrying this seat that is inside the valley of the firebird beautiful thank you thank you so much thank you guys okay hey you you teleported from over there i'm abby yeah so this is fireflies you guys get closer sure sure our concentration game so do we have a participant yeah sure patrick's our volunteer so what we have here is an eeg an eeg is an electro encephalogram it's got four electrodes built in here and what it's going to do is it's going to read the electrical activity inside of his brain and he's going to be able to manipulate a javascript animation with it patrick would you like to put this on your forehead i would love to awesome it's easy to go right behind so patrick right now the fireflies are trapped in this jar do you want to start the game sure let the fireflies go just pull it right off awesome we've got our fireflies on the screen when patrick concentrates the fireflies are going to come together patrick's not concentrated the fireflies are just going to be hanging out just like this so when we start the transmission of these brown waves so we have a prompt in the middle of the screen count to five um props are different for everyone so if you want to help focus you can look at that prompt or you can focus on something specific on the screen these are all different um you can use to help focus yeah one of the first people to say this is neither precise or accurate if it doesn't come together on your first try do not worry it's really just the device you do pretty well oh yeah and we've also got some excess so let's turn around then we'll come over here all right now just tell us your name and finish yourself in a couple sentences about the project hi my name is trendy sauce and this is my project called calm it's an immersive mindfulnessbased experience where a person is wearing an eeg headset that's wirelessly connected to my phone and then my computer so they're actually controlling the visualizations as well as the lights with their mind so if somebody is in an unfocused state you can see here the lights are flickering as well as the visualizations and when they're in a more focused piece of mind the lights turn blue as well as the screen so i'm really interested in wellness and tech and how we might use tech to help ourselves instead of using tech as a form of escapism i want to use tech to kind of get more in touch with yourself so i'm doing things like this i'm i've launched a company called design life well at designlifebull.com where you can experience things like this with other artists and free online workshops that use binaural sounds nature or sounds to kind of help you get more in touch with yourself and manifest your dreams so thank you so much thank you it must be hard to get that feeling in this show he's doing a great job tell us your name and a few sentences about your project wait uh you can enter if you want yes hello my name is alizarin and this is a sacred temple of cerebral femininity an immersive environment that's aimed to let you focus on the feminine sides of your brain which is the ability to birth spread the narration idea so there are a few ways to interact with it besides just to be immersed one of them is oh smart and compassionate mirror it knows where you are and will illuminate your face with a variety of flattering light patterns for your selfies and also well when scanning this baby you will get a cosmic compliment oh you're as mystical as a planet have no doubt let your brains shimmer upon humanity um yeah and there's like a lot of machine learning used to uh generate all these visual visuals and projections and motion capture and a bunch of technology many robots help me make this as effective as it should be beautiful we've made quite a delightful corner of this classroom i i love it so much that i'm like hey why don't you even have visitors i enjoyed it yeah build it at home next is that right great job thank you so much do you want to just give us a quick spiel introduction and then we'll sort of like move around the room and catch glimpses of you if you're gonna do a performance uh yeah sure so just first introduce yourself and tell us a few things about the project uh uh my name is tober blair uh this is uh this was my final for live image processing last spring i unfortunately wasn't able to present then uh but i've got it here now um it's just it's it's there's a little diorama with sort of sliding uh pieces going that can move in and out uh and you know and uh leds that can sort of change what they look like uh you know depending on the nature of the scene and it just it's there's kind of a story that tells us about the cycle of resource consumption um and sort of how how all these three environments interact with each other and feed into each other and there's this system that kind of works beautifully together so are you going to do a performance of it sure all right so why don't we uh we'll let you get going and then we'll kind of like come back and catch pockets of it okay so so so i'll just go and go oh all right well are you starting right now is yes um okay uh just tell us your name in a few cents about your project yeah um i'm hansel lee um i made a like a very very good uh breeding uh forest so those are elements are like indicator abstract traits so by different positions making a different type of space which can give people like a move inside also the trees are part of nature as well so among the elements of nature it could be exchangeable and replaceable and collected so yeah so i would like to give people just experiencing like inside of the space how they feel it like how uh nature reacts to the human being's reading as well broken um i can do it by manual so before like actually this is my original thing um so when uh foreign it's alone it's breeding their own speed like this and then but once someone's just inside of the corridor thanks uh just tell us your name and a few sentences about your project sure so my name is vanessa and i made a levitating cube um basically how it works is that this is an electromagnet and i'm running 12 current 12 volts through it and then this is a neodymium magnet and what it does it's basically creating kind of like a pushpull dance so when i place it here this red led will turn on and that's kind of how you know that you've hit the sweet spot um and i'm also able to control the distance through this potentiometer um really finicky but very very cool you've gotten a lot of practice i can see oh my god yes before it was like so if i move it too close it'll start to go kind of crazy and it'll stick um and that's that's amazing how big do you think you could make this um like would it work at a much larger scale yeah so if i had a bigger electromagnet um it could carry a pound two pounds three pounds this can carry about an ounce more or less so like a piece of toast is its max yeah put it first next show yeah okay okay can you introduce yourself you can say a couple sentences about your project yes where do i touch you talk to here this is just extra audio lizzie chappini and sydney myers and our project's called color field and it's a interactive light display where the controller can't see what they're manipulating on the screen and the viewer can't see what the controller is doing so through communication they build a light display yeah and the kind of premise of it is we are asking people to choose a word and have a quick conversation about what colors that word evokes for them and so when they sit down at their stations either at the controller or the viewer they're trying to come together with a common goal of having the screen show the color composition of colors that they've kind of talked about to represent the work and have people been successful yeah pretty successful yeah it's really interesting to see how everybody communicates and what they're using you guys want to try definitely let me reset it okay so let's just choose optimism for you okay cool yes and what kinds of colors are evocative of the word optimism um yellow orange red um purple um yellow orange red now you're green now you're pink purple yeah yes you got it you got it perfect are we looking at that or what yeah this is great you get some footage of him just operating the controls and then these are the controls yeah so i'm not sure what's happening uh so she has to tell me what these controllers do and um i think this is like brightness on this one can we make one yellow you're just you just made it all right now it's purple okay um i don't know how to change it great job okay hey we kind of saw like all the projects see everything and look around and listen and then we will have set times i think yeah there's only one project next to the entrance that is so we're going to attempt to take the stairs and we'll see how that goes we might lose our wifi that's the other thing who knows what's going to happen wifi wise in the lobby although presumably they're all weak wow we have full troop here this is incredible look at all the construction in the stairwell uh very low or yes does it still record yeah well it will it's not recording it's straight yeah it's uploading straight okay so interfaces for musical expression so we build so we build our own musical instrument and then we perform with it um so my performance did not look like this but it's also a very physical performance and as you can hear it produces a lot of different dissident interesting chaotic sounds well thank you thank you i don't i don't know can you just tell us your name in a few sentences about the project yes mark matsumoto's uh this gentleman wants to play actually maybe get some demonstration at the same time awesome feel free to be aggressive with it so we have basically a controller and we have a synthesizer over there uh two different components so what we have going on is uh ribbon controllers or soft potentiometers on the right hand side and that's controlling your frequency underneath those soft potentiometers are fsrs force sensors um so that's going to control your amplitude so two other potentiometers are soft potentiometers that control uh dynamic and timebased effects um we have a lowpass filter with resonance and we have amplitude modulation uh reverb which is a 0100 and a global output um but no we've got a technical issue okay hold on a second um let me see like just the capture obviously disconnected that was audio much earlier yeah but i'm just trying to call on skype it's like product description oh god 30 seconds very cool man thank you so much appreciate you sweet oh thank you appreciate it sorry you can finish your sentence now we'll get oh i don't know where is that so we have effects processing on the left hand side six ribbons uh front hand side we have a few knobs um this is for actually sweeping between two different types of oscillators uh square and sawtooth i had to think about that uh three potentiometers three lap switches um each one of these coordinates with their own oscillators so in the as themselves the oscillators for the entire strip it's one octave if we actually have it held down we can go all the way up to three octaves actually hold down at the bottom and we'll go down to that single octave and as mentioned these latches these allow me to actually feed my hands to do something else like so as you see i'm playing standing up right now actually made this to sit down which i'm gonna do and i can do because they're lost so i'll get to that third oscillator we're gonna do something kind of dramatic because so it's really a struggle it's about patience actually finding where you need to be and then adjusting accordingly i've only had a few hours on this so i'm still trying to figure out actually where to play this but i've seen some other people do some interesting things on this thank you so much we built a interactive composition together it's an insulation and a piece of music at the same time can you perform it for us yes so so thank you so much great thank you uh there's one cool just introduce yourself and tell us a couple sentences then we'll go watch you before yeah i'm joe baker uh this is my performance called ronin it's about a disbanded warrior trying to relive this motions of war try to get him out of his head and this is so so um um uh so last one my name is douglas douglas gold's name here i am with midi blade and i am using the sport of the electronic sport of fencing as my influence toward um finding expression from combat toward a musical output and the human body is an interface for a musical expression so for my basic model here i'm running arduino nano through bluetooth ble and i have it set up so that the pitch and the roll the roll changes my notes for the rotation of my wrist and then sure so i'm gonna turn you up now like if we do and now let's try doing the same thing is and every time you play you'll have a new generative composition as the output so i'm excited to keep developing it thank you very much i don't know i don't know how many projects that was 128. knows exactly how many of us just give a big thank you to everybody who's been helping with this
