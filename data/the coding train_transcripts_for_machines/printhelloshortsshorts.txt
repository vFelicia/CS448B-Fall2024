I'm here in this strange aspect ratio with the walls closing in on me but before they do I'd like to First tell you hey I made a new video All About programming a 3D renderer on an old 80s Apple 2 plus computer that's my actual childhood computer if you can believe that but really the reason I'm here is I'm trying something new it takes me a while to make these longer form videos over the years I've been getting so many wonderful questions and comments I want to try answering them and I'm going to do it in this format the first one is going to be out this Wednesday and we'll do them regularly in parallel to all of the longer videos and tutorials that I hope to make so I hope you enjoy that stay tuned
