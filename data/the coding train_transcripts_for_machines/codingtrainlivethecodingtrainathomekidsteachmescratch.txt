check check one two three check check how are my sound levels let us know in the chat the sound is good yes for what are we on three two everybody I've got the volume on now I've got the mic on mic hot mic kids one and hello good morning oh there's my treatise I forgot to have it handy oh okay hold on hold on we've got it to see the yeah okay we see the a back to me your host of the coding train at home it is me Dan Shipman welcome good morning it has been quite a while since I have livestreamed I think it was about 72 years ago or at least it certainly feels like when I was back at work at New York University in a room that had no windows livestreaming and doing coach coding tutorials so much has changed I have a smile on my face but I know a lot of people are struggling and have a lot of different kinds of hardships and challenges and I hope that doing a little livestream this morning can I'm being tapped on the leg yes I was saying meaningful important things to the camera you can do scratch that's what we're doing I'm a very serious person who does very serious meaningful important last days anyway what I want to say is I hope that this livestream can bring you a distraction a little bit of happiness maybe you will learn something I should say from the outset that if what you were expecting today was a comprar / coding tutorial and educational experience not that that ever actually happens on the coding train it really doesn't mmhm but today will be even less so I'm just gonna have a little fun test out the new setup that I have here at home I've got operator one say hello in the chat operator one operator 111 years old e is operating the chat typing hello in there and operator number two wave to me hello operator number two is let's take a look at this what do you got on your screen there operator number two know what like you're right you have to scratch open yeah okay this is oh there it is operators number two scratch project eight years old so we will be looking at operator number two's oops that's the wrong button which is fine I'm going to talk about this in a second we will be looking at operator number two's a scratch project in a little bit.i all right so I'm not worried you know I'm never organized with this stuff but I should have least had myself a little outline or a little script which I do not but this is the plan for today first I want to talk about that this live stream is a fundraiser it is a fundraiser for the coding NAT cuff sorry it's coding Kovan 19 sila dairy response fund for who this is fundraiser is being operated out of Google and YouTube itself there should be a donate button that you can see the livestream page that you're looking at you can make a donation let me just read to you what this fundraiser is we're all affected by the growing kovat 19 pandemic it's an unprecedented health challenge and we know people and organizations everywhere want to help the World Health Organization is leading and coordinating the global effort supporting countries to prevent detect and respond to the pant endemic the greatest need right now is to help ensure all countries are prepared especially those with the weakest health systems donations support who's who work to track and understand the spread of the virus to ensure patients get the care they need and frontline workers get essential supplies and information and to accelerate efforts to develop vaccines tests and treatments so I know there are a lot of good causes and organizations and there's a lot of people and organizations in need right now this since this is sort of officially vetted through YouTube and they're actually I should know this but I believe Google is matching a certain number a certain I think every $2 for every $1 you donate should look that up in advance but there is a match by Google and YouTube again this is not an official this is just me at home Brooklyn New York livestreaming with some equipment that I threw together so I'm not an official representative of this fundraiser of who of Google of YouTube any of that I'm just participating as a citizen of the world okay so and keep it friendly in the chat this is this is the coding train for kids okay I mean I always try to be a fan friendly show but here we are hello alright do you want to announce the QA so let me first mention that there is a coding train discord so I'm just gonna press my little button here which should post a link to the discord in the chat if your if you want to engage with the coding train community in various ways join the discord I will be doing I've got some new technology where I can take calls and I'm gonna do like a QA live callin kind of like show like thing with people in the discord at some point next week I don't know when yet so join the discord if you want an announcement for that let's see what else do I want to talk about so that was talking about this as a fundraiser what am I forgetting anything operator one or operator number two you're just working there over on scratch operator number two not even paying attention so let me talk about scratch for a second I am going to switch over to here you know we should find one of the cats oh it's right okay operator number one is off to find a cat you guys don't have to whisper I'm very confused by the way what's appropriate in terms of having kids on a live stream so this this is not monetized live stream there is a chat going my kids really wanted to participate I'd love to have them participate and do lots of fun things with them but anyway I'm also all conscientious about their privacy so I'm trying to figure out what is appropriate but they might say hello their faces might pop up I think we will all survive what can I show you here on this by the way operator number two oh here we go we've got we've got cat number one okay that's operator number one's head going by let's see let's switch to the full view here we go okay so this is Greta Greta is was born when was Greta born July so how old Greta was born in July it seems like oh that seems like a billion years ago but Greta was born to a rescued cat by one of my colleagues at NYU rescued the mother was the mother's name you don't remember remember the mother's name mama cat and we read and so we adopted two of the kittens born to mama cat Greta and the other the other cat is Eva and you can follow them on Instagram Instagram comm / mango and goose so yeah what oh yeah I was gonna put her on my shoulder but I don't think she likes that okay here we have Greta back some Eevee will come at some point operator number two would like a cat we have two cats all right that's why you have to fertilize it's nice to have to because they have each other you know I I would say one of the the living beings of the world that are happiest with this crisis global crisis and I don't mean to trivialize it or make light of it but are the pets of the world because everybody's at home with their pets all the time I did it confirm my email let's see oh no I'm not I'm not showing you that screen right now okay you know what we really need to do kids kids kids it's story time it's story time on the coding train hmm time for me to read you a bedtime story even though it's morning and I know you just woke up you didn't just wake up but it's time to read a story eightysix thousand 197 we're listening are you listening you're paying attention by the way I have read entire I mean actually operator number one who's read all the books like but once we get through all those I've been looking for mango and dusar the middle names thank you for answering this is the best chat mamita thank you to all of you nice wonderful volunteer moderators well always up through the chat but I have to say operator number one why you're number one and that one's number two equal in my hearts you know you're both operator one and a half operator a half an operator wanted to have yep okay mm I was reaping you a bedtime story okay let's see so let me talk about scratch for a second so um one thing that I want to say is i I'm gonna return to let me let me find this playlist here just to give you people a little bit of update about what's going on in terms of the coding train and that sort of stuff let me get to here yes I'm being tapped they should be zero where's my bell that is such a good point I apologize to everyone in the world right now that I have offended with my counting from one we have a big announcement to make I present to you operator number and I present to you face buried beneath the computer how's the scratch project going not good okay we're gonna can we look at it soon no okay all right what I wanted to update you on is my progress with the nature of code playlist this is was my before the world changed so radically this was what I was working on so this is I wouldn't say advanced level but this is sort of like a followup playlist to four tutorials about how to program in p5.js actually what I should find you is this one let me go to here so for those of you who might be new to the coding training usually the stuff that I program in is in either Java using a programming environment called processing which I could go on and on about but I'm going to stop myself from doing that right now or p5 yes which is a JavaScript library and if you go to learning I'll actually go to big if you're new and you go to beginners you can find the two playlists here for if you've never programmed before and I would say probably especially for all the kids at home this playlist I would say is probably appropriate for maybe sixth grade on you know I there are younger people and older people who do program in JavaScript but if np5 but I would say that the prerequisites are really being sort of comfortable typing so kind of all you need but that so if you've never programmed in JavaScript before this is a playlist that you can that you can follow then is that the st. that's the same cat okay then we have a whole lot of others so I wanted to mention this so because a couple people have asked me oh I want to do some coding while I'm at home where's your playlist too with this is this is the one to look at now the one that I'm currently working on on the website is under learning slash nature of code and so this is a yes what you need help with your scratch project yeah okay what we're gonna get to that next operator number one needs help we've got right now like over 500 people watching this right now who maybe can help operator number one of course operator zero can probably careful with those buttons they change the view of what people are looking at which is fine so but I've put this a little bit on pause these I was recording in a studio I had set up at NYU to school the arts in downtown Brooklyn where I also teach classes at a program called ITP and ima and I but I'm gonna see if I can get this studio working well and get comfortable with it so I could continue this series but in the meantime today is really just a test run a way of saying hello and hopefully providing some comfort or support to people if I can and then what I will what we're gonna do now is I've actually so let me talk about scratch for a second so if you're not familiar with scratch scratch is what would how would you define scratch operator zero block coding okay what does block coding mean right so it's block based coding meaning you coding is writing instructions for a computer to follow oh wait anonymous silly music for donations is not appropriate okay what's going on you really need help I happen to do a thing where I talk all the time so we just go to your project right now and help you alright I'm sorry everybody I have to go where the wind takes me we're gonna see if we can go over here and get operator number ones a screen up okay this is operator number one screen also known as rotten kitty to a1 I'll let you try to guess so this is the scratch project what is the scratch project you're currently trying to meet what's that Quidditch okay quiz okay operator number one is working on a quiz which bowtie is different so how and I wonder if I should get a camera view here ooh whoa hey that looks hold on you're like wait so what do you have so far you want to come over here so people can hear you no do you want to just talk to me and I'll say things into the mic okay so tell me what you have so far what's that oh you could barely hear me over that music sorry so I need to turn the music down that's very easy for me to do alright so it looks like what we have here is a quiz that's called which bowtie is different and I'm not operating computer right now different is spelled wrong that's okay and so the idea I think is that the user the player of the game and maybe I should well I'm gonna just put my camera on over here what I'm going to show you how to operate this okay so I'm gonna do so I'm just doing a little bit of we're gonna do video capture device we do add existing Elgato camera so if I do this now I've got the camera I'm gonna make this nice and small where do you think is a good spot for it like do you think it's better over here let's just leave it over here so we've got put it up there no I think that's gonna but we can also one thing you can do to see this here if you want to like if it's in the way you can just click that and it'll take it away okay so you're operating this you can just click that this see that I am teaching a little bit of OBS ok yeah so I need to know your question you want me to come over there alright everybody I'll be right back the computer is very far away I'm gonna walk all the way over there oh my goodness it's such a long journey I'm taking can you still hear me yes ok so which boat is different which one is that that one's different so when you click on it you get what's wrong okay when you click on the wrong one you want the other two to disappear so when you click on the road we have spoke a few let's look at yeah we don't think anybody can hear me over here so it's ironic because oops the maybe we're getting some chow so usually I have a roaming mic but right now this is my bike oh we've got another cat we're gonna help this is by the okay this is Eevee okay I'm coming I'm coming here take Eevee you get you we're gonna go back to the scratch window I just wanna I feel like people need to be able to hear us over here so I have a couple ideas for that so what's the issue which one did you click on to disappear oh okay so we now we understand the problem what you know the solution okay so operator number okay hold on let's make sure we see okay so let's bring the camera back okay so the question to issue is here we're looking at the center bow tie and when you click on the center bowtie the backdrop changes which makes the yeah up here you can go over operator zero and so operator zero is going to help right now and I wonder if I can see the zoom meeting here no I can't and so the solution it seems I would assume is that right now the code says when this sprite is by the way I'm over here because this is where I could see when the sprite is clicked when the sprite is clicked oh what's the message oh broadcast hi oh you're gonna broadcast a message and then the other sprites can hear the message broadcast message in Hyeok enzo in the chat is Kenzo in the chat is giving the same suggestion that operator number zero is actually implementing right now where there's I didn't notice so apparently there's a way in scratch where you can broadcast a message let me go back to see where they're coding this where you can broadcast a message boy I'm really and then I suppose other sprites can hear that message and then hide themselves so can you pull up the project on the main laptop oh that's a good idea so if I go to if I go to the project URL on my laptop I don't know if it's shared I'm doing that right now projects / except this is a really good way of doing it three seven nine nine seven one three eight zero does that work oops our scratch server is this is what I got our scratch server is scratching its head so so far I think maybe the either I got the number wrong or three seven nine can you read that number to me operator zero I need more numbers there's no zero after they a slash editor did you get it to work oh wait so let's watch it can you can you share the project so that I can pull it up do you know how to do that let's shuffle see okay hold I'm going oh you're singing right now so this is alright so what right now this is a quiz a scratch project there's seven Z's and quiz yak it in the chat is pointing up I could just log into I know what a log I don't actually know rotten kitty oh ones password I bet you I could guess it though I do know it okay apparently I do not so okay ah quiz so now if I hit refresh ah so I've got the project also now on my laptop so I can manipulate it and I think what I'll do also is do this I'm just so it's puts put it here and do this okay so first let's just enjoy this I'm gonna I'm gonna play it what why is it where I brought it up on my screen well I can on your screen I can pull it up oh yeah oh why is it so do you have something when you click maybe did you save it make sure you save it yeah I think maybe it wasn't saved and then Namit if I hit refresh yes okay great I've got it so if I go back to my screen all right I hereby present to you rotten kitties which bowtie is different so rotten kitty you want to come stand over here so give me some give me some and circle so I now need to guess which bowtie is different do we think it is the left one the right one or the center one which one should I pick wait all right let's pick this one I should be like it you do it wrong first okay oh that's good over okay which bowtie is different you want it you want to operate oh hold on oh it okay this is good this is good we'll be here okay which bowtie is different you want to do it oh no can you get another chance yeah we should make it play that sound all right can you what happens if you click the right one now nothing what if you click the center one ah so we need to add code right if I look at the inside so I don't really know scratch so where so basically if we look at these bowties you want you want to operate it here okay oh oh my hold on I think after refresh because I made this you should we just log into your account so you have it here no okay I've lost control of this livestream which is good when the sprite is clicked which sprite I in we're in which one the right or the left oh and then so and so it does that okay so then we have so that's the right bowtie this is the left bowtie is it when the sprite is clicked do that and then which one this is the center one when this sprite is clicked switch costume bowtie so where are the costumes are there and so you have Oh both sigh is a check mark did you draw about yourself know what but how'd you get the bowtie image it's a sprite I know but like it's one of the scratch builtin ones the scratch has has builtin ones okay and then so now and so if you click on this one it switches that and then how it waits a second and goes yay so let me look at that I want to see that code weight point five seconds broadcast back top three is yeah and you drew that back top three yourself amazing I love that wow this is cool I should learn more of this so I actually I'm saying like I don't know scratch but I do know it a little bit a long long time ago I helped a little bit in scratch on the scratch project itself and I think I wonder if they still have this feature that I implemented I mean I'm sure it's not my implementation anymore because this was almost 20 years ago but our 15 years ago I guess there was like a way to do like a twirly image processing filter have you seen that anywhere no looks maybe yeah that whole book has a million random numbers in it would you like to show it a little bit under the camera over there anyone what I thought what we would do was that I was going to make a scratch project myself my stuff and I thought we could make a thank you card a scratch thankyou card for essential workers and first responders so if what you wanted to do was draw some like a thankyou or draw some things there we could we could bring those into scratch all right so I'm gonna attempt to learn a little scratch with my helpers here whirlpool effect yes that's key on new it's very warm in here what is it half why is it that do I think it's warm in here sweatshirt I was gonna maybe greenscreen myself but I'm wearing this green shirt so that's not really gonna work okay so we open a window I feel like kind of warm in here no no there's a cat is that a cat yes the cat is attacking some paper towels under the table here okay so we're getting um alright so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go to this project see inside and what's the first thing that I should do like if we want it so you're drawing like a thank you so I'll take a snapshot of that and add it into scratch yeah no no I'm waiting so from looking at my looking at my phone which is always what you should be doing when you're live streaming I think I might need some water any operators want to get me a cup of water hmm let's see I'm gonna let you guys draw for a little bit are you actually getting me a cup of water oh okay kids will not do this if I'm not livestreaming so I think Oh tictactoe and scratch that would be fun but so one of the things you know I don't want to I don't want to oversell the meaningfulness of this but I think it's a nice gesture that we can do to think one of the things that I think about when I had to take my little quick trips to the grocery store or take my quick walk around the block to get a little bit of fresh air is I see that sanitation workers are out Restaurant delivery people are out UPS is out all the health care workers are out what is that why is it all cloudy I think it just has like there's probably like a so one of the chat was explained the science behind why my water from our New York City tap water which is excellent is a little bit cloudy but so I I thought that we could make a little thank you to all those health care and essential workers that are first responders that are out so so well done I think I have an idea wait wait stop stop stop pause your drawing pause your drawing is it a thin and scratch pause pause pause pause the trophy everybody stop stop stop pause okay is it if it's a thing right where you can have two different backdrops are you listening to me so if I took a snapshot of what you're drawing now stop drawing stop drawing Rafi now then that can make that a backdrop and you could add a lot of things I'll take another snapshot and then no oh so I should just let you keep drawing okay never mind people so one thing I'm let's see what I could figure out what I need to get a sprite so how do I even import a file so how do I get how do I get the image from that camera onto this laptop hmm oh I know I'll take a picture with my phone okay hold on I know but I just this isn't gonna be the final photo it's just take a picture of it so that I can learn how to bring it into scratch but then I'll take a new picture when it's finished got me know right okay I'm doing it okay so let me airdrop this mmm let's see if that works yep okay so if I have a photo that I took in downloads which is right here and I were to let's just crop this much out of it and now if I save this I assumed how do I bring a photo into scratch you going somewhere okay did you get bored hey lost operator number zero by the way okay so what he needs a break it's good yeah take a break choose a spray upload sprite or is that as it's kind of sprite be a backdrop or that's something different No so if I want it to be the background then I because I want to make those little hearts a let's sprite go to costumes okay the chat is telling me to go to costumes costumes oh so make a new costume whoops oh okay back upload costume so I'm gonna get this image okay you're I know you're not done I'm learning just learning while you're oh wait hold on so people can't see this so let me just switch to this for a second so okay so apparently by the way this is not a scratch tutorial in case because I don't actually know scratch I'm learning scratch and my kids who do know scratch are and some on some level teaching it to me so what I've learned now is that I can upload an image to a thing called a costume and let's call this thank you and I could add things to it I see convert to vector interesting Wow and then click on backdrops in the stage Oh so where's the stage where's the stage stage oh here ah backdrop oh I see okay that's a backdrop okay so it's kind of like a background in p5 so upload backdrop so let's do that that's got it this is a backdrop and we're going to call this thank you one so now I'm gonna go to code and I can just do when there's a thing that the program starts when you cleat when you click the green flag right so we're in which where's that events okay I'm being told breaking news breaking news I'm being told that we had turned the notifications off on my watch here I'm being told that I can find in events when flag clicked so I'm gonna put that here and then where do I switch the backdrop looks okay switch backdrop to thank you one okay so now whenever I click I will get that's my cook now am I not in the code for a sprite right now so if one of the things that I think is different about working in scratch than swimming like p5 is that basically each element can have its own code associated with it and this is actually quite similar to what I do in JavaScript with objectoriented programming I'll make a class that's a template for making objects and those objects will have their own variables and functions and that kind of like it looks like I can have multiple sprites which all have their own functionality but here I think I must not be in a particular sprites code right I'm gonna delete this great this is just like the main program so I can also like play a sound pop let's try this okay fun so and so what I could do is what should I do next so I've got I've got to get to thank you backdrop when it's ready and then I can make some sprites I can play sounds change the pitch should I try but I'm try making a little like firework or a little heart I hear noise is it a cat hold on everybody I've got to rescue the cat from the cat only just see if I could show this to you the cat had this in its mouth which was a twist tie I had for one of my cables here and that seems very dangerous we don't want any cats to have to go to the hospital we don't want anyone to have to go to the hospital but especially now we don't want to take care we want to take up spots that could be that somebody really needs so let's be careful how's the drawing going let's take a look at it everybody let's move it to what do we all think there we go this is beautiful if stars tell me what you think you might be done with it and we'll make it the backdrop add these blocks when flag clicked then change backdrop to back rub one okay okay by the way my water coding trained as you know is sponsored by h2o it's not be cloudy anymore I think I will just drink it it might be time for a break actually okay okay you're still working on it okay the drawing is not finished yet we can check in on it I will bring it up here okay let's see anybody have a bit more sense actually don't ever have any sense as to what's happening or going on but here I am Here I am live streaming from home the drawing is really coming along nicely so I need some suggestions of what else I could add to this car digital card because one thing of course we could just make a drawing which is what's happening right now but I want to add some other things so maybe I just need to learn for me when I'm programming one of the things that I like to start with is how to program a bouncing ball so maybe that's what I will start adding to this sketch and sort of figure out and operator number one over here will help me if I need so let me go back to here so let me add a sprite so I'm gonna call this sprite so I need to make a new sprite oh let's make it a better I make it a basketball do you want to pick oh I like this beach ball what should I add the animals people I can make it a little p5 let's just let's just let me not worry let me make it this beach ball it looks fun so now I will need in order to have this move I need some variables right where do I get variables do you know do you know operator number one what a variable is no shrug emoji the human version of the shrug emoji all right let me let's see under here under variables make a variable let's make a variable called X for this sprite only okay let's make a variable called Y for this sprite only and then let's set the variable to can I get the width of the can I get the width of the canvas in like I'm being told I don't need variables because the sprite itself probably has a position so all right so maybe I don't need these variables because I there's something called like motion maybe how do I move something motion move go to X oh set X to glide OH so I know if you heard that but goto makes it just disappear and go there and glide makes it glide there all right so oh there's go to random position I kind of want to make fireworks let's see if we can make this beach ball be like a little firework that rises up in bursts so let's have it glide okay great so when so I should go to when the the thingy is clicked what's this called the green flag motion glide oh wow so I don't know I can I don't even have to move it on my own I could say glide for five seconds well first I want to set it so let's have it go to the bottom of the canvas so I can actually see where it is right now over here oh that's interesting it tells me where it is how do I know the size of the stage is there a way anyone on the chat Oh first of all thank you I don't like thank you Towanda balance whele if you donated canadian made a donation for october 19 thank you so so i want to glide like so I want the X I want the X to be 0 and the Y to be negative like how do I know the height of the stage will somebody tell me the size of the canvas you on who Leon Lopez is saying the size of the canvas is negative 240 240 height negative 180 180 so let's go to negative 180 there's a way to see yeah yeah oh you move your mouse over the canvas it like shows you yeah yeah I was doing that here the canvas is 480 by 360 as everybody's telling me okay that's good so then I want to glide to about let's say like negative or 5 seconds let's try running this so I want to implement some nicer physics where it's like bursting up with grab but I won't worry about that right now let's have the glide be much faster let's just say two seconds okay so how do I in scratch create a sprite that's a sing like I want like if I want to do it this I guess I'm jumping like 12 steps ahead from where I am my understanding of scratch but what if I wanted to Oh SEPA in the chest saying if you save it I can follow the project in my computer yes let me do that file save now share so this project is now being shared so let me go back by the way we're gonna livestream until around noon I was gonna take a break at 1100 I'm just to have a short break in the middle but this is where we are so far so when the green thing is clicked this goes up the back the by the way let's just check in on the drawing can you show the drawing word how where it is so far no okay there we go oh look at it so it's let me move it a little bit this is amazing do you want to make two drawings or I guess we're just how did you do these we have ten of us okay okay you only need a gravity variable you can make clones of spray okay we got another donation from anonymous thank you all right let me go back to the code here all right so then I guess I want to broadcast a message when it gets to the top and then I want to have a burst of particles so let me and I want to make them stars so let me broad do that broadcast where's the broadcast do you know where do you know where I find the broadcast you know which category is under events under events broadcast message okay okay I got it I got it do you want to I want to okay no patience for me a new message name what's the message name I want to make Bert let's call it a burst okay well let's make them twinkle as they burst okay so I want to broadcast this message burst and then I need to make another sprite which is a star can't deserve some kind of like star perfect let's make it this star and so when it receives a message when it receives a message burst so first when it's clicked I want to hide it which must be under loop looks so hide it when I see you see the receive the message burst show so this is going up and there it appears now it should also set its location to so I do want a variable because I want the Oh actually no I could play sense location to where this the other sprites location is so when I when it receives bursts set set where motion is where I set its location go to and I want to go to a random position now beach ball aha look at that okay so this moves up and then it appears oh good okay so duplicate in event duplicate in events so I want to make lots of stars how do I do that maybe I'm being told in the chat that I duplicate in advance in in events where am i in events so I'm looking here looking for duplicate in costumes there's duplicate let's create a clone of yeah but but I want to duplicate I'm duplicating that start yes yeah oh but I don't want to duplicate the design I want to make actually multiple sprites each with their own behavior but maybe I do want to make different costumes eventually because then I could change their have different colors yeah okay okay okay clone everyone's talking to the check clone is right create a clone of myself now can I do a loop so where's a loop do you know what a loop is oh I mean I it's called a repeat in scratch you know what repeat does but what does repeat do I know but what does that mean to repeat maybe people don't know what that means I know what it means I'm asking you to explain it so I want to make multiple clones uhhuh so that's gonna do and create clone of myself you know ten is good to start with or what do you how many do you think well then I'm gonna make a lot 30 okay now so let's see what happens so I guess there's 30 stars but they're all on top of each other by the way can I just show off my mug here for a second no I know no it's not that mug it's a different bug but I have a mug that I'm obsessed with I talk about it all the time how much I love it I have multiple of them I have my like travel one mine home one my work one now I don't have a need for all those mugs did you know all the time I just need my own mug mug I should be so how lucky is to have a home mug but that's not the mug I'm going to talk about the mug I'm going to talk about today is this one it is how do I get it to focus on it there we go this is my geometry mug and if I ever need to remember the area or circumference wonder if I do this I believe I park in the UK I really enjoy traveling and visiting other places and I'm sad to not be doing that right now but I'm very very happy to do my small tiny part by staying at home and I hope everybody is healthy and okay and doing well and staying at home as well if you can okay so let's see so now what I also want to do is give them a random velocity in different directions so point in direction oh look at this so I could really think oh I'm I don't see you don't see my screen right now I could really point in a random direction how do I make a random oh how do I put something random in here under variables can I make a random variable where do I pick a random number between 0 and do you know how to pick a random number well in I could pick a random number in my head but I don't want to type it in I want the computer program to pick a random number so that all of the different stars all get their own random direction I could do them I could count yes but I kind of want to have them there's got to be up like under variables I mean I know I could make a variable and then set it to a random value I would think in events random okay I'm being told events random control sensing where I don't see a random under event you're done with the drawing okay wait so let's operators I'm being told Oh pick random here it is sorry this is in here so in operators I can take this and I can pick a random point and direction between 0 and 360 so they would all point in different directions let's even see just what that does hmm I don't know if that worked like do they I mean like will it create a clone I want to collect create their clone and then all have them points in their own render well it did it did look they're all pointing in different directions what I'm trying to make a burst of stars come out first yeah that's what I'm gonna do oh yeah I didn't do the hide yet I'm gonna do I'm gonna hide the beach ball once the stars yeah that's exactly my idea well I haven't gotten to the movie yet all I did was create 30 of them should we put your let's see your thank you let's get a better picture of your thank you drawing so everybody here we've got the final thank you drawing you could take a break yeah I think I'm off my own people I'm on my own they lasted an hour which is pretty good yeah I'm gonna take a break in a minute don't ask me these questions okay thank you Wow this is really something just thank you so let me airdrop it and I'm gonna bring in this safety downloads so let me go to where do I go to costumes coding there we go let me go to costumes no backdrops backdrops this one so can I just delete it and then upload a picture oh no no back I want to get the final drawing oh wait hold on so let me show you all the final drawing let me guess kind of crop it close enough Oh textbased YouTube is saying do when I start as cloned and point in directions 0 to 360 Oh negative 180 to 180 not 360 okay either when I start as clone oh there's a when I start as cloned event okay I got it everybody so I'm going to let me first get this backdrop that was drawn I think this is it here okay great so I wonder if there's a more thoughtful that's fine I'm gonna leave it like this and I'm gonna go back to oh this is a new backdrop I wanted this to be alright I thought I was replacing it but let's just delete this one hold on thank you it's just ah thank you and we'll delete this one and then if I go to the code switch backdrop to thank you okay so then let me just fix this one thing under the star sprite so when I start as clone is that an event when I receive burst when I start as clone is that under control uh here we go yeah when I start as clone and then pick random negative 180 to 180 is awesome okay people give me a lot of excellent suggestions there's a shadow on the picture there is uh I'll try to take a better picture I have all these nice lights on here I should be able to get a much nicer picture which I will do all right let me take a short break I'm gonna hit this little intermission and take a short break just to sort of check on what happened to my operators I'm gonna mute my microphone and be back in about five minutes let's see if I can find the original here we go so let me put this I only put this here and let me just cross this out doesn't work Oh sharpies sharpies oh here's my shirt I'm gonna say back in five minutes okay everybody I will be back take a short break get some water and be right back all right see you soon Lord everybody I am coming back I don't think I properly introduced Eevee before so this was easy let me turn off the music Evie Evie is a calico little cat here Evie was born Evie is greta's sister was also born apparently in July I don't see how that's possible I think it was much more recent than that but I don't know what do I know she's a sweetheart she likes to think that she thinks that my beard is another cat so she likes to pie and lick it and all that sort of stuff you don't what you want to go sleep with your sister I woke you up I know okay okay I'll let you go alright everyone we're gonna finish working on this thank you card and I have something I have something very innovative that I want to show which is that I had you actually have a green screen so I will attempt that um evolve Evie to sylveon yes um Evie is named for the Pokemon Eevee but also I believe the Eevee from the descendants so it's a little bit of a combination but spelled I spell Evie's name EE Vee okay so here we are back again I am working on a scratch project let me go back to here which is a thank you card to essential workers and first responders a digital thank you card and my kids were making this with me they got bored I think frankly I think they're downstairs playing roblox right now if I'm being perfectly honest it's almost time for lunch we are all together 24/7 it's actually kind of delightful and amazing but a very strange different time will say like it's a little it's interesting like I I have felt a lot of stress this week because I really wanted to livestream I kind of realized like I can't because I've got to become a third grade and if it's great teacher so we've I think we've finally sort of adjusted to this new routine of school happening at home all their meals happening at home making sure we get a little time outside everyday a little physical exercise I've got a lot of work to keep up with I'm teaching three classes and NYU which have all kind of gone remote so I actually really haven't had time to livestream but I'm hoping that I can get into a routine and then I can get this set up working well and kind of do more and get back to my old tricks of tutorials keep it down keep it down downstairs go change my shirt in a minute to try to try a tutor so I can try the green screen but okay all right so we are back I'm trying so I think I would actually really like to do some proper scratch tutorials that maybe kids who are learning at home could follow but again that's not what I'm doing right now I'm kind of doing a completely unplanned just sort of hacking around and trying to figure my way through making a little burst of fireworks in scratch so what I have so far is I have a backdrop so the stage so I have the stage when the green flag is clicked I switch the backdrop to thank you so I only have this one backdrop right now oh maybe I could color it there's I have so many ideas so when the green flag is quick click switch the backdrop to thank you okay then I have two sprites I have this beach ball sprite which when the green flag is clicked it starts at the bottom and then glides for two seconds up to here and then broadcast a message called burst and when that message bursts is broadcast the idea is that pool a whole set of stars will come glittering around the screen with happiness and rainbows and all right so and we got another donation anonymous donation to the UN foundation thank you very much with your donation you have won your own personal random number and a closeup view of me with my random number book one hundred thousand normal devious let's let's find out your random number anonymous your random number for today is 90 thousand and eighty one thank you alright so we broadcast the message burst and then when the that message burst is broadcast we have another sprite which is a star and we show it we move it to the beach balls location we create 30 of them which is making a clone and then I give them a random Direction and I want them to move then also so move test so I could do the glide to a random position let's just try that for a second let's see what happens ooh I like that so it's not exactly a firework effect um and why is there one oh so let me hide this one so I don't want that one to stay in the middle so let me do let me take this original one and hide it which is under looks again um right is it under looks hide show hide yeah so let me try to oh so I don't actually want to show it I don't need to hide it I just don't want to show it so when I receiver bursts go to the beach ball repeat 30 create a clone and then when it starts as a clone show point and glide here we go and that's pretty good let's see could do move steps plus repeat loops okay you can make the sprites walk for which means it will go in the direction they're facing that's what I wanted to do so I just wanted to see what Glide did that's a quick way of getting them to move so I'm gonna take that out and go back to motion and I'm gonna say move ten steps let's see what that does okay so that's interesting so interesting this repeat loop it's really like it's giving a little delay with each one what if I want to create all the clones at once like I don't want this repeat loop to I don't want to see it play out I want it to all to happen at once how would I is there a way to change that maybe somebody in the chat will let me know but for now I'm gonna do I'm gonna do another repeat loop control repeat and move ten steps let's see what happens here yeah oh look at that it's a nice perfect circle that's good I don't want to hide the beach ball go to beach ball where where's the beach balls code so broadcast burst and also hide I don't know where anything is I have to like find it constantly hide here okay so you can't make it instant yes you can blocks may still have a delay well it's one frame you can add a delay people stop saying it is impossible it pretty much is there's a lot of disagreement going on in the chat right now so we'll see I'll wait for something more definitive to come through but I guess what I could do is I know what I could do I mean this is a little bit of a hack but if I go back to the star and I could oh when I start as a clone like I don't want them I was gonna try to show them after all the clones were created but that didn't seem to do anything there is a delay but well I'm not what I'm not talking about is the framerate here so I understand that there is a maximum frame rate which is the amount of the the time it take the amount of frames the amount of animation frames that can be updated it with a given unit of time like a second but there's no reason why I couldn't decide that I want in one frame to have thirty things up here so maybe I need to create the clones I I think what I want to do actually is create the I have an idea I'm gonna create the clones at the beginning hide and create the clones and then when they receive the bursts so is there a way will this work like the clones are being created right now yeah there we go I got it so I just make all the clones earlier yeah and the beach ball needs to have a show at the beginning so this worked so I don't know if I sort of figured it out and so basically what I want to do is create all of those clones at the beginning of the program and that's gonna it's gonna happen 60 frames per second in the background but they're all ready and they're all gonna receive that first message they're all operating with the same code so then I get a full burst all at once there we go so I want to give them a different speed so let's I go I'm gonna add a variable been avoiding variables so let's make a variable for this sprite only called speed now hopefully they're all gonna get their own version of that variable and we're gonna set speed set speed to a random number which is under operators I'm learning here people I'm learning pick between one let's pick between 10 and 20 then they're gonna move by speed so we're gonna move instead by speed so let's try this now uhoh that wasn't good mmm oh I guess this oh this needs to happen first so I need to make that variable pick the value and then clone them are they all gonna get the same number though no perfect oh wait they all got the same number shoot can I do this what if I set the speed here there we go okay so as long as I set the speed after the clones have been made then I should be good I'm Stig is actually in the chat well future episodes of the coding train at home always focus on scratch no I mean I don't know if I'm gonna call it coding train at home or that's really a thing that's just what I called it for today I mean because for the foreseeable future coda crania it's just always gonna be coding training at home and it's going to be the same sort of stuff that I do I just thought for today I will do some scratch stuff how do I I don't want to see this variable I mean it's kind of nice to see that there how do i but that's to me like a little bit of a debug view can I get rid of that whoops no no undo undo there we go thank you okay so now how do I give these things gravity I heard that make them smaller in the clone loop yeah I absolutely should but I think I can also just pick the star right can I just go here and make it smaller how do I change the size or I must there must be like a set a size looks set size to 25% let's try that yeah okay and let's let's make it 50% let's make a hundred and 50 of them whoa why did they all oh because it took it took longer to make them I think huh that's interesting if I'm it well let's not make so many then I'll figure that out later okay that's good so the beach ball also I feel like the size should be probably half its size also okay there we go now uncheck the checkbox maybe that's the thing to like not have the variable being seen okay there we go so the variable exists but it's not seen that's good to know did not know that okay let's try to give another backdrop oh wait I have an idea why don't I get a coding train back up backdrop give me a second here let me just find I'm gonna download my coding train does that back back drop the coding train I'm so sorry you can't see this right now I'm just deep into my Google Drive wallpaper unicorn scene catch a ride let's try this one download okay so now hopefully that downloaded and we can get back to here whoops back to here so let me also up whoops upload this one okay that's a coding train back drop oh wait no did I or can I not make more than oh no I have them thank you and then this one's called coding train can you hear by the can by the way can you hear the pitterpatter of the rain I don't think we can hear that change the ball to a rocket okay it's not a bad idea coding train so now let's see if I go to code and we start with coding train backdrop and then when I receive the message when I receive burst switch backdrop what's this and oh this way switch backdrop thank you it's nice guy leave the can I just add a backdrop like could I just overlay the backdrop I guess this I could make it a sprite and I could just show it but if you make a broadcast after the create loop then you will know and they are created oh that's a great point yeah that's a great point okay so how do I the next thing I want to do is add some gravity this is used to make this more serious no not that kind of gravity so also I'd like to make them different colors change color effect by set color effect what's a color effect change color oh no that would be in the star yeah can I pick another random I don't know what this is gonna do I'm just gonna make a guess like does that do something yeah I like that okay now I've got colorful stars and I want them to fade away and burst out but I uh can I add some under motion so let's see if on edge bounce is there like an automatic gravity well I could have them rotate or do I need to implement my own physics see this is why I thought I've changed wha oh I could change Y by if I add a little changing Y will that accumulate like gravity not really kind of not really let's see gravity you need your own physics no gravity okay so maybe right now given that it's already 1135 I'll come back ooh look at that oh it stops at the edge to not stop at the edge oh but I could at least have them accelerate so I could I know what I could do set the speed to between zero let's actually set the speed to zero well let's give it an initial speed between zero and five and then change so how do I add how do I increment a variable variables change my variable so this would be some physics speed by can I do like little bits like that yeah so that gives it more of a burr of like a bursting out if I like give them a little bit of an acceleration I like that oh I could clone the beach ball oh no can i I don't think I can do that you should change the beach ball to a balloon okay how do I change the costume I mean I could just draw my own thing actually what I want to do is get one of the little hearts so I think what would be better is for me to get elements of the drawing where's that drawing here we go so let me put the drawing back here I gotta get a better picture of it just so you can see it I'm gonna put it here and I so okay let's see here here's the drawing I'm gonna get my light a light this is very silly am I really going to do I really need to get a light here why not right this is very silly but I don't have the plug for this light so I have these rechargeable batteries that I'm gonna put in okay see if this works well explosion is a decrease in speed it's so right about that I need to change that to a decrease in speed totally gonna do that just get this late to get better images of this drawing to work with a sprites will this go on now yes alright we have light by the way I know if anybody can guess what you're seeing here oh and if anybody in the chat knows oh you can't see oh yeah here's a challenge there's a couple challenges here one is why is there a halo blackhole circle here and two is does anybody recognize this particular it's a print so if you could read if you could zoom way in I don't know how I'm not doing this in 4k or anything the answer would be right over here in the corner okay so let's get a light on the drawing okay let's go over here let's see I know if you can hear the background noise coming from downstairs all right so I've got the thank you drawing there I've got some light on it so I can get a better photo ah Stig Stig Stig in the chat got the drawing I'll be not the drawing to print thank you it is in fact all this is all of the streets in the lower 448 united states an image of over 240 million individual Road segments Savin info /all streets so if I just go here for a second to fathom info /all streets it is this this is the print you know I have actually a lot of I guess look digital art and a lot of prints and various art pieces that I've collected over the years other people have sent me other than I bought this one just happens to be hanging here different ones and hang a different one for different live streams but that's there okay let me come back to with this project and let me get back to here so I should be able to get a nice screen capture of and then I should be able to edit out the little hearts and stars so that's what I want to do so should I try to take another picture on my phone alright we tried this okay let me try oh yeah this is better there's no shadows no this picture off my phone is going to actually come out quite nicely so let me do this and I'm gonna get a new image airdrop here okay we've got 20 minutes left for this project here I mean I have I have all day in a way but I've got to get to other stuff these kids need to eat lunch they need to get up and eat it they need to not be on their screens all day long okay although it is raining today so we're not gonna be able to get very much outside time keeping our safe sixfoot distance from everyone anyone else I mean we there are very few people on the streets these days in Brooklyn but taking a walk around the block is something that I personally feel like I really need to do well today okay yeah I think that's meant to be a Red Cross like because we're thanking first responders yeah all right so first let me fix in the star in the code I wanted to give them a really big speed at first like 20 to 30 and then change speed by negative 2 we wanted to slow down so let's try this whoa so and then we don't want it to go past zero so constrain variable operators is there a constrain if like a conditional control if if so if and then operators if speed is less than zero so I'll go back to my variables if speed is less than zero then set speed to zero ah sorry you couldn't see change scene I'm sorry about that I'm not used to my new setup not that I don't make that mistake always okay so that's just now let me get my new picture because this backdrop so how do I get to the backdrops backdrops let's delete this one let's delete this one oh I see what I could do let's first of all can i why is this not taking up the whole can I do this or is that just zooming in on it how do I change the size of this image that I that I loaded in to just zoom in on it know how to manipulate anything all right let me delete this let's try it let's let's try adding some new back ah ah I don't understand how to operate scratch okay upload back drop this one so how can I quickly just like zoom in on it so that it does this do something that's just zooming in so I can like see it right convert it to vector all right oh I see all right okay okay that's good then it's a little bit like the resizing is doesn't look so great but I'm not going to worry about that let's hit let's save then now add up look oh I can I can take a picture with my camera let's try this oh I should have I should have done something all right let me delete this one let me open that up okay that's a little better thank you converting to vector maybe was a bad idea okay so now let's try let's try uploading a new backdrop oh wait I think what I could do is duplicate this one right duplicate and then can I add another image on top like how do i how do I add and oh I could convert it back to bitmap there we go is that better and then what if i duplicate it can i load another image on top I don't David Schneider is asking how long past noon will you go my intention was to be done at noon but I would like to at least put a little bow on this and kind of wrap things up all right I'm not gonna worry so much we'll just change add a new costume and copy paste it on top okay got it where do I do costumes cuz backdrops her backdrops and costumes are different right costumes Oh I can add a costume here copy and paste okay let's all right let's try doing it within the backdrops so this one is coding train we're going to duplicate it and then I'm going to upload this copy go to here paste ah there we go okay so then this one is thank you okay so we start with and I I guess I missed the bottom oh well alright so now we're going back to the code it's not perfect we're going back to the code when switch backdrop to coding train switch backdrop to thank you okay oh whoops so then go to backdrops again well that's coding trained to convert to vector again oh dear all right let me start over I think I understand how to do this now so I'm going to I'm going to upload this one I'm gonna call this coding train oh there's copy and paste right there convert to vector bring this to the top oh no I don't want to stretch it let's do this so now bring it over here convert back to bitmap then duplicolor son coding train then duplicate it and then grab this and paste it in there we go okay so now is this is and this is the thang you keep it down down there kids you kids with your roadblocks okay so let's see coding training thank you whoops okay so here we go starts with coding train and thank you okay so could I possibly I haven't I have another idea which is let's go back to the star when the speed is set to zero can you I can make a function right I can make a function right so what if at the beginning like I want to make a function that's this where do I do that my blocks make a block no idle is that is that how to make a function I don't actually need them to keep it down I was just trying to be silly because what I was thinking I was gonna do is reset their positions let me not worry about that right now so because let me actually do it let me just do it this way I guess there because I cloned them move speed steps change speed by a speed is zero set speed back to a random number let's just do it this way pick a random number again between 20 and 30 set the go to beach ball I just want them to do it again go to beach ball and then oh but then I want them to go back and do do this again oh I do need a function yeah I do need a function alright maybe this is getting too fancy with what time I have oh repeat until let's change that okay I gotcha this is better there's a repeat until so let's go into operators of control repeat until and then operators repeat until this speed is less than zero variables speed is less than zero so let's get rid of this this is better and then so I want this to be a function because I want to call that function again can I even recursively do something like that Oh repeat forever oh yeah yes of course I could just do repeat forever and then actually do that alright of course let me do it that way it's funny how am I like bringing the logic of my brain doesn't understand these possibilities so repeat until would be great to use but I'm actually going to change to repeat forever which is just forever move speed by negative two and then if I need an if statement again not under operators that's under control if back to speed being less than zero and I need variables back to speed being less than zero then set the speed again can I copy a block no I mean I can't copy an individual I'll just I'll just do it man set the speed back to something random again pick random and then set the location under motion go to beach ball because now if we think about this it's going to just move move move move and then the speed I should give it a new random Direction too so I might as well give point in Direction also but let's just try this so okay let me explain this okay the idea here is that we're looking at the code over here I want to always forever just move move move I could make a diagram let's see here let's see how this works these each one of these stars has a speed and the speed is some random amount like let's say it's 10 so it's moving by 10 and moving by 9 they're moving by 8 and moving by 7 it's doing this forever it's always moving by it's always moving by whatever that speed is at some point the speed is going to end up at 0 when that does reset the speed back to 10 reset it back to here but it's still in a forever loop so it's going to do that again so I could give it a new direction a new color all those things but I think that this should work so if I go back to here let's try this when they get out of sync because the repeat loop doesn't happen I could do all of that and then wait to move them but this is actually kind of nice so I should give them new directions and a new color let's give them change the color effect so where's that under looks let's also do I could change the color effect change the color effect by an also random can anybody tell me what this color effect is I actually don't know so this should give them new colors I don't know if it's doing that I think it's doing that and then also give them a new direction point in direction which is blue so that's under motion point in direction it's also give them a new random direction by the way this really needs a they're coming out of the you in what now I feel like they should fade can I have them fade away hmm all right maybe I'm making this too complicated all right it changes the color of effect it's it's set color effect not change color effect they work the same but it is cooler so I should set the color effect not change color effect set color effect where was that where was it it's purple which is looks set color effect let's try that how do I get just come on okay move this away so let's try set color effect to a random I'm just assume maybe it's like you so like between 0 and 360 let's try this okay that's pretty good thank you Bruno can you set ghosts to multiple of speed okay what's ghost is that kind of transparency go to front layer costume background I don't know what ghost is where is this but I think one of the things I wanted to do is just try to get to cut out these hearts so what if I get a fine here if I go in here and go under costumes can I open up get like one of these stars like what if I get this copy and paste ooh that didn't work so let me let me also see if I can make this there we go let's try that I'm not gonna wear that oh that's good Auto levels let's try that all right let's keep that hit save this is the star let's go to desktop so now if I were to add a costume and go to desktop star okay it's so big can I do that convert to vector thing and make it smaller oops I guess Photoshop would be my friend here I'm not making it smaller am i there we go that's making it small all right no just moving it isn't it making it smaller yes it is okay we're getting there people okay now convert to bitmap eraser whoa they make this like ten so I can erase around it ghost effect okay there's a ghost effect I see that's under effects ah that's fine I'm doing my best here people okay to make this transparent and I could make multiple costumes running out of time here people to make this a bigger just for a second because I think there are little spots that I missed why is this sprite like got so much space to it alright let's see what happens here okay now so I've got this star and can I just delete this costume there we go okay so now what happens if I do this house run again yeah I've got the stars from from the actual drawing that's better I think it should be out of the center and it's way too fast so let's go back here let's have the the the beach ball glide where's the center a zero let's try that okay um all right so I think this project is could use a lot I want to make the Stars throw the ghost effect I wanted to try that so let I want to learn what other effects besides color there is so if we go to looks and change oh there's other effects a world I think this is the I think this is what I worked on some of these these are the things I worked on so I think it was around 2003 or 2004 I was in Boston for a little bit hanging out and working with some of the scratch folks and just contributed just for like a day but I did and I remember I had to learn squeak at the time so I have no idea of any of this and thank you Michael Anderson who made a donation all right so let me let's try ghosts and so I can do set know set another effect in the forever loop set ghost effect two variables speed I might need to multiply speed by something right but let's see what happens if I try this I expected it to fade out what am I doing wrong here what am I missing I was expecting the ghost effect if it's set by speed then speed is some value going down to zero I was expecting to see them maybe fade away but I don't really see that happening any ideas distance from beach ball times some constant I don't need to do the stuff before the forever loop because yeah that's probably true because it's kind of getting all those set here change not set what is the range of the ghost it's fading out only a smarta Matt Matt okay let's change how did is there a way a nice way to get just one of these out of here okay I guess I have to break it off put this back so let's go to change change Ghost effect by twenty five five oh maybe aha it's going up ghost is not like I think of guy I think of transparency as a number between zero and say 255 or zero and 100 so 100 being fully opaque and counting down to zero but the ghosts effect is the is the inverse of that the more I apply the ghost effect the more transparent it will be so I want to change the ghost effect by let's say just one and maybe I want to change it by five yeah so but then I need to set the ghost effect when they get back to the beginning the set ghosts effect to zero beautiful I could do a hundo so it's zero to a hundred okay zero to 100 is there a map function like a map block in I could make my own map block that's something I'll do another time okay so this is our this is my thank you to first responders an essential workers digital card that my kids were doing with me and we're teaching me scratch but they left they got bored after an hour and went to play roblox because such as life let's see what I mean to save now see project page made on the coding train Oh as taught by operator number zero e and operator number one Oh and so thank you to essential workers and first responders can I put like a little you know heart or whatever and okay let's let's add a little train let's put a URL to what we're doing right now which is this let me turn off my sound copy video URL and also lets and there was a if you give me a second I want to find its I want to find there was a local charity for Brooklyn let me try to find I don't um so I had so this is also just this is just for where I live in my local community let me get back to here let me get to here I'm gonna just give a link also to this organization which is the Brooklyn Community Foundation which is a response fund for much needed resources here in Brooklyn and one percent of all donations are going to high impact nonprofits in Brooklyn so if you feel so inclined these are two organizations that you can donate to I'm picking them admittedly somewhat arbitrarily um there's lots of organizations that could use help and that I think one way to make an impact is just donating funds and I rose a lot of people are out of work and finances are really tough I'm very lucky to still have my job at NYU and be able to do this live streaming thing train emoji was changed to a question mark I'm not sure what that refers to but let me go back to here oh yeah I don't know why the emoji yet maybe it doesn't like to have emojis here but let's not worry about that let's hit save and stop and then there we go we'll watch it one more time right okay I'm gonna see if I could get operator 0 & 1 to come see this and give me their feedback and if the link here if I don't know if somebody can post this into the chat this is the link for the project and give me a second I will be right back see my wife still open here here come's operator zero for the grand tonight you can come sit in your spot operator zero you can help me say goodbye on the stream David Schneider is wanting to is reminding me that would you like to you can you can do some drawings here to say goodbye thank you everybody so let but you want to come see what I'm what I did with your drawing let's let me turn the music off here so let's go to the scratch page see inside operator operator number one will you come over to the screen you're drawing hold up come see it I want to hear your feedback alright operator zero you're looking right so this is what I made starts with a coding train wallpaper ok operators one is coming okay ready here it is so the beach ball comes up it bursts in the center the stars pop out and they keep going like that they fade out and they go and go and go what do you think it's good do you have any idea any do you are you curious about any of the code bits how I did it or do you have any ideas for if we were going to work on it more what would be good to do next how I made the Stars come out okay so the way I made the Stars come out is and I can go back here to this view so what's the Stars code is here and basically the thing that I learned is that I can make fifty copies of the Stars with this create a clone and then all the stars have this exact same code so now here each one that have that burst message they each get out of their own color they get a speed they go to the witch where the beach ball was but the trick is that I have a speed variable so they all move by speed the speed looks I guess you could go back down hold on what you click on here do we lose the live stream no we're still going so the speed goes down by to the ghost effect fades them out and then once the speed reaches zero they reset them all so uninterested I mean if only they you know I would say like oh they're downstairs and they're playing like you know some kind of dude I don't know they're just on a different screen doing a different computer thing okay let's go to here so thank you everybody for tuning in to this live stream let's see if I can get everything up on the screen that I want which is and we're going to go back to the project page I'm gonna zoom this in above here so and let's see if I can vary oh the green screen I wanted to try look okay the guy did want to try the green screen so let's before I go let's try that I'll also take any questions oh and did I actually announce the QA so I hope to be back and livestreaming once per week next week I also hope to record without a live stream some video tutorials that I will up look at edited and upload particularly related to the nature of code playlist that I've been working on and then one thing that's new which you're not right now is I have the ability it's a very fancy technical system technology I've got here for people to call in and I can wear a headset and hear them and then send their audio through to the live stream so we have some plans to manage in discord what's going on not a battery plug it in I so I'm gonna try having people call in and ask questions I mean they can do some live office hours or give feedback on code projects and that kind of thing so that's gonna happen hopefully sometime next week I don't know when yet anybody want to bring me a cap I could use a cap what well you could find the cats so but I have a new toy that I'm going to reveal to you right now let me go back just to here let's see what happens all right let's see here now what I'm going to do is go to this view alright and I'm gonna sit down over here on my OBS and let's do some things here let's go to well let's just try filters turn the chroma key on alright and then let's unlock it and move it over a little bit and there we go mission accomplished well let's get higher but it did what everybody wanted so I'm wearing this shirt I mean I think I might just go back to here it actually just goes to that I have it set that the green screen is only in here is this still oh I have to move that over and then so let me fix this also this will be for future videos move this over the autofocus is going a little crazy so I should be able to do my weird gesturing at things and also have more available I'm very tiny I probably want to make myself a little bigger I am a ghost do have a sweatshirt which will bring me back I know everybody loves this shirt but I want to see what this really looks like here it's really raining up there and they're still this is the Greek alright Here I am on the coding train so thanks for tuning in this is pretty much all I've got for today I hope you enjoyed this I enjoyed making this scratch project I don't know maybe you could give me like a heart or a star or I got some what does this mean does this mean somebody remade their own version like is there a way I can find I have 30 messages in my inbox we've got all of you messaging me oh you can't see the size is about right okay so this is good I feel good about this I'm curious I would love any feedback in terms of the quality of this stream you know sort of like just audio video I'm using this mic which is different usually I wear a lav mic but I've got this you test oh okay the mic is back so I think I've got kind of a pretty bad USB cable here I need to get another one what's going on no one wants to bring me a cat okay I have got the the mic is back so thank you for tuning in this has been a 2 hour and 20 minute livestream and I know one found me a cat and so what do I want to say what else do I want to say I think this is all I have to say I'm finishing up and I'm gonna sip this going I'm gonna go I'm gonna go find a cat I need a cat you guys like goodbye with a cat I gotta see if the cat works with the green screen okay so let's I'm gonna find myself a cat I will be right back okay you like my coding tutorials you won't run away and get bored and just go play roblox will you no no no you won't no no no I've got you yes yes ah you're such a good kitty yeah yeah good kitties oh this cat is an indoor cat does not go outside except given the quarantine and all the staying at home we have been taking this cat outside on a leash she loves it loves it just meowing meows scratches jumps up tries to get out the door the other cat Eevee not so much don't wanna go outside no interest none whatsoever okay oh you want to tap the microphone yes it is a good microphone yes all right I was saying goodbye so stay tuned it's a little bit tricky for me to live stream here from home there's a lot of distractions yeah I took a break already I'm sitting I'm saying goodbye to everybody now would you like to draw another drawing goodbye drawing no you want the cat no this is my baby don't take my baby away bring me a kitty can't somebody pay and bring me a cat so I hope to be back and making tutorials third grade happens right over there I'm actually what's interesting is this camera I realize is like a webcam so I can kind of can kind of see what's upsidedown but this is where third grade happens you can see the desk it's all upside down oops over here that's so third grade is happening in my live streaming studio I don't know what I'm doing here let's just let's just come back and speak to you uhhuh third grade is happening here at home fifth grade starts on Monday all meals I'm quite the breakfast chef if I don't say so myself we've been cooking all of our meals at home we're really into Harry Potter is what's happening during our quarantine but I hope to be able to engage with the coding train community I remember what I wanted to say so one of the things that I'm interested in looking at is this is a really excellent article that it's from the Washington Post Harry Stevens which does some nice simulations of their called like a sir model and and also a three blue one brown also made a video about simultaneous simulating an epidemic with these sir models so what I'm hoping to do actually may be on oh you don't see my screen oh and the worst I'm not used to this setup I'm not used to where the buttons are and changing things but this is the Washington Post article that I think is really amazing use of computational animation and simulation to demonstrate an idea and a three blue one Brown takes those ideas and and and goes quite far with them in this video that I would really encourage you encourage you to watch and so I'm hoping that my next livestream will be making a simple p5.js of these kinds of simulations I don't necessarily have anything new to add from a scientific standpoint and that quite certainly not my area of expertise but I think what I do have to have something to add is if you were interested in learning how to program something like this then that's something that I can help teach and give a little tutorial and there's so much in these simulations that is very similar to what is in the nature of code tutorials and and the like so as you can see well interestingly what's what's recommended to me over here in the sidebar which is kind of interesting to see let's see we've got a lot a lot of videos here that are about math and science stuff okay so thank you all for watching I'll play my little goodbye music and I'm gonna just say Simon is writing that also working on a co vid 19 simulation and p5 you got a cat for me I will take just a few questions let me learn how to put this thing down I don't want to break it you better worry about this later I'm gonna put the green screen down later does it just like there like a little release did it kind of what it's fine I'll leave it plea can you please look at the comments on the scratch project okay I can do that before I go I'm just gonna make sure there I'm not being trolled here and that they're perfectly kind comments Oh cute project nope okay let's delete this comment okay oh there's a remix most of the comments are just saying hi and I'm from the stream so loved watching the stream my remix so I don't think I think everything's okay here let me look at this remix though from Gee Gee go gee I know I'm not showing you the screen let's I'm just checking to make sure it's okay for me to look at to everyone who helps and helped beat the coronavirus okay I'll show this one project that was shared here so this is from gog who created a remix that says to everyone who helps and help the coronavirus so that looks like just adding a nice little extra text message and let's run this again and see that there thank you very much for that wonderful remix quite appreciated okay G go G sorry G go G machine learning and scratch please any last questions I will take them I've got about a minute left of this goodbye music and thank you all for tuning in it's much appreciated I look forward to being back and doing more live stream so the coding train I don't know how this was feedback was definitely appreciated I hear the pitterpatter of feet is someone bringing me a cat no no cat Thank You Jorge thank you for your all of your kind messages will I qlearning I mean it's kind of on the long long list of things but are you doing more scratch no more today what you drawn I'm learning my lock asks I'm learning p5.js and I've come to the end of the first playlist what's next great question so I would say you could use one of the sharpies if you want I would say that so a place that you can look is the coding train comm and if you go here under learning I would say any of these actually I think one of oh sorry you can't see this any of these at the coding train comm under learning would be good next steps I might suggest the nature of code playlist or the data and api's playlist or the ml 5 beginners guide any of these I guess advanced p5 guess so one thing I guess I should make a note of I think I would like to change this I don't like using the word advanced I don't I think advanced is I think there are better ways to describe how different things can be sequenced and what level or what kinds of knowledge are expected for certain kinds of content and I don't know that advanced is really the right term so it's like maybe it's just like p5.js continued or it's like something like that so I'll think about what could be better but grant is saying go be with your kids thanks for a weird live stream indeed but yes so this I would say there's some good places for some next steps what else did you work on scratch like you mentioned twirl so I just you don't have to really kind of dig into my memory more deeply and kind of really think about this but I call working on image processing filters so and I specifically remember like the world effect but I but mostly I might have done the pixel 81 and when I say have done I worked on a version iteration of them at one time so whatever is in scratch now might be completely disconnected from that because that was back in 2004 and I've always followed the scratch project it's a wonderful tool and learning environment it's they do a really a wonderful job of managing their community and allowing kids to learn and create and share so so I encourage you especially if you have if you have kids who are wanting to learn about coding in their kind of in the elementary school age on scratch is a wonderful place to start so I would like to actually do some more now I have two dreams of like every day at lunchtime coming on and doing a little scratch but time wise I don't see how me to make that happen right now but we'll see if I can get some more stuff yes you know you could bring we do these plugs you can bring them to other outlets and plug them in alright thanks everybody for tuning in I am going to say goodbye thank you I think this says it all from my heart to yours stay safe stay inside stay well be well there's anything that the coding train community can do to support you your community please reach out the best place to do that would be on discord which I am just posting to the chat now the discord invite link stay tuned for Q&A next week please be in touch on social media stay safe stay well give your friends and family virtual hugs to the extent that you can and I look forward to seeing you all next week sometime on the coding train next livestream I hope to do a sir modeling simulation in p5.js it's kind of a topic that I'm thinking about but if you have other ideas for things that I can do let me know okay good bye everybody love you all thanks for thanks for this sort of happy to be back in doing this and I'm gonna go get some yeah it's time for lunch for me I don't know what time it is for you but it's definitely time for lunch for me good bye everybody see you later know whether I should be on this one or I just thought this will go to here thanks for watching I always forget I'm gonna do this this stock this dog the star that this stock song never forget the business so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I think nine lot family but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven this is like Berlin noise performance part to like birthing noise performance apart with curly noise I might pick numbers like this Perlin noise that it's Hurley noise so this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that is her pearling know her Perlin noise that it's Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley this is this is Hurley noise that is Hurley so this is Hurley noise but with early noise I might pick numbers like this this is like Portland noise performance part unicorns and rainbows and unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get but I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it does not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound alright coming back with my cat in three two one the cookies do you wanna go everybody see you later
