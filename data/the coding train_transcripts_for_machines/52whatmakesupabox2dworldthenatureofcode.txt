all right so now we know hopefully we have box today we've downloaded we're up and running we need to answer this question how does it work anyway like what Scott what how does box duty work so let's first before we get there let's first think about how a regular ngon box 2d sketch works in processing ok so what does a processing sketch have it has set up and it has draw and in setup maybe you create all the objects in your world right you you create a bunch of objects create a bunch of objects and then what happened to draw every time every time the sketch cycles over and over and over again we calculate the motion of every object and then we draw every object so we calculate I'll say calculate the physics you know location and velocity velocity at acceleration apply force we do all the stuff with everything and then what do we do we draw everything so this is kind of how we've been writing our sketches what we're looking to do with box2d is replace this line with ask box 2d to calculate the physics right we still need to create everything and we still need to draw everything but we don't need to update all of their locations and do all that math box2d is going to do it we can think of box today essentially as this magic box right there's this magic box 2d right and what we do is we create a bunch of objects and set up and we put them in the magic box and then every time through magic every time through draw we say hey magic box where is everything where is everything it's very strange diagram here saying ok what we're gonna do is create everything put everything in the box we would say hey there's a whole bunch of squares and a whole bunch of rectangles and a bunch of triangles and they all start here and then go we back away slowly and just saying where is everything drawn on the screen where is everything drawn on the screen and we don't know how it's stuff is moving that's up to box2d it's taking care of that so the good news about a scenario like this is we don't have to do all of that physics math our code and figure it out and debug it it's all done for us the bad news about a scenario like this is we lose a lot of control here we are just kind of just saying draw everything draw everything and I'm sure you're doing it correctly thank you very much and mostly and and and so this is a good some projects this is perfect for other projects this is not so perfect for and this is the question you're gonna have to ask yourself when you're kind of figuring out what tool to use to create what you're creating but so this so this is the overall structure and we're gonna we're gonna see how this works in an actual code example in the next video I'm not timing destitute but in this video I have a couple more things that I want to talk about one is what goes in this magic box so this is kind of key what goes in this magic box so let's erase all this over here and let's talk about what are the central elements of box D what are the things we're going to have to learn about to use box 2d so box 2d has a bunch of elements number one there's something called a world number two there's something called the body number three there's something called a shape well number four there's something called a fixture and number five there is something called a joint so these are the central elements of box2d these are the kinds of objects that we're going to make we're going to make bodies we're going to make shapes we're gonna make fixtures we're gonna make joints and we're gonna put all those things in the magic box and then we're just gonna ask where is everything we would like to draw it with our own special colors and design and images etc so the key that we're okay so the world first of all we should kind of leave world up here world is the world the world is this magic box so that's the world we need to the first thing we're going to do in a box through the example is create that world the second thing we're gonna do in a box to the example is start to put bodies in that world the body is the central element that moves around the screen it is the thing that has the physics has the physics that can something have the physics anyway it's it's the sort of central element the interesting thing about a body is it it is nothing it's nothing it's emptiness it's just like this empty points that's moving throughout the screen a shape is what actually has geometry and a shape is what gets attached to a body so if we look at a window the body is this point that's going to move around and it's going to have a velocity a shape is going to be the actual thing you know our little Angry Bird here I don't know what I'm drawing I can't believe I'm doing this that's and it added to skip something fixed whatever okay so the shape is the thing with geometry that's the actual shape is it a rectangle is it a polygon is it a circle that's the thing we're going to attach to our body how are we going to attach it to our body with a fixture so you can start to imagine here that you can see how using box2d even though we have this magic thing right oh it's gonna be so easy we just set up things in the world then we ask where is everything where you draw it it's gonna be so easy it's not so easy because we got to make bodies then we got to make shapes and we got to make fixtures and we got to do all this stuff so this is when we get to the code example which we're very slowly inching our way to in the next video there's a lot of details we're gonna have to work out and and most of this we can copy paste and just sort of look up we don't have to memorize it so to speak but it isn't so easy so the body is the is the thing that's the mover this is the equivalent to the mover class that we've been making all along the difference is now our movers didn't have geometry sure we drew something on the screen but there was no collisions so we have to start worrying about geometry which we have to define shapes that are attached to bodies with fixtures joints by the way we're gonna start to look at later towards the end of this section of videos a joint is something that connects two bodies so when we think about the pendulums we made we could are the springs we might have a body and a body connected with a joint that could be like a revolution joint it could be a spring joint there's a bunch of different kinds of joints we could look at in box2d okay so this is the overall picture and think okay so I think that's pretty good for right now what I would suggest to you what I would do as your exercise here before the next video is get make a basic processing sketch make an object that has a location and a size maybe it's a square maybe it's a circle and make an ArrayList of those objects and just stick a whole bunch randomly on the screen or wherever you click the mouse add objects so make a sketch with no physics it's just going to be a sketch and I'll show you an example of this make a sketch that's like this that I can just add objects to and they don't do anything what we need to do in the next video is actually take a sketch like this and stick box2d in it say like okay instead of just these objects that are drawn on the screen we we now want to have those objects move according to the physics of box2d and Bach City is just gonna tell us where they are and what their rotation is and we're gonna draw according to what box2d tells us that's what we're gonna get through in the next video okay any questions I'm sure you have many okay so I'm gonna click this and I'll see you in the next video
