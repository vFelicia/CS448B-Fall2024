hello here's another video about other ways to create p5.js projects other than the now deprecated outofservice so to speak p5 just desktop editor but don't worry soon when I have more gray hair I will be here in a video hopefully with the creator of what's the upcoming p5 just a web editor to show you that and how you can make p5 just project with this new editor that's coming out soon but while I'm here in this video I'm gonna show you two wonderful projects made by the processing foundation community and one is called open processing so open processing is actually a p5.js web editor and it's a project that's been around for a while created by Sanada Show glue and I apologize Zenon if I did pronounce your last name correct I'm correctly I'm sure we get lots of comments here about how I botched that but Zenon originally created open processing as a way to share processing sketches which are Java applets and he recently launched a new design I should really have seen on come in and present this sometime on the channel but and so it's a great way that you could quickly mock up a p5 just sketch in the browser and then have it to share so the only thing that I've done before making this video is go to open processing org itself and sign up for an account so I actually signed up for I already had an account by signed up for a new one just for this YouTube channel called coding train and so once you've signed up for account and go to your page you can make a profile and do all that kind of stuff that I'm sure you can figure out but really what I'm interested in is the fact that making a sketch is as easy as this button create a sketch so let's make a sketch create a sketch so now I have a sketch and the fonts a little small but I can zoom into it for you can see it's a very simple sketch it just did an automatic template for me I can obviously add lots of code and do different things and I can you know just to do something I'm going to change the background to a slightly purplish color I'm gonna play it to see how it looks and you can see here's my sketch it's filling the background with one color and it's drawing a lot of ellipses I can how do I get out of this now ah there I go so I have to go up to the top and then a little menu appears and I what I want to do is this button looks like this button will go back to the code so now I'm back to the code this button will go back to the sketch okay then I can also hit save and then I can give it a name like coding train and I am on the youtubes training juju you interact with the mouse and then I can do is hit submit and there we go I have my coding train p5.js sketch and I have this link which I can send to anybody to share so that they could see it and use it as well so that is a really quick way also to create sketches in the browser through an online site like open processing and share those sketches instantly so that's that's one let me go I'm just gonna do two in one video that's what I'm doing so another way that you can do p5 just sketches is you can actually go and get processing now processing is a project that's been around for since 2001 it's a Java based platform I do do a lot of videos that use processing and if you watched my intro to p5.js that kind of referenced the relationship between processing and p5.js their sibling projects part of the processing foundation so if you go to processing org and you go to download you can get to a download page where you can download the processing desktop application for your particular operating system now what this is meant for you to do is then write processing code and run desktop applications but it so happens that Ben Frey and fathom information design been try being one of the creators of processing created mode for the processing editor so let me open the processing editor here it is so this is what it looks like it normally would expect you to write your Java code in here your processing code and run it and that sort of thing but over here up in the top right corner you'll see there's this little box that says Java and you notice I can switch to Android and Python now those won't necessarily be there by default those are modes that I've added through this mode option there there there are ways of writing using processing to write code in a different language for an android application or for writing your code in Python I'm going to add another mode it's going to open up this window and this is the one that I want p5.js mode adds a simple editor for p5.js code by Favot information design so now I'm going to install that they're going to wait for it to download download download downloading downloading downloading downloading downloading downloading downloading down that's the song it's the downloading song I really I've really excited there and now it's ready and I can't remove it I should be able to go and switch to p5.js and look at this it redid my window it gave me a little setup and draw even have an index.html file and I can say create canvas 400 400 I can say background 200 comma 0 comma 255 and then I can draw a circle here where the mouse is to do my first sketch and I can hit run and then it goes to the browser and opens up and once again here if I want to if I want to look at the results I'm sorry if I want to see what's happening in the console just like I showed in my brackets tutorial if I want to see any print statements I've got to look at that javascript console in the browser so I can I can get to that by saying view developer JavaScript console or I can use a keyboard shortcut to open that up and close it ok so those are two other ways that you can make p5.js sketches you can use the brackets editor which I showed in a previous video and in this video I've shown you open processing and the processing p5.js mode so if you have questions or trouble with these things please write it in the comments and I look forward to hearing what you end up making and hopefully you enjoy using these tools good bye
