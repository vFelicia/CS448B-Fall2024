*train whistle* hello welcome to a Q&A video I'm going to talk in this video about what is the difference between p5.js and processing, i'm probably in a moment going to say exactly that same thing, because I'm actually just after the fact recording an intro because I went on for so long i decided to drop to divide this particular discussion into three parts. so the first part i'm just going to kind of talk about those real bigger picture of these two different environments and what programming languages they're built on and kind of how that plays a role in their features and ways that you work with them and I'll diagram that on the whiteboard the second part i'll actually show the two different environments and type some code sidebyside and look at the editors and see some pieces of that and in the third part i will make a list of pros and cons of why you might want to use one versus the other or where one environment excel over the other environment and as well as take some questions from the live chat about things that I missed so that's going to be three videos if you find them interesting please watch them if you kind of don't please don't watch them and offer you maybe in the second part *train whistle* hello welcome to a coding train Q&A video in this video I'm going to answer a question that I get a lot about the project the software projects that are maintained by something called the processing foundation the processing foundation was founded in 2012 its mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts and beneficial literacy within technology related fields and I would say primarily also to make these fields make this more accessible to diverse communities and i encourage you to read more about the processing foundation's initiatives and projects and mission, all on the process foundation website but I'm not here to talk about the processing foundation in this video because i have this habit of doing that all the time the question that i get a lot and this question comes from someone named shiffman ok so i posted this question but it's only because people tweet and email it to me all the time but you can actually ask your own questions here other github repository in the issues which I'll link to in this video's description but the question here is what is the difference between p5.js and processing and the last time I tried to make a video you'll see it in this playlist answering the question I really went into the history of these projects and why they exist and the philosphy and principles behind them in and some differences in that extent but i didn't really get to what I think is important and on a lot of people's minds which is the technical differences what are the underlying programming languages behind these environments what kind of editors can i use with these environments what kind of projects what kind of features do they have whats the difference between the syntax and features of both of these frameworks and that's what I want to discuss in this particular video ok so I'm gonna come over here to the whiteboard for a second, hi! I'm over here at the whiteboard now so here's the thing, processing and p5.js are I would say open source frameworks software projects that are kind of broad projects that involve different aspects and so each one let's think about each one as sort of three categories so each one of these projects is all three of these things if some ways, a library they're built on top of a programming language and then for each one of these that you might use you need someplace where you would sort of type your code and figure out how to use it an editor so let's think about these three categories for a second so p5 and processing let's start with processing so processing is built is written is a library for so these are really kind of one thing it's really not three, it's really two. processing is a library for the java programming language the library, the things that processing is adding or building on top of, or giving you features for are things like drawing data hardware sound so maybe this is a good way of thinking about it and maybe I could add more things here so it's a library meaning it's really ultimately what it is one of the aspects of it if the library of code that you can call functions from, it's built on top of the java programming language, there is an editor for processing which I'll say is like a desktop editor so processing has a desktop editor that you can download and use. the language that p5 is written in and that it is a library for is JavaScript and it has libraries also for drawing and data and sound and hardware but I could keep going with this list, but the primary thing that i might add here HTML CSS or maybe more importantly Dom. because it's javascript, and i'll get to this in a bit more there's a big component of p5 involving the web, so now where do you create projects using p5? Here is the thing processing which is a project that started in 2001, in 2001 if you wanted to write and compile and this is a sort of an aspect to this as well and create software sketches you would need a code editor most code editors were difficult to download install maybe you need to use command line if you're just using a text editor you have this big giant complex environment like eclipse so processing really the idea of processing being an editor is really fundamental to the project you download this editor you open it up and you type code in it you hit 'play' or a run button you see the result of your code, 'EZ peasy' so to speak so just as much at processing is both a library with all this functionality a place to call those functions in an editor in very fundamental to the project. p5 in many ways that's a little bit less the case because of the world that we live in now and where you can program for the web you know name your favorite editor everybody has their you can use added more supply more brackets are codependent some of these are webbased better just knowing their desktop editors you can just have a you can just use any text editor you can run a server so there's all the fishes left a little bit less of a fundamental piece of the project out there was and I'm gonna make a separate video about this i think there was a p5 jas desktop editor that we modeled after the processing one of many similarities many differences as well because ideas that simple thing you downloaded tiger code you press the play button you see the result this has now been deprecated hopefully a desktop editor will come back at some point in lieu of developing an entire web page editor so their website editor is currently in development there's no public release of it yet but certainly when its release I hope to have people who are working on it comes and presented on the youtube channel Kathy target charts are occasions is that is the lead developer of the People vs web editor and the work that she is doing is just but not else i'm very excited to the point that will be able to have that a public relief if there's no this is not a new idea there are many webbased editors symbol code pen jsfiddle these are places where you just go to your web browser you see a place where you can type in code and you can see the result of the code you could say that you could share it this is very powerful so while there are a lot of options for web editors that you can use we have decided to try to make one that's kind of geared towards people GS specifically and highly tailored to a beginner so if you are a teacher and you've got the group of you know ninth graders on Saturday afternoon for a couple hours you want to teach them the beginning of learning to code what would be the easiest way to do it open up the browser everybody sign up for an account type in your code hit play save share that's kind of mp5 yes to all the libraries are configured and set up for you that's kind of a goal of this this particular web editor project so this is the landscape between these two things so now here i think it is worth exploring for a second and then i'm going to them kind of 102 things going to do is just show you these two environments and like make the same program in both of them to see highlights of differences and then I also want to make a list of pros and cons of why you like you want to use one versus the other but let's let's spend a minute here on Java and JavaScript and I don't like to say versus just put a little heart because i love you by the way people think java is like not a thing anymore but it's used so widely and people don't like job but i like all programming languages it's the place that you can write some code and express yourself and make something interesting it's a good place to be might not be your favorite but let's not be so mean about java so Java is a programming language i think it was started in 1991 but really more formally launched probably 1995 everyone in the comments can correct me here if you walk up and the idea of java the big exciting thing about java was write once run anywhere i think with the acronym write once run anywhere anywhere whoa Rob war up at the Royce didn't have like a good ring to it but um the idea is if you were writing your code and C or C++ you would have to rewrite your code entirely if you move from a apple computer to a windows computer to a linux machine to a mobile phone to a toaster and the idea of java the magic was you didn't actually write code that native to that computer you wrote code is very generic way and then there you would have something on that computer called a java virtual machine so as long as the Java Virtual Machine was part of this device then your java code could run on it the Java Virtual Machines essentially job is to translate your java code which turns into java bytecode to that machine specific machine code so this is what it was exciting and powerful innovation and java really adopt most of the same syntax as c++ and it was also highly objectoriented language for better or worse it can be very very wordy and tedious and kind of ugly in many ways are beautiful and elegant depending on how you look at it but what processing a lot of what processing did with java is when you're working in its desktop environment a lot of the rapper code to sort of extra code you need to put the beginning and end of every program in java probably can add for you behind the scenes so that makes it a little bit simpler and some people think of it wasn't really java it's it's because it or is it but it really is java however you are allowed to a not have to live by this like very formal objectoriented way of thinking although you can of course two objects and you don't need all of this extra java stuff that looks very intimidating and upsetting in a way on your like first day looking to program to have that handle this computer stuff that you know what it means so that's really what's going up what happened profit now processing was also in this is what I spent a lot of time in my previous video check i'll try not to harp on too much here java made sense because they could connect to a lot of hardware and librarian for data and networking but it also at the time there was something called applet which were part of early browser's javascript in many ways with need to to complement the fact that JavaScript might be a programming language of the browser that would complement applets but a way of running your profit pitches in 2001 when process of creating that export to Annapolis and share it on the web can't do that so much anymore so the JavaScript of actually what kind of struck started being developed around the same time a little bit after it had other names like mocha and maybe like live script because and netscape and various companies that were developed organizations that were developing early browsers realized you needed something to that you could write code right in the browser in your HTML in your file to like control the behavior and logical things that are happening on a webpage and that's where javascript came from now javaScript obviously is very different now in what year is that 2017 of that it was back then that there's been many different specifications for the language there's there's an organization called ICI ma is that when they were on version like there's like es6 and early term i haven't adopted the new syntax of my video tutorials of JavaScript just yet i can pick your very life doctor to get to show you the environment but but but but still it's quite different but it still is fundamentally the language of the browser a key difference however is that while this is compiled code you have to write your code and then run it through a process that converts it into you know zeros and ones that can be executed an application javascript doesn't work that way javascript is what's known as an interpreted language meaning the browser just read your code and executed at the same time which allows for a lot of flexibility and exciting things like live coding or changing code apply running it typing your code in the browser getting rest there's all sorts of possibilities that you can explore because it's interpreter on the fly and can change as it's running over time as opposed to send it to be compiled and finished but and so invested these are very different programming languages the name is just there because of this thing that applicants were there and JavaScript supposed to complement that and so but added some of the syntax for a while is the same but the actual quality of the language of JavaScript ism do more functions are a job everything about object javascript is that can be object is underrated but functions that sort of this primary thing and this left of can do want to that of course but that sort of the primary think so p 5ks is just a library for JavaScript so if you are quoting full learning p5 yes what you're learning to program in java script and the library of functions that you're calling to maybe draw or do things come from p5 yes if you are learning processing your learning the syntax of the java programming language and how it works and getting access to all these libraries from profits to draw and do that type of thing so and in truth at least in my experience people say well I don't want to use the framework because i really want to learn the with a real big well guess what the real thing is learning how to use different framework so if you learn how to use P by jet maybe you'll learn how to use 3jf RP production or a no matter chance or fill in the blanks doctor is different libraries in different framework for the languages ok so that's kind of a rather longwinded summary of all this and what I want to do now is just show you the two different environments and house intact looks between them and then make a lift of pros and cons between the two Subtitles by the Amara.org community
