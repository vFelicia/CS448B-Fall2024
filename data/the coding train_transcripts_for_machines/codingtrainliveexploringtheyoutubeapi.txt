um so believe the yeah is probably so me do do good morning i'm not ready that's not really that what you're supposed to start with a live stream i'm also kind of going to speak a little bit more quietly not because it's very it's early morning here in uh brooklyn new york where i am broadcasting from but because there are children sleeping in the next room uh when i did my late night shows um the children were sleeping a little bit further away from where i live stream although still you know within earshot for sure but you know with the heat and different there's like we only have certain airconditioned uh areas so um my idea which is uh uh apparently going incredibly well so far was that um i would try and i know it was like weeks ago that i said this that i would um live stream in the morning um i tried the late night thing it's very difficult these days with um being quarantined um at home and everybody being in the house all the time no school no camp to find the time to live stream so the evenings the night time and the morning are my experiments so welcome to the coding train morning show cue the morning show theme song oh it doesn't exist amazing how come it doesn't exist um good morning to fran mg and lok sham and akash and spidey zack i love your name spidey zach um tapu and cooper and i guess tapu is saying good evening dan because one of the nice things about streaming at this time is i have a feeling that there are a lot of you who often can't tune in because it's the middle of the night or very early in the morning for you whereas particularly if you're you know if you're on the other side of the world maybe it's just sort of the um a perfect a lovely friday evening you're sitting down with your evening tea turning on the tube and watching a coding live stream all right so um to help us get uh woken woken to help us wake up what's going so well it's like everything i ever dreamed of to help us wake up let's begin this morning with our ceremonial reading of the random numbers q the reading of the random numbers theme song let me just check the chat uh we're getting scratching on the mic okay um hi cj um oh good i'm glad cj is watching i don't know if cj is planning to be to stream this morning and i understand of course if you are and have to go but um i feel like some of the stuff i want to try to do today will need cj's help mike was jumping um is it i want to make sure the mic is uh um the mic is working uh fine before i keep going i guess i'll read my random numbers as a mic test fifty six thousand four hundred and forty uh sixty nine thousand one hundred sixty nine five thousand nine hundred and thirty nine fifty seven thousand five hundred and sixteen eighty five thousand one hundred and twenty seven seventy four thousand one hundred and fifty nine uh fifty three thousand two hundred ninety five twenty nine thousand eight 7409 28 140. i don't see the mic is fine um akash says i'm looking beautiful and diabetes staring in the chat um honestly no cause i don't know do i need to for live streaming for you people you wonderful wonderful beautiful people of internet i don't think so um i will bathe today i don't bathe every day it's quarantined do you do i need to bathe every day i don't think so i mean i i try to bathe as often as reasonable and to keep sort of healthy and clean why are you making me talk about this i do have coffee i did notice that um somebody did say in the chat that i look 20 years older i think let me let me explain to you why so first of all i don't i there's just like an optical illusion happening in other videos one is a lot of the videos on my channel are literally from almost 10 years ago so i am 10 years older the green screen lighting setup that i have in the uh recording studio where i typically record tutorials um thank you anthony oh where's my bell um uh something about that like the way the green screen and the lights i just oh we've got a new member oh no that's for the super chat um thank you um wait i'm explaining why i look older because i don't i look my age which is 46 oh very soon to be turning 47 my birthday is coming up thank you very much oh today hey people of the internet let's do something together today is actually my daughter's birthday she's sleeping still she is turning nine years old nine years old today see if you get that reference um it's the beard yes i was getting to that um but her i don't know she can hear me but hopefully she's still sleeping because she's literally sleeping like within 20 feet from me there's a door um but um her favorite one of her favorite things in the world are parrots so i don't maybe we can make a p5 sketch with like parrots in it or something as like a little happy birthday present for her that could be nice that wasn't on my list of things to do this morning though let me show you my list i have it right here there it is there's my list oh wrong button oh i never actually uh excuse me for no no i did i did over it ah okay hold on hold on everybody um talk amongst yourself for taking oh there it is oh weird oh is the um ah oh i forgot to mention ah everything's falling apart my buttons my buttons my buttons okay here i'm gonna get this please please give me just just give me a minute less than a minute i can do this very quickly i thought i could computer why you forsake me oh there you are what's happening it's happening it's happening as i was saying in my wellprepared and rehearsed live stream where i don't make any mistakes or have any technical issues don't say um or like or uh because i have a script and a teleprompter and everything is highly planned and prepared as i was saying during this live stream i have a list of things that i want to work on it is right over [Laughter] crud here there's something on the list boy that was a lot of work but a lot of effort for a joke that completely fell flat what was i saying i have no idea i don't even remember is it time for me to be done yet can i go on with my day no because i'm going to do some coding i'm going to work on a project actually what i wanted to say is that i'm choosing this summer to just not worry so much about some of the sequence tutorials that i have and hope to continue uh like um starting back in september um i think there's a good chance that it might be reasonably safe for me to go record in the tutorial recording studio that i have we'll see um and so stay tuned hopefully this fall for continuation of the nature of code series guess what's coming i'm so excited about this i have finally figured out how to get twitter bots to reply to tweets and a stream or trigger events based on a search word or a reply or a favorite with the new twitter api web hooks system that i have been trying to figure out for years i did figure it out so i'm teaching that in my fall course at nyu which is going to be an online course but i will be recording videos on the coding train for that course so that is coming up i mean i'm going to get to that for sure in september because i i'm signed up to teach that class um but this summer i just want to work on you know fun random projects that i haven't gotten around to i want to experiment with controlling the hue lights that are behind me i've been well let's write these things down i made this list for a reason so the things that i one thing you know the things that i've been working on is gpt2 uh text generation and i i did um i did that previously i made on one of the late night shows i made a sort of dad joke bot so that is um something that i made previously you can go back and find some of those um i control the hue lights from node and i didn't get very far with that so i don't know maybe like a check minus is that a thing uh this is like a medium like started project um actually the gp uh discord bot um i believe if um i recall correctly i connected the gpt gpt2 model to a discord bot i wanted to connect the hue lights also to a discord bot where that during the live stream you could control from chatting and discord the hue lights behind me but the other thing that i really wanted to explore this summer which i'm hopefully going to do today which is very high risk because please please don't hack my youtube channel during this session i'm going to try really really really really hard not to reveal my api keys and tokens and all that stuff but i really want to work with the youtube api i know that um i can't remember who it was in the member chat it's a tilde not a check minus yes thank you i don't know if that's um i will cj says i will wait till your stream is over before i start mine this morning um thank you so you definitely don't need to do that but that's actually a wonderful thing if we can do that because a it gives me a reason to try to like give my i really should finish around 10 o'clock because kids are gonna wake up it's my as i mentioned it's my daughter's birthday um um thank you chi chaitan cheatin i'm sorry that i might be mispronouncing your name uh the rubik's cube ai says sean oh i have such pain in my heart there is such deep deep pain and sadness for the videos and projects that i have left just lingering unfinished unresolved and that is one of them ah um anyway what i was saying is that we could send everybody all the way over to cj i don't know if you have a plan cj for your stream let me know if you have a plan if you don't perhaps we can even think about something that i'm working on that you could continue definitely don't need to do that but that is a possibility if you were interested everyone should check out coding garden with cj if i haven't said that enough millions of times let me talk about a couple other things i do have a sponsor um it's been a while since i had um oh and i'm gonna have to remove the um my todo list i can't find the button for that there it is and it'll bring up my sponsor brilliant.org um brilliant brilliant uh sorry my sponsor brilliant the website is brilliant.org it's just called brilliant i do get that wrong i did get email feedback about getting that wrong so i'm getting it right this time thank you very much uh you know i i'm i'm always conflicted about um having sponsors um on the coding train um you know obviously the content and the teaching and the stuff that i do is primary um so but sometimes i think the stars align and uh it's really wonderful for me to be able to have um be able to have sponsors to keep this channel sustainable and going with all the different pieces i've got moving but it's really great when i have a sponsor that i feel like really aligns with the mission of the coding train and brilliant is one of those so um if you go to brilliant.org coding terrain you can sign up just for free if you go through that link it lets them know that you found it through the channel um it's just a site that's full of learning interactive learning courses so i spend a lot of time talking and demonstrating and on brilliant you can read and interact so it's really selfpaced learning fun puzzles well i'll take a break in the middle and i'll do their daily puzzle which is kind of one of my favorite things to do and the two courses i want to i'll highlight for you are the neural networks course and the python programming course which are you know for obvious reasons highly linked to the stuff that i'm doing on this channel okay um can you tell us how you are so happy every time acting thank you thank you thank you does anybody know that reference remember i am 46 years old and i will be 47 on july 29th i'll just let you all know my birthday because then maybe you could wish me a happy birthday when it's my birthday why not that'll be nice that's a nice thing i will not be streaming on july 29th i should mention schedule wise i will be um off for the month of august i actually will have a lot of work to do to prepare for my nyu courses but i will be mostly off from the coding train that doesn't mean though that there won't be videos released because i not in secret because if you're a member of the coding train you know this already um i have been working on a new coding in the cabana video i will show you the code from it i'll show it to you right now i'm going to open it up this is exactly oh i forgot that i made all these extra versions of it too um but i'm just going to show you um i'm going to show you here this is the project that i built i wonder what the youtube compression is doing with this but this is the project that i built in my next coding in the cabana video you might say like oh you've already done this i recognize this what does it look like to you giving you some time to type it in the chat type it in the chat type it in the chat um chinchya asks do you stream on twitch besides youtube no i have tremendous twitch envy all of the amazing things that i've seen people do on twitch i'm gonna name a few of them uh cozy coding with aaron davey you've gotta check out cozy coding aaron was a guest on his channel i mentioned coding garden with cj i know that saint plays uh i think it's saint plays tv maybe somebody could put that in the chat kobe who is a very dedicated viewer of the coding train streams on twitch and they're all david snyder worked on a project with kobe and at some point maybe i'll be able to get the they're working on that with the youtube api and this is one that i'll show you but so much amazing stuff people are saying simplex noise aha okay coming back to that um i have twitch envy but i've built this audience on youtube uh i'm kind of like an old fogie and maybe it makes sense for me to be like i'm the youtube streamer how's it going over there kids on twitch okay boomer now um but no i don't stream on twitch but i i i think about it often very often i think about streaming on twitch um so the question was how do i stay happy all the time nobody got my reference acting thank you um so um let me explain what this is is you might notice from the title over here this says marching squares cabana so while the oh i hear i hear people awake i hear footsteps the little pitter patter happy birthday i'm live streaming i think you know that already i mean that wasn't the dog and i'm waking people up um people still want me to actually there's no answer to how do i stay so motivated and happy i you know how i stay so motivated and happy it's people like you it brings me joy to share this stuff with the world with youtube with students with friends with colleagues um to discover to learn it it makes me happy i mean i have sadness in my life things are hard i think they're also you know i'm very lucky and privileged we don't need to get into all this why am i getting into all this but i i really honestly i mean that is a genuine answer um it's the the chance to share and be part of a community it's very hard these days to be so uh physically separated from that community um and it's and i'm lucky that i already have this thing set up where i can even though i'm just staring into like a camera in a room by myself with waking up my children who are sleeping and scouting get warm in here because i don't have the air conditioning i see thunderstorms coming i really like the rain in fact i'm kind of excited if it rains because it makes a lot of noise and i think that'll be an interesting um delightful sort of like background noise for this channel um okay cool cj says that uh answering questions and hanging out stream i by the way do you notice how i can't like seem to finish a thought it's a little bit of a a a characteristic of mine that just goes throughout my entire life but it's really really exaggerated or uh brought out by the sort of like live streaming of talking and looking at the chat and thinking about this i i'm going to get back to what i was actually talking about which is marching squares coding in the cabana video um that is coming out very soon um you can actually find almost all of the code for it um my one of my favorite examples is um uh i think it's this one let me just show it to you um which is using and let me actually draw more stuff i know i'm kind of you're not seeing the code but i can switch myself to over here oh come on uh oh okay banner i mean they're the sponsor they can have a banner um uh okay this is what i wanted to show this is the marching squares algorithm with a running with um with circles bouncing around the canvas um i ironically i didn't actually program this during the the cabana video i mean this example will be released and it uses the exact same algorithm just instead of running over noise it's running over these circles i think this is actually really a tremendous way of demonstrating it um it also is using interpolation so the actual marching squares contours are much smoother but there are just um so many um possibilities you can do with this algorithm that i think people will really um i can't wait to see your community contributions so you know even though the video probably won't be able to be released until next week i will have a quick members only preview basically my process is such when the video is done i order professional captions for it so it's closed captions while i'm waiting for the captions i release it for the members of the coding train and then once the captions come in and that sometimes can take up to three or four days hopefully it will be faster once the captions come in then i release it for the public so um anyway but the code is all available currently on so if you want to get a jump start on making um if you want to get a jump start on making your own version of it you can oh that's weird anyway there's a lot of the code examples are here in this github repo coding train slash marching cubes marching squares i have not done marching cubes though i need to come back and do that at some point um so check this out no i can't again not used to my buttons there we go uh check out this repo and you can start playing around with the code right now uh but let me uh if you want to know about the algorithm um this was my main reference so you can see j and i mention this and this will be in the video but it's jamie wong's article this is from 2014 that goes through the math for the algorithm and shows the um and actually implements this metabolism so i felt i wanted to try to do something different in the video which is why i chose to do it over simplex open simplex noise but the metaballs um way of visualizing the algorithm is quite fun and then the interpolation okay so but i do need another topic i should do a wheel spin for it today i'm obsessed with wheel spin um but i do need another topic for the next coding in the cabana video which is the whole point of me mentioning that was gonna be away in august is i'm gonna record a coding and fan a video before i leave and then actually i don't have to even i don't have a plan for what i'm doing in august so we'll see if i really go away but that's the goal um somewhere local that i can drive and still be uh safely socially distanced um with the family um but uh what was i saying ah i don't have a topic yet for that coding cabana video my idea was to do delani triangulation and i kind of like i have an example that i made years ago i could pull it up right now but i'm not going to um the problem is that i feel like i need a really long period of time i mean that's going to be at least an hour long video maybe people don't care and that like a really long coding cabana video would be enjoyable but i try to keep those to like 20 to 30 minute projects so um we'll see generative color gradients with noise i like that i i feel like though so one the one um thing that i i want to do something that's a bit more unique i feel like there's i mean everything's so interrelated but i feel like um there might be a lot of that um that is a little bit hey christian um k weekman is here um i feel like that is um perhaps uh a little redundant with a lot of the other videos that i made okay he's not looking on us i am looking at you except i can't see you i wish i could somebody will uh someday invent the cool magical thing where i can have this like giant screen behind the camera like sort of like a zoom brady bunch grid of everybody watching that would be wonderful sieve of era tostinis says sam hey sam thank you for your coding train membership it is highly appreciated i don't know if i ever gave you a random number when you join and why not now maybe it's the time the song i believe is a new member because the purple this dot icon is for a new member and for new members i like to assign you your own custom random number because i do have a million of them i don't have a million members i got a million subscribers though which is insane forty nine thousand and sixty there you go son are you programming today i don't i mean i i in theory yes all right because i think ah the only other thing i need to i wanted to mention and let me go to youtube dot com slash the coding train and i wanted to mention that i am uh starting a oh this one doesn't have closed captions i am uh starting a new guest conductor series i have had guest conductors um on the coding train before i never called them guest conductors that's just a new term for it i have a whole playlist of guests cj having been one of the guests um i am now featuring um black voices in tech as part of support for black lives matter uh the movement um and um uh aaron davey and nelson from amigos code were the first two uh guest conductors and a week from tomorrow it looks like if all goes according to plan um i will be bringing you uh the artist uh chrissy brimage who um i did um did not know of before a couple weeks ago when psy who is uh producing this series um sai coding train community managers producing this series uh introduced me to chrissy's work um and chrissy works with something called blender and does a lot of work with uh 3d uh models i think um i could scroll around and look at uh her website here um but um uh so we're gonna get a um a tutorial uh a brief tutorial and that's gonna be a week from tomorrow it's supposed to be tomorrow but my fault scheduling wise it didn't actually work out so a week from tomorrow will be a saturday morning uh with blender uh live stream so please tune in to that i'll also be doing a fundraiser i'm still working on setting that up so i will um announce that as well that will be a um fundraising live stream okay um simon has told me to look at the puzzle from yesterday uh oh uh oh okay are you gonna be around to help me when i get stuck all right all right let's get to some let's get to some coding why don't we okay so oh boy so there's going to be a lot of time if i if all goes according to plan actually let me uh it's fine i can just do this i i want to have a good system for um hiding my screen because if i'm going to do the youtube api i'm going to have to be really really careful i always try to be careful but with a lot of things i don't really care so much if things slip through i can regenerate or whatever but like things like my email my bank account my youtube channel um i really need to be careful with that so um austin is telling me to check up check out stand up math's most recent video for a topic for coding in the cabana okay uh stand up maths let's take a look is it this one the almost impossible chessboard puzzle or complex fibonacci numbers both of these look super interesting and i would love to watch them i love standup maths i hear little voices happy birthday to you happy birthday to you did you all notice the name of usain bolt's uh new daughter uh olympia lightning bolt isn't that an awesome name my daughter's name is olympia so that made me happy okay three blue one brown also the second most recent meant austin okay i'll take a look maybe there could be some nice visuals there complex fibonacci numbers okay um so um what i what i would like to sort of see um let's uh let's see what happens here is i want to just kind of jump right i literally have not looked at this in let's see what are the dates on this since may 29th is it it's like july now i like have not worked on this looked at this since may 29th i want to see if this still works um because i want to like see if i can um uh use the youtube api actually one of the reasons why i want to look at the youtube api is um violet who um helps me um i think violet uh is hopefully watching i thought violet in the chat at one point violet had a really exciting idea of some things we could try to do to celebrate the 1 million subscribers which i know happened a while ago but i'm just way behind on everything and so if i could possibly use the youtube api to get a list of all of the subscribers um usernames there might be like something we could do with that so that's one of the reasons why i wanted to look at the youtube api today um i want to be able to uh one of the ideas i have is to create an overlay that members names could sort of like pop up in like a thank you segment uh randomly um while i'm streaming i want to see if i can i know this is going to be like a big nightmare um and this is why i have twitch envy but i would love to be able to interact uh in real time with the youtube chat um right now i know i could do that with discord um so that's definitely a possibility um um one of the actually you know i do i i um i i wonder if i was thinking about the complex fibonacci series just remind me uh members in the discord remind me about i mean by the way the discord is open to the public anybody should remind me i just um we have a membersonly uh channel in there which is why i keep saying that um remind me about this uh fibonacci not the um the complex number thing because i have some thoughts on that um i wanted to ah be able to interact with the youtube chat because i think it would be fun for the youtube chat to be able to control the hue lights or to interact with an overlay or just like for me be to be able to like you know do stuff with that so um so that's kind of the plan so let me just at least see if this even works still um terminal no i term i i'm so uh yeah sure you can update oh i fixed this somebody and somebody gave me a really nice fix for this and i forgot the command i'm not going to worry about it right now um what am i looking for uh lights um all right let's just see i don't let's see if this still works oh yeah oh yeah it still works oh yeah a code i wrote a month ago still works i can't believe it i can't believe the code i wrote over a month ago so it works i haven't looked at it since that's amazing so oh and now i just want to do now i just want to like make this into a server and then have a p5 sketch that i can like set the light color let's just do that can we do that i know i said youtube api but i think this will be fun um let's do that simon uh wrote me a comment which i would say is exactly why i'm a little bit afraid of uh discord api straightforward twitch api a bit of a pain youtube api big painful nightmare okay let's take a look at this lights code because i don't even remember how it works um and let me get it into a place where you can see it um and this that fun i guess it's good to have a nice big uh font for you to be able to see so i'm loading the node a hue api i'm using dot uh um dot environment so i have environment variables like the username this is stuff that i want to keep secret um because it's like for it's it's how i'm actually accessing the hue lights and i think probably you wouldn't be able to you know even with the username like break into my local network here to control them well that would be exciting if somebody did and then i just call turn light on and run through this and it's just got a little loop to go through every possible hue um and set so let me see um how i feel like it should be not too difficult to turn this into a web server right if i just use x and i know i have a lot of people watching who know this stuff better than i do so because then i could just create a route where i can receive an rg and a b value and then i can have a i mean i probably would want to use web sockets to be controlling it in real time but that's more work for me right now so let me just try running uh making a quick express server i'm going to go to and i realize i'm kind of jumping in uh for any of anybody who's watching who's um maybe a a beginner with javascript maybe you've seen my p5 tutorials but haven't programmed uh in every node.js or on maybe the idea of server client is new to you i do i would suggest um i'm sort of searching for node web api coding train because yes this uh 8.1 intro to session 8 building an api in node this is probably um what i would suggest starting with um also the working with data and apis series i do go through actually i go through a lot of this in this series so i might actually suggest that so those are two these two series both cover a lot of the sort of stepbystep tutorial stuff for what i'm just gonna like play around with right now okay but let's go to uh node express and there must be just like a hello world example right um i mean i probably could figure this out without it but i just want like the like basic the basic example i guess i could just go to one of my examples let's do that intro data and apis uh no no yeah i guess i'm gonna have to say coding train because i'm not that actually this did come up it's kind of amazing that's a video of mine but this is what i'm looking for um let's go to module two i believe is the project i think the data selfie app will have what i need in it and i'm looking basically to do this i don't need the database though so i want to add in addition to be able to control hue lights um i want to create a express app i'm going to listen to port 3000 i'm going to serve a static directory and i am going to call public and i'm going to limit uploads to one megabyte unnecessary for what i'm doing right now but i'm going to leave that boilerplate stuff in there and then i just need one route i'll use a get um and let's uh let's put this i don't know really where it matters i'm gonna put this here i'm gonna call this uh that route to be uh hue and uh there's a request how do i get the like let's say i have my goal here is to have like r equals g equals like that's going to be is it request.params like are those the url our query arguments that come in are they dot params somebody will tell me um and uh respond oh boy there's some sort of crazy uh auto complete going on respond a thank you acting acting thank you okay uh oh that's i just wrote a i just made up a function in express you could just say respond nope response dot send i believe is what it is let's see if this works uh node oops index listening uh localhost 3000 slash hue acting thank you and request.query um let's see oh shoot it was empty first of all let me not while i'm testing let me not have this turn light on function called and so i'm being told it's request.query let's try that let me run the server again great empty now let me try a question mark r equals 255 and g equals zero and b equals zero perfect there we go so that came into the server so by the way if this is new to you this is how the web works i mean i'm not using rusty in routes here which is i could also pull information from a by having slash this and slash that and slash the other but um these are called uh query string arguments i think i'm basically passing named variables key value pairs to the server this way so now if i just put a little p5 sketch and this is my ridiculous way of creating a p5 sketch where i'm going to make a new folder i'm going to call it public um i'm going to make a new file i'm going to call it index.html i'm going to paste that in and then i'm going to make a new file i'm gonna call it sketch.js and i i mean i can uh and then uh where where where where where what am i doing oh i don't need the style sheet um and then sketch.js uh i gotta turn this off who who writes these web apis svg path seg line to horizontal abs i mean let's write a song we should have a song um uh we should have a song called uh svg svg path maybe i can get some music here line to the right hand on amazon that size create canvas uh 400 400 function draw oh i've got a real problem going on here uh how do i change this everything's fine now uh background uh now let's see if my so this is acting thank you and if i just go to localhost 3000 there we go i've got my p5 sketch great so what i want to be able to do eventually is click on this p5 sketch and click on a color and have that set my hue lights behind me oh interestingly how do i create how do you know in photoshop when you have these color pickers i mean i guess if i keep the saturation and brightness constant i could map all the hues over a grid um i guess i don't even i guess i could use i have two axes so i could map maybe should i map just like keep set maybe i'll keep saturation constant and i'll map hue and brightness um to x and y let's do that really quickly so let's just say in let's get rid of background let's say a color mode hsb and then i want to look at every x oh i gotta i gotta get rid of gotta turn that autocomplete off for the default stuff um i i've done that before i just forgotten how i got to do every y i'm not sure if we're getting to the youtube api folks but we will be taking a break in about 10 minutes this is actually going to go pretty fast i'm realizing the question is can i open this up to the public i could use like ngrok maybe and run the server right from here uh create color picker oh p5 has a create color picker function oh but that's so boring i want to make my own all right let's try it though create color picker what is that oh i've got an error oh extra curly bracket oh okay so let's do this now but can i get events off of this oh i guess i gotta look i did not know this was a thing in p5 amazing so create color picker color picker position color picker dot color all right let's definitely put this in can i get events like can i get a changed event um well let's let's do this oops okay background color picker oh so let's make that a variable color picker equals create color picker color picker dot color um i might need to turn the air conditioning on which will create a little bit of background noise but i think we'll be fine where are we here we are so if i now click here and i do this and what do i do oh oops if i do this i go here and i just click out of it cannot read property mode of undefined was this wrong i thought that's what the example said color picker color picker dot color all right didn't i just do this exact example oh what did i do wrong before what did i have wrong uh i wonder what i did wrong weird like oh because if i don't give it an initial color it fails you have to give it an initial color that's insane it should probably have a default color i would think but that's fine somebody can if i don't know what the world i don't know what the world of viewers of the coding train thinks but recently i you could consider that a bug perhaps let's give it a color let's just give it um uh that and let's see there we go and let's um let's make this i don't know why i feel like making the that's much too much i'm like crazy here this is so ridiculous what i'm doing okay so now oh there we go oh so it's okay awesome oh this is gonna be fun so now okay perfect so now um and let's can i get an event like color picker dot input um let's see if this works rather than having the draw loop yes okay so that's great so regular um kind of dom events there's input and there's change i'm going to use input and then i am going to say let's let me just use changed right now and see what that because that might only be when i like lift up the mouse oh that one doesn't or click yep so i'm going to do that just because i want to first get it to work kind of not in real time i don't know if i'm going to need web sockets for that oh this is awesome so now let me just see what that looks like console.log colorpicker.color and we'll just see where those rgb values are let me make this a little bit bigger for you i don't need the sound library let me just get rid of that okay so now i'm going to change it to this color and i get levels maxes array there's not like an r property i mean it's fine there's this object interesting are there functions like get red get blue i mean i guess i'll just use the array levels 0 1 2. all right oh but am i setting in my server the way i had it work was setting hue saturation brightness so i guess i will if i oh there's the children would like some breakfast they're not asking me but i i'm usually the breakfast cook i don't know if you can hear them through my mic here let's see if i change this to a color mode hsb uh it says rgb mode rgb how come it didn't change it to hsb and i assume by the way in the let me just look at the node hue api because i can probably just change this to uh red green blue that'll be easier uh node hue api i have to turn tell me if um let me know how bad that is sound wise i just turned the air conditioner on because it's very warm very very warm in this room okay is this the node hued api i'm using i think so and i am using a light state oops which is this thing and on white brightness saturation is there a saturation x y um anybody see here where i can set it as an rgb color i'm trying to think of what the like logical way for me to do this is apparently you can set the color picker mode to hsb how do i do that um light state value off brightness hue saturation x y well that's interesting color temperature effect color loop wow there's all these other things transition time fascinating uh rgb so rgb there we go we'll set an rgb value perfect so i can do rgb so this is what i'm going to uh set color um actually so i guess i want to do let me let me make some of this like init color um let me create a function just called init color and let me because i don't think i need to do this every time i change the light value so let's say let's call init color and i guess this this is a sort of silly way that i'm doing it but i want to have access to this api variable because then i can write a function called probably an async function called set color to an rgb value and then there i would do this state is new light state rgb rgb and so i want the light to be on and i suppose i'm oops on rgb and then set the state to that and then i don't i guess i don't need console.log light set to r g b okay so uh oh light id is how did i set that before light id did i just have that hardcoded i don't understand where that comes from oh i have it hardcoded okay great uh i could probably turn on like the noise filtering but i'm i'm not gonna bother with that right now i saw in the weather report that there's going to be thunderstorms all day long today but i don't know if um if um i know i don't is that tropical is i saw also in the news that there's a tropical storm like forming off the coast of north carolina one of those are related okay set color async function set color um so i think i'm good now i call init color and then uh when i get an um where is my route in the server what happened to that other code oh i have it up here um by the way so hue for hue light not for um so now i should have a um i should get i can get rgb um r g b and then i should be able to say set um and this can be an async function because then i can say await set color rgb and then i can say i'll just send back an object which sends back the r value just sends back i guess i can do something like status success and then send back the rgb values so let's see if this even works so now if i rerun this server and i go to here but i want to go to slash hue now i'm about to hit enter when i hit enter we should see the lights turn to red this is a good time to use this whenever i use the sound effect it inevitably means it's not gonna work that was so cool okay now let's change this to 150. okay it's hard for you to read these colors as being that different but let's make it this color there we go oh this is wild oh this is fun by the way i have a lamp here also that's changing color i could probably put that like in front of the camera for you to see it or like over here let's see there's a nice spot right here i could put a nice much brighter lamp would that be worthwhile let's see does anybody care i just want to make this as pleasant and exciting for you as possible and so let me unplug this oh lamp please don't knock things like i'm sort of at risk of spilling coffee all over my computer right now like what if i put this lamp here that's not good hi everybody do you see me uh i have my um ipad i'll move that with the music cues let's put the lamp here okay that's good that's good i know the light behind me changes but come on this is going to be much more dramatic and exciting where do i plug this in i don't have a plug if i really i'm going to put my fingers here i'm going to think really hard um where's that plugged into no is there oh there's a plug over here oh no extension cord i need a next do i have an extension cord this is going very well good planning every good planning good good good planning there is an extension cord there what's plugged into the extension cord uh currently plugged in oh no no no that extension cord i was about to go take an extension cord over there which is very very very very clearly what everything is plugged into including the computer that's allowing you to see me and listen to me right now okay um this this is this is something i can accomplish wait let's see if i put it over here it's going to be much closer to where the outlet is you can't i have an idea i can reach the outlet now okay so the light is plugged in you can't see it but if i move myself over there we go then i can put my ipad back don't spill the coffee spill no okay oh oh i just realized something this is not light id number five [Laughter] oh no i forgot that i had that hardcoded in can i guess which light it is uh where's the light id you know maybe it's six i guess it wasn't six oh this is such a fail there is no lag four it's not four how did i figure out what the different lights were how did i figure that out before i think i went to like a special like console um oh oh boy random lucky number seven lucky number seven all right i'll try lucky number seven who's it is july after all did it change oh i'm so sad all right i'm gonna uh when i take a break i will um go and look i think there's a thing that i can log into that has all the private information that will list all the different lights let me just put this down here for right now because i need to take a break in a minute no there's a hue lamp in the light it's all that let's just get this to work uh because i want to take a break and do the brilliant um the brilliant puzzle um so let's let's go back to five and let's get it to now from the p5 sketch i should be able to say let's go back and look at this pick a color and we're seeing the levels are i can get it out from the levels array so let's do that so um uh rgb equal this um let r equals rgb dot rgb dot levels index zero i don't know if there's a better way to do this but this is what i'm going to do then i need the g and the b one two uh then i'm going to say load json uh slash hue uh question mark r equals r and g equals g and b equals b okay and now uh and then i should say i should get a callback like uh color set and let's write that function separately um and let's just uh console.log the response okay let's see if this works oh that's um i always forget that i can do this so i think this is like that object destructuring sort of thing let's try this const and it doesn't have to be constant i'm very inconsistent about my use of uh equals rgb.levels does that work i love that if that works and in fact i can be even insaner if that's a word and just do this does this work does this work all right let's see okay we are gonna pick keep an eye on the lights behind me let's what color are they now they're green so let's get them to be a nice bright like pink i'm going to click here they're going to say my little hue light prayer say a little hugh light prayer ah why did they turn was that just an effect hold on i have to turn around and actually look at them that was exciting it worked um i saw them when i looked in the camera like they flashed white but i can't tell if that was just an artifact of yeah they flash they why did they flash a different color before they changed is that part of the hue behavior is that a bug in my code oh because i have the on so i should set the light on in init color so i should set it to be on here i can just do this so now if i rerun the server now it shouldn't do that i should be able to just say uh this no it's still flashed i assumed did i keep it in there by accident oh because it's a new light state no set light state no why does it flash huh i don't wonder why that is well let's um one thing i wanted to ch it works one thing i wanted to change is so clearly i can also do something here like this right this should work also boy my uh auto format is really really excited about putting the object properties on different lines there's something called transitions in the document yeah do i need to um let's look at that very briefly actually let's not look at that well let's look at that uh node hue api um light state oh wait but actually i wonder if well is that part of the light state transition time transition slow transition fast transition instant let's try that let's try uh does this how i would do it p5 what color are they now let's go to red oh yeah that worked transition instant so the setting the transit the default transition that's weird but it is what it is right no flash let me check perfect oh awesome okay so now i should be able to change this to let's see i mean again i think it probably makes more sense to use um to use what am i trying to say here uh websockets because if i want to have this sort of continuous connection where i'm kind of dragging the mouse around and setting a color but let's just see even if it works with a sort of like one user local server i'm going to change the event to input and now i'm looking looks like it's having a little trouble oh no no i'm just not in the ah it's like it's hard for me to tell if this is working yeah it's freaking out a little bit i think probably i need to do like web sockets or something but because um probably the requests aren't you know i probably shouldn't allow myself to send another request look it's just doing this continuously it's like behind maybe well this is crazy like it's sending so many requests okay time out so i got to put a limit on it uh i see that's why it's freaking out let's just see if i can i mean again web sockets would be the right thing here but i think what i could do is i could have a variable like next color is true so i'm only going to call load json if next color is true so i'm just going to use a little flag variable just really quickly and when i get a response i can set next color it's true but as soon as i'm gonna ask ask i'm gonna set next color is false so now i'm i'm kind of slowing down my calls to the server i'm only calling to the server when um one um when i get a response uh after i get a response back so let's see if this helps things yeah you can see the the console is not getting overloaded now yeah and it's it's working i just want to look at it in real life wow this is sort of totally fun um cool so now i have full control from p5.js but and obviously i should also um it would make much more sense for me to put this here and no need for a draw loop so now also you can see the color up top as i change it here it changes the hue lights and if i just knew what the light id was for this one it would also change yeah websockets keeps an open connection okay so yes the goal is to see if i can use the youtube api to control the lights we'll see um i'm going to take a break because want to tell you about the uh sponsor of the coding train uh brilliant well give me a moment here because i am the kind of person who super super prepares let's go to the website brilliant.org oh i definitely want to log in new computer good work everybody this is this is riveting um uh riveting live streaming getting all sorts of messages let me get my login for brilliant and here we go oh my god this password is insane i also uh okay i do use a password manager i the thing is this coding train log into this computer is new and i haven't installed everything so i just have to do everything with the most slow way possible see if that works and okay okay um save why not so simon is corner connection the one you're telling me to do i don't have the chat up anymore i'm such a mess here but everything is going to be fine in a second ah by the way a solar liner is telling me that i need to throttle request because there's rate limiting in the hue api side as well that's good to know um okay so let me tell you about brilliant for a moment so i talked at the beginning of the live stream about brilliant it's a site that i love um i'm always looking for inspiration for things to learn for material for my courses that i teach for coding challenges that i could do and brilliant is just like a treasure trove of this stuff so i know a lot of people are looking for online math and science resources right now and maybe you're a student looking to uh or a professional brushing up on cuttingedge topics or maybe you just want to understand the world better check out brilliant so you can add some learning structure to your day you can set a goal and you can just do a little bit every day because it has these like wonderful interactive challenges and courses um it's a so it's a it's a it's a problem solving based website with a handson approach there's over 60 interactive courses in math science and computer science the puzzles will surprise you and expand your understanding of the modern world and all of brilliance courses have storytelling code writing interactive challenges and problems to solve so a couple courses that i would really recommend you check out um one is the brilliant neural network course you can see this interactive uh essay in a sense of like explaining how neural networks work where you can sort of like draw and watch the weights and connections actively change through this mnist digit recognition example i mean this is like this is actually also like for me when i see stuff like this i think like oh wow this would be a wonderful thing to learn how to program in processing or p5.js like could i create this kind of interactive demonstration on my own um another course that i think people would be really interested in is is the programming course and it's in python so you know on on coding train i don't really program in python except on very very rare occasions but one of the most frequently asked questions in the comments is where can i learn python and so um i've been kind of going through this course and really enjoying it you can see how like you can actually just write code right there in the lessons and it has written explanations and checkpoints and all that stuff so um take a look at those courses you can sign up for free right now and the daily puzzles available to you but if you want to get um full access to everything in brilliant um you can sign up for a premium subscription and if you go to let me come back to here with uh whoops um this oh nope here with this brilliant.org coding train um you will uh get the first 200 people to sign up will get 20 off of a premium subscription you can also say i have premium one of the nice things you can do is you can i you know what's a good birthday present for my daughter who's nine uh she can use my premium account to be frank but if i wanted it to give it to somebody who wasn't in my immediate family i would i would gift them this account maybe maybe she should have her own account because she's but you know she's young i don't know if she's using computer anyway i don't need to figure out what i'm what i'm buying her as a present today but uh brilliant.org is a great present for a friend or family member who's uh interested in learning okay um it's a it's the a surprising shortcut one oh that's today's puzzle i want to do this one because um toggle tags puzzles are solved with logic all right let me look at this one because simon really wants me to do it if you've ever watched a duck swim furiously upriver without appearing to move or a seagull fly directly into a gale without getting anywhere you already have an idea about the relative velocity oh velocity that's the thing that i i do on the coding train relative to you the duck or the gull doesn't seem to move very much at all right relativity but relative to the water air they're moving pretty quickly which viewpoint is the right one are they moving stationary doesn't even matter okay i'm not going to do a dramatic reading of all of this simon you're going to help me right see this is what i love all these like interactive okay so i see reference for the water swim speed water frame um okay oh whoa look at this flowfield see all this is so connected hi austin wow austin i've not seen you in a very long time welcome um small fairy boat oh i have no it takes hikers between two points on opposite banks of a swiftly flowing river the current is the fastest in the center i don't know if i totally understand this and gradually become slower near the edges the decrease on either side is symmetric about the center of the river so that means the current so the the i've i assume this isn't the correct answer because i'm sort of because it seems like well wouldn't it just be fastest if you stay c the center of the whole time if you want to get across the fastest to minimize the time of the trip variety different routes the speed of the boat relative to the water is constant oh but the angle that the boat makes with the current varies the ferry operator finds that for the current this one's hard it's got three difficulty spikes i don't understand this one the ferry operator finds that for the current today one of the routes shown above is faster than all the other routes which of these routes gets the boats across the river in the least time all right maybe we can do phone a friend here i think i'm missing a key element of the challenge because why wouldn't it just be fastest going directly across if the current is fastest in the center and what's the difference between a and d because those look symmetric oh the current is pointing down oh i see the cr the center is over here i'm fundamentally misunderstanding this completely got it so now my intuition is is telling me that it certainly wouldn't be d we can eliminate d right so then take us way out of the way we can eliminate c unless we can't really eliminate c could that still be the best but you know intuition is saying something about a do you not or do you not want to go against the current so actually we can't eliminate d because d is going to allow us to go with the current to increase our velocity can i write a simulation i do a simulation of this i honestly have no idea what the answer is and i'm very tempted to just click on the explanations but i'm going to happily get this i'm going to happily be willing to get this one wrong think brackets decrone i don't even know what that is brackish stock oh back a stroke chrome curve in mathematics and physics a brackish stone code curve from the ancient greek brachistos chronos meaning shortest time is the curve of fastest descent is the one lying on the plane between point a and a lower point b where b is not directly oh below a on a bead which slides frictionally okay so it's a cycloid oh yeah so we want to go fastest at the beginning okay this would lead me to believe based on this this is really cool so this is definitely something i would love to create a p5 sketch to simulate this would lead me to believe d is the answer brachy stone brachiostur crone i thought that was a dinosaur broccoli brachisto chrome dinosaur no it's a good dinosaur okay brachiosaur that's a dinosaur right brachiosaurus yeah it's kind of got like a bra is that connected because it's curve is like that am i just totally imagining this there's an excellent youtube video by vsauce on the brackets to chrome curve bracket chrome vsauce okay i'm not going to watch this right now but i definitely want to do this as a p5 uh oh and look it's even got um uh with don't troy with uh adam savage they built one this is so i can't believe i don't know about this this is wild and i see a three blue one brown video about this i i really all right so let's just go with d and hit submit okay oh explanation i was wrong so b will waste time the beginning because it's moving a i'm so confused i'm so confused your animation is wrong wait what happened here where am i the answer is a so i just was thinking about it i i those diagrams tricked me but that it's like gravity pointing down the current all right let's look at i don't i don't know that this explanation is correct everybody's discussing it let's keep going okay to visualize i use desmos to make up functions these are the trajectories of the four roots defined by color this is the force of the current in the function the x position of the ferry consider there's no current the ferries still behave the same way then subtract the four trajectories from that function the blue curve is actually a straight line this means by using the blue route a the fair uses the strategy of constantly orienting the same way the second explanation after this one is just so amazing the second hint is that the current is not the same gradient as the river current um interesting falls a straight path until it turns right right i yeah it's got a turn it's got to turn and then go against the current i see so a it gets all of this speed and then just really like goes up to be able to like maximize the current right here that sort of is my intuition all right um if anybody so first of all you can submit your own explanation here if anybody i i'm looking at you simon anybody else wants to make a p5 demonstration of this using like my nature of code examples um i would love to see that and there's i think people are in the chat or really discussing this in an amazing way so simon's about to tell me which explanation he's talking about but i want to go and just do the other challenge because let's take a look at it let's try one more although i should probably keep moving on but i want to see if i have another chance to get one right because this one how many how many daggers two this is my level i'm at level two okay um toggle tags puzzles provide a list of constraints that the characters in the puzzle need to satisfy read on for some examples or jump straight to the puzzle below okay so five friends ivy j kurt larmor i've gone out to a game together so there's an even number of purple caps so you all of these conditions have to be met sorry you might not be able to see this all these conditions happen to be met so um like if kurt is wearing a purple cap then i have to click on curt i can't click on cur oh right but it's now showing me it's stepping me through okay all right let's just go to the uh then there's let's go to let's go to the puzzle okay in this challenge you need to determine the contents of each treasure chest as well as whether each chest is labeled with the true or false statement each chest has a statement written on it one of the four statements is false and the other three are true so i have to pick false for one of them and the other true the chest that contains only gold coins is labeled with a true statement so if this one is true it can't this one can't be this right this one can be true um okay so exactly one chest contains each of the following ah so these are unique the true and false labels are accurate given what well of course uh given with the same equines okay so let's just try sorting this out what can i use first the chest that contains only gold coins is labeled with a true statement so which ones chest a contains a mix of gold and silver coins oh oh how many solutions does this puzzle have okay oh this is tricky um okay i'm a little bit lost here one of the four statements is false the other okay so let's see let's just figure out let's say this one is false that means these have to be true okay i'm just going to go through these ones i'm using the brute force method so if this is true then this chest contains no gold coins that's false so it has it has to be either the mix or this and if this is true chest a contains a mix then it has to be the mix okay this chest contains no gold coins is true so it can be the silver or the rock oh but this contains the nope so this one cannot be the false already uh if that's the false then this has to be the mix so uh this cannot be the fault so this one has to be true so let's say this one is the false well this contains the that can't be so if this is true this has to be false so this is true this so this has to be the false one i figured out the true and false this is the only possible this is the only possible scenario so now if this is true uh then this has to be this oh but it contains no gold coins so if this is true and this is true no one of these has to be false i i think the answer is going to be did i make a mistake here b people are saying b is false all right so these camp so first of all these both these both can't be true right it can't be that this contains no gold coins and this contain and we're saying that chest a contains a mix of gold and silver so one of these has to be false we already already said if this one is false there's no possible solution what if this one is false chest a contains a mix okay let's try it contains no gold coins so this could be either the silver coins or the rocks but these are true so this also has no gold so this one has to so either this has to be the silver or this must be the silver so this contains this one has to be a mix this can't be the mix so this could be all gold no gold the chest that contains only gold coins is labeled with a true statement no i i it's got to be zero i mean i'm maybe i didn't go through this as thoroughly as i needed to let's see if i can get one right today i'm going with zero ah i got it right there is only one chest with the false statement reading the statements of chess c and d it is clear that only one of them can be true didn't i say that about a and d well right that's also true anyway i got it right [Laughter] thank you everybody all right i got to take a short break i said i was only going to go until 10. but um what time is it now it is 9 30. so let me we're going to think i'm going to take a short break um you know if you want to sign up for brilliant.org go to brilliant. if you want to sign up for brilliant go to brilliant.org codingtrain um you can do that while i take a short break here um and um you know you could put your own answer or explanation to any of these and tweet it at me at shiffman i'd love to see it especially if you make a p5 version of either of them yeah i will go let's try to get back let's see if we can get the youtube api working before i go um and uh what was it gonna say that's what i'll do when i come back and take after a break um yeah so sign up uh and you may have your breakfast um the chat something in the chat is telling me that video and voice is so delayed i don't know let me know if that's true for everyone um and i'm just gonna be doing a little like comment moderation here come on people uh thank you austin who got to it before i could um and um yeah so uh intermission starting now about five minutes everybody so do do do do do do hi everyone just a couple more minutes i'm trying to find the hue light for that lamp id so i'm still trying to find it i really want to find it it's coming i'm working on it uh okay here we go i think sensors lights let's see i can show you what i'm doing in a second here i've ah i've got it i've got it dimmable 18. i've got all the numbers hallway gotta find so close so close i'm looking through all the lights a little more music here here we go hold on this is me this is my intense concentration music i guess i can put my camera on i'm just i'm finding the id for this lamp just give me a minute here if i look at my q what's the other one id number two all right everybody welcome back uh thank you for sticking with me here thank you to brilliant for their sponsorship of the coding train if we uh go to light id number two and by the way what i did is this is a function which uh i can just go to api.configurationgetall and then this will list every bit of information about all of the lights and i just looked up the id i i don't i'm just a little bit worried there's some private information in there there probably isn't um that's why i'm not showing it to you but i'm going to comment this out now and and they're there already you just saw a little bit of the of it i don't think there's anything in there um okay um there's the that's the local ip address of the light which i don't th of the bridge which i don't think will give you any information and now we're going to go to localhost 3000 and there we go gloria come here come here come here can you guys see her come on up can you just say hi there she is there's a little dog dog good girl i know you want to go for a walk we'll go for a walk soon okay i have to take her for a walk hopefully it's not gonna thunderstorm okay i already took her i took her at 6am this morning so it's about time getting close okay this is working it's not nearly as exciting as i thought it would be because this light isn't really showing up i can't get the uh i could as much as i thought it would be let's just let's just see if i can get both um so what would i do if i want to do light id2 uh what if i do this light ids ids2 and 5 let's just adjust the code to light state well i'm going to be and then i can do uh let i equal zero i is less than light ids dot length i plus plus i'm sure there's a nice four each or four of loop that i could use and then we could say light ids index i and let's see what happens here now are they doing both of them well what happened to the other one um what happened to the other one light ids length oh i didn't restart the server i forgot i'm not using nodemon there's a there's a node module called nodemon or node monitor which will restart the server light id is not defined uh where's that light ids light ids ids let's be lazy about this here oh no let's let's let's do it correctly let's do the same thing to turn the both on uh light ids index i all right come on everybody here we go very exciting moment here on the coding train now interesting there's a little bit of a delay right because it takes a minute to do it takes a millisecond to do one or the other what's cool is um what you can't see it's like it's also changing on my phone uh you can't really see that but like the app is like actually active there you go uh if i go like to like a dark blue see dark blue all the way to a red that's kind of cool and it's doing that too okay so the goal for today was maybe to actually get the youtube api to also control the lights um i think i'm going to allow myself to go to 10 30. um let me just send a little text to my um i wanted to also make a special like birthday i'm just not gonna get to that um but let's just see if i can at least get a kind of hello world thing going if i go back to my um todo list here and i've got another one or two more live streams in me this month so i feel like i feel good about where i am with the hue lights for my projects um i want to do more with gpt2 the twitter bot stuff is on this list as well although that's really going to come in the fall but there's plenty more i could do with the discord bot stuff but um i let's see if at a minimum i can get started with looking at the youtube api today and again this there's this is a major problem with me doing this in a live stream which is that i'm at serious risk of exposing some kind of um private key to communicate with youtube and do things like just like delete every video on my channel so i hope that no one watching would do that but i know that the internet is a scary and treacherous place so i'm gonna be really careful and try and in many cases just keep you in this view but um let's see how this goes so i have never used i don't know that's not entirely true uh i haven't anytime recently looked at the youtube api so this i'm really doing this fresh i mean one thing i could do is i could use a different youtube channel to experiment that's what i should do um cj you wanna let me use your channel no i'm just kidding so i wonder if i could create a channel under this google account which is just like it let's try that because i'm logged into the google account associated with daniel at thecodingtrain.com which is an email address you can use to reach me although i barely ever read those emails uh try info at thecodingtrade.com because that's read by other people who work on the coding train um second account another bus so let's see what happens if i just go to youtube right now like do i have a channel with this account it's funny i have premium with this account which is sort of funny but now i'm just realizing i have two youtube premium accounts but this is not like i'm subscribed this is i'm not the coach so this is good so let's see uh i do have a channel if i go to youtube okay hold on is this account a manager no perfect okay so i can freely show this to you because this is youtube studio this is a channel that has no as one subscriber and no videos let's go under videos no videos perfect so this is what i'm going to do this is much lower risk i'm going to and i could probably am i able to live stream from this channel probably not i probably haven't done enough to is it live streaming get started all right let's verify my account i'm text i'm going to run a like a simultaneous live stream from the webcam text me the verification code i'm putting in my phone number oh my god i just couldn't see it so not revealing my phone number this is good i'm getting the verification code hopefully got it submit okay my youtube account is now verified i'm going back to live streaming get started i mean i don't know okay oh ready and want whomp uh ready in 24 hours all right what if i so i won't be able to interact with a live chat today but that's fine i just want to get the basics maybe i should like upload at least one video so what i can do is open up like quicktime i mean i have open broadcast studio but let me just do it this way do movie recording we could try like the tom scott thing like oh my god i look terrifying um we could try the thing where uh we like based on the view count change the title or like comments or something so um let's see okay all right um all right okay let's record uh let's uh hello let's just use the microphone hello i don't know why there's no oh this is hello i don't know why there's no audio but i don't care oh and it just froze there we go now there's audio okay hello oh why am i getting audio feedback in my ear let's try this again hello hello okay better hello welcome to a test video no this is the camera hello and welcome to a test video now it's last chance gotta get this right hello and welcome to oh where's my train whistle shoot maybe i'll just read random numbers in this video where'd i put all that stuff this is how it goes on the coding train it takes me like an hour just to uh record my test video oh here it is i don't know where the whistle is though i lost the whistle here we go this is the last time i'm doing this all right comment yeah okay hello welcome to the first video ever on the coding train random number channel in this video i will read you a random number forty seven thousand five hundred and five thanks for watching everybody uh okay let's see do i need to trim off the beginning here all right let's play this oh the all right i can't do that one more time i'm like upset but what if this video like takes off in some weird way uh yes no these are these are that's not the official coding train train whistle that i use to make sound these are just uh test whistles for as member rewards but i lost access to my laser cutter so i can't make that all right we're going to do this one more time now that i've rehearsed this close anyway delete cancel delete this is ridiculou this is the most insane thing that i've ever done why am i paying so much attention to this okay okay here we go hello and welcome to the coding train random number channel in today's video i bring you the random number 14 622 thanks for watching everybody all right that was much better let me just trim out the beginning okay now we save this video um and now we will go to um studio and we're going to upload this video uh where did i where did i save that here we go oh can i just drag it can i select it i don't know what's going on here okay we're uploading this video and we're calling this uh i forgot what the random number was but whatever uh this is a test uh next is not made for kids i guess next next publish public publish okay uh now we should be able to go to here and uh watch this video hello and welcome to the coding training all right so if people want to try to find this video you can find it uh here um and uh this is actually this is what i want to do i mean i'm not i've got just a half an hour left here i've really got to go at 10 30. um um but um what i would like to do is uh i could like auto upload videos for every random number in the book i'd have a million videos each just with me reading that there's a lot of really awesome popul possibilities here okay oh i forgot about the community contributions oh i'm the worst i'm the worst i'm the worst i'm the worst i'm the worst or maybe i'll do that at the end just as a quick um quick um quick thing to celebrate the end of this live stream okay so now youtube api node.js okay so use this wizard to create or select a project in the google's developer console so next live stream i'll be able to like play with the chat um and uh let's see i have read and agreed uh okay i read these before because i i've read these before agree and continue oh a new project named my project but what if i want to name it hello enabling api sorry okay uh select a project my project can i please make a new project i'll just fine that's fine can i rename the project it bothers me that it's called um called my project new project coding coding train test create okay and um all right now continue ooh free trial is waiting activate now to get 300 credit to explore google cloud products okay go to credentials so this is definitely the danger zone here for me to be like but i'm totally much less worried about it now i mean obviously people can wreak havoc on that channel but so let me just before i click go to credentials let me switch to here um okay doesn't look like anything yet that is i need to be worried about so find out what kind of credentials you need so i definitely want the youtube data api all right fine where will i be calling the api from web browser web server let's go with web server i mean i might like to do it from web browser but let's go with web server right now what data will be will you be accessing public data so this could be oops this could certainly be what i start with just public data but let's do the user data because ultimately i'm really going to want my specific user data um get your credentials what credentials do i need set up oauth consent screen okay boy what a pain this is so let's do this um oauth consent screen choose how you want to configure and register your app including your target users you can only associate one app with your project all right let's do this right now this will help so one of the advantages of me doing this which i really should switch my channel to this is i have a g suite the codingtrain.com organization the actual channel is just under one of my other google accounts but i think this will help me be protected because if i keep it with internal i guess that's what i'm guessing okay so let me hit create here oh my god this is seriously uh the coding train test is it going to make me do internal that's fine scope email profile ad scope do i need more scope i want youtube is that a scope yeah so i want youtube data i think i want all of this upload i'm going to select all the youtube stuff add okay add all the youtube stuff your current per minute token grant rate limit is 100 grants per minute okay that this seems fine i guess i'll use the defaults authorized domains uh that's probably something i should use uh let's just do save i'm gonna hit save anybody have any don't show your api key yeah yeah i know um okay okay got it this should be good let's go to credentials now create connection so this is definitely where uh let's see uh add credentials at the top of the page and select an email address enter a product name select create credentials select oauth client id select the application type other enter the name youtube data start api quick start okay download so i'm going to do this i'm going to follow these steps but i'm going to ver follow these steps just in this view i mean i'm still protecting the api key but i'm not as worried about it um so um i'm going to read to you what i'm doing add credentials select oauth consent screen oauth client id okay name uh enter the name youtube data api quickstart so let me do that so i did that and then what else does it want me to do select the application type other and click ok don't see that but um hmm i know maybe i'm going to need some help here uh highly recommend corey schaefer's video he made a really good video about this schaefer youtube i don't know why my caps lock is on python youtube api getting started okay i'm going to take a look at this uh thank you um but what i'm confused about here is i'm adding credentials to my i did that create a oauth i just refresh i don't know like maybe i need to hit refresh oh okay create okay great oh there we go client id uh uh there there's there there's this secret one that's great that i'm showing this to you let me let me regenerate it i'm sure there's i'm going to delete this one i'm trashing that one maybe you got it fast but i now deleted it and then i'm going to do create credentials again oauth client id uh web application uh youtube data quick start api create and now i've got it and uh what i'm gonna do okay so you can't i'm gonna i'm happily gonna bring this back because you can't see the full thing and i'm also gonna hit download here so this is what's important i think there's there's the client id there's also the client secret so even with the id you wouldn't be able to hack into the channel but i'm gonna click download so now everything in this file clientsecret.json i definitely [Laughter] i definitely don't want you to see it let's trash this one i don't know what just showed up on preview there but let's delete it and i'm going to make another one i'm going to make another one and download it without showing you okay boy this is very challenging create cadentials oauth client id uh i'm going to say web application uh youtube data api quick start create uh okay download i now have that file which i am going to really really attempt to not show you and i'm going to close this so hopefully now i have my file so i should be able to create a new project just calling this youtube api test and i'm going to go into that let's make a node project and let's follow these instructions so npm install google apis i don't you don't need the save anymore um okay and npm install google auth library um then i want to hopefully uh without showing you i want to um let me just let me deal with this client secret file so i've got my client secret file in the youtube api test so just to show you i have the client secret in this file clientsecret.json which i will not be showing you i am now going to um here uh open up the code and not click on client secret and not click on client secret but just to be sure i'm going to go back to here i'm going to create a new file called index.js which that is the file i'm editing not client secret not client secret not client secret now let's go i don't know let's just copy paste all of this oh my god seriously this is the quick start it's a lot of code here let's copy all this well i'm going to have to really parse through this to understand it better um i think this i'm having a real hard time reading my code with the font this big so let's go to like 28 which i think this is still plenty big for people to see but it's gonna be a lot easier for me to look at right now um so i don't know i'm just gonna try running this client secret credentials installed client secret so how come i didn't get that where is it trying to get it from where is it loading it credentials oh read file client secret.json isn't that right though client underscore secret why would this not have worked i've got everything here this hold on let's let's comment out let's um content well i don't want to console log the content because then you're going to see it is there a directory that it's like reading oh token directory token path youtube node.js quickstart.what but all i'm trying to read is this file right now like i know dot credentials hold on let's just make sure it's reading the file okay it's reading the file file so it's something oh so youtubenow.jsquickstart.json and you need a dot credentials folder there's i must have missed a step if modifying these scopes delete your previously saved credentials at dot credentials how come i don't have this file authorize read file token path what did i miss um there's someone's uh maida oh cj is telling me i made a writeup of how to get live chat messages i do not use the google npm module just http requests oh that's cool for me to see okay so i will look at that later but i'm going to um i want to get this working but i'm confused why what it doesn't explain what this file is and why there's a dot credentials store i mean i got an error let's try this bummer i thought maybe it would like say what some of the common errors are i just i'm so confused um nobody is telling me is there a download there is a download but it's just this file it's just this file api samples but like what is this file it's not i don't understand what this file is i mean it's going to create this right it should be creating that file let's see what the actual error message i got is i didn't look at it too closely so let me put this back in cannot read property client secret of undefined index line 33 okay so let's actually authorize oh okay so that all right there's something wrong with the file okay um let me um let me go back to here and i'm going to look at that file client secret client id oh it's under web so i think the file is formatted differently than the tutorial that's what it is credentials so hold on i i know what to do here this is super annoying because the the example is out of date and i can't show it to you without yeah so it's not credentials dot installed client secret it's credentials.web.clientsecret um so the example is wrong and i just need to make sure i don't show any of this again so let me go back to here it should be credentials.web web and web i think there's a redirect i didn't actually check hold on back to here let me look at client.secret again web what what is this one looking for it's looking for web dot redirect uris and i do not have that i didn't set one up so maybe it won't care let's see if it doesn't care like this is no so and let me close this oh the rain is starting okay so uh what i did here we're gonna see if this fixes it is it's actually stored um in the file under dot web um i could read i could have renamed the json file but i'm reading and then i'm just i don't have a redirect so i'm going to see what happens if that's left undefined and then cj is also telling me that the method does not require oauth and just requires an api key which i like so i probably should have looked at that in advance and maybe i could uh go look at that but but now that i've got not very much time left let me um and i haven't even i didn't get to making a parrot p5 sketch maybe i'll maybe i will though really quickly before i go let me just see what happens here token path is not defined oh i why did i uncomment these okay uh authorize at this url missing required parameter redirect uri what can i just make that the codingtrain.com um so can i just make this can i just do that redirect uri mismatch does not match the one all right so i've got to go actually add that in wow this is crazy um where was i console um let me just go back to here for a second wow this is what a nightmare uh so if i go back to this one um and i am adding a redirect uri which is just the codingtrain.com so just so you see i i can't show this to you because it's got the client id and the client secret on this page but i'm just going to show you very briefly what i'm doing so i'm adding an authorized redirect uri here and hoping that that does the trick oh no okay so hopefully that does the trick um and let me go back to um and close this page and let me go back to the code uh this is so sad the redirect uri in the request does not match the ones authorized to update the authorized redirect uris let me go here and go directly to this link it's there it's an authorized redirect uri look there it is it's there like does it want me to have one that's like without that of course now i have both of them you're using the wrong o auth flow you're currently using the one that expects a user to sign into google account the redirect url sends the verification code to your server and the server oh you need to redirect to localhost blah blah whatever okay hmm oh i see maybe i need to actually do something for real it can't contain url fragments relative paths or wild cards and can't be a public ip address to this path so it needs to be a path to the server if you just want the youtube api you don't need oauth and i guess that's what i'm learning it needs to be a url from which the request is made so so it just could be like in other words it should just be something like like this is this right now or it has to be localhost is what a 60 is telling me remove the last slash oh oh must be http or https okay let's just try this then let's try adding this as well and see what happens okay so let's see if this if without the slash if that fixes it i know i'd ah okay this will allow the coding train test to view your youtube account you may be sharing sensitive info with this cyber app or with the people watching that i don't know who they are okay allow oh it just redirected me to here okay perfect that's what i wanted it to do and i could get all this nonsense stuff which probably now i'm exposing to you in a way that i shouldn't whatever good luck to you oh enter the code from the page here uh how come it didn't give me the code try that again don't i get a code don't i get a code where's my code allow is it up in the um hold on allow the oh here's the code i've got the code i'm just not going to show it to you got it i've got it in the url so there we go and now i'm going to enter that code here i'm not showing this to you i'm entering the code token stored um oh this is funny it it actually like the channel it's using is google developers that's funny so i just want to um i want to show you the code so hold on a sec just give me a second so what it did is it actually worked the token was stored to this uh project am i not on the desktop that's weird or just put it there and then the the thing is it's like using the google developers channel so i think i need to change the channel id but this was good enough i've authenticated so what do i do now i have my token was this just to get a token and now oh and now i got stuff i did a call channels list for username snippet content detail statistics so this is like now i have this off now can i can i just do something now to load that token every time right i don't need to go through this so what do i do now um got people are um what do i do now basically what your um channel id yeah thank you around thing who posted that um but it was not able to be shown um all right let me look at back at the instructions run the sample okay it worked except i had to change something okay notes authorized information is stored in the file system so subsequent executions will not prompt for authorization oh so if i do this again if i run this again it's it's just gonna work ah perfect okay the code example is built to know okay great okay we're good everybody um now what i'm going to do i just i just want to get my channel so i should be able to just the authorized stuff is done doesn't need a token get channel where is get channel being called here so once it reads the file and authorizes it goes to get channel so this i can call just like i'm going to call this like do stuff and i'm going to call this uh get channel do stuff um and we're i'm gonna return to this in a future live stream let's just see if i can get four service search so i'm service google youtube so now this this is where i need to look at the api docs because i want to do other stuff here so where are those docs look yeah yeah i got that okay um 1033 google api so data api reference documentation so i should be able to do all this stuff now right delete download insert list so members i just want to get the that's actually one of the things i want to do is get members search subscriptions like how videos list let me just see if i can get that video list by video id so v3 service oh but i'm using the official this is weird i just i just wanna i could just like request stuff using a get request which is what i want to do all right let's just see what is the package i'm using google apis does that have documentation i think maybe cj might be right in that it makes more sense for me to like just use requests but specifying request body i'm so confused i'm so confused google youtube so can i call service.videos is that what i want to do if i'm like here list by video id try this api but uh all right list by video id and the video id is that's the video id auth part 4 username so i don't want for user name i want part id right id this okay and then console log respon let's see videos let's call this videos no video found and let's just console log uh videos let's see if this works yeah i think i would prefer to do this honestly with just like fetch because this is really confusing me but i'm i'm curious to see what happens here oh yeah look at that okay so that worked this is the video right channel id title descriptions right this is that video duration license content view count like count okay we're getting somewhere i just want to get okay this is pretty good now can i like do i have permission to like change its i'm just doing the tom scott thing now because that's all i can think of can i set something how do i video insert update i need to do a put what off youtube partner do i have these scopes i think i have these scopes set request body snippet set values for these properties snippet.title try it i can't do that so what i want to do is set the snippet.title is that what i want to do and execute no ah i don't know call show code part equals snippet.title author yeah this would be so much easier based on what i'm seeing here to just use and this is using something else this is like is there a node one here there's no node one all right i'm gonna have to i'm gonna i really probably need to investigate this i'm going to need to investigate this i can set values specify a value and how do i set i don't know how to use a put with this service videos list but i'm not on list i'm on yeah i am on update service videos update can i just call service videos update and the id part like what happens if i just call update i'm just curious insufficient permission well all right um all right everybody uh if you want a quick win you can make a get request to that last url i shared to get the latest live messages i don't know what that means uh la oh but oh this is just like okay i see oh and my api key uh add my api key i'm live streaming you know okay i'm trying to finish up okay i gotta finish up everybody um where do i get my api key uh so your api key is in my client secret or in that credentials quick start i'm going to use your script the problem is i need to get it can you put that in a um let me go to cj's gists all right we're going to try to get a quick win here using cj's for cj's help uh w3 cj look at this okay uh request a list of live events okay and then use the video id to request live streaming details oh you've actually put this in here already request live chat messages using this active live id oh my god i'm terrified here um so which one is it this one um next page let's try this okay so this is the url i want but i need an api key so i must have an api key somewhere i have so many credentials i'm overflowing with credentials where do i find it let me go to my console hold on everybody i'm going back to my console and going to my credentials api key i can create one okay i'm creating i'm creating an api key got it i got one okay uh restrict your key to prevent author unauthorized use ah let's not restrict it i'll just delete it eventually okay so now i'm gonna put it in ah look at this it's working it's working okay thank you cj i'm gonna put this into my hue light code okay so we're gonna use node we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna speed through this i'm going back to the hue light thing uh where's my hue light so um what i'm going to do in this is i'm going to write a function pull youtube and i'm going to uh hold on everybody um i'm going to put my api key in my env file so just give me a second okay so now that's in dot env so um so uh process.env dot i forgot what i called it youtube api i think that's what i called it so i've got my api key oh whoops um and um then i just need to get cj's oh no that's fine you might have seen some i ah it's got a dot dot dot in there i don't think you could get it this is the url that i want copy link address it's so hard to do this url equals and then uh api key so that's that what did i call it all right fine we'll make it capital and i just want to make sure it's called in uh dot env it's called yt api it is okay we're getting close to getting a win here um so now what i will do is i need to use node fetch right node fetch i feel like that's a thing i use um write node fetch okay yeah what will it okay i can use native prime i think this will work so uh mpm oh hey hold on npm install node fetch and then we're going to require it let's just um and then i'm going to say response equals await fetch url json await response.json console.log json so this should give me a bunch of recent uh chat messages i really gotta go here i can't believe i i just like can't stop live streaming i have a problem we're just gonna get the lights to respond to one chat message and then like leave in a blaze of glory did i not call poll youtube and also why does it keep console logging yeah that ip address i don't we let's not worry about the color just pull youtube cannot access fetch before initialization oh silly me all right live chat messages happening use like dislike ratio to control the brightness oh so ah i would gladly if somebody because i'm really trying to like what would be my um what would be the url for getting likes to likes to for brightness um so i'm just going to look for i'm going to look for numbers let me just go with this chat message i like the idea if somebody can quickly create what the um url call is for like likes and dislikes of this video that would actually be awesome um uh yeah the air conditioner went off uh it's set to go off when it reaches a certain temperature so if i just look at these messages there i guess there's probably it's probably under items kind items and snippet is probably where so let me just see um this is high risk here but um let me say console.log items uh index zero uh dot uh snippet so let's see what happens here display message did somebody write this as the message yeah who is cj great okay so i'm just gonna look for any messages that have that have a number in it um and that'll be the hue i'll set that to the hue so i'm gonna now look through um let let me just iterate through all the messages so let's just do let messages equal json.items and let's let's go through all of the messages um and then i'm going to say console.log no no so let txt equal messages dot uh uh index i dot snippet dot display message i think is fine right yeah display message i'm going to say dot trim just to trim any white space and then if um like i can quickly write a regular expression like uh dash like uh three digits uh one to three digits dot uh exec is that no or match like is it like this like um test i think i think this is ah hold on ah help get me out of this um like if i have a string and if i say s1 dot test isn't that um that's not a oh the regular expression you tested on the string that's it okay so i can say if te uh if if i get a digit but one to three digits so a value between 0 and 255 loosely uh dot test text then um val equals let me convert that to a number and then oh are you serious what the please don't do this to me formatting thing don't format the regular expression hold on fine you know what any any digit will do what all right hold on a format on save turn that off val equals number.text let sum equals zero sum plus plus uh let count equals zero you know sum plus equal val count plus plus average equals sum divided by count and then uh new light state what was the one with hue yeah let's set the uh now we're going to turn the light on saturation brightness uh average oh hugh average okay everybody let's just see why is this giving me like it doesn't like oh because it does it really need a parenthesis around this ah it wasn't like recognizing that as a regular expression so if your message in a minute just contains a digit try to keep it between 0 and 360 please all right i'll say that if val is greater than is greater than or equal to zero and val is less than or equal to 360. oh it won't auto format for me anymore i'm gonna all right so now we're gonna see if uh let's just see if it's finding messages and then let's just see if this works so take a look at the lights behind me i'm giving everybody a minute to put their numbers in ah 255 is not within a loud limit oh it's between 0 and 100. okay everybody oh no that's for saturation and brightness no wonder i had those as 100. okay let me try this again cannot read property lights of undefined oh i i didn't uh init lights i need to await emitting the color uh async function this is a very silly thing that i'm doing is init color it isn't okay great so now it should init the color pull youtube chat the chat's going crazy good thing i don't have slow mode on and get an average hue and set it let's see if this works why is it listening in port 3 oh no hold on am i getting here no a weight in it color why is it stuck am i just being impatient oh i didn't call go i didn't call the function go here we go everybody now it's really happening no is my hue thing stopped working why oh i just want this to work i was getting these messages before hold on let's pull youtube let's get rid of that yeah that's working so what's wrong with my init what happened to this function did somebody disconnect the hue bridge well i wasn't looking light id is not defined okay now that worked that was weird light five okay here we go everybody here comes uh ultra it works it works i was like why did it get these because uh it the test is like it just has to find it in the so there is a bit of a flaw here which is that and let me just fix this real quick
