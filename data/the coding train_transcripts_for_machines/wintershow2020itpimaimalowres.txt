hi there hi i'm fake oh okay hi oh yeah it's um i'm checking your uh live now oh uh where oh yeah yeah i can look at it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's working really well okay do check one check one does everyone hear me is my audio okay oh you could hear me that whole time that's very strange were you hearing me having a conversation there i'm not sure what's going on i got to get started in just about one minute or a few minutes do so do test hello oh my goodness i'm i'm technically challenged right now there we are hello good evening welcome to a special well at least eastern time nighttime edition of the coding train i am here to do something very special today um so you might be wondering what uh as as was just asked in the chat by pin ball oh you got me pinball oh my goodness i can't believe what's happening right now um you might be wondering what is the itp ima show hi alca i haven't seen you in a while alka welcome back to the coding train maybe you've been here all along and just haven't seen your name pop up um so um this is my uh there's a bunch of things that i tend to do at the end of the year and this is sort of like item number one so my uh regular day job uh besides um being this uh uh internet uh weirdo is um being a teacher at new york university a school at new york university called tisch school of the arts and a program called itp as well as one called ima so itp is a twoyear graduate program an ima is a well four year undergraduate major and at the end of every semester the students usually gather physically in person and you know transform the entire floor where all the classrooms are and the labs into a giant exhibition gallery space that is not happening uh this year it didn't happen last spring either instead the show has moved virtual i mean it's not really virtual what's virtual about it it's happening it's real we're just look we're just experiencing it through the through mediated through video and audio and all sorts of stuff so um what i have typically done in the past is spent my time wandering around with my phone trying to live stream and a microphone and looking at projects and interviewing students today really i'm just here to invite you you can see the urls up there i'm gonna i'm gonna take a little time to show you all the bits and pieces of how the show works it actually doesn't start technically for 20 minutes so um so i'm going to show you how uh where you can find projects where you can uh interact with other people i'm going to show you the website i'm going to show you this thing called yorb which is really incredible um and then hopefully i'm gonna just back away slowly turn off the streaming button and let you experience the show for yourself and i'll be around there you can chat with me and say hello um in the virtual spaces as well so that's what i've got on the agenda for tonight are you ready are you excited i hope so but as always on the coding train we must begin with the ceremonial reading of the random numbers now how do i do this i have to find i'm going to open up discord here so if you aren't a member of the coding drain discord a link should be popping up in the chat right about now it probably actually happened about 30 seconds ago because you're behind me in time but the chat is in real time um and i'm looking for where did i last end up i think i forgot to post no i didn't row 17 column zero i am embarking on uh a project it is my goal it's my lifelong dream to read this entire book out loud the book of a million random digits i'm really not doing a very good job with that i'm gonna have to live a very very long time unless i somehow speed this process up but every time i live stream i try to read a little bit of it so here we are it is evening time night time time for children to go to sleep gotta sleep children i guess it's actually only 7 40. finish your homework whatever whatever i'm supposed to yell as a parent who is up in the attic live streaming and reading from a book of random numbers aha okay so let's move on to line 18 and tonight's random numbers will be starting at row 18 column zero sixty nine thousand nine hundred and sixteen twenty six thousand eight hundred and three sixty six thousand two hundred and fifty two twenty nine thousand one hundred and forty eight thirty six thousand nine hundred and thirty six eighty seven thousand two hundred and three seventy six thousand six hundred and twenty one thirteen thousand nine hundred and ninety by the way i think i was supposed to read row 17. i'm on the wrong row mr over you'd wear that that that's next week's random numbers seventy four thousand three hundred and fifty ninety nine thousand eight hundred and seventeen seventy seven thousand four hundred and two seventy seven thousand two hundred and fourteen forty three thousand two hundred and sixty three two hundred and ten wow that's quite a number i feel like the first time i've ever read a number that below one thousand in this book forty five thousand five hundred and twenty one sixty four thousand two hundred and thirty seven ninety six thousand two hundred eighty six two thousand six hundred and fifty five all right so one of the reasons why i like to read these random numbers is because i don't want there to be any confusion whatsoever about what's going on here this is nonsense and you should probably tune out and again might i remind you ah shoot i moved my camera around and i'm just like i don't have enough vertical space to reach up so i have to like practice not going too high um you should not be watching me instead you should be visiting show itp.nyu.edu yorb.itp.io but for the time being there's about 15 minutes till it officially starts you can stay here and i'll kind of talk you through and show you um what's going on all right i'm looking at the chat i see people are saying they're sleepy um they're gonna use the julia says i'm going to use these as lottery numbers i'm rooting for you i'm really rooting for you um all right so what do i need to do first let me move over here to my laptop whoops no over here there we go and i think i can well i guess i can leave these messages up here maybe i'll just unpin them now for a second but i'll bring them back so what is it that i want to do first so let me open up open broadcast studio so first of all one thing that i have a really difficult time with oh and this is photoshop maybe some of somebody watching can actually help me make a nicer version of this but one of the things i'm struggling with is i'm about to go into uh you know semipublic online space and essentially be recording people i'm actually more than just recording it i'm live streaming so this is akin to you know perhaps playing roblox um a game like that and live streaming your experience and there's other players in the on the server and maybe there's an understanding that people have when they're in one of these spaces that there are other people who might be streaming it or recording it um but this place where i'm going is not a particularly anonymous space in fact people can have their cameras on and be visible and so i don't really know uh in in the physical show i could walk around with a physical camera people sort of see that as like a social cue oh there's somebody with a camera and a microphone if i don't want to be on camera i could sort of move out of the way also being in the sort of public space of the show there are signs up that kind of um explain that your you know the sort of permissions around um your photo maybe being taken and recorded in the space so i know i'm going on for a long long time about this but i've been thinking about this a lot and i don't love the idea of kind of going into this 3d world that i'm about to go into and live stream it but i think the benefits here outweigh the downside in that i'm going to bring some attention and and have a little bit fun and see the show and students will be able to interact and you'll be able to see some of their projects so this is my solution i'm using open broadcast studio to get my camera and then put a like message over the top that says live broadcast i wonder if it might make sense for me and i was just quickly mocking this up in photoshop so first of all these should definitely be the coding train uh whoops um instead of these like red dots they should be these coding trained characters which you would think i would have at the ready so i'm going to quickly i'm just like i put my screen away because i'm going to head over to google drive here where i have all of my stuff my stuff okay where are you um characters paid members merchandise no share design design i'm looking at a folder called design design assets um and characters here we go i think i can bring you back now um so i'm in this folder called characters let's go to symbol characters maybe or i really love um i do love my friend the robot this is my new favorite character choo choo bot so let's try uh let's try getting a chuchu bot download i just want this might indicate to people that it's the coding train what uh what else uh is really sort of obviously the coding train is there symbol symbol character is the unicorn here let's go to jpegs let's try the rainbow one this would probably also indicate so i'll download this one this is a png oh it's a jpeg i don't like that why don't i have a png of this here oh there are pngs here uh rainbow okay there we go let's download this i know this is like riveting live streaming watching me attempt to use photoshop which i'm like absolutely terrible at um okay so i think i can get rid of this now and i can i don't know drag and drop is photoshop gonna let me do that uh downloads downloads symbol look at that all right i know what i'm doing here you can't stop me live broadcast and then let's grab a robot oh do i need to like place it okay great let's grab the robot and shrink it a little bit put it over here it's in the corner you're in the corner all right i think people will sort of get the idea uh and if anybody wants to design a slightly better version of this you're welcome to it uh what happened to my oh it's fine uh let's actually like keep these dots really do say live broadcast though um so maybe i should leave these uh trans uh free transform will that do it here we go making them like right in the corner down here uh we can just get rid of this one and where am i here no here now here where i don't even understand what's going on oh that look that's a layer okay there we go so now i can copy paste there we go put that one down here so just make it all along the bottom i think i'm going to stop okay save export quick export is png let's try that to the desktop sure replace that and then is obs gonna perfect so now when i go in so what i'm doing is i have a virtual camera running so i've got the virtual camera running which means if i go to any website that makes use of my webcam instead of just the webcam it's going to show this so hopefully that's going to indicate to people oh i should probably put let's also do this um so let me add one more little bit of text and say youtube.com the coding train and make that much smaller and just put that down here on the bottom uh let's try another quick export export quick export i know you guys are just so this is so exciting there we go oh i spelt it wrong uh come on i can't see it so it's very hard when i can't see it just i need a c in there there we go um do i have to recenter it just tell me where it goes come on photoshop like do it for me automatically close enough close enough i don't know where that is i don't know what's going on i'm trying to line it up with something okay uh quick export i really i should have done this before i started live streaming but you could say i started i just didn't have a lot of time um all right this is gonna be great all right so this is what people will see um and alco oh wait we've got some breaking news here breaking news um obs version 26.1 has added official support for virtual camera for the mac all right that's great to know all right so now this can go away and um let's just run let's go i'm gonna go to a quick test zoom meeting and by the way i'm just going to because i don't know what's about to pop up i'm just gonna put my camera my and let's just see if this at least works with zoom so i'll know let me go to slash test join so there might be an option of visiting some of the projects in zoom meetings and so i'm going to join with video and so with the virtual camera okay yes yes i hear the ringtone yes my microphone's working um so basically uh this is now oops uh me in uh zoom meeting and if i go here under video and change this to virtual camera now this is me in the zoom meeting so you can see that i am live broadcasting now of course i could do that as the background which would make sense and i have a green screen and all that but i actually think it's better for it to be just right up here at front so front and center so people know all right we are ready to head on to over to the itb show i'm so excited so ordinarily um i feel like i know what all the projects are i've seen them all i've seen the students building them i've helped students with them i'm i feel very out of the loop this semester with everything being remote and all my classes being remote i know about some of the projects i participate still but there isn't that like i show up to work every day and wander around the floor and see all the students building their projects so mostly i have no idea what i'm about to find um so this should be exciting i should pin back uh this back up on the screen by the way uh if you are a coding trained member that unlocks a channel in the discord where you can post messages that i can uh bring up here on the screen pretty exciting stuff here i've got going um all right so now let's go on over to itp.nyu show so this is the winter show website um we can start to look down here and i will do a dramatic reading of what this is that we're about to experience uh join us on december 16th if you brought your time machine with you you can go to the show on december 16th or december 17th for our virtual winter show it's a twoday event features projects representing creative applications of the recently possible from three programs of new york university's tissue of the arts itp ima and a brand new program by the way ima low res this is a new program that is a one year masters everything you know is turned upside down this year in education and in many other industries and activities but the low res was actually designed to be mostly online and remote with some intensive inperson um periods in january and over the summer i mean you should check out the website to get the full details but it's pretty interesting model for um uh learning the material and participating in the community that is itp ima so um so this is how um basically th one of the reasons why the time is the students are all over the world this semester and many of them there's a large uh number of students who are in china so if we find any of them it'll be 8 a.m for them whereas it's 8 p.m for me so yorb is really where i want to spend the time so in a minute i'm going to click on yorb but i also want to show you oh my test zoom meeting ended um how i can browse projects on this site which is the website itself so you can read more about itp and by the way let me just highlight all of these wonderful people who have made the show happen sorry stop stop talking to me watch um so it more than just these people because there's a lot of students and a lot of behind the scenes administrative work but just to highlight a few people um esther zhang who did the banner art that you're seeing uh lennon compressed who did the website design and front end development yet yen and chan yen chen who did the back end development the show producers are sean van every rob ryan and ellen nichols thank you so much to ellen who's been sort of feeding me my like sort of secret live stream producer for today it's like feeding me discord direct messages telling me what what where i might go to see a project um aiden nelson who i don't know if it's accurate to say is the inventor of your but the orb is based on a project by dan o'sullivan from many many years ago and there have been a ton of people uh contributing to your the orb team there's a europe club but aiden is your producer and then the resident show assistant producers lydia jessup august blurs billy bennett and yg zhang so thank you big round of applause to all of those wonderful people i wish i could just press a button and have them like appear i could interview them but maybe we'll find them in yorb and we'll be able to interview them in in the space that is yours okay i keep saying yorb you're your bjor bjor bjorb i don't have a yorb song you know my ukulele nothing got a train whistle a little bit out of breath let's get going all right so first thing i want to stop by is check out this browse project on this site so here is where i could actually see a list of all the projects so i can go into this 3d world and wander around and talk to people and find the projects there but if i just want to look at the list of projects you know we could spin a wheel i could have you vote with my live poll about which one we should go to and you can see here if it says join live presentation with a number the number indicates the your blitz which is like a mini orb inside of your oh my god i'm i'm in the upside down aren't i what's going on um yorbjorblit what's happening 11d it's like you know it's like a room number classroom number but you will also find i saw one up here some of them are uh i'm looking i'm looking zoom so this one for example the censor battle star wars edition is a live presentation in zoom and you can kind of see i don't know if i can get down here but you can see at the bottom like this is just a link to a zoom meeting whereas this is a link to a url um your blit2.itb.io all right so this is what i'm really hoping those of you watching will take it upon yourself to um experience so yes you can watch me i'm gonna just ramble on and all i'm very tired and confused and not sure if i'm putting words together that make senses uh but i do have a computer and a microphone and i'm gonna poke around here so this is um this i definitely encourage you to check out all of these projects and join especially the ones that are in zoom um i heard anecdotally yesterday that people weren't finding them as much as they were finding the your projects so it looks like most of them are in europe right now here's a here's a zoom one so yeah so i'm gonna check let me put on a little uh music for you here i'm gonna check my secret direct messages here which have some information about where i might go adding times above okay let's see um move this out of the way i don't know what that means oh closer to 9pm ready to go position 2b okay we are going to ready to go position 2b the title is historia historia let's see there's a search on here right search uh can i do this historia and we're going to go oops oh ethan prince oh i know ethan uh so how do i find ah here we go join live presentation here we go we're heading over to the live presentation of historia in europe and we really gotta just cross our fingers and hope this works cuz i don't know if it's gonna work all right uh yes allow okay so it looks like by the way this is my preview so it looks like i can see in my preview that my weird live broadcast sign is showing up i'm going to hit uh enter and i'm heading into the your blit i'm going to just remove this message here and where would i need to go was it 2 2b all right here we go i can't hear anything wait a second hold on i've got to make sure that the audio from the browser is heading to the stream so if i the thing that i use for that is something called loopback uh google chrome is on and it is heading out being routed out to usb capture so as soon as there's any audio you should hear it we'll find out in a moment 2b 2b there we go hello is anybody here ethan is that you hello hello are you there i like to jump i'm like obsessed with jumping in yorb hello oh ethan is that you yes and you can and you can hear me yes i can awesome now i don't see you which is fine maybe you have your camera off a bug you don't have to be on camera i'm just curious whether it's a bug or not and by the way this is basically i should be on camera okay so do you see me with a giant live broadcast sign on me no no no just you in front of her green screen really yeah ah hold on you think this is using a different camera that's so weird hold on my camera is off now yes uh yeah it's that stopped updating now it's on and it's not a giant uh it's not a giant live live stream sign it's actually just me in front of a green screen all right hold on i'm gonna see if i can make an attempt here very briefly just because i want to get this working um i'll see if i can get my camera okay um ah your blade is allowed i'm gonna go here no camera how do i go to switch the uh camera obs virtual camera yeah and obs virtual camera all right i'm gonna not worry about this too much it was a lovely idea i had i'm going to hit refresh so i'm going to disappear and come right back all right people in the chat hearing the double audio oh that's just because david you're over there okay uh here we go i'm going to refresh and see if it comes back with i'm saying live stream okay here we go enter enter yorb here we go yes webcam i'm following where we see you jonah should we go to two like this yeah 2b is where i'm going by the way this is a live broadcast do you see live broadcast written on me probably not oh wait i think i see ethan now there you are let's reload but it worked now okay and i'm just curious is it still just me or is there a sign in front of me sorry oh well well i won't worry about that anymore so this is my first attempt at live streaming the virtual yorb itp show ethan you are my first uh victim so to speak um and so i don't really have a plan here other than to turn it over to you to tell us about your project called if i'm right historia yes indeed um so i created an automatic reality ios app that's basically built around a walking tour of downtown brooklyn which is the neighborhood where i depend on the itp so you it uses an apple's geotracking api to basically scan your environment to get a hyper precise location of where you are on the street which is necessary for popping up these physical markers around your environment um that show what the neighborhood and streetscape look like 100 or 120 years ago so these photo markers pop up there's also like ambient sound markers and then if you click on them they provide a bit more background information where they came from when they're taken and you can zoom in on the photo um so there are those photo markers then they're like audio ambient markers and there are infoboards on with the more historic uh important sites that were destroyed in the neighborhood so yeah it's apple ios app i'm hoping to have it ready to be released in a month or two with some more user testing and just fun to work on yeah it's undergraduate a new realities class um with the n sebastian oh yeah it was a bit of a mixed bag um because to test it every time you have to go outside you have to put on the mask and it's a look very anxiety do this thing i find especially if you're like going in high rises with elevators um but the opportunity to go outside was certainly excellent once i got outside and it was a fun project to work around with um just exploring the neighborhood making sure that all markers were positioned correctly great so i i have to tell the live stream i have to apologize to the live stream i muted my audio while you were presenting because i needed a minute to like check a few things and fix a couple things and then when i came back to ask you that question i didn't unmute my audio so nobody heard my question which i really by the way there was a very eloquent um deep and meaningful the way i asked it was just ah so so well done if i don't say so myself no i um i very awkwardly asked just about how the pandemic sort of affected the development of this project related to especially as it related to being outside oh my goodness did your just crash or is somebody oh no just somebody with a um a black screen like walked right in front of me and it made everything look empty uh wonderful thank you so much for sharing your project um so people everybody if you want to come and chat with ethan and find out more about historia you can go to your blit2 dot itp dot io i'm gonna zoom way on in up here on the url yourblit2.itp.io and you can um find ethan's project that way and many more projects thank you so much all right so here i go wandering around um i'm going to head this way um let's try going to a let's go return whoops very challenged with using this oh okay let's try returning to the lobby let's see what happens there return to the lobby okay here we go enter drum roll please and and oh here we go all right i got to ask some people if they see my live streaming sign i really want that to work uh david you are here do you see my live streaming sign you know what's going on do you see my giant sign that says i'm live streaming no no no amazing what's up man i've got a killer this whole elab oh i went into a your blit why is that not working why is it not picking up my virtual camera it's making me crazy um all right well i'm in your blood four let me see here that happened by accident where i'm supposed to go next uh position 2d oh i should have gone to position 2d um i really should have gone there because i was already in york too i was at 2b and 2d was right next door your live stream sign was not working and your picture wasn't moving either hmm it's so sad because right here you can clearly see that the preview of myself has the weird live broadcast thing in front of it um and it is so it is picking up my virtual camera why does this not showing up in your oh well i did see it for a second a few minutes ago says nancy hi nancy welcome to the the very last live stream i ever do in my entire life okay uh this is going well i'm gonna look here um so there is a project for f called meet the future let's try to wander over there i don't know if they'll be there i'm a little confused i have a schedule oh ready to go 8c ready to go 8c i see oh ready to go 10a where do i go where do i go now adding times above 10 also 10b and 10c use ml5 okay we're going to your your blood 10. can i just like put in the number 10 here and it'll just send me there secret hack i've hacked yorb here we go what happened to my sound i don't hear it anymore did loot back die did my headphones die i don't know what's going on but i'm not going to worry um do you hear a drum roll i don't hear it anymore okay your blit10 we're going to 10a okay shoot i don't hear any sound anymore that's a problem i do need to hear the people whoa is this this looks like 10a this is so cool do you hear it all right we got to figure out what's going on um loopback my audio routing software chrome is up um let me let me try playing this oh connection failed please restart the page oh no oh no let's try refreshing but also why is this not it's okay all right let's try this again just going to check something here yeah this is up did i disconnect no turn this on all right well i can hear coming out of the speakers why can't i not hear it in my headphones this is going so well let's try this headphone put another one in when in doubt add another headphone let me play actually some music that'll play more continuously okay oh my connection failed well i think we might have to visit a zoom project okay connect all right i'm connected i heard a ah okay i've got sound back again all right okay i've got sound back we're gonna head back over to 10 uh 10b or 10a which project 10 10a [Laughter] did i i wonder if i have singlehandedly brought down yorb through the power of the coding train all 194 people who are watching possibly you know ten percent are actually paying attention and one percent of those people actually went into europe so probably not uh i think the itp show the itv ima show has quite its own uh following i don't know what's going on to be perfectly frank um you know my name is not frank it's dan but and we're like we're in some kind of strange yorb uh uh empty ghost yorb wait is that a person or is that just a sign this is a sign about this project um nancy writes in the chat it makes me so happy to see you having problems with yorb it makes me feel less alone that is like the thesis statement of the coding train it makes me so happy to see you having problems with blank it makes me feel less alone fill in the blank javascript math programming css video yorb i have problems with it all don't be alone be with me i can't do it either let's not do it either together all right um drum roll yes oh no look at all this noah is here and luisa's here there's all these people that i actually know in real life in the chat that doesn't usually happen when i broadcast all right let's try i think we might need to go visit a zoom project i'm a little bit wary of doing that because i'm just kind of landing in somebody's zoom room without them being aware sort of but um i pretty sure um i'm pretty sure that the um the web oh the weather ban says closer to 9 p.m it is getting close to 9 p.m it's already 8 15. uh ready to go 10a let's try a different ur blit ready to go position three let's try your blit3 do you think that different your blitz um my connection will work better with one or another let's try all right drum roll please okay is there anyone here to say hello to me is there where am i going 3c a b c okay c is over here hello hello i i'm waiting to play my ah wait yes i see a project oh and i know this project i know this project hello are you there i don't hear anything wait i heard somebody speak up hello hello who's there this is maria maria oh hello people does anyone see my live broadcast sign that's about my whole life it depends on it no no but i'm watching the broadcast now so okay oh wow your voice is really coming through wait i'm looking hi am i i'm here to oh zao there you are i am here i'm here to uh hear about this project that you've made oh great uh is that okay is it okay that cause i i i i my intention was to have a big sign on me that says that i'm live broadcasting so that i'm not i know that you're alive everybody seems to know it anyway so i i give up okay my face so anyways uh hello tell me your name and this by the way is very artificial because zayal actually made this project in my class so i'm going to pretend as if i know nothing about it tell me your name and uh um about this project and um tell the viewers all about it we'd love to hear about it yeah um hey everyone here's the round shipment uh anzael this is the project i made with my cosmic tinshu it's called 100 2100 nonexistent voice i've dated before it's a project using machine learning in runway that trend data from okcupid which i found the stairs that has like 60 thousand dating profiles uh it's just online and i trained them so it's all artificial uh fake dating profile that i put into like this tinder clone that i made uh once the swap person is matched you can find a dating story between me and this nonexistent human being and this dating story is using contextfree grammar uh to write the story always end it with with we never met again so we want to talk about how the data privacy really is out there and also oh i feel like i heard some alcohol but yeah i hear the echo too i think it must be somebody who's nearby who's not doesn't have headphones but anyways uh we want to talk about like data privacy and how you treat your data on dating profiles uh more seriously and also just it's a fun project to just work on to like get all this like weird bizarre it's like somehow even feels like cursed because like you know all the data that you watch right now are like very weird but then they're actually from the real data like got trained out of it so it's very cursed it's very uh entertaining in a way that i like to to read it and to to find all the stories between me and there's a hundred boys that i've dated so just just so everyone's clear who's looking at this right what we're seeing right now on screen that you're sharing yes is a picture of some a person with a name alonso at age 27 and then a description written below can you tell me where you're headed on the road do you have any life goals or dreams that could be started in any format can you go through each one of these like where did the photo come from where did the name come from how did you pick the age and how did you get text okay okay so i'm gonna go scroll a little bit the profile picture is actually from scale down two and also there's like a ff hq data set so like you just mentioned learning to train the photo and they generated like like a nonsense a human that actually looks like real enough uh we pull it actually from the side the code not just a human uh because the easier they're using the same model to train it and it's easier to pull data from them every time you refresh the page you'll generate the new data and the names who are like getting it from the social security administration just find like common voice name and dating bio is trained from the okcupid profiles and we pick so if you have you state um if you have you say okay cuba you'll probably know there are like multiple questions out there and we picked the first question which is a dating bio and trade the dating bio which is can you tell me where you had it on the road and also what is this weapon so we match but what happened after we bought prepared food at zarbar 10 minutes into the date he said your kind of guy wants to marry but i want to have fun with pretty ones first we never talk again so what he said here is also trained from okcupid uh it's trained from fun fact and also what you're looking for and we put that into the context programmer and then we generate it with the end of we never talked again so and then you click and you can swipe as many as you want uh this one said if you lose 10 pounds you'll be a 10. very bizarre but this actually got trade from the real data but yeah this is our our project that is a fun entertaining to work on but also it's fun to rate it and it's very interesting to think about how data got used uh online and on dating profile because the data privacy yeah fantastic yeah play with this project play with like is this um is this i'm currently online at the url can people go try it out yeah exactly uh go click that billboard thing uh in front of you well i'm just gonna oh so over here yeah yes there's a billboard thing here and then you click this billboard and then there will be a website okay learn more about the project yeah so hopefully this is going to keep not kick me out of yorub and go into a new tablet see what happens oh i see and i actually see the project website i will check this out so i just wanted to say like one of the things that i love about this project many things but is it's really a great example of how when you're using you know techniques for machine learning or uh generative algorithms to create what is this entire like fictional story basically but there's so many elements of that story and you've used a different technique and a different data set for each element and it's um uh i i i love to hear about the process of why you chose different ones and what data set and i know how hard you all worked on sort of developing this project um so great job um wonderful to see thank you okay so everybody i'm in just so you know i'm in your blit3 if you're watching this live i'm putting the url up the screen your blitz3.itp.io you can go um there yourself and then you can also find the url if i click on here and click on project website um there we go now i found and i found alonso uh right here that we saw so i could see i can see the actual project wonderful great job yeah thank you okay i'm going to wander around to figure out i'm going to check my list as to where i'm go my uh team my team of producers is telling me to go next see you all everybody i'm wandering over here here we go all right uh so that was awesome uh i'm looking at the chat now just for a second they are hiding in the corner i don't know what that means sean um all right so let's see ready to go is position eight where am i i'm in three is there any other three listed here ready to go position eight c so let's try going to your blit eight this is my really highly sophisticated technique where i change the number in the address bar and i hit yes i want the full experience i want the full experience uh yeah use my microphone but please could you could you please use my virtual camera i worked so hard on this i worked so hard on my virtual camera it's not showing up it shows up here it shows up here enter can i press my happy sound i see people oh i see people i hear people yes uh i'm going to position 8c let's see uh oh i see a blank screen in 8c this is not a good sign but we're going to head over there oh i'm like i've never been so hunched over in my life while live streaming i'm just like here we go this project is the chocolate factory oh my connection failed now why do i get that message and then oh i've lost control i'm spiraling out of control i crashed oh my god where am i going stop no come back go back oh my god europe has gone out of control oh my god where how help i'm gonna hit refresh refresh refresh here we go and look they're all the people there's i think there's a there's a very small group of people it's like my entourage that's like falling around so i feel like there's a whole bunch of people at hc right now come to your blit 11 says yonatan okay okay i i will go to your blit 11 but first i must go to hc okay yonatan says come to your little eleven i by the way if you're saying in the chat come to a your blit i'm coming to that your blit uh chocolate factory i will have to come back to uh we're going to your blit 11 and duh i have a lot more sound effects i'm just using this one i think maybe i need to read some more random hours up up up i want the full experience so i need to know where in your blit 11 to go i mean i'll go anywhere uh all i see is your blitz 11 okay moving around is there a tour guide here by the way i believe the ushers in yorba are called ushers or is it ushers are you shells i don't know um okay i'll look for a project that seems on um here's something hello um i'm supposed i'm good i'm supposed to have a big sign on me that says i'm live streaming but it's not working so i'm telling you that i'm livestreaming this is that so if you if you want to send me away i will go away if you don't is is this your project here yes oh wonderful um would you mind telling uh the viewers of the coding trade a little bit about yourself in this project yeah sure so so briefly we created of your gallery oh and so i'm sorry to interrupt you i have a bad habit of doing this this is a collaboration between the two of you yeah can you can you tell uh can you tell us your names and any other collaborators oh okay so you're team leo and my name is kevin and my name is hanzo so uh yeah we we made a building leo which is a social vr platform like a vr gallery so um we both have designers background and i thought we thought 2d a flat 2d screens in real world has a limitation of digesting future of computational crap so we use vr technology and game engines to create a environment where artists can express the future of expression i would say so we created a whole clear gallery environment with six different rooms with six different themes so um idea is coming from collecting our secure moment and memory so we recreated this uh designs and like from our memory with the light insulation and sound experience and spatial environment so also multiplayer can play in the same venue together as well oops fantastic um is this i you know i obviously in the context here we're just seeing this sort of documentation is there a url is this a thing that people can try um right now if you click this signboard here there is a website and i also unloaded applications so if you guys have oculus quest you guys can try uh this whole experience with octopus quest wonderful thank you so much for sharing thank you all does anybody know what station yonatan is at nobody knows okay we're gonna find jonathan maybe 11c meditative experiences oh yeah can you see me yeah i can can you hear me yeah i'm teaching it can you kiss me now yeah we're good it's our it's how you're lit we're up up beep beep beep that's me censoring out the language see this is the problem i want to be live streaming sign all right is this uh oh this is where i just was okay i don't know where yonitan is i don't know where yonitan is and i've i've ceased be able to navigate i can't turn to the right anymore what is going on ah here we go let's try going this way we're gonna return to the lobby ready everybody we're returning to the lobby 11h okay i see it in the chat 11 e a b c d e f e f wait g yes g h there we go okay i'm coming over to 11 h hello 11 h space mapper car uh yonatan are you there i don't hear you hey welcome oh i do hear you okay wonderful um thank you for thank you for uh sending bringing me here f wait g yes g oh wait there we go somebody's got my stream open it's 30 seconds in the past the audio is coming out let's see okay i think we're back i think we're good so i'm wandering around asking people to just introduce themselves and tell us a little bit about your project so take it away cool uh so here's my project uh it is let me get my camera little little remote control car wow yeah um so basically what this thing has is it's got if you can see right here this is an infrared distance sensor and probably me what you can do is you can take uh any kind of object uh like a box here and what you've got is um you can drive it forward and what it will do is it will graph out the side of the box just like that and then what you can do is you can click on hold on i'm sorry to interrupt you i'm going to go wander over to the screen share because i think i'll be i'll have a better view there sure okay i could still hear you i think you can see on the stage the graph and everything awesome right behind you okay i'm good yeah let me let me uh demonstrate again um so i've got the car and you've got any kind of object right here and uh using arrow keys you can drive the car forward and as it passes the box you can see that it graphs the side of it and then what you can do is you can click at the start and the end and it will tell you the length with semi accuracy 17.8 centimeters and i've got a ruler and this box is uh 18 and a half so it's almost perfectly accurate still needs a little bit of calibration wow fantastic and i can see here this looks like this is a p5.js sketch is that right yeah absolutely oh i think i missed the last thing you said yeah it is a p5 sketch amazing and had you used and this is is this a is this a project you did for the physical computing course yeah physical computing and uh computational media ah so you did it crossbars um and so and so you're using the p5 serial library to communicate between the car and p5 itself fantastic yeah exactly i love the way you're presenting this like it's such a challenge to present these kind of projects in this context yeah it works so yeah i had to uh yeah i had to get the camera feed to be part of the uh of the sketch in order to make this whole thing happen yeah yeah wonderful and had you ever um you know i know obviously you were familiar with itp before you came had you ever worked with p5 before this semester or was it your first time no no uh p5 no programming no nothing i used to be a musician actually yeah amazing did you work on any like music related projects this semester or do you think that's something you'll can like think about my uh my past uh physical computing program was a little guitar um using stretch sensors and p5 to kind of make little notes i wasn't a guitarist but yeah guitar seems like the most uh yeah appropriate choice yeah i for me teaching programming i i find so many students have music backgrounds are interested in music and sound and that's definitely one of my sort of missing pieces of my knowledge base and i always feel a little bit lost um and always excited to see what students are doing with computation and music so great job thank you so much for sharing this thank you thank you so much thanks for bringing your entourage here of course and so people can find out more first of all you can come here right everybody watching and come to your blit 11 station 11 h and you can also see here um you can click on the sign post which says space mapper car and if i click here on the project website we'll see probably some documentation oh look at this we've got like a circuit diagram and all sorts of other information about how this was made fantastic wonderful okay off we go uh to where will where will we'll be led we don't no i just like awkwardly slide away that's how i do it bye thank you so much uh all right i could return to the lobby coming over here to the middle i'm gonna look at my uh oh the weather band is ready to go and that is a zoom project i believe i think so let's go to uh the weather band project how do i find that i'm gonna leave yorb for a second i need a break i'm out of here oh my god that's very stressful this is very complicated i also need to eventually move on with my evening the point of me doing this as fun as this is and hopefully you're you're enjoying this or finding projects and people are telling me to come to 3a was that my goal here was is not really to visit all the projects myself but to show people how to navigate the itp show itima show and encourage you all the viewers to go yourself and i can bring back my urls here your.itp.io or itp.nyu.edu so we're going to go to the weather map let's search for weather band introduction oh wait whether journals no that's a different project weather band close and this is a zoom room okay everybody this is very exciting we're about to go into zoom let's see what happens oh i should have made my name i should rename myself to live broadcast but whatever i think it might say codingtrain my name so hopefully that will help people know that what they're about what they're getting themselves into before i enter now i actually don't know if the zoom audio is going to make it through to um to the actual youtube stream itself okay let's put on some waiting music here while i check loopback zoom and audio source it is if i turn it on oh i'm connecting okay naturally come to that i probably will not have anything to do with my thesis but i did take um sound studio with luke this past semester um and if i'm if i'm lucky i can get to apply some of that to what we're doing next semester yeah awesome hello coding train hello so this is my like warning sign to tell people that this is a live broadcast as i enter these semi public spaces so people can quickly leave or turn their camera off or something i haven't figured out how to do this effectively but i thought this is better than nothing i really you know anyway so but i'm sorry to interrupt in the middle but i've got a small group of people watching who i would sure would love to hear about the itp weather band project name do you want to say so we are we are my tv weather band and we make music with data collected from the diy weather station do you have anything to add like name yeah so this year we are focusing on building the system um behind the weather ban like the database and the server and also we have some new instrument coming as well so yeah let's watch the video together here's what you want to share i cannot share okay i have a better internet here yeah itp weather band is an experimental band creating music with weather data collected from a diy weather station and we have been working together for the past year to build a networked weather station system and create experimental instruments that turn the environmental data into music and visuals this is the weather station installed like love by animals then this is a circuit that is boosting the data onto the web so here is our system diagram so what are we doing is the weather station is getting the winter data and we are using i don't know mkrt intend to getting the data and then um through the wifi we posted the data to our database on the daily ocean server and after we having the data in the database people can get the data using a http request our client can be p5 client arduino client or website or any client that can do http requests and here is our api so as for our database which is set up with microsoft we have um our old documentation and database here and our the point is that we started as a performance band and we did a few performances but now uh we are developing the performance and also uh we are trying to grow as an open source project that like people in the anywhere in the world can set up their diy weather station um and then also and contributing to our day on weather data network and also we have some p5 and arduino examples that people can just use to get our weather data um that's posted like every one minute like a lot of um data like wind and rain um and illuminance and uv and everything to combine into their creative projects and just to show some of the projects like using the data um this by skylar and um ichan at new new school they're collaborating on this website that is uh veteran website but is a very nice graphical sculpture that is reacting to the weather data in real time and also we had this performance last time music performance and network music festival and we are all in different locations like a people who are different locations using the weather like different weather data from the same period of time it's the first day of the summer and these are all the instruments made on that music developed by the band members so may 6th cloudy and we have some new instruments that we are meeting like dp like every two weeks um to continue this project and then these are from um new members which are first years this is one of these by sihen and this one is by cu the visual instrument using the illuminance data for this um light sculpture yay thank you um that was fantastic you know i've heard so much about this project and i've seen bits and pieces but it was really nice to finally be able to sort of like settle in and get a full sort of like survey and presentation uh i'll tell you i have actually like a sort of vested interest in the project i know you sent an email about this and i hadn't gotten a chance to reply yet but a huge challenge for me in teaching is to find sort of stable and easily accessible free uh data sources for people to begin with like just to learn the low json function for example in p5 and actually i have several people who watch the coding train know that i have like a whole series about working with weather data and in the video i make a joke like by the time you watch it this api probably won't be available anymore and or like you'll have to pay for it and that's actually the case i was using dark sky which then um i believe apple bought them and shut them down or whatever you can't use it so like so anyway i think it's really exciting to see like these kinds of like open source style um initiatives the to that not only like teach people that are opportunities we're able to learn about working with data but you know you've got this whole like hardware system that you've built to like make the api itself so it's really thrilling and i wonder you know what and just the way you're showing like all these different projects that came out of it so i hope that this can grow and that people can make their own weather stations they're going to be a lot of them and it's super exciting so thank you for doing this work i i definitely think i need to like add to my list make a basic like here's a p5 example that gets the weather you know from this api so remind me about that maybe maybe in january um with xer calm down i can like take a minute to to make a video about that be great yeah we really yeah i think that would be super exciting and then we will um yeah make sure the weather station is working hard [Laughter] and then we don't plan to install in multiple occasions the name is thinking over in thailand then like in china and maybe i can ensure in korea so right is there is there just one right now or yeah so one thing you might consider actually by the way also is and maybe this isn't relevant maybe i is like creating a sort of like sample also api that's not real data but like allow people to sort of like test the idea out of like getting multiple sources so i haven't thought this through and here i am just like live talking off the top of my head live streaming here but that could be something to think about also if there are sort of things that you're thinking about scaling and features you're thinking about offering you know you can sort of test those out and have people use them um without the hardware in place um and that also like if it ever goes down then there's still like you know a backup feed that works even if it's historical data i think there's interesting possibilities there yeah yeah we do have historical data but that's a great idea of the example api yeah yeah we are here we are yeah we are like still developing different features so thanks so much for the suggestion yeah mostly i'm just really stuck on this thing where it's like no matter what i use like it's not there a year later or it's changed because i'm often relying on these sort of commercial services that you know change very rapidly so anyway uh thank you so much for sharing this project i hope people watching um can we're joining the itp weather band i see we have a viewer who says i live in thailand that's super exciting um i'm i'm going to wrap up soon so i'm going to wander off and try to catch one or two more projects but anybody wants to see come and visit your zoom room they can do that by going to the show website which i have in the video's description searching for itp weather band and then join live okay so maybe hopefully after i leave some people will come and ask you some more questions thank you okay bye everybody okay that was so successful it like worked and there was a presentation and you could see it i got to turn my camera off for a minute and i could just take a i could like meditate and i was reading my random number book actually i was quite glued to their presentation it's a very exciting project and it's just like uh i'm just so surprised so not really surprised because i see the creativity from students at itp and ima and people from all over the world all the time but it's amazing to see how just this one little piece of data can launch so many different kinds of threads and ideas for projects that riff off of that data all right where do i go next it's getting close to 9 pm my children need to be put to bed actually they kind of go to sleep on their own they're a little bit older now but i should say good night to them i would really like to encourage people to go visit the show lil z crazy g is asking what is itp so i did talk about this briefly at the beginning of the stream you know if you go to the show website you can read a little bit more about the different programs but itp is a graduate program located in brooklyn new york where i teach and many other people teach and many people are students and many people work there so many wonderful people um and you can visit the virtual floor which is like a 3d model of the actual space and wander around at yorb so um uh crabby is possibly a bit late but crabby i am so glad that you are here it is always wonderful to see your green name crabby second account someday you will grace us with the presence of your first account i know it will happen someday but we'll we'll take your second account right now all right i'm i'm going to head over to your blit 12 your blit12 let's go to just the main yorb and wander over to your blit12 okay i really really wish that my live streaming sign would show up but i don't think it's going to so we're going to go this way oh there's a help desk hey it's the help desk okay i'm gonna move on i don't like wandering around here people don't know that i'm like live streaming them your blitz eight your blit9 okay you're a blip where am i going and then you're okay here we go you're blit 12. here we go i'm gonna fall okay click enter okay here we go whoa oh sorry for landing here we are your blitz 12 going to 12 b uh b is an easy one for me to find because it is the letter after the letter a in the alphabet and i do know that much without having to sing the song but it is nice to sing the song uh oh 12 b hmm i don't see anything going on here 12b where did you go in my secret message system which tells me which projects are ready for me it says ready to go i need also to like cross them off once i've already been there i uh we'll wait for a minute while i look around to see what where else i might go um um four f doesn't say ready to go oh wait a second ate pandy i think i know this project oh yes we're gonna go see if we can visit handy uh your blit8 so we'll come back please hold everybody wait anybody here sound drop wait 12c is active hello um i'm supposed to have a big sign that says i'm live broadcasting so that i don't surprise people so you could run away if you want or tell me to run away and i will gladly do so but if you will accept me here i would love to stay and hear about your project if this is your project okay you're kind of like a celebrity here yes thank you very much that's why that is the most absurd thing i've ever heard but i will take it okay okay so so tell me tell us your name um and about the project that you're presenting here okay for the other people as well i'm charlie i'm the first year student in itp and this is my um my first year project it's called wait it's not actually playing sorry um it's called a scene so basically it's an interactive interaction and also animation and coding p5 sketch it's a combination of all these forms um so um it's basically the idea of like seeking for a weakness of my life of my uh moments of up ups and downs so somebody who can be my supporter so i choose to be uh in the um so basically it's like three different forms just just a very quick uh walk through so first you're gonna see this little um uh just let me know if you can see it or you can hear my sound um i can definitely see it and i hear your voice but i don't think i hear that great great sound from the sketch yeah excellent so first we're going to see this p5 sketch so basically um it's it's actually have the monologue playing as a background sound oh now i hear it yeah you can hear uh let me know if you think it's true uhoh now i don't hear or see anything what happened do people hear me jump if you hear me oh okay people are jumping i don't hear anybody did we lose um our project creator oh no now i can hear you oh yeah sorry so i shouldn't play the sound because every time i played sound my voices got cut off ah got it anyway yeah there's a sketch just like uh you is this just like um how to say like a narrative this stages first you're gonna like um basically just um when you uh the the mouse access is worth controlling this whole schedule here so when you just um move the mouse from the uh left to right it will lead you to the next stage and at this stage you're going to like collecting this like little eyes when you hit the 20 you can see it moves moves you to the next stage and you're going to see this little animation as a video embedded in the sketch and you're gonna listen to monologue and the sound and just gonna be you know just like a quick like what no just move the mouse from the left to right you're gonna move to the next stage so there's gonna be four stages i i if i remember correctly it can be four stages you can be you know just oh i think we may have lost audio again oh no i hear the audio from the video from the sound from the screen how about now can you hear no now i can hear you again yes okay did you visualize where where where did you lies um it's hard to say okay there was a there was a giant eye with like heart emojis in it that was the last thing that i saw oh yeah this one so basically just like a presentation of the all the videos in the p5 sketch um you just like move the little mousex things and just walk through the whole sketch and that's it and for the next one uh it's in unity um it's like uh it's not it's not vr because i didn't make this one for the vr setting what is it um sorry i just i just hear dance like the voice take it back yeah i think what happens i think is that people have the live stream open on their computer and then it's they don't have headphones it like comes out through their speakers into the mic and then ends up in your but trust me if you're finding it hard to figure out what's going on with hearing my own voices also but this is really beautiful work i love i mean first of all i always love seeing um such you know sort of creative new uh visual ideas that get programmed in a p5 sketch you know i always think well what is else is there but the sort of like shapes and things you can do but i'm always just every year surprised by sort of new um new designs and visual ideas i also just like that how you have all these different um it really feels like to me like there's a i'd love to like experience it myself but there's like a story you're telling and there's different aspects of the story but there's this one sort of a visual this icon really the eye that kind of is the through line that sort of connects everything and that i think that works super well yeah thank you first for the coding part you just mentioned thank you for the coding change that's where i picked up all the things that i learned wonderful um is the sketch online somewhere like if i go maybe to the sign will there be a url okay i think we might have lost uh okay scene and if i go here project website um i could see it here oh wonderful okay oh look at this amazing amazing look at all these beautiful oh and we see the sketches here this one with the eye made out of emojis is really amazing so now i'm talking to myself here am i still in europe i'm also still in europe all right wonderful uh thank you so much for sharing this project um and i look forward to checking out and learning more about it ah you're back i was just clicking over to your website and looking at the project more thank you so much yeah thank you for coming have a great evening i hope people should come to your blit12 yourblit12.itp.io come and check out scene as well as other projects that are here in your blit12 i'm going to wander over to the middle um and figure out where i'm going next okay bye everybody thank you bye all right i'm gonna just this is here we go i'm just head on over here to return to lobby i'm going to take a look uh and taylor i think i'm going to try maybe one more project i'm looking at the chat i'm looking at my direct messages um let's see if we can try one more project oh handy is where i wanted to go where was that uh your blit8 all right i'm heading over to your blitz eight this is my last stop um and then i'm going to say good night don't worry there's more coming in quoting trade coming in 2020 and then a lot of coding train coming in 2021 but um here we go we're going over your blit8 everybody this is the theme song for your blitz 8. come on you're blind you can do it just want everyone to know that i worked really hard on this sign this sign that would show that i'm live streaming all right your blit8 here we are um eight b eight b i like going to b b is fun uh a b oh no project so sad this is a project i know well because a version of it was made in a machine learning class i taught a year ago and so i definitely would encourage you to check it out handy is a wearable interface interpreting tangible interaction to intentional experiences using emg signal and machine learning so it's not here right now but you can obviously come and click on the the sign here and check out the website all right we're gonna try to find one more project one more project tonight people all right we're gonna travel back in time to yours and find ourselves a project to take us out tonight on the coding train i mean i'm gonna stop i'm gonna still be here in europe in the show i just gotta stop live streaming at some point uh all right let's see i'm looking at my 3b did i go there already i don't know what project that is that's the problem so i can't remember if i went there it's my project actually 3b i'm right here oh should we go over oh amazing see the problem is my stage broke so the link isn't working i appear to be having very unique technical difficulties i can share my screen and if you want to go back there i can share my screen yeah let's do it h now because 3b is broken three so i should head to yorb33h that's where we're going to ph this is like this is like in olden times where we had to plan where we would go and give each other congratulations and then there was no way to communicate unless we just happened to be there yeah i don't know if anybody ever lived through the time where i would actually give my friend a pay phone number and make sure they had quarters this is the thing we used to do in new york city okay yes everybody i am old okay we're going to now i already forgot where i'm going 3h right 3h 3h okay here i go see you there all right here we go oh come on enter boom ah that was quite quite a rough landing there um i think this is working okay three e a b c d e f g h i like to say h ash okay anyway here we go i uh here we go ah here i am um okay i'm here to involve technology in our society and our daytoday lives hi everyone there's somebody standing on top of you so i sort of see you only partially i think oh no my connection failed well let's see if i can get back all right am i here does anyone hear me jump if you can hear me the only way to signal people in your is with the body language of jumping all right i seem to have you know what would be a nice feature is to be able to type a little message to like pop up on the top of my head um i seem to have lost my connection i'm going to refresh and come back i don't know if anyone can hear me other than those of you who are watching i'm gonna hit refresh in the browser and i'll be right back just make sure i have sound i do all right here we go refresh i want the full experience okay okay that's like my favorite thing in yorb right now it's like flying in okay okay i'm coming back so the audio should be sharing as well i'm back sorry i lost my connection but i'm back now oh okay okay hey hey okay so um basically my project i'm looking to liminal spaces which is this idea of like transitional spaces whether in a medical or medical physical sense um and it's also kind of this internet trend like i was looking at pictures on reddit where people post these pictures of spaces with no context no people and so basically i did like an ai interpretation of that um so basically this is a web vr project uh let me know if you can see it cause i've been having some difficulty so i can't actually unfortunately wait you can't see it i see you and i hear you but i just see a black screen oh no oh no i really don't know what's happening do you see it yeah i see it do other do other people see it do other people say that no we can't see anything on the screen okay wait let me try something else um okay i can let me see if this works can you see something now no no oh my god this is so sad okay well um i don't know you know how to give my link uh this is very sad thank you for coming no i i so i think we could we can make something of this we can figure this out in a way that gives us like a moment of of of uh like a triumph so i i think if we can't see it that's maybe you could you could you i was enjoying listening to your description of the project so i'd love to hear sort of the end of that and then i can pretty easily even if you just speak it out loud kind of like put a url up on screen so i could say oh yeah let me just check it or i can actually just even i can open it up myself i'm getting the link now sorry okay okay okay i'm putting the link in the youtube oh people are oh that's not going to happen oh craig's here oh my god okay oh are you an ima lowres student yes i am oh oh this is like the most exciting thing ever to happen i didn't even realize that okay now i have so many questions yeah but i but you know maybe i won't ask you to answer all of them right now while live broadcasting but i'm just the ima lores is totally new and so it feels i kind of remember this when i would be like an ima student the undergrad program when that was new or just like blow my mind so i want to hear i'm a undergrad and i'm i'm a uh low res so yeah i got really into ima i don't know can't let it go but you so you graduated from ima undergrad yes i went to nyu shanghai and i said nyu because i was going to say we haven't had four years of the program in new york although there have been some transfer students who are yeah maybe graduated but yeah yeah okay was incredible i highly their program there is like so good and where and are your are um i'm only like now i'm like i got to stop asking people to reveal personal information while i'm live streaming but anyway just give me your tell me the url so i can uh pull it up on on screen people will actually see it or at least you're watching the youtube chat okay yeah under my name it's juju codes dot somehow like well that's weird i don't see it i'm like losing i see craig says low res right above craig julia ann myers my full name wait this is so weird i don't see it i saw your name earlier okay let me that's so strange because the the chat and this is live i think oh you mean it could be like from way before uh um i don't know i this is live though so i put it in the chat live the latest mess this is crazy this we got to figure this out the latest message i see is from presto that says why i love that do you not see the message right above that it says i need friends on here do you all want to be friends wait what my messages aren't showing up okay it's juju codes did somebody who's a moderator by accident uh okay juju codes dot github dot github dot io dot io slash liminal mind slash uh oh i'm am i going to spell this right liminal mind slash yes i think i spelled it right that's so lucky okay so i'm here it says enter my liminal mind headphones recommended click on center text to advance please do so i'm going to go forward so i'm going to narrate this and then you can sort of explain what's happening that no one can see you right now but they can hear you still yeah i'm just waiting for the stream to catch up so i can see oh yeah it's way it's way in the past uh click on center text to advance oh no yeah let me know if you hear anything there's supposed to be like a like yeah a monologue and soundscape so the monologue and soundscape are also ai generated so basically i like really gone to this idea of liminal spaces like researching like jg ballard and like the situationists and all that and so um basically i want to explore this and how ai kind of like reacts to our conversations and images of liminal spaces um so basically i trained ai on like my notes about little spaces and used an ai voice to do the voice over and then i create these images these are gann images that i bred from uh liminal space images i collected from reddit and other parts of the internet and so and then i stitched them together in photoshop to create accurate rectangular photos to create this web vr um so i learned a lot i use aframe and i wish you had a video on that i hope that's coming you know well i'd have to learn it first maybe you can uh help me figure out how to use it um yeah so i'm in there and i'm seeing this room and i see the text that says look around you and i can look around one thing i'm curious you know i have a lot of people who are watching or from all over the world are not necessarily native english speak speakers and i'm wondering if you could sort of define that might be helpful to hear in your own words like what what what you mean by liminal space like what how do you define that in terms of this product in the context of this project maybe you can't hear me i do hear the monologue do people hear the monologue very quietly well i'm going to go back into europe to see what's going on can you hear me still i can hear you now sorry oh i know oh i've been talking and talking but it must be that the uh my mic gets muted if i go to a different tab so i was curious one thing i was curious if you could just you know for viewers who might not be sort of familiar with the term or maybe you have a particular point of view of the project can you give us a definition of liminal space and how um how do you think of that for this project yeah sure so little space just basically means trans transitional transitional transitional space so basically it's a space like maybe in between uses so i feel like capitalism produces a lot of these spaces that are like for example empty malls empty parking lots like these kind of empty spaces that are in between um particular uses but also it's kind of been an internet trend in recent years you go to the subreddit liminal space a lot of people kind of post these photos and they like evoke nostalgic feelings also like people are creeped out by them i think it's like the lack of context combined with unidentifiable elements like visual indeterminacy so that was actually my link because like i realized visual indeterminacy is the quality of luminal face photos as well as gan photos i'm like really into like an art breeder and all that and so that's what kind of like the connections like i want to like create my own little space photos um kind of trained off of these ones i was collecting so the combination of like an interesting internet movement as well as like yeah liminal is like a very you know over all encompassing term but yeah wonderful that's super helpful to hear and i i i um i think you've really you know you've you've you've found something here about this sort of connection with this concept and idea and the kind of strange and you know images that are produced now by your synthetic uh images that can be produced by the different ai models um and by the way i think we discovered the mystery of the missing message uh this is this came from arnov who is a dedicated coding trained viewer i'm going to put his message up on the screen for people who are watching he says maybe the message got filtered out by youtube as it contained a link so it is true that unless you're um um yeah so the messages that don't so i suspect if you type a hello message into the chat we would see it but messages are being blocked and filtered and i actually don't i'm looking at the chat in a different place where i wouldn't actually even see the moderation panel so anyway mystery solved i know now you can now everybody can sleep sleep tonight knowing that you are you're not mysteriously blocked from the coding train yeah wonderful thank you so much for sharing that project so again just to tell anybody who's sort of tuning in here um go to uh well i'm on juju codes.github.io slash liminal spelled liminal i've got that up on the screen and then you can also visit um here some very loud banging by the way going on who that is uh yorb station 3h if you want to come and ask more questions about the project thank you so much yeah thank you and it's also on like the whole database too oh wonderful yeah awesome thank you thank you for trying i'm so glad that we found an ima uh i'm a lowres student to represent um in this like really small selection of the show so um yeah another 3b 3b okay i was gonna wrap up and leave but you you you had me at three you had me at gorblet three i could just it's so close i got no excuse i could just wander over all right i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a try okay all right awesome thank you for the recommendation i'm gonna head over there now yeah thank you bye okay we're gonna wander over everybody to 3b we'll play a little wandering over walking music here it comes hey we're wandering around ah over here to 3v but uh i i have a couple friends that have beautiful projects in in the your blood nine that are sound related i think you would enjoy okay um i'm sorry to interrupt but i wanted to let people know in this area that i am currently doing a live broadcast of the show uh visiting projects so if you want to send me away i will leave but if you would like me to stay i would love to hear about this project called cyborgian rock all right i'm going to read to you um this description of cyborgian rock a fictional entity experienced via a chatbot stimulates animistic imagination in the user explores untapped potentialities of social presence theory and technology fascinating yeah so maybe my warning was actually like i'm supposed to have a big sign oh i hear my voice again being fed back to me okay well i want to encourage everybody to come and visit the cyborgian rock um i'm actually going to click over on the website maybe i can find out some more information so like to feature this project somebody has the live stream going on on their computer and it's like coming through in your mind i'm sorry that's me okay okay uh maria's frozen for me i think oh shoot she did she just froze oh okay she hopefully she refreshes okay so we can confirm she's not running away because she's not okay because you know i don't want to i don't want anyone to feel uh that i'm invading their space [Laughter] all right we're gonna we're gonna hang out here for a few minutes um i will while we're waiting to see if maria returns i am going to head on over again to the itp show website because i am going to be leaving soon but the show will go on the show must go on and you can experience it yourself you don't need me you'll have a much better time being there on your own visiting the show so you can um if you go to the website which is uh in the video's description and up here on the screen um you can click right here to enter into your which is this 3d world that you know i'm winding around have a little uh be flexible have a little patience it's a new uh very experimental project that a ton of people are have worked incredibly hard on um and you can see the fruits of their labor here okay wait uh maria might be back no no no no craig um by the way craig who is uh uh somehow a moderator i don't know he's a little bit suspicious i actually i think i remember giving craig moderator privileges it's time to head to 9f um so um oh and sarah sarah gives her endorsement of the cyborgian rock quote let me quote i am a huge fan of the cyborgian rock that's actually there should be a big poster you know one of these like posters that has like quotes from your views from sarah i am a huge fan of the cyborgian rock this is me by the way just kind of vamping here to see maria comes back she keeps getting kicked out unfortunately okay so here's what i'm gonna do i i can't stop as much as i say i'm gonna stop i just can't i'm gonna head over to um 9f secret forest is to try to get one more project in all right now i'm getting so many recommendations i can't do it all people there's you got to go around yourself in the show i can't do it all just i'm just one person sitting in an attic in brooklyn with a lot of computer equipment and apparently a very robust internet connection the fact that all i'm live streaming all this stuff all right so we're gonna head over to nine f if um um ellen if um if um if maria comes back you can send me a discord message i i do have that up um so i will see it oh i see her okay oh you're here oh oh my goodness wait i have to play a very exciting sound effect for you okay you can't hear it but a big giant round of applause yay it's just gone off um so uh maria please tell us about the cyborgian rock all right so the cyborgian rock is a chat box actually um i build it after watching uh a couple of the videos that you made to them um about rescript oh rhyme script yes oh that's so exciting to hear amazing ah i i didn't know i it's as if i planned it this way that's so exciting to hear cool so yes and um and i was exploring this this concept of social presence the the idea that um even dots in a chat message produce a feeling of of another person or some being there and i was also very interested in animism so um the rock is is not a consumerist type of a product it is encouraging you to think um about nature to observe it stimulates uh optimistic imagination um i think um the as people interact with it i'm able to improve it and work with the uh dialogue to make it better um amazing so wait um can i can oops oh i pressed the wrong button ah here i am i'm back um can i or not me but can is it i what i'm seeing right now is this sort of like a live interaction with it um yes that's uh this is me interacting so i'm gonna go up closer can you type a message to it absolutely okay tell me what to type then um all right i'm gonna uh the chat is way behind but if anybody has a question wants to suggest a question from the uh to ask of the cyborgian rock we have a unique opportunity here this is a you know once in a lifetime opportunity to speak directly to a rock so far nobody has come up with a suggestion all right i will uh come up um let's see maybe something train themed um um can i ask the rock if um if it uh i'm really like expecting somebody like something profound to suddenly just appear into the chat but it doesn't seem to be happening i'm gonna have to come up with it myself okay um um how um how is how is the weather the weather where you are that's my like super creative question the being of hills and wind carry me across oh the beings of hillson went carried me across that is very profound what um are is the sound effects that i'm hearing part of the experience i'm hearing crickets yes these are the sounds around the rock so when i begin to type their assignments and we are not hearing anything because we're in our own presence but as soon as i exit the input box but i think this this this deserves a followup uh comment yeah i'm i have so many questions about the hills where are these hills if the wind can carry the rock let me ask the rock um are you alive this this might need a drumroll would it matter to you oh oh oh it would matter to me the chat is suggesting i ask if uh lava is good or evil it's a lava groot or evil i'm seeing some messages from some folks telling me to check out the zoom rooms i have been to one zoom room uh for sure there are some amazing projects in those almost wonderful oh i do not harm or nor serve okay wow this is is this live online somewhere like can people chat with the rock themselves absolutely yes the project description has a link okay terrific all right i'm gonna i'm gonna wander over there and show it to people and if anybody wants to come and ask more questions so you can ask your questions to the cyborgian rock directly by going to the cyborgian rock website but if you feel so inclined and want to ask your questions to the creator of the cyborgian rock then um you can come right here thank you so much for sharing this project with us take care all right so here i am and i'm on the website now i'm gonna actually just close out of yorb real quick okay sometimes like whenever i close out of europe i just feel this like enormous sigh of like i find it very stressful to be in there live streaming and people don't know that i'm live streaming and what am i going to encounter like it's it's it's very stressful i just like this is what i'm much more used to i just have a website open i'm just here talking to you the viewer i've been doing this what now for two hours getting a bit exhausted i do like i really want to see all of the projects and i i'm sad it makes me i i often i just like it pains me to see people in the chat or like come check out this project check out this project is it's just not possible for me in this context of how i'm doing it to visit all the projects so i think that i need to kind of wrap up for a minute uh i could put this into intermission stage and come back in like five or ten minutes i gotta just check on some stuff that's going on here at home nine f9 f9 f9f wow i really got a message telling me to go to 9f all right we're going to have um just a brief five minute intermission and i will be back and i'm going to head to 9f so let me just uh send this message here hold on type something i'm gonna put on my intermission sign you can still hear me actually before i do that um let me come back here so what i would like for you to do um if you are watching right now is go to the itp show website go over to projects and browse through them and let me give you a tip uh if you see one of these say zoom room please visit it um i think that the zoom rooms are waiting for you to check out their projects don't be shy um go i would like to ask everybody watching this right now while i take a fiveminute break or else you can't see me anymore to visit one zoom room okay everybody let's do it together let's all of you go pick one zoom room to visit and then i'll wander into yorb and i'll be back to go to 9f in about five minutes so do so do do do do do okay here i am i have returned if anybody's still there here i am uh all right so um i see in the i'm going to 9 f but i do see in the chat here i i it's hard for me to not take a request i see a project called blur clock which is in zoom okay ah good aiden oh and i saw young min okay here we go we're going to blur clock uh oh you don't see it um but actually so i'll bring it in uh as soon as um as soon as i'm live in here okay oh oh people can hear me yes hello hold on let me bring in your screen into this row okay here we are um say something let me make sure the audio is going through how's it going ah it definitely is okay wonderful all right first of all so thank you for coming into the chat i'm so excited that we can make this happen by the way i'm like europe is so amazing but it's i find it to be very stressful and now being in a zoom room i'm like oh this is so familiar it's so relaxed i do have and i have my sign working because just in case i arrive somewhere people aren't aware they know that this is a live broadcast all right so um i'm checking i'm on the tail end here we've looked at many projects i'm super excited to be here and hear about the blur clock so tell um each of you if you could introduce yourself and and tell us a little bit about your project surely um so my name is aiden lincoln fowler and um i'm the second year at itp and my name is young min choi also second year at itp uh this is our project called blur clock um so we built a clock that uses machine learning to detect if you're looking at it and it only shows you the time if you are look if your eyes are open in front of it so we have a webcam um and when it sees your eyes it pushes an led screen that has a clock on it towards the front and it becomes legible um and when you close your eyes it retracts the screen back into the box and becomes blurry the whole thing is based on a book called the order of time by carlo revelli and it's basically about how time only exists from a human's blurred perspective of reality and we actually make time by measuring it um we also have a clock called sunclock um young you want to talk about that yes a sunclog is an abstract version of learnclock we built a server that asks um for sunrise and sunset time when you enter zip code and based on your location it will place the sun at where he's at and right now we're showing just the whole animation throughout the day but it'll actually move really really slowly um and i can show you a quick demo of how it looks like so is that the sorry is that the clock right behind you yes so so right now it's drawing the animation no but it looks like i'm seeing it kind of like a mirror but then i saw an animation going across it but i'm just seeing it's just that's an artifice of it being a screen that is it has a piece of dichroic film on it so it acts as a twoway mirror so it changes color and it's a gradient as you walk by it but when the lights behind it you can see through oh now and now i'm seeing this is like a uh um a recorded anim uh video of the claw of the song like wow no it's not a video it's running um like on a fast a fast pace but if we set up so that you just place the time the time it would move very slowly over the course of it yeah where it is at it'll move really slowly um and where is so i see that clock where is the um the other clock the one that looks free clocks yes i'm running a local server um and we i can turn on and off sun clock or the blur clocks oh it's the same physical device that you're able to oh okay wow you're picking that up like move it back and forth you can see the color change if you if you tilt it yeah there you go so hold on i i had you aiden large there for a second so let me get um young but great yeah okay oh amazing yeah so um i hope um i because of the letter i don't think it'll work um why but um we tested before it sort of works through zoom and we can i can pin someone's video and it reads the face um and uh it moves back and forth so interesting you know it's funny i was sort of when you were talking about it for a moment i was like thinking it through and i was imagining that it worked only when you're not looking at it right which is sort of interesting to think like uh you know can you like this idea that time isn't real you can't actually get there right like if you look away it sort of is there and you look back but anyway that's neither here nor there but it's interesting to sort of think about the sort of range of possibilities um have you um so young obviously it's like it's there physically with you have you been sort of like you know i don't know if this is the right term to apply but user testing it so to speak like do you have you do you sort of like live with the clock and interact with it or the sun version or the blur clock or is it mostly just kind of like it came together very recently so um i personally like to use uh blur clock is really um fun because it's it really has like a subtle and smooth way of interacting with the clock but when you turn the clock sun clock on throughout the day it's really nice to see like because it's it's all different throughout the seasons so for example winter we have shorts a certain amount of sunlight time so it's interesting to see um how much sunlight we have but yeah it's it's it's been really great to use our tests yeah i also really like the idea that if you know you have to give it your like focused attention you know where so like the clock isn't just going to display the information it needs you to like be sort of like present with it and so there's something kind of um touching about that or unique it gives it a sort of quality of character in a way um i'm just curious so is it all um just i'm curious about some of the technical information is it all selfcontained like is there a camera in the device it's not um and there what's and you mentioned it's using machine learning so there's some like pretrained model that you're running that's taking a look at the camera image and just doing face detection or eye detection or what's um can you tell us a bit about the logistics of that sure it's all embedded and the server is running on a local host when you um turn the clock on so you it could just work with the phone and it's using opencv um eye tracking so it it first finds your face then it finds your eyes and then it checks if your eyes are open or not so it's using three different models or kind of two models and did you do both these projects for the same class are they different classes or uh we built it for time class but i i combined it with uh understanding networks so that's where we built like the app controller amazing wonderful yeah i can see now i can see it blurred right now it's funny like i'm staring that's really quite uh beautiful wonderful amazing so thank you so much for sharing this project um so for people who want to learn more um they can go to the show website that's where i found i'm just gonna pull that i'm pulling that up right here um under projects under blur clock so first of all go here you can you could be in this zoom room with us right now i'm gonna jump out real fast so before everybody comes racing in here but you could come i'm just trying to you can come and ask your questions about uh the blur clock but also i'm assuming if i click on the name blur clock i also get to a page with a description and learn more some more documentation so definitely come check out this uh wonderful work thank you so much thank you for sharing this okay i'll see you all soon oh great okay byebye byebye sean i've got to go jump to the okay all right nine f i'm i was really about to be like i think i'm done now it's 9 45 this show only goes till 10. but you know there was another part of the day today where i thought maybe i'll do a little like advent of code challenge also but all right we're going to go to the your blit9 um we are going to go to your blit9 and try to get to 9f if anyone's in there you can let them know that i'm on the way um yorb 2020. we're going into yorb sorry your music this is my walking around your music your seven eight nine here we go europe nine everybody oh what perfect timing here we go going for a landing wow i really want to know why my sign doesn't show up okay nine f here we go heading over to nine f this is going to be my last stop the train has reached the fight's final destination and we're going to head over to 9f and see what we can find out this project and like have two people who trust each other two performers perform it rather than and see how people respond to that because that's i i'm supposed to have a big sign on me that says i'm streaming but you don't see it do you uh i don't see it but i heard you say that on the stream several times i'm aware you believe me i'm gonna show it once again this is what people are supposed to see they're supposed to see this and you can even see it here in the preview it makes me crazy okay i'm i'm talking way too loud and interrupting no no hello this is like the cool low res crew over here is this another ima low res project yeah amazing and are you the creator who is standing in front of me here yeah i'm enrique and also jiro which is at my left she's also creator of this message okay wait wait wait we found enrique and then say your name hero okay so i'm gonna um uh if you don't mind uh this is being this is a live broadcast right now and so if you want to opt out that was your chance i'll run away very quietly but if you would be so kind i would love to hear about this project and i think it works pretty well especially if we wander a little bit closer to the stage because then i can get a little bit closer for people to see with you also in the frame yeah sure so if you want to come like stand like off to the side there that's perfect where you are and hero if you want to come there too i've got now i've got a nice view of both of of just enrique okay yeah take it away okay so this is i am an amelo rest project for a class called connections lab and this is our secret forest that you and i created for you all so it is an interactive experience that we it's a collective interactive experience so maybe if you want daniel you can join us there if you go to the poster and at the bottom part there is a link that will take you to our secret forest when we can play together okay shall i head there now or is there anything else you want to tell us before i do maybe we can express it like first and then okay then i'll come back okay i'm gonna do that i'm heading to the poster well there's so many people here uh oh there's the poster here we go secret forest i'm clicking on the poster at no people on my way okay i got it and now i'm gonna go to project website i'm gonna open that a new tab so hopefully i'll still be here in yorb but um i'm heading over to that other tab allow move my nose into the hexagon okay ready to play oh i'm in the forest and my my sign is here whoa [Laughter] oh boy are people hearing this this is amazing i guess i should put my camera back on fly into the forest listen to the music okay this is amazing i think i'm gonna go back into europe now let me close this tab come back here okay i've come back hey yeah so that was our secret forest amazing you know it's interesting i couldn't i found myself just swaying and then i couldn't stop swaying you know just i settled into like a groove with it and then i almost wanted it it's very beautiful to look at but i also felt this moment that i just wanted to kind of close my eyes it's actually a really nice project for me to sort of like finish off my wandering through the show because it's uh it's very relaxing and soothing is that the sort of intention behind it to bring people together in a networked way but with a different feeling than we might have ordinarily and and i i don't mean to describe your project to you i'm giving you my sort of impression of it but i'd like to hear about some of the reasons why you made it and what you imagined the experience to be yeah uh maybe do you want to talk about that part yeah the project idea is actually uh starting from very simple idea how we can bring the music experience online and through our user test we we find overlapped two people together is the most people love experience so we go for this direction and and then we how to say develop our project and we want to focus that part how to build an intimate relationship when both of us uh remotely but we actually are in the same place to to to to build a deep connection with each other yeah maybe enrique can add more about that project yes ah this comes in many different ways like uh we wanted to do a musical instrument for the web but also like uh like very based on uh many collaborative projects like i don't know like even physical ones like react table and uh just like this sense of can like playing together and then that uh lead us to this intimate uh kind of setting when you overlap people and you can have like this shared space and i think that's like a part of the uh benefits of of doing this in web because you can connect people and to allow them to to play in this this kind of scenario wonderful is it um is it only a twoperson experience or is it as many people who join no i think for the prototype it's only allowed two maybe three or four because we want to develop this project in a long way so we also imagine how this project can be in the public space to to install some screen in the public space so people can interact with people how to say in the other place so so to build that physical space remote relationship but it's intimate connection yeah actually like like in the technical part you can yeah like many people can join but i think it's designed only for for two people and do you imagine that people would use it in the sort of way we did here where we sort of came together and said oh let's go there and try it or would it be something that you you know you end up in it with a random person that you don't know is that part of your thinking behind it in terms of how two people would find each other to experience it yeah that's a good question actually uh i think uh there's like we see two ways for this project like to evolve into maybe we can do both but uh like first one it's like a musical interactive experience uh that maybe can be on a public space or something like that and the other one it's a performance tool for actual institutions to create with people around the globe so it depends on which direction we want to take which um two other things that i just like to say that i really love about it one is i loved your use of hexagons like i'm so used to interacting with sort of gridbased pixelbased systems and something about the hexagonal pattern is just has a different quality to it that is um just gives it a unique feeling and it's very like sort of playful um uh abstract quality that's just like taking that makes it feel less like computery in a nice way but still very sort of geometric and understandable and then also i think you've found like it's always really tricky with these projects to strike the right balance between um my i want to be able to see what i'm doing and understand what i'm doing as but i don't really want to be fully there like i need it to be abs it makes me uncomfortable to be like sort of like looking in a mirror with my camera fully on display of course that's what we're all doing right now i do all the time but there's something nice i think you know
