I have some uh rainbow sweatbands the problem is there's Green in this so I think you're seeing this like invisible stripe with the computer behind me but if I switch to over here you can see what this actually looks like oh the light's not on over here okay I don't think I can I don't know if I can manage to get myself to actually wear this uh welcome good morning this is coding rainbow my name is Dan uh it is uh Tuesday August 2nd welcome to August I am live from the school for poetic computation in New York City I'm going to be here for approximately 1 hour and a half I got about a 20 minute late start here so the time is going to be a little bit short today but I will be also be back on Thursday so this week the live streams will be today and this coming Thursday I have a bell just getting new things for this uh thing called cating rainbow I have some stickers and I know if you can see these can you see these where's my like hey camera 4 oh there is no camera 4 where's the director there's nobody else here but me who can like do a tight shot of these stickers uh I can talk about where you can get these stickers if you want in a little bit um I want to kind of get started uh today as quickly as possible with a coding Challenge and uh the coding challenge that has been requested uh and Thumbs Up by a bunch of people is um is uh uh Flappy Bird so I am going to uh something that surprised me that's actually become a little popular one my most watched video on YouTube is a coding challenge where I programmed from scratch the snake game good oldfashioned snake game uh in JavaScript so I think I'm going to do a Flappy Bird game today and actually I have a ulterior motive for doing Flappy Bird today which is that I am leading towards eventually it's taking me a lot longer to get to this um some machine machine learning videos and what I want to do is have a machine Learning System that analyzes the current pixels it just sort of looks uh almost as if like a camera pointed at the screen uh and then knows when to press the space bar to make the bird kind of go up versus go down so uh if we have this example of a kind of a a simple interaction a one button game of playing Flappy Bird we can look at a machine learning algorithm to play it automatically and uh again you know the point of this channel is not that you will then go and have your own machine learning algorithm playing Flappy Bird but you will take some of these Concepts and realize them in new creative and exciting beautiful ways um so uh let me see what else just I can briefly tell you if you are new um if you would uh so the if you're looking for more of this stuff uh you can go to everything that you need H everything that you might need related to this coding rainbow channel is here at coding rainbow.com uh you I encourage you to uh press sub subscribe uh you can you're also welcome to uh participate in a coding rainbow slack channel uh by becoming a patron on a crowdfunding site called patreon and if you would like to find out when I do these live streams I send out email announcements and you can also scroll down and put your email in here okay that's all I'm going to say intro wise today uh and I'm just going to kind of get started already so there's a chat going I assume everybody can kind of see and hear me okay in the chat you can see I don't know if you can see my new stickers here there's green on the stickers so I don't know if it shows through uh and we're just going to kind of get started here let's go to with the one thing I wanted to show you which is there is also a uh GitHub repository uh oh yeah uses my hand to see if it SE through yes that actually won't work I I recognized that Oliver how absurd that was that I just did that um okay uh there is also this GitHub repository coding rainbowrainbow topics this is where you can suggest a topic it's kind of like exploding I I make a lot of videos each week and I'm kind of churning stuff out at the same time I cannot possibly keep up with this list um but it is uh here and you can see four minutes ago Cube Helix visualizer what is that whoa I made a cube Helix visualizer based on this it'll be interesting how you would tackle it perhaps with actual 3D instead of fake 3D a little bit afraid to click on this let's click on this this is from joerger if I pronounce that correctly whoa that is quite nice uh and there looks like there's some sliders here oo this is quite nice uh anyway you guys can find this on your own and look at it more later I would love to take this on as a challenge uh something I also do often is I go here to sort and I sort by a thumbs up and you can see what's kind of uh rising to the top here machine learning uh which I'm trying to get to computer vision I've done a bunch of genetic algorithms I actually finished all the genetic algorithms videos although I still want to do um traveling salesperson problem with a genetic algorithm so I will get to that um and all of that stuff so um let me mention actually because something that's I think happened is that most of the people who most of you the viewers who have found this channel already know something about programming uh most of you who are supporting and participating in this GitHub uh reposit who supporting on patreon or subscribed or contributing this GitHub repository already know about programming but it has come up I one of the reasons for this channel is not to do Advanced tutorials about programming my goal is to have a wide range of tutorials from complete and total beginner to medium to intermediate to more intermediate but I want everything to be friendly and accessible but obviously different tutorials that I make you kind of kind of have uh you've got to come with some knowledge or with no knowledge so I just want to point out for you guys to help share with the world that and I think I could do a probably a better job of organizing this but if I go to my channel here uh I want you to uh right now I guess I'm live right now does it say that I'm live I could watch myself live um that if uh uh right here this right here these playlists playlist 1 through six foundations of programming in JavaScript these this playlist is for complete and total beginners you don't have to know anything whatsoever so that is someplace you could get started and then find your way to some of these more intermediate topics that I'm doing and then there also if I scroll down here these tutorials now these are quite old I made these uh probably four or five years ago but the learning processing are also beginner tutorials the difference is learning processing uses a programming environment called processing and the the um the other one one through six foundations of programming in JavaScript uses something called p5js you know we could be here forever talking about why you might pick one or the other I suppose this might make a little more sense in that I made them more recently but um you can kind of choose and and and that sort of thing so um uh the wgb Bros uh mentions in the chat um uh JS is client side maybe you want to do some things server side it's funny you should mention that I am planning this fall to do more uh node.js server side programming tutorials I have done some already the two playlists that I have about servers side programming one is for making Twitter boot using node and another is a tutorial for making a shared drawing canvas using something called websockets both of those require service side programming and both of those tutorial playlists you can find them uh kind of give you some beginner uh getting started information about node however this fall something I will mention that I'm planning to do uh uh shiftman GitHub ah I teach a course at ITP uh which is a a master's program at New York University called programming from A to Z you can see this is the website for last year there will be a new one for 2016 and this uh this course is all about programming with text based data in JavaScript making poetry machines reading massive like tones of text and like generating new text out of them using Markov chains and grammars and hoping to actually insert some machine learning into this course but one of the things that I'm going to do this fall is do more server side programming with this because there's a lot of uh good and interesting uh text analysis node packages you know typically a lot of this material you might find um in Python libraries but as I'm kind of doing stuff for the web and the browser side I'm using JavaScript so this is coming this fall all the videos for this course will be free in online but if you want to participate in a uh an online channel to discuss assignments and Share work um that's my slack messaging me right now I'm going to turn the sound off here uh you can uh uh support um you can sign up for the uh crowdfunding patreon okay so uh that's what I want to say I've got my soundboard working with some music in case it gets too hot in here I have a sweatband sweat a headband we're going to do a coding challenge I got to put put these on get ready for the coding challenge I have a watch on will this go over my watch I think I'm going to do this in JavaScript but oh no wrong sound effect very important when programming JavaScript not to forget the okay uh uh cannot post links some of you in the chat can post links um uh okay so here we go the problem is the green right is a little bit weird that I have this like slice invisible slice in the middle of my head okay um now let's get started because we don't have a lot of time I only have a little over an hour left and I want to get started here okay so flappy birds let's look up some information here let's get going here Flappy Bird Bird play Flappy Bird let's look at that let's look at Flappy Bird on Wikipedia okay so flappy bird you may or may not be familiar with Flappy Bird let's take a look will this actually let me play it oh look at that it kind of goes up and down oops look at this like ridiculous like advertising now okay it's GNA make me watch a message from the sponsor um Flappy Bird is a really simple game uh it was quite popular um and uh it was built in 2013 By Vietnamese artist and programmer dong win did I pronounce that correctly any of you who know uh I I I sort of had this memory of it being released and then it was like so popular and it was taken down now everyone's making Flappy Bird clones um I I think as an interesting exercise here I'm going to try to program this game from scratch I kind of wanted to just play it for a second let's go to continue boy this was a terrible this is this website is no good at all it's just only advertisements can I click on this this is like ridiculous uh uh let's look let's look let's let's look for uh Flappy Bird um JavaScript whatever I'm just G to make it I think I have a sense of it is there like a little animation I know what we can do uh Flappy bird YouTube let's watch a little video of it uh uh okay here we go so let's let's forget this advertisement for a second come on can I not skip this ad this going to make me watch a full 30 second ad here what's wrong with this YouTube ad stuff okay I just wanted to get a visual reference of the game play to help me as I start to program it I I don't know that I've ever actually played Flappy Bird I'm culturally aware of it and I've definitely seen it uh okay here we go let's see there we go okay so you can see the idea here there's a bird it falls um the the bird flies every time you tap a force push pushes that bird up and the idea is you want to get it through these like pipe things oh this is so this is like isn't it sort of beautiful I think these one button games are so beautiful the sort of like addictive like crazy quality to it I can see myself having a serious problem with this game okay so um let's get ourselves going here I'm going to open up Adam is the my sort of preferred text editor of the day oh somebody mentioned to me on Twitter like a an Adam package with live reload and a web server does anybody um does anybody I forget it I'm going to do it my own old fat somebody in the chat I don't want to waste time here let's open up terminal uh uh desktop give you guys some music here so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8 9 tax I did recently apparently but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this 2 three 4 3 four five 6 5 4 7 5 six 7 five 6 S 8 N9 876 look this is like pearlin noise performance heart 2 4 2 1 2 4 3 four 5 6 let's make a like PE noise perform birs file and a pipe. JS file but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this I'm just getting set up I'm not going to I'm going to all the I'm going to write all the code live in the tutorial this is that is that is noise so this ising noise that is noise no that is so this ising noise that is what is this craziness what is this craziness idea what this is some strange new notification on like but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this oh something's going on with the beauy I hope my Adam isn't broken 4 four five six how do I get pear noise performance art is there a okay hold on let me at least see if this is working is the um is the uh oh sorry everybody is the background noise uh too loud compared to my voice I will I will fix that if that's the case that was a package error it's a bug I know I I don't mind ignoring it oh the file could be readon I don't uh let's go to here uh yeah close oh camera went off H I might switch to using Sublime if this is going to if this is going to cause me a problem uh I'll have to look into this later let me just try restarting Adam no all right um uh make sure yeah everything seems fine I'm just going to use Sublime to not worry about this very happy with Sublime Text as well I don't have my I don't have beautify and Sublime that's going to drive me crazy oh this is very sad how do I what's the uh what's the um key key code uh show the trace okay let's not let's not worry about is is this distracting that my head looks like it's going to fall off maybe that's a little bit better is that better okay all right everybody welcome to today's coding challenge we are going to recreate Flappy Bird in JavaScript in what I hope won't take very long I sort of feel like how long could it possibly take okay waits for supp okay let's see how's how we going here we've got 43 people watching thank you all for being here and here we go 45 F Looper okay everybody what's the over under on how long this is going to take me I'm guessing 20 minutes it's going to be longer it's probably GNA be 30 minutes yeah everybody place your bets now is that Bell a very harsh sound let's see no doesn't seem so bad I have a bell three days 25 minutes uh 30 minutes okay here we go everybody uh we're going to start here uh and I put a coding rainbow sticker on is this a waste of a sticker these stickers are kind of expensive 42 one guy made it in processing with 50 to 75 lines so arson arson says in the chat one guy made it in processing with 50 to 75 lines I'm not trying to do this with as little as few lines of code as possible in fact I'm probably going to overdo it there okay here we go let me uh cycle the camera I don't think I need the uh whiteboard I don't think I'm going to use the Whiteboard for this but just in case um nah forget it okay yeah uh okay you guys are all making excellent comments in the chat here we go I'm actually GNA put on a timer here oh Adam live server that's what it is uh uh okay uh hold on I'm looking at my phone this is the worst this is my worst live stream ever but I was getting some important messages and what I wanted to do is put on a stopwatch I have a timer thing that I put on the screen but I don't have time to do that okay stopwatch going hello and welcome to a new cing cing coding let's try this again hello and welcome to a coding rainbow coding challenge today's coding challenge I'm going to attempt to make uh a Flappy Bird clone which I admit is kind of like a bit of a cliche probably at this point I don't know how many people have made Flappy Bird clone tutorial whatevers on in the world but it was requested I think it'll be fun I'm going to give it a try I'm going to do it in JavaScript I'm going to try to do it fast but with time to explain and time to relax and and just enjoy myself and Hope hope you might enjoy watching this so um if you're not familiar with Flappy Bird then I would say pause this video go and familiarize yourself with it I actually don't think I've ever actually played it before but I am somewhat familiar with the gameplay we'll see how well I do I've got a live chat going on and you guys can uh tell me how I'm doing if you're watching this as a YouTube archive you won't be able to follow along live but that's fine okay so I'm using p5js which is a JavaScript framework has a function setup it has a function draw and so the only thing I've got so far in the browser is just a canvas that's 400 by 600 pixels and a black background on that canvas so the first thing that I want to do I actually have a a separate Javascript file called bird. JS and I'm actually going to make this a uh Constructor function and the bird all all the bird really needs is a y value right the bird moves up and down and it stays in one spot so I'm going to give this uh bird I'm going to start the bird off in the center of the window and I'm going to write also a function called show uh where I draw the bird and again I'm going to my design is going to be very poor so it's going to be up to you to take my code which will be linked in this description to make something more beautiful and interesting and riff off of this so I'm just going to say uh let's make a white circle and you know what let's give this bird an X position as well even though it will be fixed but let's just try uh 25 for right now and I'm going to uh never forget that this you always need this dot in JavaScript um so let's make this bird a circle and let's say in the main program now VAR bird and we're going to say bird equals new bird and bird. show so we should have something a little bit more interesting now ah there it is bird with divided by two you know it would probably make more sense if I want the bird to be in the middle to be height divided by two so let's fix that I'm going to say height divided by two I think the bird could be a little bit bigger and the bird could be a little bit more in on the screen so there we go this is the beginning of Flappy Bird now what happens to the bird without you doing anything the bird falls down so oops oops wrong window so I'm going to go here and I'm going to say this. update equals function and it would be good to have some sort of variable called gravity and gravity being the force that's pushing uh that bird down and let's say that that the gravity here is going to be one I also need a velocity right I need a velocity so gravity is the force that's causing the velocity of the bird to increase so I'm going to say this do velocity equals zero and now I'm going to say this.y changes by this do velocity and this do velocity changes by this dot gravity okay so now we have a function that's going to push that bird down so I'm going to go over here and I'm going to say uh also bird. update there we go bye bird it flew down now we should probably do something where the bird stops when it gets to the bottom of the window that makes sense so I'm going to go back to the bird and I'm going to say I'll just do this in the update function I could write a separate and I'm going to say if this doy is greater than height then um then I'm just going to uh keep the bird on the screen I'm going to say this.y equals height and I'm also going to uh set that velocity to zero so we can see here that bird stops I don't know if that's actually what happens in Flappy Bird but I just kind of want to do that anyway and you know what I'm going to do that also for the top of the window because ultimately I'm going to be able to push the bird up so let's do that for Less Than Zero uh now of course so okay so now what how does the game work I think it's a mobile game right you could tap your mobile device this is my mobile device so I'm going to as a tap I'm going to just use the space bar on my keyboard so in um p5js I can write a function called key pressed and I can check to see if the key is the space bar um and let me just make sure this is working uh I'm just going to console log something right now so I'm going to run this and you can see each time I press the space bar uh it says here in the console uh it prints out space so that works so what do I want to do I want to cause a force to cause that bird to go up so I'm going to say bird. up and so what's going to happen with this bird do up function uh what do I want to do I want instead of the Velocity being pushed down by gravity I want to say this do velocity minus equals I want it to go up or I could say plus equals but some minus amount now what if I just said minus this do gravity let's try that for a second just to see what happens come on wait oh you know what's a little bit annoying I have to oh I took off that console.log hold on let's say minus equals this.g gravity time 10 so nothing's working here and I have a kind of a a sneaking suspicion that I've done something totally wrong a bird dot up let's make sure this is happening uh uh I'm going to say print line uh this. velocity okay so you can see that's working so let's try to tune I think there's sort of an issue here we've got to sort of tune the numbers so let's make the gravity just for right now a lot less strong so it's not going so fast now you can see though that this isn't really um doing very much let's make a uh this do up Force let's call this lift uh and we'll say it's 10 so I'm going to say this stop velocity plus equal this. lift not left lift there we go so you can see there's there's sort of an element of tuning those numbers so now it doesn't really feel like it's falling fast enough but me pushing the space bar is kind of working now does it what happens if I hold down the space bar so that's good okay so that lift is too much let's make the gravity point six and let's keep the lift there but now I'm going to need to make the lift A Little Bit Stronger there we go so this so now I have I sort of have the game going the lift is a little bit too strong uh let's make it less strong so there's you know some things something that I could do is actually limit the top speed or also or also like give it some um something that I could also do is is add some like air resistance in general which I could say something like this do velocity times equal 0.9 so that actually like helps with things quite a bit because it's just there's some there's sort of like a limit to what the speed is so now I've got something that is a bit more kind of like reasonable to play here so you could spend your time tuning this even more but I think just like keeping the velocity keeping some like are resistance by always shrinking the velocity a little bit uh tuning how much the lift is versus the gravity those types of things you can kind of play around with okay so now we have the basic game mechanic here which is just a falling Circle and each time I press the space bar I can kind of like have it lift up a little bit now what do we need to add we need to add those pipe things that kind of come from the right of the screen I'm only at eight minutes by the way which is pretty good the pipes things that come from the right of the screen and you have to steer your way through let's see if we can do this so um let's think about this I'm going to also create a pipe object with a Constructor function and let's think about what is a pipe need so a pipe needs I would say it's going to extend from the top to somewhere in the middle of the screen and then somewhere further down to the bottom so I need um I'm going to say like a a value called top which is going to be some random amount between the top of the screen and the middle of the screen and let's say this do bottom is some random amount also between the middle of the screen and the bottom of the screen and the the pipe also needs an X position which is always going to start at the edge of the screen and then let's let's write a function called show where I draw the pipe as uh White fill white and I draw a rectangle at this.x comma zero all the way with a width of like let's say the width is 20 and let's actually make that a variable and uh this width and also uh the height then is this do top and then I need another rectangle which uh starts from the bottom minus how tall it is and let's make uh minus this.bottom and its height is this.bottom okay pause I'm going to do an edit Point here because I really think that using the white the Whiteboard would be useful so this is when I publish this coding challenge I'm actually going to edit this part out uh because I'm kind of thinking it in my head but I feel like uh showing it on the Whiteboard would be useful uh so let me just erase the Whiteboard real quick I should have obviously I should have done this before I started uh okay so now I need a marker do I have a good marker somewhere okay uh will this marker work I think so can you see that screen okay um so I'm actually going to now go back into the video and draw a quick diagram okay in case this isn't making sense to you let's actually let's actually do a quick diagram here uh what I'm trying to do is create something that looks like this so I need two random numbers this length is what I'm calling Top This length is what I'm calling bottom and then this length this this width is what I'm calling W so I first draw a rectangle from here here with this width with a height of top and then I draw a rectangle from here which is height minus bottom which is this point with this width and then the height of that rectangle is bottom so this is what I'm get and if these values are random I'll sometimes get stuff that looks like this Etc now I could be more thoughtful like right now the way that I'm doing it there's this you could never get something that looks like this so it probably would make a uh I could probably do something different where I pick like a random empty amount of space and and then I pick a random starting point for that empty amount of space that might be interesting to do we can make that as an improvement later but let's just stick with what I have right now which I think is good enough okay I'm back over here and let's just see now I need a function like this. update and all I want to do in this. update is say this.x minus equals uh some speed this. speeed so uh let's say uh this do speed is always going to be five I'm going to just so all all of these are always going to move to the left so let's look now here in sketch I'm going to create uh an array called pipes and what I'm going to do is say uh pipes. push a new pipe and then in draw I'm going to say uh for all of the pipes in the array yeah I also have a problem with this somebody in the chat saying where I could technically have a pipe with no space in it so all that stuff can be corrected later and I want to say show and I want to say update so let's run this now and see there we go oh that's moving quite fast so let's go back to the pipe and let's just make the speed one so we could see ah look we basically have Flappy Bird already and it's so easy to play so it's moving kind of slow now but of course I only have one so let's think about this what a couple things that I want to do one is I want to um I want to say something like if frame count I want to have a pipe every like so often modulus 40 equals z which means every 40 frames the modulus operator being the remainder of division so anytime a number is divisible by 40 with a remainder of zero is 0 40 80 120 160 Etc let's add a new pipe and let's see how this looks oh that's a lot of that's a lot of every 40 Fram is quite a few oh look at this oh I'm pretty good at this I need some like music to play along with this okay so that's no good obviously let's um let's make the pipes move a little bit faster twice as fast and let's uh let's say every 100 frames so obviously you can see um how uh the speed of the pipes how frequent they are and we can see basically I have the game right now now I've made a very easy version of the game to play uh it's not very hard but one thing that I haven't done is figure out when I need to actually you know this I'm I'm doing a great job here so let's actually add something that shows us when the circle hits the pipe or doesn't hit the pipe so and also by the way I should be getting rid of the pipes at some point so one thing I should do is I should I should say if pipes index I uh is finished and I can actually just say x is less than zero and you know what I'm going to write a function I'll write a function called off screen so if the pipe is off the screen I want to say pipes. spce uh i1 so splice is a function that deletes an element from the array so I want to know if the pipe went off the screen get rid of it I don't need it anymore now of course there's a little bit of an issue here which is one is there's no such thing as a function called off screen that's a function I have to write there's another issue here which is that when I'm deleting stuff out of the array I should go through the array backwards and I've covered that in other videos but basically the array slides the elements slide back and if I'm going forwards the element slide back while I'm going forward I could end up skipping things um so I'm just going to switch my Loop to saying uh greater than or equal to zero and I minus minus and then I'm going to if I run this right no function named offscreen so I have to go into the pipe and I have to write a function called this. offscreen is a function and this is very simple I can just say if thisx is less than W right because I want it to be all the way off so it's with that has to be all the way off uh return true uh else return false and now I know all of you watching this video are going to complain to me and just say but couldn't you just say return this.x is less than negative W because that evaluates the true or false yes I could do that but you know what sometimes I like to write my code this way I like it to be longwind did multiple Lin I love the way the curly brackets just Nest themselves so beautifully I love to say return true return false you can write your code a different way but yeah uh and now I sort of feel like I should change it but I'm not going to I'll do it later okay so coming back let's see now we should see o w is not defined so I have to say always forget to this stu okay uh now we should see now I can't really tell if this is working I can only assume this is working but if I do something I say like this oh pipes. length if I look at the length of that array it's two and it's always two so even though I'm adding more and more they're getting deleted okay so we can be pretty sure that that's working okay now let's see now we've got to do the exciting part here I mean this whole thing hopefully is somewhat exciting but we've really got to get the gameplay mechanic where you it's going to give some visual feedback if you hit one of those pipes so let's think about how we might write this ultimately here's where I'm I have this single bird that says bird. update bird. show and I'm also looping through all the pipes so one thing I could do I don't really need to do it this way but I'm G to uh I'm going to move this Loop first uh just so the bird comes after and I'm going to say uh here I'm going to say if pipes's index I hits the bird then do something I'm just going to say console.log hit so I need to have a function that determines if a pipe has hit the bird so if looking at this bit of code you can see here what do I need to write I need to write a function called hits and that function is going to be part of the pipe object and it's going to receive a bird object as an argument so I'm going to go to the pipe object I'm going to write I'm just going to write the function up there here this do hits I called it hits equals function bird and now I just need to check what do I need to check I need to check if bird doy is less than the top and bird or or bird doy is greater than height minus this.bottom so if the bird is is ever uh if if I come back here to my whiteboard if the bird is ever right less than top or greater than height minus bottom here then it's kind of it's it's hitting that it's hitting that pipe so let's come back over here did I get that right it's greater than okay so then I want to say uh a return true although this isn't good enough right it's also got to be within the actual exposition so we should also say and um I could I'm I could be much better about how I construct this but I'm going to inside here go so let's just say it's within that stuff also let's now check if bird dox its exp position is greater than uh this.x and and bird dox is less than this.x plus this.w so I'm also just checking if it's in between the actual exposition of the pipe so if all of that is true I'm going to return true you know I'm just working it out we could I could this double if statement is kind of an awful way to write this and I could probably be more clever and I could write a separate function that just tests intersection between a circle and a rectangle but right now this will be good enough for us right now and I I look forward to hearing your improvements and suggestions in the comments so let's just see here uh if whoops right now I'm not seeing anything hit hit ah so this is basically working you can see that any time oh this is going to be hard oh so let's actually give ourselves some visual feedback um if this is the case uh let's let's write a variable called highlight set it equal to false let's also say this. highlight equals true and then under fill under show I'm going to say if this. highlight I'm going to say fill uh to I'm going to make it red so let's just see if this gives us some nice visual feedback oh you know what I never said highlight equal to false so watch it hits it so you know that's fine but I might want to uh actually also say uh uh this do highlight equals false oh if it's not hitting it so now here we go it hit hits it you can see so now I could add like score I could be more careful about like I'm really only checking the center go go go go go go go who this is way too easy to play oh there we go okay so you get the idea so I I think that I've kind of completed this um there's a lot of improvements that I would want to make to this in terms of being more thoughtful about checking that intersection to be a bit more precise good enough though be a bit I could do a better job of picking the um the the way that uh oh here's a difficult one a better job of how I pick the top and bottom Heights of these rectangles um I could add score right you start with the score maybe as time goes on your score goes up every time you hit a pip the score goes down all those things I I I would say um ask me your questions in the comments uh suggest make versions of this and and tweet me your uh exciting you know you could make a nice Bird design you could reimagine this entire game to not be a bird in pipes but to be you know a flower in rainbows I don't know how that would work um so uh so um tweet me and share with me all of your uh interesting variations on this and I'll maybe come back and do some a Q&A video where I follow up on some of your questions and make some improvements to this Flappy Bird challenge okay thanks for watching and I will see you in a future coding challenge goodbye all right everyone my hands are detached uh so um uh the WG Bros makes a great suggestion in the chat make it find the nearest XY coordinates of the pipe to the circle and check if the distance is less than the radius of the bird yes uh was it 25 minutes yeah 20 I I see 23 minutes but there was like 30 seconds to a minute in there where I um uh I erase the Whiteboard that'll get edited out when I make a sort of edited version of this okay um how any questions any comments I forgot to hit the bell at the end that's the reason for this Bell um oops wrong buttoning power all right ah so uh Jack Napier in the chat asks does anybody know um how I changed the theme of P5 so I'm not actually using the P5 editor I'm using Sublime Text as an editor and just running a local server in the background um which I have a video actually that shows how to do that if you look for like Google on YouTube search on YouTube shiftman local server P5 or something you'll find it okay so um today I feel like the theme of today is game stuff I really picked the simple one to start with um a lot of I've had this request to do uh agar iio how do you say it agario agar.io I'm going to click play as a guest so this is also a very simple game where with this mouse I move a and is it always moving in the oops I lost um continue no play as guest uh let me just see here now so it's always moving exactly in the direction of the mouse uh uh and I guess the idea is that I I can eat the smaller things and if something that's bigger than me gets me then I die but if I get something that's if I get something that I'm bigger then I eat it and this is all multiplayer and networked and people have names and they're on teams and someone's oh oh we're just like punching each other here when we we to similar in size like how do I yeah so that one was big enough me to me so um so I don't I've actually never played this game till well I looked at it last night actually when I was thinking about things that I would do today so this doing this as a coding challenge presents a lot of complications one is to do the full multiplayer aspect of it I need quite an elaborate web server system using sockets and managing a list of players and you know some sort of scale you know terms of people connected to it um so I think I could do this in a multipart series maybe I should should do the traveling salesperson today aarion is that what it's called um um so I'm trying to think of what how to best use the time that I have left today I had this list let me look at my list you guys Talk Amongst yourself for a second uh okay um I'm looking for my list of topics that I had that I was thinking about oh yeah oh I forgot about the point sampling I'm afraid of this agario thing let me check the chat see what everybody saying you can also split yourself and fire things that are viruses interesting no n at the end okay um so I would be I think this is interesting the other thing I like about this is I like how these are kind of like a little bit Blobby and we can make them a little bit Blobby so um so let's keep with the theme of games today I did Flappy Bird and let's try to begin this agario thing I could always do Tetris there's no way I'm doing Tetris today so I don't I'm I'm only going to be here for about another half an hour or so um yeah I should make a way that you can launch sounds remotely um so let's um okay play my Flappy Bird game for a little bit I feeling a little tired a little sad uh okay trigger Frogger froger oo I love the idea of Frogger hold on Frogger classic uh so how do I do this oh how lovely this is probably much harder to do than you would think sorry I just got distracted by enjoying playing froger oh why do I oh I have to get on the things I forgot you know I I kind of want to do this but I want to think about this this is great somebody add this somebody add Frogger to uh oops somebody add Frogger to the uh rainbow topics uh GitHub and we're going to work I just all I need is for uh somebody to tell me how to pronounce agario and I'm to start doing that as the next coding challenge so let's go get Flappy Bird and uh AAR AAR IO yes ad all let's just make this okay and I'm gonna open this again in Sublime oh that's Adam I forgot that Adam wasn't working for me and we're going to close Floppy Bird and I'm going to make this an object I'm going to make this called blob and uh I'm gonna get rid of this and uh get rid of all this stuff uh that's the correct way to say it okay uh okay and setup draw I didn't eat a big enough breakfast today this is a problem uh and here it is okay great uh pipe is missing I don't need that this is blob let's give myself a slightly larger pixel space see if we can manage that I think that works console doesn't need to be so big um yeah I have been using um I have been using Adam the adom editor uh in most of my videos as a text editor but for some reason um I'm getting a weird error in it this morning and I don't feel like wasting time uh okay I uh so a lot of you are asking about Flappy Bird I just made made Flappy Bird so when the archive of the stream gets released you'll be able to watch that back and then there'll be an I actually there's one small edit point in it where I was like erasing the Whiteboard that'll also be published as a separate video uh actually you know what I uh okay um I'm sad to hear that the stream is not working for some of you I don't I don't have any um I don't have any um good advice for you guys about that okay so let's look up uh let me go here is is can I find a Wikipedia page for this uh yep okay matius Bala valadares uh okay so those of you who are having problems with the stream I wish I could uh do something about that right now but one thing I'll say is all of this is being recorded so at you know apologize that maybe it's not working so great for you live right now um but it will be published as an archive you'll be able to watch it later okay okay um right I guess I'm talking to the people who can't watch the stream as if they can hear me which is a bit of a problem okay okay getting ready for this oops power where's all my special effects special effects aren't happening right now okay so um let's recycle the camera I'm doing this in JavaScript okay here we go so oops no okay so I think this will be um the last coding challenge for today and then I'll hopefully have some time to take uh some questions at the end uh okay I like how people in the chat are asking what is happening why is he dancing clearly first time viewers uh hold on you might also be wondering why am I attaching stickers to myself there oh you can't really see that one that's another sticker okay here we go hello and welcome to another game coding challenge now this was suggested to me by a actually hold timeout let's find it start over all right start here I'm starting again hello everyone welcome to another coding challenge today's coding challenge is agario agar.io agario a game that I am was not familiar with until recently when little a on GitHub suggested this particular game I looked it up I played it for a few minutes uh it's a massively multi player game uh created by matus valadas I don't know if I'm um uh um pronouncing that correctly you could go to agar.io and play it yourself but basically you're this blob moving around the screen and you eat other blobs now here's the thing this is actually quite complex the simple mechanic I think it's going to be hopefully something easy that I can Implement in this short video but I'm going to do this in several stages and so part one is going I'm going to implement the basic game mechanic and in part two I will start to look at how you we might how I might use you might use websockets to create a multiplayer version of this game so this video is just going to be the basic game mechanic so I'm using the p5js framework I'm using the suime uh text editor I have a canvas and a black background that's all I'm starting with and I also I've created a separate oops darn ah oh pause or don't pause hold on uh yeah pause oh yeah hopefully I didn't mess up the Flappy Bird thing edit point back in sorry Mata um and I also have a Javascript file called blob. JS where I'm going to write a Constructor function to create this idea of a blob object The Blob object will serve to be both you the blob moving around the screen as well as other little blobs that you are trying to eat so what is this blob need now I'm going to use Vector objects which are something that exists in P5 a vector being an object that stores an X and A Y component for a position on the screen and lots of other things that we could do with that so I'm going to say this. pause equals create Victor Vector Victor what's your Victor Vector uh width divided by two height divided by two and then I'm going to write a function called show uh which actually since it's in this object I'm going to write this. show equals function and I'm going to say Phill 255 and I'm going to draw an ellipse at this.x this.y and I also I definitely need a variable to keep track of the radius the size of this blob let's just make it 32 or 64 to start with so then the size of the ellipse is the radius times two and the height is the radius times two so now if I go to sketch I can just say VAR blob blob equals new blob blob. show so let's just see where's the blob oh something's going terribly wrong pause oh don't pause or pause I'm kind of being silly here where I forgot the whole point of this was I made a vector called pause for position and then I tried to draw it at this.x which doesn't exist so this.x this. p.y there we go so there we are in the window now this is something a little bit crazy as I just realized as part of this game so I want to move around the space so the but the thing is I don't in the game this blob that you're seeing on the screen right here moves but visually it stays the same and rather the world shifts relative to it so we've got to kind of figure that out so I'm going to do something else here I think to help us where I'm going to make an array called blobs Bo I need some better variable names uh blobs can be just an empty array and by the way I think that I should give the blob a variable in the Constructor so I can actually say how big to make it so I want this blob to be 64 and now I want to say uh VAR I equals z i is less than I'm going to add 10 smaller blobs blob's index I equals new blob which will be smaller all these blobs are going to be 16 and then now I can have a loop in the draw Loop where uh I call show on all of those now look at that they're all in the center that's a bit of a problem so how about we also something we could do is in this blob object I could also give it an X and A Y and then I could say here I want this blob to be this blob to be in the middle and I want these blobs to be at a random location and then the blob is made with that X and Y there we go so this is where we're starting we have this idea of one blob that is me I am the blob and then lots of other little blobs that are food that I want to eat so now the way that the agario works is the blob moves in the direction of the mouse so let's see if we can figure out how to make that happen okay so what I want to do is add a function called update and let's think about how this camera went off let's think about um I have some old Flappy Bird diagram here that I'm going to erase let's think about how this actually works so here is the blob and here's the mouse what I want is I need to create a vector an arrow that points from The Blob towards the mouse and I want that to be the direction that it moves so this is actually quite easy to do because coming back over here if I know this position and I know this position if I take this position minus this position I get a vector that points from here to there so I can actually use coming back over here I can say mouse equals create Vector Mouse X Mouse Y and then I could say mouse. subtract uh this. position and then I can just say uh I could say mouse do uh set magnitude to like three set magnitude just takes that Vector however long it might be and sets it to a specific magnitude and then I could say this. pause add ex what am I doing this do pod add Mouse so really th this is how I'm calculating the velocity and oops we got some errors here blob. JS line 5 this. update equals function oh and you know what would help if I called this. update if I called blob. update Mouse is not defined and oops I'm calling it velocity now so you can see how that blob is now following the mouse here's the thing though it's moving and not the other stuff so I want the my view of the world to be relative to this particular object so how do we do that H I have an idea what if instead of what if okay okay okay I'm gonna use the translate function let me come back over here this is where the object is and this is where the origin is z z but let's say the object moves over here what if I move the origin over to here then we should see it still wait wait no no I need to move the origin the other way if I move the origin over here right it would be kind of here which would appear back in the center of our screen I I kind of got lost in my own thoughts there basically what I want to do is it's moving over here but I want to shift the view to be over there and the view of where we're seeing everything is kind of like where is the origin point in our canvas and translate is a function that shifts the origin so what if I just said right here translate by blob. position. X blob. position. Y negative now I think this is going to be a little bit off and you'll see why in a second it's working but the blob is at the top left so really what I want to do is translate by the center because that's really where I want to have the view minus that and now we can see as I move the mouse around the blob is that always stays in the center but these other things move am I doing this right guys tell me in the chat if this is kind of the right idea it's not right look is it yeah move this way move this way move up move down move this way move this way move this way move this way it is uh it's just sort of sort of strange to see let's add a lot more of these it feels like I'm steering it incorrectly okay people are saying it's right feels a little off to me but okay the other thing about okay the other thing that's a little bit crazy here is that what what's happening now why does it do that and pause smoothing dampening for the controls yeah it needs that hold on I'm thinking for a second yeah making a full screen would certainly help um why is it oh I know the problem and we're back so I forgot something as soon as I started moving it around I forgot that the this actual velocity is being tracked relative to the object's position which now is off somewhere and that it's actually The Mouse and the position in the same place and all sorts of I actually what I want now is I need to subtract just the center of the window so I can actually just create a vector like this I don't want to actually any more subtract the actual position of the object because the position object is relative to the world but the user's interaction is always relative to the center of the window and so that's what that's what was messing things up so now you can see um this work works well now there's another sort of issue here which is that the world should really be much bigger than what I'm seeing actually the width of the the canvas itself and in that sense we can kind of do that really rather easily by saying um uh let's pick a random X between like negative width and width divided times two and let's pick a y between negative height and height times two just so we have kind of like a larger space for the blobs to live in and so now you can see that as I move around there's a much kind of larger world uh of of things for me to eat potentially okay so I think we're moving along here we've got the basic gist of the game okay um now I need to add one more thing here which is that if I eat one of these if I find one of these other pieces of blob things and eat it then I get a little bit bigger I think that's something that happens in the game so one thing that I need to do is When We're looping through all of these blobs uh we should check function oh yeah if blob beats blobs index I then blob grows and actually what I want to do is uh remove that blob so blob index I.S splice 0 comma 1 I find myself saying this a lot these days I also want to Loop through the array backwards because I just said this in another video I made but uh if I'm removing things from the array as I'm going forward through the array the the elements SL backwards and I could Skip One by accident so it's good to Loop through the array backwards uh so let's see I want to check if the blob eats one of those other blobs then I want to remove one of those other blobs from the array and how do I determine if it eats it the way that I do that is by writing a function eats which receives another blob I'll call other and I need to check something I need to know what is the distance between this blob's x you know what and actually there is a P5 Vector distance function so I'm going to say what is the distance between this blob's position and the other blob's position and if that distance is less than this blob's radius plus the other blob's radius then we've eaten it why is that true oops I hit the wrong button uh right if I have two objects and I check their distance relative to the sum of the two radiuses radi if they're overlapping that sum that distance going to is going to be less than it if they're not overlapping that distance is going to be greater than that sum so coming back over here we can now say if it eats it then I can also let's say this do R gets bigger gets bigger by the other's radius and also return true otherwise otherwise return false and come over here to the blob come over here back to the main program and I think that's basically it so let's see how that works oops invalid left hand side in assignment un sketch. 21 uh what's oh I equals blobs length minus one okay so we should see here oop blobs indexi dos splice is not a function okay of course what am I doing here this is absolutely incorrect I don't know what I haven't eaten breakfast this morning clearly I'm kind of struggling here for my energy I want to splice out of the array at index I one element which means remove index one element starting at index I I don't know what I was writing before was completely wrong uh blobs splice refresh here come on eat there we go eat eat eat okay so it's getting quite a bit too big just from eating a blob so let's let's divide that let's multiply that by like 0 2 and we can see there we go and I think that what might be um okay so okay I'm going to pause for a second all right people are telling me some things um people are telling me in the game they don't eat it immediately when they touch so when um uh so guys give me some corrections here so um they don't eat each other immediately when they touch that's fixable um the other thing that I feel like some dampening would help right it seems like I'm let's go to the actual game is there dampening in the game no feels the same it's just your kind of smaller oh yeah it kind of adjusts there's a little bit of an interpolating okay so let's do a little bit of an interpolating to the velocity um I should scale everything else uh the screen zooms out instead of The Blob size increase really oh blob size stays the same does that really is that really how it works that's interesting okay oh that's cool ah so we use scale interesting okay okay global scale okay so that I can fix too okay I'm going to come back I'm going to do two things you shouldn't add the rate by calculate both blob's areas add them and get back the radius okay you increase the size but the zoom out cancels it somewhat okay okay calculate the blob areas add them that makes sense that makes sense area is pi r s right okay okay so I'm going to return here okay I'm back uh the chat gave me some nice helpful suggestions a couple things about how the game actually works one is uh increasing the blob's radius is not actually how the game works and this is actually a great thing that you should learn about if you're not familiar with because we often think of The Blob a circle size as its radius but that's not really its size the size that we're seeing is its um surface area the area which is calculated uh pi r squared so let's look at that so let's actually let's fix that for a second so um I'm going to make a variable called sum which is equal to Pi * this. R * this R plus pi time other R time other R so that is the sum of the two uh areas of of The Blob that's eating the smaller blob now the new radius should be the radius that's associated with that particular sum and how do I get that well um let's think about this really quick uh if the area equals p r 2 then R2 = area / Pi and R equals the square root of area divided Pi so I can just solve for r with that particular equation and I can come back to here ah no I'm getting I'm bad at my switching screen I can come back to here and I can say uh this. R equals the square root of that area uh what did I say oh no no that area divided by pi so let's take a look at that ah there we go that's such a more beautiful and elegant uh interaction now the other thing that I was told that actually happens with uh Gario is that instead of the um instead of you seeing your circle grow the actual view of the world kind of zooms out so while you're growing gr what you see is you stay the same size and the other circles kind of shrink and we can do that in P5 using the scale function so um in the same way that I used this translate function I could scale the World by um the blob's current radius divided by what it started with which is 64 so right if its radius is 64 then I'm scaling the word World by one so uh let's see how this works now the problem is this is causing everything to shift to the right which is not great so and um and by the way the radius is getting bigger so I wanted to do it the other way 64 divided by the blob's radius I wanted to shrink so this is working but everything is kind of Shifting up that's because I unfortunately am drawing everything relative to the top left so really what I want to do is I need to change the whole view of everything for the blob to start at 0 0 which is better anyway so I want the blob to start at 0 0 Let's go back to the main sketch I want me the blob to start at Z 0 and the other blobs can just go from negative width to positive width um negative height to positive height that should work I kind of had that weird before anyway and then the world is actually just drawn relative to negative the blob's position so I'm always doing everything relative to that particular blob which starts at z z that's going to make things much better oops um wait wait wait width divided by two plus wait I did this wrong whoa uh minus yeah there we go wait something is still off time out scale first then translate thank you no wait wait wait hold on let me think about this uh okay I want to first thing I want to do is translate to the center everything okay look I want to translate to the center this should make the blob okay that's what I want right so it's working correctly then I need to scale then I need to tr offset do the offset from the blob's location I think this is right now yeah yeah okay okay hold on let's go back because I think this is g to get edited out I got to edit this back okay the figuring out is probably good I should keep that okay there's a there's a kind of an issue going on here so um let me think about this let me get this right here for a second I want I've done this twice now but hopefully you're seeing an edited version of this now um so the problem is actually that the first thing that I need to do is translate to the center so let's not do anything just right now but translate to the center so now you can see this is where the blob moves freely around and it should be growing as it eats other blobs now what I want to do is uh I wanted to I want to scale it I wanted to scale it by its relative size relative its size relative to its original size so you can see the world is kind of shrinking rather than the blob growing but now that I have that I need to do the scale before I trans I offset the whole world then by negative the blob's X position negative the blob's Y position so now if I do it in that order you're going to oh whoa whoa whoa whoa I need a comma there now we can see we have the world uh doing what we I originally hoped and intended it to do so um so okay so now you can see that things are very kind of Herky jerky here um and that's because everything happens instantly the scale changes instantly The View changes instantly and it could be nice to have things massaged a little bit smoothed a little bit and a way to do that is with a function called in P5 called lurp which stands for linear interpolation instead of taking a value and setting it directly to the new value just want to kind of move slowly towards that new value and so let's let's do that with scale um so the new scale is 64 divided blob. R but I need a variable I'm going to call I don't want to call it scale because there's a P5 function called scale so I'm actually going to call it Zoom so Zoom I'm going to start Zoom equal to one and zoom should always be the lurp between the a value in between itself and what the new Zoom is and now the last argument of this lurp function I have a whole video about lurp you can find that video uh if I make it like 0.1 let's see what happens oh wa wait hold on hold on hold on hold on .9 oh wait wait wait I got to actually put it in there sorry everybody I got to actually use the variable I created so what I want is I want it to be just a little bit 10% of the new value so that I interpolate towards it and can you see that happening kind of smoothly let me um so one thing I want to do uh just to make this more obvious is I'm gonna just make it uh 10 times that amount whoops oh okay wait hold on hold on I think I had it Opposite I think this should be 0. n no hold on pause it's just such a subtle change that I'm not seeing it I think I did it right though um hold on why is it if I just multiply it by two it's so much more let's do um just temporarily let's do this okay so that's growing really fast and so I had it wrong no comment out the blob's radius new zoom zoom equals lurp to the new Zoom make 0.1 smaller yeah I know okay hold on let's let me just test something here lurp X comma y .01 yeah 100.5 so that is the the distance like I'm I'm going 1% from X to Y and I want to go 1% from the zoom Zoom to the new zoom and zoom starts at one and this the scale is slower than the lurp so this in my view this should work oh oh it is actually working I'm just not seeing it because the lurp is I'm just yeah you can see it there this is what I was trying to show you it was working all along I just kind of was like not looking at it correctly that's what I said yeah you all are giving me the corrections okay okay okay hold on how am I on time what time is it everybody 1215 so I've got to wrap this up okay got to finish this video I'm going to do this with the velocity as well um okay uh okay here we go okay um okay hi everybody okay I don't know mat you're gonna have to edit this somehow I don't know it'll be awkward but it's fine okay back for a second let's take a look actually forget it I'm not going to say back for a second this'll just be a weird edit Point Let's adjust the way the radius is growing to try to get a better look at this so I'm going to change the radius I'm going to take away that uh the using the surface area and just actually add the two radi together um and then now we should be able to see and and by the way there's so many it's actually I shouldn't allow any of the it also like it just eats a lot of blobs immediately so let me start with quite a few fewer just 10 and so now we can see what happens as I eat a blob it gets really big immediately but then the View kind of slowly interpolates and shrinks so you can obviously tune these numbers a little bit better but I'm going to go back now to the surface area and sort of see and I think I want to add one more interpolation here which is just to interpolate its velocity so that it doesn't immediately get the new velocity but rather kind of smoothly turns a little bit as you move the El around I don't know that agario is actually doing that but I think that might be an interesting thing to add so I'm going to add that here uh in the blob object I'm going to say I'm going to give it a velocity I'm going to give it a variable velocity create Vector uh uh and it's going to be empty 0 0 to start and then this is going to be its new velocity and its new velocity has a magnitude of three and its velocity I'm going to lurp to the new velocity by 0.1 so let's just see how that works uh is not defined and of course I forgot no I either this dot uh blob. 10 uh and this needs this dot velocity so you can see it's kind of the Turning is a little bit more interpolated now is a little bit smoother is it still going in the right direction right so you could play with that number quite a bit like if I made this number you know 0.01 its turning is going to be quite slow if I made that number 0.9 it's going to be as if it turns instantly so I'm going to just like use point two and you can see now there's a it's a little bit smoother now let's add let's go back to the original sketch and let's add a whole bunch of these and you can see here I am eating them all moving around and you know I as I eat them I should probably add new ones I've got a little bit of a performance issue because there's way too many of them you can see the scale I'm really kind of like zooming out on the world but this is the basic game mechanic so I'm going to stop here um in this particular video um I encourage you to take this tweak it improve it uh change the design of the blobs change the size of the world maybe as an exercise add the feature of when you eat a smaller blob a new one gets added somewhere else um and see what you can add to improve this and make this a little bit better I'm going to do two more videos this one video I'm just going to show you how to make this something that's a little bit Blobby so the vertices kind of undulate a little bit so it's not a perfect circle I'm going to do that in a separate video and then in a third part of this challenge eventually at some point I'm going to look at multiplayer networking with this so multiple people could sort of play against each other and consume each other in this kind of blob way um somebody also mentioned to me that in the actual game the blob doesn't eat it immediately maybe it has to envelop the whole thing or they squish against the each other a little bit so there's some some possible also like additional interesting features that I could think about adding at some point to this suggest those and let me know in the chat what I got wrong with this uh game um and also I'm going to have to do some work in the chat also been mention about optimizing this all these square root calculations are really slowing things down and there's some ways around that that I think I could ultimately um uh do to kind of optimize and make it perform a bit faster which I'll look at at some point as well okay so that is part one of agario game in P5 jazz coding challenge I'll see you in a future video goodbye thanks for watching okay everybody so um uh so I'm looking in the chat square root is not that slow just the amount array of Global Food as data cach blob split and fire oh you can split and fire stuff I haven't done that also the Border this is getting annoying so people giving lots of great suggestions in the chat okay so I think that I am finished for today I'm trying to see if I can hit the camera with the with the rainbow sweatbands ah it did hit the camera but I don't know if you saw that um so I encourage you to uh so I've got about five or 10 minutes before I have to move on to actually oh let me plug something I am here at the school for poetic computation uh they are running a 10we program whoops uh sfpc they are running a uh goodbye dance is being requested uh SF PCI is a school they are running uh a 10 we session now which is wrapping up this week I'm going to uh be helping some students with their projects or seeing some of their projects this afternoon which is why I need to go and I think if I go to attending. sfpc let's Google that uh two ah here we go uh we should be able to find uh SPC fspc summer 2016 student showcase it is happening us this Saturday and Sunday I believe um so I encourage you to uh find this and come and visit if you're in the New York City area come to the show see some interesting student projects um and um so so that I thought I would mention I'm trying to think of other things that I forgot to mention ah another thing that I will briefly plug is I recently uh some of you had asked about this I recently uh released a set of tshirts unfortunately this is mostly only us shipping friendly I am looking I say this every time and I got to get to this but I I am looking into some uh other parts of the world shipping friendly tshirt systems um this will ship outside of the US it just kind of can get expensive but um this uh tshirt run has now closed however I am told that if you go here and put in your email when it gets to 40 they we'll do another run of the tshirts and actually I have some friends that I wanted to buy Tshirts for um so I need this to get up a little bit higher so uh if but don't don't just put your email in here only if you're really interested I think uh put your email in here um to uh uh request that they do another run of the tshirts if you're interested however the the kit sizes actually are always available they don't do they do those sort of print on demand this lovely company cotton Bureau so I think if I do SLK kids uh these the kids uh sizes and the uh onesies are all available um another thing that I there was something else that I wanted to mention ah yes so I recently had a Caden course uh called the nature of code a lot of similar content to what I do in my YouTube channel has forums and some assignments this course is now closed but it's it's going to run again um in what they what Cadenza calls adaptive mode so it ran where they released a session every week and people did it at the same time adaptive mode meaning you can just come in and come out of it at any time but Caden asked me to plug um I think it's class Central uh nature of code reviews so if you took the course uh and liked the course or didn't like the course you could write a bad review if you so want if you feel so inclined um you could go to this URL um and I'll I'll post it in the description of this video or maybe Oliver can post it in the chat if if you can find it quickly um class central.com m3777 Caden dth the nature of code um and you can write a review there so far there are 13 student reviews so if you if you feel so inclined to write a review there uh Caden would appreciate it I would appreciate it okay let's see if there are yeah I use Google as my default search am I not using it Daniel uh let's coding rainbow yeah that's my default search um okay okay uh use the smooth movement library for doing client and server stuff can you show your new GIF okay hold on gify coding rainbows coding with rainbows it's on hold on how do I find it uh shoot uh I I have it oops o I rang the bell uh shoot where's the gify URL for that it's funny like I don't have all my recent um because I switch to a different user I don't have all of my recent and I don't know why it doesn't show up on search it would be nice if it showed up on search uh here I wonder if it's not listed I I could just find it on Twitter because I posted it I don't know why I'm so one thing that I'm working on is very very soon there's a giy URL for this maybe somebody can find it I don't know why this isn't playing the browser this browser cannot support video playback that is insane save hold on what is going on with the world today wow that's crazy uh you'll have to enjoy this on your own I don't know what is going on uh with uh my let's try Safari just SEC for a second keep Chrome something is weird with this here we go okay so this th this is for your own enjoyment uh Gooding power this is my goodbye dance oh I need the Sweat Band back now anyway um so so this is random anyway I'm gonna say goodbye this uh this is a sneak preview uh Adam Blau who is a h composer who out of Los Angeles who writes for television and film amongst other things has composed a wonderful uh coding Rainbow theme song A friend of mine from college is is the singer on the theme song I got a a preview version of it I I shot some green screen footage to create a little promo video that a bunch of people are helping me with so that will be released at some point soon in case you're interested uh okay um so um Akash asks what are some up topics good question uh you can kind of the two places you can find out about topics are in the rainbow topics GitHub repository uh if you sort by thumbs up you can see this is kind of what I'm looking at I wanted um I'm really trying to get to machine learning topics it's going to take me a little while to get to it but there's other things listed here I wanted to do um traveling salesperson as an upcoming topic more stuff with the connect I already did phot taxis that'll be uh oh I want to do fluid simul that's coming up um and that's it now you guys are all talking about the so those are some of the um upcoming topics that are coming I hope um yeah I don't think I'm I don't think that my little weird dancing will break the internet but it would be fun if it did uh plug my class again okay so uh which one I don't know which one but I'm in starting in the fall these are upcoming topics in SE I should mention something about schedule for a second hold on I got to pause this so let me mention something about schedule because um I am actually going on a little bit of vacation for about 10 days uh at the end of August starting August 12th um so next week is going to be my last live broadcast of the summer I'm planning on doing one on Thursday this week and one day next week I don't know what day yet um I have a big backlog of videos which is good so more releases will be coming out as I'm away on vacation um with the patreon for the patrons now that I'm doing this crowdfunding thing with that I'm sort of committed to four live streams per month and if you look at how many I've done in July and August I think I'm already at eight so I feel like I've kind of gotten that but sort of my mental checkpoint to see if I'm kind of doing enough to Merit the crowdfunding um you guys can always let me know if you don't feel that I am uh obviously um but um so this Thursday I'll be doing a live stream next week I'll be doing a live stream and then I'll be away um and you know even though I'm only going away for about 10 days as soon as I get back is NYU orientation so I have this job that keeps me living here in New York City and um so that's going to really keep me busy for that last week of August as well so likely the live streams won't come back then until September um and in September I am going to focus my live streams on first of all getting this machine learning stuff going that I haven't been able to make happen this summer I might have make that start that next week but I will be teaching a class on uh JavaScript and text so topics are Markov chains data and apis regular Expressions context free grammars look at Chrome extensions Twitter Bots doing some server side programming all this stuff I will be making videos about all semester long and um if you want to sort of follow along with the assignments and discuss assignments with me you can also subscribe to the patreon and there'll be a slack Channel where I'll discuss that um so boy uh David by the way in the chat in the chat suggest a new challenge Boyds so that would be great I have a lot of video material about flocking and boids already if you look through the nature of code playlists but I I could it'd be interesting to do it as a coding challenge where I program it from scratch um so that's kind of in the hopper for the fall and stay tuned to my Twitter or my email mailing list where I will announce kind of the schedule and once the fall Hits I'm teaching on Tuesdays and Thursdays my class at NYU and I so probably Mondays or Fridays will be my live I'll probably have a consistent once per week live stream so that's kind of my plan for the fall and also I'm starting in the fall I wanted to make this happen in the summer but it seems unrealistic at this point I'm going to start having guests so those viewers I'm going to uh if you want to submit a work a project that you're doing I will show you a project and you can even Skype in if you want and then I also have some uh get people who will come in and do quick guest tutorials I wanted to make that happen this summer so I could release those while I'm away but it it's hard to sort of pin people down it's mostly my fault but I haven't gotten it together so that's also on the horizon for the fall uh and so a lot of things like some Manuel in the chat asked about processing. py python processing um that will um um that will um be something that I might have like a guest come and do because I'm not I don't really do Python Programming but I know people who do and they could come in and do a guest tutorial about that uh okay so that is I think think all I have to say as the song Winds down as I say goodbye this was a 1 hour and 45 minute about live stream we did I did two coding challenges to sum up floppy birds and stage one part one of agario so uh Andrew bone asked what are your thoughts on web components I'm going to have to get back to you on that one that seems like a complex question I'm kind of just a dabbler a Sketcher a playing arounder so I'm not really a professional web developer type person who has serious strict thoughts about how to do things um thanks for tuning in U please subscribe on YouTube Share um you know um trying to make this a sustainable kind of operation so more viewers uh is a um um is great um goodbye okay so that's the end of the song that was coding rainbow episode 55 see you on Thursday this week it will probably also be in the morning stay tuned to Twitter and the email list for an announcement about the precise timing goodbye
