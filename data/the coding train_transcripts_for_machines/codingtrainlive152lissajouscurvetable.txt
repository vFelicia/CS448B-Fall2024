hello and happy Friday it is Friday it is time for the coding train with me your host Daniel chief Mon mmm and I'm so excited to be here I did have a livestream last Friday and I had a guest evening she was here yuning she was here to demonstrate how to train a style transfer model using tensor flow or train that model model locally on your computer or in the cloud using a service called spell and use the ml 5 library to take that model and use it in the browser and to style your image from the webcam all that exciting stuff and if you missed it you can go back and watch it but coming this Monday edited versions of yuning's livestream will come out so if you're looking for just the kind of stepbystep instructions without all the unplugging and plugging in of wires and me interrupting her by accident stay tuned for that all right so I have so many things I feel like I want to announce and talk about but I'm just gonna put all that aside and guess what I am starting this instant with a coding challenge you know I just I just don't have it in me to go on and on about like the store and the patreon and all that sort of stuff I uh and I'm gonna use processing for this although I think what I'm gonna do sorry I'm looking for a marker am i over here I'm looking for my manie's processing for this and which is Java and then as soon as I'm done I am going to oh oh I know where my markers are I need some cleanup in this room now I have a whole thing of markers I got pink green and black and another black one and even like some new ones all right so uh how are you how's everybody doing today are you are you well are you happy it's Friday I don't know how that is in your life so nice Friday is like the start of difficult stuff sometimes it's the end of difficult stuff sometimes it's just another day for me I'm really looking forward to this weekend I might wait my life is working these days I have to wake up very very early and on Saturday I can sleep until like 730 in the morning if I want my children don't wake me up earlier they're not allowed to get out of bed if you're watching right now you must stay in bed until 800 a.m. then you can get out of bed and read and play Legos and all that stuff okay I am seeing a note over here that that the stream status YouTube is telling me is okay I want it to be good when I see the green good makes me happy all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start by programming a Lisa Zhu Lisa IU leaves as you see sighs ooh Lisa Zhu table curved table I'm gonna open up processing here I'm going to check the font size to make sure that seems good look that's my little seat look at this coding new coding train characters see these little brackets over here now classes person thing and I'll come back I got a new store and new tshirts and everything I'll come back to that later see if you can find it what's over here Oh style transfer okay so this looks good font size wise and let me just save this I want to reference standup maths standup maths YouTube this particular video videos no this is the wrong channel this is Matt Parker's other channel Lisa Zhu who I'm signed in as here can I sign it as myself all right this is my weird fake you can't I just leave it there that's fine yes all right so reference this video thank you very much then let's go find the links here to this tweet and this tweet and then we can also maybe look at why is my brightness so down on this computer okay we can look at and it's so tiny we can look at Wikipedia is good okay all right we're ready for this did I say I was just jumping right in hasn't even been five minutes of livestreaming and I'm about to start coding and one turning a new leaf a new page in the book of random numbers well it's been a while though twenty two thousand three hundred and fifty eighty four thousand seven hundred and thirtyfive seventyone thousand six hundred fifty twenty seven thousand six hundred thirty six thousand seven hundred twenty six thirty nine thousand nine hundred and seventy nine sixty eight thousand five hundred and twenty three seventy nine thousand five hundred twentyone fortyseven thousand four hundred and thirtyeight five thousand three hundred sixtyfive ninety one thousand seven hundred sixtyfive twenty eight thousand three hundred ninety fifty seven thousand three hundred sixtythree and sixty nine thousand 137 hey six ninety thousand six hundred and eight eighty seven thousand four hundred and thirty six fifty thousand two hundred and ninety nine I lost my place okay and let's check everybody everything's working what brand of markers okay oh the slowmode is not on slow mode is off today is just a crazy day no rules and I will be turning slow mode on immediately in five four three we'll see if I need to turn it on somebody please let me know doo doo moderators do appointed moderators have the ability to turn it on themselves that's the question that I do not know the answer to do okay this I don't need is this enough space can I move can i cheap this a little bit over this way and yes and also let's check console prints hello here that's viewable okay I think we're good I think I'm ready I think I can do moderators cannot alright alright you you're only a you're just it's very sad how you required me to do this Internet don't worry I'm here to help I'm here to save the day info and settings live control room ingestion settings actually I'm kind of lost here once I already once I've already started can I adjust tiles higher Stan's managed miners participants advanced settings there we go slow mode enabled now 10 seconds 10 seconds of doing the 10 second thing I will raise it if I have to I will have to don't make me pull this car over I don't I'm not driving a car kids okay hmm all right no Jules Antoine Lisa Jew in 1857 all right family of curves French physicist okay okay so quickly French yeah so this dot t shirts are available see if you could find them the Vista T's are now available I just haven't finished everything and there's some other styles and colors and things I'm having a few bugs with the store but they are available thank you to uh natter League Gaming that is nice to hear French French people Bolger Oh como sure Paul knows that's not how you say pronounced jewels on Tuan Lisa Lisa jus just Lisa jus right okay somebody will tell me in about twenty seconds because that's how long it takes I need I have tissues I need to blow my nose what other weird music do I have oh this is that's scary Cody train it's sponsored by water thanks everybody stay hydrated the presentation right there in the article where oh hold on No won't speak it for me where is it you say it right all right good enough hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make I'm gonna do I'm gonna do sorry I was thinking about something it's fine I might do you know what I would like to I think it's gonna be interesting looking enough that I would like to have it at the beginning of the video I can't tell whether it's better to actually have it at the beginning of the video or not so I'm gonna start as if I've already introduced the concept oh and I'm not recording this to disk boy I hope things don't crash I was having some crashing issues the other day ok and I'm seeing a weird glitchy thing here better better ok ok the music is still playing I think it stopped by now you shouldn't be hearing any music alright is anybody still hearing music that's weird if you are cuz I'm not little check here it stopped okay great I want anybody do this in half an hour unlikely very unlikely okay welcome to the Lisa Chiu coding challenge now I want to talk about where this idea came from this is not a new idea this is like a 19th century idea but I I was reminded of it by this wonderful video from standup maths YouTube channel Matt Parker actually created a mechanical version of this particular pattern and Matt Parker's video referenced these two wonderful gifts one from Giulio Lara on Twitter and then this one here from Vincent pant to Loney and these are really like satisfying fun patterns you could see like what's going on here there's a circle there's a dot moving around it the dots moving around the circles are at different speeds and it's tracing a path and look what's going on so how do you program this thing this is exactly what I'm going to do and I'm going to do it in processing now processing is a Java based programming environment for sketching and creating graphics you can do a lot more with it more information about processing in the video's description and then I will also be making a JavaScript version of this that you can refer to actually I might just do that in a whole separate video so anyway okay so let's get started so the first thing I want to do is I'm going to make a nice window 800 by 800 and I'm going to give it a black background now I need to think thinking is what you do let's do some planning so I'm gonna come over here oh and I have no idea if this markers of reason reasonable but basically what's going on so the idea is that we have a table oh and look at this glare can I fix that in any way yeah a little bit the idea that we have a table maybe there are a number of columns let's just say there are four and maybe there are a number of rows 1 2 3 4 now actually what's going on here is the mathematical principles behind this these Lisa Zhu curves really have nothing to do with well that's a bit man no editing okay let's make a rule except for like extreme debugging I cannot stop and start anymore okay no more stopping and starting no more stopping and starting never plan it okay all right so okay the idea is that we have a table so if we look at that we can see there's a bunch of columns let's just start with four although I have I'm envisioning this giant Lisa do table that we're gonna make at the end four columns and four rows and each one of these is going to show an oscillating pattern so some things you're going to want to know about are the sine function the sine function is a trigonometric or metric function which oscillates a number between negative 1 and 1 I mean it's and the sine of a particular angle and a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite angle over the hypotenuse the length of those two things so this is an important concept and you're also going to want to know about polar coordinates and the idea also of Cartesian coordinates these are things that I use in almost all of my videos just learning to program in processing is an exercise in kind of understanding Cartesian coordinate systems because that's what you're drawing into but a polar coordinate system is a way of saying ok I want to if I have if I have a radius of a circle and an angle how can I describe a point outside the circle so in other words if I could figure out what the radius of each one of these circles are and then have this point travel around it circularly and this would go at one x speed this would go at 2x speed this would go at 3x speed this would go at 4x speed integer whole numbers of course you'd experiment with other stuff too and then I do the same exact thing over here 2 X 3 X 4 X and then here I need to get an x coordinate why don't I get the x coordinate from wherever this happens to be so the x coordinate is oscillating back and forth well I'm gonna get the y coordinate from where this happens to be moving around the circle so it's oscillating up and down it's really just the result it's hard simple harmonic motion don't have a video about that I'm just doing simple harmonic motion on two axes if they're moving at the same speed I will get a nice curve like this if one of them is moving faster than the other I might get something like this not exactly and so on and so forth so this is what we have to build alright so let's start with just making one row of these things alright how am I gonna make a row of these things first let me come up let me start with a single variable called angle because that's the variable what I'm doing I'm a single variable called angle I'm gonna start that at zero then I'm going to I just need to figure out a little bit about the space that I'm in and so I want to think one thing that I want to think about is what is the size of each one of these boxes and let's make that like 10 pixels or 20 pixels and what's going on here we have an 800 by 800 window so let's actually make that 800 pixels so I'm gonna call that W and have that be 80 so it's going to be 10 by 10 and what I want to do now in background and in draw is just say 4 oh and then I need to know how many columns so the number of columns is the width divided by that that size of each box so if I loop in draw start at 0 go go all the way up to columns I plus plus and then I just draw an ellipse at some X and some Y with some let's just use 80 right now some diameter and the X is what I times W and the Y that's just the Y is just zero right now what do I have so I have those circles up there and I want them down shifted over a little bit so the X the Y is really W divided by two and I should be saying no stroke and I should know not no stroke I want the outline so I say stroke 255 and no fill cuz I just want the outline okay great so that's good and I move these things over a little bit so let's also have the X equal to plus W divided by two great because the reference point is this Center that's perfect but the truth of the matter is the corner I'm looking over here that corner up there when I'm creating this table the corner is kind of an empty space so I actually want to start the first one over here and I actually want to have nine instead of ten so the number of columns is actually width divided by W minus one and then the X starts at W Plus this is a little goofy but that's good so that's my top row and you know I don't really like this I want to make the I'm gonna call this like diameter D for diameter of these circles and I'm gonna have that B with no no W minus like 10 just so there's a little daylight a little space in between these things look how like big silly it is can I make that look nicer okay anyway sorry now that's fine so let's start this from now how do I get that point so if I have this angle for each one of these and you know what this is really like Center X circle X circle I Center X centralize the center of each one of those circles now what I need is an offset and an offset is where I can suddenly like I wanna figure out where is this point based on the angle this angle is increasing where is this point along the circle and this is this idea of polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates so if I know the radius of the circle and I know this angle I can use a formula which says x equals R times cosine of the angle y equals R times sine of the angle down X equals R times cosine of the angle theta being a Greek letter that's often used to signify an angle y equals R times the sine of the angle where do these come from the reference to some other video where I go through this in more detail but right now we just want to add that to here so I'm gonna say x equals R times cosine of the angle and y equals R times sine of the angle and what's our R equals D divided by two that's kind of useful and then I'm gonna say draw I'm gonna say stroke stroke stays the same I'm gonna make the stroke weight stroke weight eight so I'm gonna just draw like a thicker point by just using point point Center X Center X plus the X offset Center y plus the y offset mmhmm and I'm gonna need to say I'm up here I'm gonna need to say this is I'm gonna have to say here stroke weight one so the old circles get a stroke weight of 1 and the points ah there we go look at that you know technically speaking I mean this is fine I could start here but that the point I think if you look at those other Lisa do table images the point starts at the top so I think I can just do like a little offset here and again I should probably be more thoughtful about variable naming and function but I'll refactor this later teacher coming soon for real okay so look at that that's perfect now let's just say angle plus equals 0.01 there we go look all the dots are moving around the circle now perfect the dots are moving around the circle let's even do something really fun here which is like stroke 255 let's give it a little alpha and let's draw a line from see X plus x 0 CX plus X height so now we can see oh wait wait wait stroke wait stroke wait 1 and now we can see there we go so now you can also stroke 255 I'm gonna need to reset the colors everywhere okay there we go so you can see now those I can see those lines which are gonna help us as a visual guide as I start to create those curves curb curves yes I have a very deep voice no curves okay now did I really just do that is that edited out it's not edited out it's probably in the video they were watching right now ah what's the big thing here the big thing is remember is the speed of these needs to increase this one's going to go around two times the fest three times it's minus four times as fast so coming over here I want to say oh this is easy angle I have I have a counter eye so I'm gonna say angle times I plus one because I don't want to multiply it by 0 the 0 1 gets multiplied by 1 etc etc so now we can see there we go oh this is already fun they already like this just like this ok so that's good now oh this really needs refactoring because this I could really think about is like a function and then I could just do that same function vertically but I'm but I am Who I am I will be who I will be i will refactor this later for real and you will also refactor it yourself as an exercise to improve your programming skills and we just change this to Rose this is going to be the Y this is going to be the X and then this is all the same this is all the same except the line now goes from 0 to C y plus y and with to c c y plus y right what I do wrong all right did I not even calculate the Rose so I need a variable that is the number of rows and rows equals height divided by W minus 1 and now there we go so we can see I already I've built the table I could stop right here and I could say I'm done please finish this I'm going to keep going because this is gonna be fun and exciting all right so now what do I do how do i how do I get the curves in here well I see in the chat actually I this screams Oh Opie can someone explain to me with doing me Opie alright what is Opie objectoriented programming so yes I probably should have done this I could refactor this to be objectoriented even this idea of the columns and rows and the objects that are there but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a new tab in processing curve and I'm gonna create a curve class so the curve class is an object and the idea for that object is to store the curve that's gonna go in each one of these spots so what does it need to store that curb I need to store a path so where am i a curve I need to say what do I need I need an ArrayList an ArrayList there's a flexibly size array if I do this in JavaScript I could just make a plain array and I'm gonna fill it with P vectors I'm gonna call that path and then I'm gonna write the constructor and the path is a new ArrayList empty ArrayList so I'm gonna just put points in this path point in the path point in the path point in the path right so I could write like a function that's just like add point and it gets and an X and a Y and then I maybe do something like say path dot add new P vector with that X&Y right and then and this would be void and then I'm gonna also write a function to draw it show and I can say stroke 255 and you should be clever and thoughtful about color and fill and all sorts of pretty different ways of doing this stroke weight one and then I'm going to say for every and this is a nice way of doing an enhanced loop in Java vector in the path set a vertex V dot X V dot Y this is this little bit of code right here is no longer relevant and when I saying begin shape and shape and no fill so this should give me this is actually me drawing the path as a shape using all of the vertices okay Oh somebody's telling me that the vertical lines are not visible and I'm not in the slack channel here okay the vertical lines are not okay two quick fixes I'll make Alka is telling me that half pi is a global constant in processing so if I want it to be I could use that time saying PI divided by two and you cannot see the lines well that's so sad the lines are like my favorite part let's do 150 just make them much more obvious okay that makes them much more obvious hopefully it looks reasonable in the sort of YouTube compression stuff but we'll see we'll see okay so I'm going back to the curve and I just that the debugger biaxin all right so let me format the code so this should draw me the path and then Oh tricky so now at all where do I want to store all these curves well one of the reasons why I wanted to use processing for this is I just feel so comfortable whenever I have a grid like structure like this using a two dimensional array and to mention where right is it really two dimensional it's just a list of lists but we can think of it as a two dimensional matrix see my other videos about twodimensional arrays it's kind of tricky to make those things in Java though absolutely possible JavaScript that is but in Java it's it's not so tough so what I can actually do is I can declare I'm going to call it curves and I can now just say curves equals a new twodimensional array with columns by rows now I have always always always always whoops I have to zoom in on this because I got really something to say here it's fast forward like two or three minutes in this video I have always programmed like this because Cartesian coordinates are expressed as XY so I always think if I'm making a twodimensional array the X's will come first the Y's will come second but I've been doing so much stuff with matrices recently and mathematically matrices are expressed as row by columns that is the standard and this is probably gonna cause me to make all sorts of mistakes and bugs but right now do it Rose I'm gonna consider the first dimension here Rose and the second dimension here columns so everybody try to help me remember this you know sit there and like meditate on this and like send me your brainwaves that's what I'm gonna do so now once I've made it I can just say into I equals zero eyes listen Rose I plus plus shouldn't the eye the eye should be the chyme is so confused the I should still be the columns the J should still be the Rose I mean I should iterate over the J first who knows who knows know what how will I live curves index J index I equals a new curve so there we go I made an object for every single one of those spots and now here's the thing oh I did something so weird here because I made I mean the thing is if it's a square columns and rows are gonna be the same size but I kind of want to this to work for non square images so I really do want to refactor this and put these two blocks of code together in one loop I'm not going to though here's what I'll do I'm willing to if I change this function to like void add X so I make two of them like a separate one for add Y and then when I'm after I add the X and the y I can add the point with both of those so I need to store I'm gonna say P vector current so if I keep a separate variable current equals create vector create vector it doesn't matter what's in it just zero zero or nothing an empty vector then what I could do not create vector in processing it's a new P vector in P five in JavaScript it's create vector so if I do that then I can say current dot X this is really kind of awful I can set the X maybe this is more like set xset why then I can say current dot why and I'm sure all of you were thinking of other ways of doing this which is excellent and I encourage you to try write about that in the comments so if I set both of these then adding the point can just be add like I could do that at the end and I could say add current and then I could say current equals a new I could just make another empty new P vector so I could do that over and over again let's think about this in other words now for every column hold on I know I need to turn the camera back on just so this is a little edit point and I'm just gonna do this camera line here for every oh and what I lost where I was here okay what I want to do is basically for this column I need to set what the X point for all of these for this row I need to set the Y point for all of these so I need another loop inside of each of these like at the end here I'm gonna say for int and this was I so J equals 0 J is less than rows J plus plus and then I'm gonna say curves index J index I set X to this point CX plus X then if I do the same exact thing here but for the columns so this should be I this should be I this should becomes this should be I exercise in like weird copy pasting this should be why this should be why I'm already lost whether I'm doing this correctly okay my back now sound wise you know the the batteries weren't charged when I arrived in this room I am back now how when did that happen that's the question I like that this is working I got a backup so everybody it's okay all right the question is when did that happen what was the last thing I said you change set X to set Y well that was a while ago wow that was a really long time okay let me do let me just do some triage here and let me just processing is not super great about undo but I'm gonna save where I am just in a different file let's see here Thank You Alka for noting where I stopped wait I was in the curve class I was in the curve class onset why not in the main program because that's a way back so sags this was actually going well and I got to get to the mastodon stuff I'm waiting for someone to confirm so we're saying I'm setting the curves xvalue I need to wait Oh in a for loop so it was later I was in the main excellent good so it wasn't that far back too bad it's too late now my redo doesn't seem to be uh but luckily I did this cuz I was okay so TMC I could to a voiceover no changing I and J TMC you gave me a screenshot me at the whiteboard that seems like way before when the sound went out so I believed that I was doing this I believe that I was here this is where I think that I was yeah your tips it is a good point because I could just do both of them so that might not be such a bad idea and then Matt you can edit it together I'm gonna do something here just in case okay did youdid set set wine set X so by the way if you ever just say something like in this flash challenge you say something like yup I have no idea what that's referring to cuz you're like 30 seconds later so you've got to be very specific saying yes I agree you should blah blah blah blah blah okay all right I am going to do yes oh but I didn't change both of them probably but that'll be a little continuity error that nobody noticed okay all right I've got an image here oh that's exactly where I cut out I was changing the I to a J I'm gonna I'm gonna let much you figure out the best way to add it together and I'm gonna go by I'm gonna do TMC's original suggestion even though I was like no no no no no and I'm gonna go back to I'm gonna go back to yeah I'm gonna go back to where I'm starting to add and this wasn't there yet right this would not have been there yet yeah yeah okay okay all right here we go I'm gonna pretend I remember what I was saying at the whiteboard let me check I switched the batteries and that mic I'm just gonna pray okay okay No finally finally I had some livestream going well I got it like I got 20 minutes to finish this up all right so something about how I need to do blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so if I come to the first loop where I'm going through all the columns all I need to do is at the end then add another loop for wait time out I'm now I'm concerned hold on I I saved I need to go back and look at one did I already is the curve did I add like she was show and add point already there I think it was right like I didn't make changes there so I'm going the desktop I have the video recorded over here so I can actually just open it up and watch it sorry you can't see what I'm seeing now so where is the code and the other before the whiteboard I have add points yeah I have all that show an ad were there okay great I can confirm that they were all right thank you everybody thank you for your patience you're very kind to watch these live streams where everything goes wrong at least the system hasn't crashed that's usually my problem okay okay so in this loop here where I'm going through all the columns now I just need to go through all of the rows for each column and set those exports so I is going through the columns so now J will go through the rows and I'm gonna say I forgot what I'm doing curves curves cannot type curves J I dot set X and then what am i doing I'm setting it to exactly this point so I go through all of the rows and set the X point for each column okay then I'm gonna do exactly the same thing here down here but this time I'm going to go through the columns because I'm going through the rows so for each row I go through the each column and this stays the same but now it's Y and I want to set the Y point ah we've got a problem so I used I here but I should use J now so I should be consistent try to always use J with rows and I with columns which means these have to change and this has to change okay great okay no errors and now guess what I'm kind of done I think because basically all that I need to do is call add point and show like once I've set the X and the y add to the path then draw the path so I need a nested loop do I have that somewhere somewhere I have a nested loop yes right up here already let's just actually look at this graph ah no come back to me I'm going to copy this because I don't feel like typing it and go all the way to the end and now instead of this is before I made new curves now I'm just gonna say add point and and what else show oh my goodness could this be it look at that ah there we go look it's the Lisa 2 table so we're what kind of done coding challenge finished why is there like 15 more minutes in this video because like I don't to do a couple more things hopefully there's not actually 15 more minutes in this video I want to do a couple more things number one is it would really be nice I think it's really nice and one to guess if you could sort of like highlight that point that's moving along the trail so I should be able to do that by saying separately right strokeweight 8 points current dot X current dot y this isn't gonna work so why is it not there because I as soon as I added it I recreate so I don't love this but I'm just gonna move this to down here maybe I should put that in a separate function like a critical but there we go now I can see I can actually also see the point that it's moving on that's nice I don't know if this is going to matter but I'm on like a high density display here it's being captured with a green screen so I don't know if this is gonna do anything but it'll look nicer for me I'm gonna change the pixel density of this sketch to oh not available for this display so so that doesn't make a difference I would have to unplug it so you can't see it but that's fine I am gonna use though the P 2d renderer because what I would like to do now is I would like to use full screen so let's just be careful about this for a second I mean use the P to do T renderer and I'm going to make the much bigger let's see what happens so we could see this is a small Lisa Zhu table and I probably want this like buffer between them should be a ratio of their size like maybe it should always be W minus like 10 percent of W or something or the 0.9 times w would work maybe a little bit more with so Pixley okay so I like this now uhoh oh there's an interesting oh it's ding so first of all there's a big problem here the as soon as this one that's above me right now gets all the way to the end it's just like redoing its points so one thing I should do and also is it backwards I think it's backwards but I'm getting some big red error there I gotta take a look at this it's back I mean it's kind of fine I don't know that it actually matters but I think in those examples the the dot moves counterclockwise rather than clockwise this would be the easy thing for me to fix because I can just do minus equals but I also want to do something like if angle is less than negative 2 pi like it's gone all the way around once then let me let me reset it and maybe I want to like save an image of it so I'm just going to do like curves index i dot reset like reset all the curves and so I could write a function reset which would just take the path and clear it I think let's have it like do it really fast just to see if that works so let's like have it go ten times as fast so it gets all the way around and it clears oh oh you know what I guess I'm gonna have to reset the angle back to zero that was a bug so if I do that now it's gonna go all the way around and we start over and you know what I really want to do also is when it does that let me do like save frame you know Lisa do one two three four you know so I can like save it now there gonna be the same so know why I'm doing this over and over again but that's fine but I just want to be able to look at it later okay let's make this back down and then let's let's go a little nuts here 20 no that's just crazy let's try it oh you cannot good bye good bye goodbye to YouTube compression algorithm for sure alright that's better so you can see I can have a really large table and by the way you should see here of course as they're going the same speed they should be always circles so you can see these interesting like patterns here based on the ratio of the column to the row so this really should be like divisible more nicely so that it fills out you could do so much more with color and stuff like that I probably should make these dots actually also a ratio of the size so the stroke weight should be a ratio but let's look at what that error is because I people are gonna be wondering we can I can I please grab this mmm I have no idea what this is so somebody will tell me in the comments and I will pin that comment let's see if I get that error in p.3d it just what if I don't use people oh actually you know it runs kind of fine in p.2d I thought I might need the hardware acceleration to get it going kind of fullscreen but this is fine save the frame before Oh before I reset the circles yep you know it actually should be fine because it's okay to reset the circles without redrawing it so I'm not redrawing it so let's let me make sure it gets all the way through and by the way I also probably don't need to save I could like in the path I could save every other point so all right so come on let's get all the way to the end oh it's because I'm doing it in P 2d it's getting really slow alright I'm not I'm doing it in regular you see what I mean in this video was here we go I'll speed this up in post walk slowly all the way super chat new member I cannot pronounce the Russian name but thank you alright okay so it reset itself it's going again and let's go here and let's look ups sorry let's look in the sketch folder we see Lisa Zhu 629 dot PNG and there it is there's our beautiful Lisa Zhu table that's some number of columns by some number of rows thank you for watching this coding challenge stay tuned I'm gonna do like a five minute video where I port this to JavaScript if you want to watch that link in the description below oh please make your this dot Lisa Zhu make your own version of this share it with me Twitter Mastodon is the new place they'll be some videos talking about that in the comments and all those kind of stuff thanks very much good bye okay alright so one thing I want to do just before I forget is now I feel silly doing this but I'm going to welcome to a coding challenge I'm showing you quickly before I start the end so I finished it this is what I'm going to make it's called a Lisa jus table it is a what is it okay I'm gonna say less what coding challenge number on my own I don't know hello welcome to coding challenge number written in the title I don't know what number it is this is a Lisa Zhu table I'm really excited to have done completed this coding challenge as soon as I finish talking it will start I'm going to program this from start to finish from scratch well in the processing environment which is a Java based environment and then I also have made a JavaScript port of this so you can watch you can watch me program the whole thing and then port it to JavaScript in a separate video if you want so I hope you share with me your variations that you make of this I talked a little bit more about what it is and where I got the idea from if you keep watching oh the bitrate is wrecked even just with this so this will do me no good what if I do let me try one with just the static image so why don't I do this okay this should be fine with YouTube compression Yes No I like how it looks okay I'll try it I'll try it a couple ways a smaller count of them alright alright it is good okay hello welcome to at a coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna make this it actually animates oh wait this doesn't need to be there no no why won't that go away go away oh there we go oh hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge he keeps coming back why did I hit the mouse or something oh hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge its Alicia do table I really like it it actually animates but I can't show it to you animating because it messes with YouTube compression so this this was made in processing which is a Java based programming environment made it from start to finish in however much time this video is and I also have made a JavaScript version of this that I ported it quickly in a separate video that you can watch as well so I hope you will enjoy this coding challenge make your own version of this table with colors and shapes and designs in ways that I can't possibly imagine and share those with me thanks so much for watching okay now just just as like one more let's see which one looks better what is though what is what are the dimensions of the let me just try like 200 just yeah it's kind of ugly if I could make it stroke weight too everywhere I'm just curious oh yeah that's nicer I think stroke wait I'm really like cuz I only have an hour I have to go at 4 like I have a thing downstairs I really want to do to talk about mastodons but I really wanted to do this so I'm going to yeah that's weirdly slow this is I feel like actually oh you know what I think p.2d is like unhappy in this with I always forget that when I'm going out to the HDMI and capturing it it makes all sorts of things run and slightly wear it away all right this is good let's do this let's try this one okay to it in 3d that would be that's an awesome idea hello welcome to a coding challenge and this coding challenge I am going to make this actually already made it that's what I made it's called a Lisa Zhu table I got inspired by this by some things I'll talk about in a second this one was made with processing which is a Java based environment but I've also made a JavaScript version of it that you can watch in a separate video where I poured it so I hope you enjoy this coding challenge where I program this thing and and make some exciting cool weird wacky beautiful strange animated art with it okay goodbye see you soon all right that was like a weird introduction but I'm gonna stop now I'm gonna let Matt you do do what he thinks best come on okay let me just hit this okay that was bad it was pretty bad right make it slower that I'm not gonna use that one suggestion from chat what if you what what if do not use curves but just draw points and apply point nine transparent oh yeah that's a nice idea so there's so many I'm not worried about I love that suggestion thank you very much I'm gonna leave it to you the viewer to make it more beautiful or different or creative version of this I just wanted to get the functionality down pit errors occur when multiple Java programs are non multi threaded or open wonder if I had something else open somewhere or who knows okay so let's port this to JavaScript real quick and I'm gonna do it with the p5 editor great should I do the flip thing no I don't have the new flip all right let's not do the flip thing so much I think this can probably just sit on its own as like I totally said this is not a coding challenge it's not like part two of the coding challenge maybe it could be but it'll just be like a side for people who want to do this okay okay so you know I don't think there's a find and replace I just realized in the p5 web editor that's fine I'll do it manually it'll be fun okay let's do strokeweight one one one no I don't want to ask Siri give me a break one okay oh and that's going too fast so let's do this hello this is a short followup to my Lisa jus table coding challenge what if it screwed this video is just take the processing code paste it into the p5.js web editor and quickly make all the changes to have this run in JavaScript and let's see how long that takes I think I could do this pretty quickly and hopefully this will be useful to you to see how you might quickly port the sketch back and forth so let's start with just this main tab here I'm gonna do select all I'm gonna go into the p5 web editor and I'm gonna do paste so I've got all of the what is it the Java code in here now so all the let me just do that again hello this is a quick followup video from my Lisa jus coding challenge which you can see running here in a 400 by 400 window in processing what I'm gonna do in this video is take all this code copy into the p5 Jess web editor and convert it all the JavaScript can I do that just like five minutes and get it running and canvas in the browser so you can use that code if you want to make a browserbased version let's see so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm literally just gonna take all the coded copy paste it so I'm going to copy and then I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna do paste save so I'm you know and then I'm also going to create and right over here in this sidebar I can do like add file and I'm gonna make a file called curve J s and then I'm gonna go into curve J s come back to processing get my curve tab and go over here and paste that in so now I have both of those and then I also just want to go into index of HTML and make sure that both both JavaScript files are referenced so now I'm ready to start porting and I'm going to do this in the most manual way possible I could use regular expressions or clever find and replace or write some code to convert it but I'm gonna do it kind of one variable at a time so let let write all the data types this is just ah you know what ah I have an idea so I need to make a twodimensional array in JavaScript and it's a little bit awkward I remember I wrote a function once called make 2d array I search for make 2d array coding train hey look this might be useful to you please edit not be saying oh here we go this is somebody else's project minesweeper on code pen but look there's my make two date to the array function so I'm gonna close that and I'm gonna bring that into here just put it at the top so now I have this make a 2d array function I'm gonna change the order of the arguments columns rows columns hopefully that's hopefully that's not gonna kill the gonna do anything terrible so this is function this is create canvas ah one thing that I need to do if I doing any integer arithmetic I've got to use floor a floor because because I want to take I have to manually take off the decimal place and then this is now make 2d array rows columns this is let let you keep going down function let let let let let the let song the let song let let let let song the let song what what what what what you're watching somebody sing the Lord let over and over again and copy paste let over we're okay so I'm just gonna take this out for a second guys I don't want to know I don't know how this savings gonna work now ah class Oh classes what a lucky day but this needs to change the constructor and now this dot this dot never forget that this stop there's gonna be a lot of this dotting now and this so I gotta have this dot everywhere this stock this haha this time this dot this dot this dot this dot where did I miss it I don't need void I don't need void I don't need I don't need void oh I don't need float I don't need float also a ray list is not a thing we care about brackets just a plain old array and then I don't need void and then oh this won't work but I can say for let V of this dot path and then I feel like did I juice add somewhere yeah this has to be push clear it's clear a JavaScript function I guess we'll find out we save run okay make 2d array is not defined great job because I have capital letters there let's put that in here no no don't reload the site just do this P vector is not define ah okay so that's also another one that I forgot this has to be create vector and what create vector I think that should be good and now Oh current is not defined what is going on here oh this dot current I currents got the fine line 37 also this dot this dot there we go look at that Lisa two table in JavaScript let's see how it performs so by the way this this URL will be linked in the in the video let's try I forget how I do this but if I do I think if I say create canvas window with is that what it is mp5 window with window height that will give me the whole thing there we go and then if I do sketch or file save file one more share fullscreen here we go you know what this is running faster crazily I feel like this is running faster I should have just done this in JavaScript the whole time I had this idea looks it's less like weirdly pixelated or maybe it is so look at that that's beautiful view I mean I'm sure you can't see this because of because of the YouTube compression so let me just go back here and make this something much bigger like 120 and let me let me go view enter full screen and refresh refresh did I not save save refresh there we go and now here it is your JavaScript Lisa table so if you prefer to work in JavaScript you can take this code remix it in the p5 editor and some other projects share it with me this dot Lisa jus hashtag this not least add you and I look forward to seeing what you guys make okay goodbye seeing what you all make good bye oh wait a second it broke stop stop the presses stop the presses clear is not a function javascript array prototype let's look at what it is what there is is there I mean I could just set it to a new array but is there like some kind of just like clear it I mean splice all of it shift all of it reverse reduce all of it no that's reduce of something else okay I don't know what it is but I'm going to go over here and I know you can't see me right now I mean you can't see the code right now because I've done something horrible you know I have a new key command Oh No yeah this one okay you don't I don't not here anymore but you're looking at the code and I this is probably I should do all my videos no one wants to look at me where am I looking to do a reset curve reset where's reset this dot path equals and here I come back ha hi I'm back and now save and now refresh and here we go look so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave you at the end of this video watching this beautiful Lisa do pattern emerge okay I have new create vector uh where did I do that oh shoot well I think we're just gonna have to live with that I fixed it now though okay by the way if you want this code right now somebody could somebody who has privileges could post this link into the chat all right what time is it how we doing processing it can go away now wait hold on worse what is this left at I'm gonna leave the code as this I think okay f11 thank you close processing okay so we are moving on we're gonna take a short break it's not really a break but I just need a minute here to get reorganized microphone I'm gonna do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine to one thirty I think nine line apparently but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six this is like Perlin noise performance part this is like cursing noise performance apart with early noise I might pick numbers like this Perley noise that it's early noise so this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that is her hurling her Perlin noise that is hurling boy this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley so this is her Lee noise that is sorry I didn't realize the camera was off so I have 45 minutes and I am going to attempt hold on I'm gonna attempt to make up Mastodon bot I'm not probably won't get as far as I want to but let's see here we go so I've got a kind of crazy password here in my password manager no app I mean that's my big my email yeah nobody cares everybody can find that email anyway that's like but I'm just I'm gonna type in my password here that's not the login anyway so that's good what's the chance this works oh wait wait wait oh you probably just typed it in wrong sorry sorry everyone I have to get the setup here I'm not password changed Oh different email different email don't tell me I have to retype this sorry everyone get in there could this really be the I should've thought of this hope this works what I get for having like the craziest impossible password ever like 8 million characters because I never have to type it in except I don't have my passport manager installed on this laptop No okay shoot all right whoops where am i all right how am I gonna do this let me just make a let me make an insecure password and I'll change it again later see if that comes through reset password change password password it's too short too short okay login there we go okay here we go okay all right so mastodons what is Mastodon and then we need to go to bots in space okay and okay let me get back to slack all right Activity pub I think I will like to sign in to github and this is just going to require twofactor when welcome for okay alright okay please what is Mastodon it is exactly what I'm going about to talk about what is Mastodon is the topic I believe Mastodon is also sponsored by water actually smashing I'm probably espanish apparently I have some real sponsors to admit and one other place I need to go to is this YouTube channel called coding terrain if you stay all the way to they add into this live stream I'm gonna show you my new coding train store which you can find very easily without me showing it to you but I will show it to you okay playlists I'm looking for programming from A to Z Twitter very bad there we go okay okay all right I'm ready are you ready alright wow look at this Tobias right there hi YouTube okay hello welcome to a new playlist this is a replacement playlist for my session four of the programming from A to Z course session four is all about making a Twitter bot but guess what I give up on you Twitter goodbye Twitter I'm still using Twitter but it's I'll talk about this a lot of things about the Twitter API changed which make it not such a viable not to mention sort of like a highly toxic problematic place in general but a lot of things about the Twitter API have changed to make it problematic for your creative experimental wacky fun meaningful active what art bots so a social network platform that you might be interested in experiment with is something is called method on this is something that I am now experimenting with I'm going to start this over because I kind of like what am I talking about alright um you know I really don't and I was can I leave this here and it won't scroll okay I should be back streaming apologies I'm surprised that that didn't happen till now because there's an issue I think with this computer overheating and so yeah so I think I'm back I'm going to start recording I don't have the YouTube chat up and see if I can get that up really quickly I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again so apologies to everyone oh that's a good idea you just oh crap we're gonna see who's faster hold on I just wanna come on count to three there we go that'll do it ah yes that's what I want sorry I want to I want the local time line so let me see if I can let me see if I can do that since I'm hopefully not going to by accident where is that a home no but that's not the that's if you're logged in Alka that's if you're logged in what I want to do is I have to do it under administration and I apologize if anybody's name is coming up here that that they don't want to have up here site settings since them now ah there we go Oh shown own this is what I want okay okay that should do it Save Changes okay but now I think maybe I don't want okay here we go let's try this one more time hi so I don't know what's going on and either let me just that but what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to turn the volume on in that computer because it actually it does this weird hold on I have to but I have to turn my monitoring off which is not a big deal but actually I can leave that it's fine it it starts to beep and I've never heard this before it just starts to beep and I'm pretty sure it's overheating this is not this laptop this laptop all is do it is is not streaming anything I just have HDMI going out there's a trash can on the floor over there that takes all the cameras in and the laptop in and streams and recently it just dies I probably should upgrade the OS that's one thing I could try to do because I am still on a pretty old so maybe I'll do that after I shut down today maybe I can get some software to test if anybody has any ideas please let me know okay so let's the people in this flat channel are giving me a lot of helpful suggestions let's let me look at that after I stop streaming for tonight don't have the YouTube chat up right now cuz it's like it takes me so long good set everything up and it just freezes at to restart so I do have I do I'm able to look at the YouTube chat here and but let's see I definitely need to come up with a new solution so if I have to take a week off to like set up a new computer not a whole week off I just mean a streaming alright let's try to make let's try to get this mastodon bot thing going okay hello welcome to a new tutorial series this tutorial series is actually a replacement for session four from a program room from A to Z which is Twitter API and BOTS with nodejs you can just it's exactly the same session it's going to be the same session it's gonna be session for mastodons API and box with no chance mastodons what is mastodons why using Macedon well a couple reasons number one is Twitter recently changed their API rules how it works it's much harder to sign up for new accounts that are bought accounts they've also removed a feature which was the streaming API which Macedon does have so I'll come back and show you what that exactly is but allows you to basically have a connection to the service and continually listen for different events and so you could still hopefully maybe if you want try to make Twitter bots but I am giving up on it I think there's a lot of problems with the Twitter platform as a whole and if what I'm interested I'm interested in its community and experimental weird crazy avantgarde art image poetry nonsense BOTS mmm Mastodon is a pretty good place to do it so first so what is Mastodon so first of all Mastodon is an open source project if you want to find out about it just go to join Mastodon org and also the toot sweet organization on github the Mastodon project so it's an open source project II and sorry I'm looking for the thing that I wanted to say it's an open source project there was like a nice little why I'm at two you're gonna hit this out yeah okay it's an opensource project you can read right here find friends discover new ones publish anything you want links pictures text video on a platform that is community owned and adfree but the really the thing that's really exciting and interesting to me about Mastodon is that it is a decentralized social network what does that mean so in mind you I am NOT an expert in this I will link to a really nice YouTube video from master the Mastodon project what is Mastodon you could go and watch that if you want so let me give you my kind of take on this so let's say you sign up for an account from Twitter and you are on your own computer your device your phone or whatever you're using it as a Twitter client you are connecting to the Twitter server you are sending messages there you are reading messages back all of your data is stored here on the Twitter service this is a centralized service and the web more and more of these days is moving moves into the web originally if you okay I think I am back so I am gonna actually gonna give up on this live stream right now for now you know I have 15 minutes before I have to be downstairs for a meeting but I'm so I'm gonna use that time to see if I can upgrade this machine I got some good suggestions of oh yeah oh and this is the great idea Cody's made sponsored by water I'm just going to go ahead and pour water on the computer them not those computer the computer over there I'm gonna see if I can fix up this machine just by upgrading it and installing some stuff to manage the fan and then I will try to come back later today or Monday to do the mastodons stuff but you know even if I even if it wasn't gonna freeze again in 10 minutes I'm not gonna get much done in 10 minutes so at least to show you since if anybody's curious and a feedback is welcome they do haven't so let me just if this freezes again by the way I'm not gonna come back I'm just gonna add mystery so if the cuts off it cuts off and I'll talk until it cuts off so if you want to well I was gonna just talk a little bit about Mastodon but I guess I'll save that uh I guess I'll mention the store so if I go to teespring dotcom slash stores slash coding train I'm gonna show you this is fun I'm gonna show you all this new stuff thank you Jason hey Glen hey Glen is the did illustrative designer who has done a ton of stuff for the coding great look there we go coding train and so we have a whole lot of new stuff these coding is magical shirts with all those people have requested the I'll refactor that later sure it's different characters and the this dot one is somewhere in here well maybe I remember it was on that first page there yeah I never forget that this dot there it is the new coding train bouncy logo and some other stuff of course this one so anyway poke around feedback is welcome if you see stuff that's not there that could be there stuff doesn't work does it make sense thank you for your support please don't feel obligated to get anything the I will be sending these out as gifts and things to people subscribe to patreon and that sort of stuff ok so I wanted to show that on theory let's see how this works in theory this is integrated with YouTube this is totally gonna course it's not freezing freezing now right if I go here oh no no that's next live now if I go here and it's find there's no Mastodon BOTS in this and I scrolled down yeah there we go so that doesn't work look at that so these are expensive I'm definitely this is the one that I want to get I will be buying this one for me for myself probably okay so thank you for being patient and dealing with the fact that this is like not working I'm looking at the YouTube chat now so I'm gonna figure I got to make this content cuz it's for my class wouldn't discord BOTS and their WebSockets be more interesting I don't know about more interesting definitely interesting I have to admit that I am NOT a discord user I've been tempted to set it up in lieu of slack as the member community for the coding train but I just haven't had the time to explore it and then once I suggested it do like no no don't bother with that so so yeah so thank you I mean I would happily stay on while I try to upgrade this computer and install stuff but I don't think that's gonna be that interesting and then also have to restart the computer which will shut the stream down so at least we got that at least we got the Lisa 2 coding challenge in I feel kind of good about that and the that will get edited and pushed out next week sometime and if I can manage I don't know if I can manage to make it back today but I really got to do that Mastodon stuff so maybe I can get an extra hour or two in on Monday so just stay tuned stay tuned just stay tuned sorry I was looking at the chat stay tuned if you want it like when a might the places I was on Twitter you could follow me on Twitter no stay tuned I will announce the best way to find out when I'm going to livestream again is just to take the home check the home page on YouTube because it will show you like there's definitely going to be one next Friday text generation with tensorflow ml5 and the spell platform with Nabil Hussain so we're gonna do an LS TM neural network model with a guest next Friday and so as soon as I figure out if I can come back later or on Monday I'll post also another one here in the upcoming live streams ok that's it but uh what a sad I will refactor this computer later what a sad ending to today's live stream but I am going to have to go and see what I could do about this computer even if I could just come back and just like explain what Mastodon is and make one little simple bot it'll be worth it to me if I can manage to do that in a little while so we'll see if I come back today it would be between like 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern Time so and now of course it's not crashing now which is ridiculous frustrating so but let's see I know about you've got to go to sleep go to sleep don't wait up for me because I am NOT this is not a reliable thing thank you everybody thank you for tuning in and I will see you next time bye everybody I forgot I have to press the stop streaming button where do I do that they lost that page I'm going I'm going don't make me pull this car over um customize channel no that's not what I want don't customize the channel ah geez Louise okay look there I am uh edit video where do I go here uh here we go edit video okay and live I like control room let's try this one more time thank you everybody for watching today's livestream I will see you next time on the coding train goodbye everybody
