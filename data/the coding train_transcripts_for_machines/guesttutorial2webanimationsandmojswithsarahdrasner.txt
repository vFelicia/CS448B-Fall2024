hello welcome to another guest video I'm super excited about this I'm trying to do this more and more and I have more guests here in the studio today and the first one that I'm going to introduce you to in this video is Sarah Dresner and Sarah is a web technologists she does a lot of work with JavaScript a lot of JavaScript libraries that I know nothing about including modeis which has made this particular visualization which is exactly what she's going to build in the video so if you like what you see behind me that's what you're going to learn how to do um Sarah works speaks it a lot of conferences and teaches at conferences and she works with Val head too and and travels internationally to do web animation workshops and if you want to find out more you can go to web animation workshops com so check out their workshop series check out their their websites and check out this tutorial that you're about to watch Thanks so as Dan mentioned I'm Sarah Dresner I'm here today to talk to you about mo GA s mo da Jas is an animation library for the web and we're going to be doing a lot of work with it today using JavaScript and then under the hood it's actually going to be dreaming up a lot of SVG which is really cool SVG is scalable vector graphics so we actually don't need the HTML pan panel here we just need the JavaScript panel I'm leaving the CSS panel open for you so you can see that I'm working with body background you know it's dark black bass or a dark gray basically but that's basically all we're going to be doing in that panel too I also already have loaded this modeis min you know here and if you go look at this pen later you can fork it and grab that that link I'm also going to work with Babel so that I can or Babel I don't know so that I can work with some JavaScript preprocessing and do some work with es6 today so basically we're going to do a burst bursts are really really fun because they're so simple and you can drum up something really beautiful really easily so we're going to just say Const burst here equals new mo j s dot burst and then inside here we're gonna say radius if I can type is inside up another object zero I don't know 360 and then what we can do even from here is just play it and see what we've got so if I hit play you can see that I already have something just bursting across the screen it's these little pink dots that's really cool but let's make it a little bit more interesting we've got circles so far but I can actually talk to the children of these like little units we saw we have about five of them and I can say you should be a shape that's maybe a rect and then maybe you should have a longer duration because we're actually having a hard time seeing all of the stuff that's coming up here so I'm going to give it three thousand seconds three thousand milliseconds sorry and then you can see it bursts apart which is really cool so that's just the beginning of what we can do we can actually start to add other shapes here so you saw before we have a circle and you can see that it's kind of pink from the getgo we can also make them a little bit bigger so maybe we should make the and this is a different kind of radius so the radius of them of the bursts is actually like how big the burst is but the radius of the children is going to be how big those shapes are so maybe we'll change them in this object it once we put an object in here we can do thirty to five and then I need a comma here in order to make it work and then you can see it's like a big burst that's way way cool so then I can change it to whatever I want there's a lot of different kinds of shapes in modeis right out of the box so we might change it to something like a cross but the interesting thing is you'll see it disappear because crosses don't have a fill and we're working with the fill so instead we're going to give a stroke and what's cool about that is we can say stroke is you know teal I'm going to do consistent you know a kind of things here and then we've got these crosses that kind of boom across the screen we can even change the stroke width while it's moving so let's do we have to do camel casing here and we'll do let's say six to zero and then we can see it kind of like burst out and be big and then get smaller um might be nice if it kind of rotated as we goes across so we can even put in an angle here and do from like 360 to zero and then we can see it kind of like shattering apart we can change the number of children which is nice so we can do count and do something like 20 all of a sudden and then it's like a tons of things that are just bursting across that's really really fun so that's like a basic mode j/s burst but maybe we want to do more than one maybe we want to make it kind of interesting here as it goes so I'm actually going to get rid of this play for just a second and I'm going to say new timeline equals mo dot J oh no I want to say con story about that cons timeline equals new mo j/s timeline and then I can make it do things like repeat which is nice because then we can kind of continually see it as it goes along and then I'm also going to make sure that I play it because we want to play it but we also have to add in this bursts that we have so we'll do add and then we say burst and now but we need to play dot here and now you can see the bursts kind of appearing and also it's going to keep going so we can also just start adding other shapes here if we want so we can copy all of what we have here and say khan's burst 2 Khan's add burst 2 and now there's going to be two of them that maybe will make them a little bit different you can see that the difference between these so this one's going to be magenta and this one's count is going to be 10 maybe like 12 or something and maybe we'll put this in another direction so that we can see the difference between those two things kind of bursting apart right so we got negative 360 now one's going one way and ones going the other way that's kind of fun and now they're scattering across the screen that's kind of nice we can also change this from a cross to something else like a zig zag that's cool and now we have like a totally different shape moving across that's really like kind of interesting as it like morphs and moves so we can also change the color as its as it's going across just by putting it in that other object so we can do magenta pink pink is kind of like a lighter color so it'll change as it's going so cool we can also just like we can see that there's like that you know default pink in there that's because the zigzag actually has a default fill so we're going to say fill none here and then we can see the zig zag go across and that's going to have a default of three points but zig zags are really cool when they have lots of points so maybe we'll do points you know seven or something like that and then we have these zigzags that have like all of this character it's really really fun so we can also play with opacity right right now we're just kind of having them scale out an infinite infinity but we can also say something like opacity is you know one two zero and then we meet our comma there and then we can actually watch that pink kind of go away as it as it kind of moves off the screen maybe you want we want to do something else too because we've got right now we've got these pretty big radiuses so maybe I'll change this one to a hundred oops that's a thousand that's really big and then this one will do two hundred so we can see them kind of like blowing apart a little differently each time that's really fun too so right now we have two different shapes kind of bursting maybe we want to kind of accent it with a circle that's just one circle that's kind of blowing apart so the way that we would do that is pretty similar to what we had before but it would be a shape so we'd say Const circ equals new mo Jas shape and it's all pretty much the same syntax over and over again so you can kind of see that it would be like a circle here and I'm going to say do the same thing where we're like radius is from zero to you know 200 and we're also going to say let's say we don't want to fill because we just want the outline so we'll say fill none and then we'll say stroke is going to be maybe yellow so that's kind of fun so now we don't see it yet right because we've got to add it here so we'll add it in and then we get to see what happens so right now it's kind of going really fast remember we're how we talked about how like the default is for it to go pretty quickly I think it's 250 milliseconds so we'll also make the duration of this pretty much longer so we'll do 3,000 here and then it kind of blows apart the same way maybe we'll make it a little bit different front so that it's not overlaying on the crosses we can do three hundred three thousand five hundred milliseconds here so that's kind of nice we also might want to do like an opacity from zero to one like we had with the other one or I mean one to zero so then we have it blowing apart this way so that's kind of nice so now we have this like circle that's kind of blowing out at the same time but it might be nice to have two circles it might be nice to have like a circle and then another circle coming out at the same time so right now we have a bunch of things that we might want to reuse we have a radius we have our filled that's none we have our stroke that's yellow we have the opacity from zero to one we might want to keep like all that stuff so what we can do in instead is you know make some default options since we've got our es6 in here we can actually use a thing called a spread operator which is a really really nice thing so I'm going to take this circ and I'm going to call it Const circ opt instead and then I'm going to say that this is an object instead so the nice thing here is I can say Const circ because that's what we had before is new mo j s dot shape like we did before and we can do these three dots which is the spread operator and we can say circ underscore opt and then what will happen is it will start to use those options from before that's really really sweet because now we can just make a second one we'll so we'll call it circ we can add those options and then I'm going to add a slight delay on this one so then we can add it here and we have two circles really really fast because we have all of those options that we're able to reuse and we can override some of them we can change some of them so that's really really fun and then for the last thing that we're going to do we're probably just going to do like those base circles again just one last base circle so let's go back and take one of these bursts that we have here maybe we're just going to make something very very similar to this but we're going to take out some of these fill none stroke stuff we're going to take out the zig zag because remember the default is that children are always going to be circles so instead we're going to say burst 3 and then we're going to give it a different count of let's say 5 and then let's see what color shall we make it let's say color purple and then we can add burst 3 in here so now you can see it's like giant and then it's getting smaller but maybe we want to make them a little bit more subtle because they're super big so maybe for the radius for the verse three we could say something like let's go for fifteen to ten see how that looks that's better that's kind of like not so bad but maybe we want to make it just like a little more subtle than that so let's do and we don't need the stroke within there and then we have a radius of ten and we're going to make it go to five so basically everything in these objects were interpolating the values of all of the things that we're using the angle the radius the opacity we're going from one to zero every single time we use one of those objects and we're passing it for everything else like the duration it stays stable so we can just use that over and over again so if I wanted to refactor this these bursts I could find things that were common for all of them I think maybe they don't have so many things in common though so it might not be possible but you can see what we did with that circ opt where we just basically used those those same options over and over again and that spread operator and es6 really helps with that and that's really really awesome that timeline is great too because we can just keep adding things and we know that they're all going to repeat at the same time together which is really really fun so if we look at this in my like little code open thing that opens it immediately in dev tools it's a Chrome extension you can see all of these things bursting apart whenever it plays so that's about it thank you for watching and thanks for tuning in bye
