okay so this video I'm kind of sneaking in it's like a huge topic and so particularly excited about this one I think this is going to make if you're if you're kind of following along here this is going to majorly change the way you might approach building certain kind of quick sketches in JavaScript and in p5 so let's take a look at the scenario it's like a little tight in a way it's like a small change I'm going to make to this particular sketch than the show you in a moment but it's a major leap forward conceptually in terms of how you think about and build sketches now this is certainly I'm a like way too much exposition here but this almost definitely needs many follow ups but let's see how far I get in this video and see what happens from there since I'm really just in a room talking myself but at some point I will hear from people who are watching this okay so let's look at this example so this is a variation of the bouncing ball sketch that I showed in a previous video I simplified it a little bit this is now a bubble it's an object it has just an X and a Y and then the program is modular monetized into two functions a move and a display function the move function adjust the x and a y by the random value and you can see here that it's kind of just like jittering randomly and then the display function down here just draws the circle so this is what we've got a bubble object and a move in a display function the leap forward that I want to make here is I want the code ultimately to not look like this in draw but I want it to look like this bubble move bubble dot display so right now this bubble is just some data it's just the XY location but I want to think of the bubble as a kind of more than just some data that bubble is an object that has an x and a y and it also has functionality it can know how to display itself you can know how to move itself and this will open up a lot of possibilities for example eventually we'll see how you might just release like a thousand of these bubble objects onto the screen all at once so how do we define the function how do we start how do we define this object so not only does it have a bubble X and a bubble Y but that this move function is somehow a part of the bubble object so let's I'm going to diagram some syntax here so okay so this is the syntax for the object VAR bubble equals open curly bracket close curly bracket X which is a filled aura it's really like a variable inside of the bubble object X I think I was 200 comma Y 150 and again an object contained in java script contains what's known as name value or sometimes referred to as key value pairs this is the name X this is the value 200 and this really behaves just like a variable does it's kind of like this list of variables that's inside this other variable called bubble so the secret magic wonderful thing about javascript is that these don't have to just be values they can be functions so what would happen if I said okay here this name value pair is not named value it is name value but that value is a function so the name is display and the value is function so syntax is kind of hopefully when I type this out it will look a little neater than this but you can see name value name function so this looks different right normally we would say you know function display like this but here just like normally we would say var X instead of saying var X its X colon instead of saying function display its display colon function now sort of unfortunate truth is there's lots of other ways that you can write and define functions in JavaScript and some of those will come up later as well but for the moment now we're seeing one new way this bubble has an X and a Y and a display function so what happens that we've got to fill in the code here inside for this function I want to draw an ellipse the question is where do I want to draw that ellipse I want to at this X and this why did that by accident but I realized I'm sort of doing it on purpose so the we this is the one of the weirdest things it's going to take some time to get used to and hopefully some followup videos I make will clarify this new term I'm like having this like thing go in my brain because I'm saying this new term and the term is actually this like the word this that's what getting to so in order to refer back to this X and this why you can't say x and y here these X and y if there were an x and y here would be it would be looking for some global variables summer you need to in order to refer to the specific X that's part of this object this is a keyword that refers to this particular bubble so this dot X comma this dot Y and this is like one of the biggest gotchas so to speak in job scream it's so easy to forget and then you might have like 20 comma Tori so might be so easy to forget this kind of thing so now that you've said this bubble with an X and a Y and a display function which does this draws this ellipse head fits X abyss Y then we can start to write things like bubble dot display when you execute bubble dot display it's going to look up this function execute this code and look for the what these values are here in these particular variables okay so let's try to make that happen here hopefully I got this right so now I'm going to say a display function and actually I could just go and grab exactly this code that we had here I'm going to delete this and bring it up here and the difference now of course is that here I have an X which is 300 or Y just you under display which is a function which does all this right I'm inside the object so there's no reason for me to refer to the objects variable name all I could just say this this particular object that I'm inside right now then the next name value pair comma move which is also a function and I'm going to grab this code and again this dot X this Y this dot X this dot Y so now we see this entire object here the bubble object this is this is like now we have this thing this it's it's not it's like this collection of stuff it's data I could add colors to it I could add size so I could and other functions to it I have this bubble fun bubble object has both data and functionality so now here in draw I can say things like bubble move and bubble dot display now I wonder why display is syntax highlighted there it's not part of p5 it must be display must be some other keyword in JavaScript so I wonder if that's a little bit dangerous for me to use it but I think it'll be ok so let's run this program we have exactly the same program it works just fine and also uh this might also be actually I'm not going to do this next I'm not sure how the b5j has editor works so anyway you know I've actually never like this is like the first time I tried doing this object stuff in JavaScript in this way at least explaining it so I'm not sure how that was but this is just the first first step and so you know if you had to have a second one of these you'd still you'd have to essentially duplicate all this code so that might be something that you try right now actually try making an object like this like this particular one this bubble maybe you know copy this code and add a color to it add another function to it maybe a function that do something if it like reaches the edge of the screen or something although with this randomness it might take a while so see what else you can add to it see if you can make one program that has two objects in it and then at some point I'm going to make a video that's going to look at something called an array which allows you to have a list of variables and one thing you can do very convenient with the rise of a list of objects and there's more there's a lot more you to get to in terms of how these objects are made and stored but I'm rambling now so hopefully this helps a little bit and let me know what you think and I'm going to hit stop now I've really hitting stop this is actually a short video for such a big job
