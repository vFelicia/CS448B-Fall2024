okay I'm think I am live hello hello uh volume is working unfortunately yeah software update hello everybody oh okay um so I want to first uh mention something off the bat I have to like minimize this for a second so I'm having an audio problem uh which is that uh you're hearing this in mono the videos that I'm actually going to record and upload later will come in both the left and right ears but for whatever reason the stream settings I've changed it in a whole bunch of different places I can't get wirecast to take the input I I don't know in Mac OS if I can change the mono input to stereo so I haven't been able to figure it out yet so uh unfortunately if you're watching this live um you will only hear the um mono signal um so I'm going to try to like I already did an hour of videos so I'm like losing a little bit of steam but I'm going to try to uh finish off these videos I want to do one more video about uh conditional logic um in JavaScript P5 I'm going to look at what it means to set a variable to true or false um and um I'm going to look at the mouse is pressed variable uh as well as making up your own variable uh set to true or false and then I'm going to move on and look at loops and drawing things a whole bunch of times that's my plan so I don't know if let me just check if any of you are there uh the latency is still not so great uh hello seven people who are watching now uh hey I caught that uh I caught that let's see um so so I'm going to get started in a second I'm I'm just trying to think of where where I'm going to do this okay thanks antonus okay you guys are beh I I hate that the chat is lagging behind me but it's not that bad okay uh I need a little water little bit of this coffee okay so I'm just about to get going here I'm losing my voice um okay so I think I just got to get this started so let me prepare the first example I want to prepare I'm going to use both of these uh conditionals one conditionals two oh you know what we need uh oh I'm thinking of so many things I got to make some notes uh so I'm thinking of things that the editor needs it needs needs a um the editor need editor needs uh like Windows so you can flip from sketch to sketch and then the editor also needs would be nice to the editor rememberers uh size and location of the code window also okay uh maybe I'll get a fresh marker okay so um if you guys have uh other thoughts about the p5js editor and things that it might need let me know put it in the comments you can file GitHub issues yourself you should thank Sam LaVine and many others too but Sam LaVine has been leading the charge at the editor there's also a web uh P5 editor that's coming down the pipeline that Jason seagull worked on a lot over the summer uh with a lot of help from others as well uh okay but I got to make this video so I'm gon to make one video where I make a Boolean variable that's stops and starts this circle from moving and I'm going to make another one that uh uh that only highlights it if you're clicking on it I think that's what I'm going to do oh boy H this is dangerous okay I'm just GNA do it it's GNA be fine um let me make this uh no no I'm also going to change this to let me just fix a couple things I'm going to make this wck mode Center and I'm going to change this to uh then this has to be where is this if Rec mode is Center and it's at 300200 it's at 250 and less than 350 and mouse Y is greater than 150 and mouse Y is less than 250 so now I have a perfect roller over which I will use to start demonstrating okay uh okay I got to start this video and I'm going to start it I'm G to check the chat one more time uh the fact that you can watch is totally amazing seven people are watching this right now but possibly less fewer than that are actually paying attention I don't know what's happening okay okay I just got to start making these vide videos I'm I'm stalling like crazy look at this weird invisible look at my invisible mug this is the strangest thing I have a mug it's in completely invisible it's also just glass and clear but it like when I put it in front of an actual human being you can see it but in front of the green screen just disappears magic okay uh uh here we go um uh I don't know how I'm going to do this okay I'm GNA figure it out wrong one okay here we go again hi so uh I I've I made a couple a bunch of videos about conditional statements and I recall or I thought of during one of them that there sort of a key element here that I think would be worth noting and spending a little bit of time on in its own short little video which I am attempting to make right now I'm trying to be perky because I'm really inside I feel like lying down and taking a nap okay so what is the topic of this video and what I want to talk about is what if you had a variable and instead of assigning the value of that variable to say a number or perhaps a string or perhaps an image these are some things that you may or may not have seen so far what if the value of that variable I'm going to call it like going were equal to True itself or false so in fact this is a data type now as you know anytime you declare a variable you just say VAR and the name of the variable and then it's up to you to assign it a value most of the examples we've seen so far we give those variables numbers numbers are useful they can be used to specify coordinates on the screen sizes of shapes colors red components of a color the transparency of a color numbers generally are being used over and over again everywhere in the code however it can be useful to have your own variable that is either set to true or false now before I get to that one of the reasons why I'm mentioning this to you is there also happens to be a variable built into P5 right there are the variables built into P5 that you likely know about Mouse X and mouse y these variables are numbers they hold the coord ordinate as to where the mouse is on the screen but there is also a variable called Mouse is pressed and this particular variable is uh uh its data type is Boolean meaning it's either true or false so this is relevant because why is this relevant this is relevant because sometimes you want to know is the mouse being pressed or is it not now earlier in a previous video at some point in some life where I made this this other video there happened to be a function a function called mous pressed and I stated at the time that this function is an event meaning the code that you write inside this function gets executed instantly the moment the mouse is pressed so why is there a mous pressed event but also a Boolean variable to check whether the mouse is pressed or not and the distinction comes down to the following and this is a really key distinction which is totally built into the way that you live your life and use a computer but you may not have thought about it at such detail because it's kind of like just sort of like inherent way of being but there's a difference between clicking the mouse I want to click the mouse to instigate something versus I want to hold down the mouse to have something happen continuously while I'm holding down the mouse and in essence the Boolean variable is something you want to use when you want to test if the mouse is being held down and the function Mouse pressed is the function you want to use when the mouse for the event the moment is the mouse is being clicked all the stuff that happens after that is it being held down there's also a mouse released function for knowing when it's released but I but I digress so let's look at the distinction between these two and I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to do this but I'm going to go back to the example the rollover example and see if we can kind of play around with this idea of it as a button versus a rollover okay so let's look let's review this example I since the last time you saw this example because in my fantasy world people are just watching these videos one after another in sequence which I don't know if it's true I don't know if anybody's watching I'm doing this anyway you don't have to watch it's just something I do to entertain myself during my day um and so I'm going to hit run this and you can see I did a couple things one is I used this uh function rect mode so now the rectangle is being drawn according to its Center and then I adjusted the coordinates and I added the ycoordinates so this if statement has become very long I'm checking if Mouse X is between the left and right hand side of the rectangle between the top and bottom so you can see this works perfectly Now it only uh it only changes color if the mouse is anywhere within that rectangle so we've got a rollover now what if I wanted to when uh uh when you're inside the circle um uh do something when when the mouse is pressed sorry okay I know what I'm doing here so let's look at that if Mouse is pressed uh variable so I'm going to actually add just a completely separate if statement and I'm going to say if Mouse is pressed background and I actually I think I want to put this yeah put I want to put this um above that one just uh actually it doesn't really matter but I'm going to put it up here just to kind of for a second just to kind of keep it all uh together so look I've added another uh I've added another if statement sorry I lost my train of thought here but everything will come back so if the mouse is pressed change the background so remember this is different than I click the mouse and one thing happens at the event now I'm checking this is the mouse pressed in draw so what I'm trying to do here is check is the user holding down the mouse this is how this is used okay so now if I click the mouse I'm holding it down you can't see here watch this this is going to be a really crazy moment moment for you this is my computer rising in this like mechanical desk thing we this doesn't really help but just show you there's a computer here I'm going to now hold down the mouse it is green I am now letting go it is not green so I have this interaction which is different than uh I click the mouse and it's green forever we're going to have to sort of see how to do that the other thing what I want to do is only actually have this happen when I'm on if I'm on this this uh on this rollover so let's do let's figure that out so it's kind of silly but the way I'm going to do it right now is take this if statement whoa and put it inside this if statement now I probably could figure out a way of joining this with another and but what I'm saying here is look at this look at this this is kind of exciting and different if the mouse let me put this back down uh if the mouse is within in that rectangle and it's pressed change the background but it doesn't matter where it's pressed or not if it's within that rectangle always change the Highlight so we can see the logic here that I now have it's always GNA I always have this roll over it's going to get highlighted as soon as the mouse is over there I could click anywhere around it doesn't change color but now when I click here but only when I'm holding it down okay so now that's using the if Mouse is press what if I wanted this this is kind this is like a button that you hold down it's like if you had a light at home and in order to have the light on you just always had to hold down the button the switch as soon as you left it like turned off so with your light at home you want to press it it goes on you leave you come back later you could press it again now for this to happen we need an entire other kind of we need another variable okay and we need to use the mouse pressed event so we're going to piece these things together so now we have a rollover where you hold down how am I in seven minutes you hold down the mouse it turns the light on what I want to do is press the button turn the light on press the button turn the light off this is kind of like strangely such a simple thing it's a bit of a tricky um a tricky uh interaction problem inter uh tricky programming logic something like that problem let's figure it out okay so ultimately what I want now is to have my own the way to do this is uh is not to use the mouse is pressed variable that has a value that's just built into the operating system into P5 into JavaScript into the browser it knows whether the mouse is pressed or not I want to have my own variable I want to have a variable and call it on might be some there might be an issue with using this term on but for now I think it's going to be okay and I'm going to start with on equal to false so when the program first runs the light is off when on is false the light is off and in draw what I essentially want to do is I want to say if on then set the background to some other color otherwise set the background to some other color so this is the idea here if I have my own Boolean variable that's either false or true I can just change the value of that variable somewhere else in the code when I click the mouse turn this to true and the light will always be on then I have to figure out when do I set it back equal to false so let's take a look at uh at doing this with this now in theory I should upload all these code examples somewhere and I got to figure out a way to do that but at the very least what I'm going to do is save project as uh conditionals button and hopefully um that previous one will be saved so I'm gonna um I'm going to take some of this code for a second and just stick it at the bottom and put it in comments because I might might need to refer to it later later so down here we might need to get back this rollover code and maybe we need to look at the if Mouse's press thing again but right now instead what I want to do is just add at the top VAR on equals false and here I want to say if on background a green background otherwise a black background so let's look at that this is just a simple if statement if on otherwise background now I there's actually like I can't believe I didn't even mention this really because we looked at this with Mouse's pressed and we looked at this with um look at on it's just sort of intuitive to me but always before when you had a Boolean expression you needed to have some sort of like relational operator like if Mouse X is greater than 100 here I just said that the whole point of this is this evaluates to true or false is that sort of off the edge or there a bit of glare there but um this evaluates the true or false a variable with type Boolean you don't need to check anything about it it inherent it itself just has the value true or false it evaluates the true or false that's what it that's its whole purpose in life you could technically say this you could say if on equals true and this would be the same thing like if on has the value true but this is redundant so this might actually help you to sort of think about it because this is really what's going on but codewise it's a little bit shorter to just write if on and then open curly bracket okay so now I'm coming back over here and we see that now if on green otherwise black so I'm going to run this you can see there's no green because on is set to false and I'm not setting it to True anywhere now if on is set to true I'm going to hardcode that now the background is green because on is true so this code is being executed so now the difference between wanting to do something when the Mouse is held down versus instigated event the moment the mouse is clicked is I need to add function Mouse pressed so instead of before remember with the holding down the mouse I had this if Mouse pressed and draw now I want to have this event and what I can't do I don't want to put draw the green background here right remember draw is always looping so drawing code here in this case doesn't really make sense because it we just get overwritten by what happens in draw what I want to do is change the state of the program how do I change the state of the program well on starts as false that's its initial value and when I run the program it's false it's black what I want to do is say when I click the mouse set on equal to true or on equals true so now on equals true let's click the mouse Tada it's on click the mouse again it didn't turn off also when I run this again I can click out here it turns to on so how do I get it only to turn to on if I'm within the bounds of that rectangle well that's an easy thing that's why I saved this code we can now inside Mouse press test for uh oops we can test for the location so the thing that I've added right here is now when the mouse is pressed first check to see where the mouse is and only if it's within that rectangle set it equal to on so let's run this again okay I'm clicking all around the outside nothing's happening now I'm going to click in the center here it comes it turns on now I want it to turn off so this is a tricky one if it's on if it's true it should go off otherwise if it's off it should become I already confused myself we want it to toggle it State true becomes false false becomes true true becomes false false becomes true and I could actually type this out I could diagram this for you but I'm just going to kind of type it out I'm going to say if on is true on should be false otherwise on should be true now this is kind of like oh the camera shut off here I'm turning it back on uh so this is definitely is like a point of confusion now the camera turn off I don't need to go over there anymore this is definitely a point of confusion It's Tricky like uh of like very circular weird logic but think about it if it's on turn it off otherwise it must have been off so turn it on so let's see if that works yay so now I have this button every time I press it I change the state of the program pretty exciting now this however can be condensed all into one line of code and it involves an operator that I this is perfect because I was like what operator did I forget the not operator is something that I forgot so let me I do need to come over here so I need to turn this camera back on uh so I want to look here at the not operator so we know that I could say something like if Mouse X is greater than 100 do something and I could invert this like the opposite of it's greater than 100 would be kind of like less than or equal to 100 but I can also say if it's not not true that it's greater than 100 do something and the not operator is an exclamation point so for example if not on what does this mean do something so I have a variable on it's equal to false does this code get executed yes or no not false is true so this expression together evaluates to True therefore this code does get U does get evaluated so let me make another statement to you and this is like we really this is like very uncomfortable here we're going to do it on equals not on what does that mean I want to set the value of this variable to not itself so if its value is false not not false is true if its value is true not true is false so this much like we had that expression speed equals speed * 1 this reversed the polarity of a number 3 becomes neg3 neg3 becomes three take a number multiply by negative 1 makes a negative positive a positive negative this expression takes a Boolean value makes false true or true false so if I come back over here and look at this I could take all of this right here which has this effect of toggling the Boolean variable and I could just change it to one line of code uh equals not on and I'm going to run this the light goes on and off I've got a button I can click outside and nothing happens I click inside now we lost our little rollover so I'm going to also add that back in which is just about highlighting the color and uh so uh we don't need the mouse's pressed part anymore sorry and so all we're doing here sorry is I wanted to add in also so notice if I want to check is the mouse over it continuously that's something I need to do in draw but at the moment the mouse is pressed I also need to check is the mouse over it for the button so this is now has the functionality of if I'm over it it's highlighted but only if I click does that button engage so I have a couple things to say about this number one is anytime you notice two pieces of code in your program that are basically identical you should ask yourself the question is there a better way to do this now we haven't we need to get further down the road here but maybe there's a way we could create our own function that tested if a if the mouse is over a given point and we kind of can do that in two places without have copy and pasting the same code that's something we're going to see later that I'm going to show you later the other thing to think about here that's super interesting again I think it's a point that I started with is we just I just spent uh oh my God this is 20 minutes this video crazy 20 minutes just looking at how to like make a button to have you know roll over versus a button and what's interesting about working in P5 and in the browser is later and as I get to further topics I would like to show you how you can add buttons and interface elements that you get essentially for free that are part of the Native browser environment ments they're HTML elements they're elements that you can add to a web page with a little bit of actually code in P5 will let you just create one and you can kind of hook different events and the the P5 is going to take care of a lot of this is the mouse over it or did the mouse press it that type of thing but I think there's a moment here as you're just starting out programming working in the raw canvas that it's worthwhile to try to program some of these button and rollover uh kind of elements and it's just good practice and kind of gets you working with all this logic stuff and it'll be interesting to compare to it later so I would say if you're trying to think of an exercise of piggyback off of this is you might have some stuff try have ADD putting this kind of button on a sketch where there's something moving around the screen and when you press the button can you make the like thing move in a different direction or change its size or what kind of other types of things can you hook into like a button like this besides just changing the background color okay hopefully that was useful to you I am now going to stop this video and I'm going to move on to making some videos about loops stop recording here we go okay now uh live stream I'm just talking to you now uh going to see uh yes uh shoot oh great oh interesting the audio is in Stereo but it's bad oh well so this video probably needs to be rerecorded I can't I don't look at the chat during it which is too bad is the so wait a second I just want to debug this for a little bit unfortunately you guys are behind me um the audio is bad now oh yeah look at that uh it's going back and forth what did I do G shoot ah never change the settings uh okay uh shoot I don't know what I changed uh show Source settings darn it h did I switch this I don't think so silly wirecast I'm using o hey you guys can't see me sorry um I'm G to try to let me hold on uh oh green screen oh no I've really messed things up ah what's going on oh no no no this is the Whiteboard okay um and audio audio audio audio I didn't change anything test test test this is like this is changing the sensitivity test test test where did I change the like did I click on something here uh oh boy uh test test okay uh hi everyone uh the audio is just all screwed up so I'm going to unfortunately stop this broadcast um and I might restart another one if I can figure it out okay because I I don't want to sit here and debug this live sorry um thank you guys for tolerating this unfortunately I'm going to have to uh rerecord that video it seems like just too bad how do I stop this uh stop streaming okay
