you and ten nine eight seven six five four three two one and you're live oh wait no it's me I'm not your life no I live I have you you were me we are we I don't know whatever okay hello good afternoon happy 2020 2020 which does not in any way whatsoever remotely describe my vision which is about 28,000 I cannot see anything this is really how I should live stream without my glasses I cannot see a thing at all I am taking swimming lessons I do know how to swim but I don't know why I'm bringing this up first but I wanted to exercise more I do exercise quite a bit I ran the marathon last year but I would like to develop some more full body fitness and I thought swimming might be a good thing for me to try both of my kids are very good swimmers and I notice they could swim much better than I can so I went to sign them up for swim lessons I signed myself up for swim lessons they are Stage four and six I am in level three why was I talking about this oh because I had to take my glasses off and I can't see anybody in the class I can't see the teacher put on goggles it's very awkward and I actually like I discovered I the teacher thought I was lefthanded which I am righthanded because I was breathing in the wrong direction so much to talk about with the swimming lessons but that is not really what I'm here to talk about today I am here on the coding train in 2020 in 2020 to do a lot of new tutorials and coding challenges and fun stuff and hopefully upgrade the systems and various things with which I engage with the community here just quick shout out to Cody garden with CJ who was in the chat I was watching CJ stream this morning and in he has some really incredible systems that he's built to interact with the community and manage content which is really inspiring and wonderful I encourage you to check that out if you haven't somebody post cj's I'll link to see his channel in the chat if you could and I owe the reason why I'm also mentioning this is because one of the big things on my list of topics today is talk about the new coding train Oh discord and a lot of what I'm doing with the discord has been modeled from coding Gardens discord which is a quite vibrant growing if you will community so I wanted to show the discord and talk about the discord in a moment but I have one other random non sequitur arrived to other well once not a random non sequitur because it is the sponsor of today's livestream whoops wrong button come back here lame so I will talk a little bit more about dashlane during the intermission of the livestream but you can check out laying at late calm slash coding train it is a password manager I can't live in this world without a password manager and if you don't have one you can get a 30day free trial lien premium just by going to that link and also a discount if you choose to purchase premium ok so the other thing that I wanted to mention and bring up is I was I felt like I was gonna try to like spontaneously segue into this organically which is what I did with the swimming thing which I did not intend to talk about but I just wanted to mention something new that I'm also doing in 2020 let's see if I can go to money pause rescue as I am fostering a dog and I hope to foster more dogs currently let's see adopt with uh this is not a sponsor there's no like official relationship here between oh you can't see my laptop here we go how's biz willing says I could go it BTB suggests I can get prescription swimming goggles I know is it worth it I mean maybe I should I don't know how expensive that is but I will consider that I loved seeing all the coating garden emojis in the in the chat I wish there's a way like in discord I've enjoying how you can kind of share some of the emojis across different servers but okay I'm off I'm off track I'm well I'm already I'm off track I'm up the off track I'm always off track that's what the coding drain does it veers off track and now I am off the off track which is if I get off off the off off track we're really we know where everything is lost we're in big trouble there so this so I wanted to just mention I don't know if you're in the New York City area if you're thinking about adopting a dog or fostering a dog the dog that I'm fostering right now is Rover there is uh you can really recognize Rover from the Kota Gede the Cabana set it's not really a set actually old very small garden where I live in Brooklyn that's Rover he is nine months old we think man that's what a muddy paws has aged put his age at um he was found tied to a tree and rescued by muddy paws in Kentucky and brought to New York we're gonna grandpa and so and he's currently living at ma with me and my family but on Saturday I don't know if like news here or calendar probably under calendar if you want to meet Rover you can go to their adoption event which is this one no this one adoption event prescheduled these are I guess he's at the pre scheduled meetings and a walk up another dog there okay I just wanted to mention that I've five hopefully I'm going to continue to foster more dogs I don't know if I'm ready for the full commitment of I have two cats as you know you can follow them on Instagram at mango and goose become just that I have a platform now it's grown over the years it's kind of exciting and fun and I can like promote my random weird stuff just and people will watch it listen I don't know it's a little bit weird but that's or MIDI but I will get to the coding stuff and all the things that you're actually here for Jordan says I missed the train chuggachugga chuggachugga choochoo by the way I'm wearing a new shirt it's pineapple shirt I'm wearing a sweater because it's winter but it's already the temperature just keeps going up and up in this room as I stream so I'm sure this sweater will come up the mouth eventually Cassandra says thanks for fostering a dog thank you for writing thank you for fostering a dog and there we go oh yeah I woke up I wake up now at this morning I woke up at 545 a.m. and took a rover on a walk at 600 a.m. which I would know you know I wake up early anyway because I got kids I got to go to school I got stuff to do but there's something about it's dark out it's New York City there's nobody there it's very empty on the street I have to say I feel so like kind of corny but alive and awake by taking this he's a very large dog which it's a little bit tricky to handle I don't have a lot of experience the muddy paws has been very kind to give us tips and we're sort of trying to train him and you know you've had all sorts of issues to start because he had been living outside you know like what it means to go on a walk but anyway I could talk about this forever I'm good I'm gonna stop now as chirag says let's start coding I would just say it's not so likely that I'm gonna start coding anytime in the next few minutes but I will get to it hopefully by 2 o'clock I'll be here for a couple hours too all right so what were some of the other things alright let's get to the big news big news I am revamping and relaunching a lot of things related to the kind of community interaction membership supporter stuff so I kind of wanna because I'm gonna talk about both of those things together let me just pull up the discord because that's really where it's all happening so this is the coding train a discord server I am a complete and total discord newb as the boobers would say oh wait this is buzzing I must catch this Pokemon for a second gonna catch it catch it I wonder what it is hey I'm just gonna be doing this because the camera doesn't shut off as much and I'll have a button to press I got it I need a button to press every 30 minutes this might be a little bit more often than every 30 minutes I think I'm gonna have to put that away a problem I have a problem I know it's 20/20 and I am holding a pok√© ball plus catching a Pokemon a Pokemon go to other my thumb and I am a 46 year old human being on this planet doing that okay gotta catch them all um I do need to go to the barber shop that's not what Lucas said he said nice beard but I died I'm just I don't like doing it money okay discord so I'm totally new to discord previously there was there were two things that existed previously there was an unofficial discord which is what you're actually seeing here which was set up and maintained by nola one two two two two some number of tubes by their username I also ran a slack channel which was a private slack channel for YouTube members and patrons and sometimes I would invite various other people there if they were contributors or collaborators in some particular way to the coding terrain or related things I don't the we so in 2020 we have I have decided we along with a lot of people's help to consolidate these two things so there is no longer a slack channel for the coding drain it still exists and somebody could post there and I probably get a notification somewhere but I am deprecating that in lieu of this discord so this was a existing discord a lot of you may be watching are already members were members we've redesigned it a bit a lot of help from side the coding trained community manager who is a pictured in the top right up there under the conductor role as well as various discord experts and moderators notably Coby L and Noah and then a lot of other people who are there under station manager which is the moderator because I'm trying by the way I spend way too much time on a Wikipedia page called like list of railway occupations trying to figure out how to name things I really should have gone with the garden thing and so it you know you got plants and buds and see all that it's great this train stuff it's very confusing I mean I had the rainbow the rainbow was a good start I could have gone with colors so many options there so this is now publicly joinable please there's a link in this video's description already underneath a couple things maybe but if one of you who is a moderator could post the link to the invite in the chat right now you can join and so I you know there's a lot of stuff to figure out in terms of how this is going to work what I would ask of you and this is an ongoing working document I would say is please read the when you join read the Welcome channel so the Welcome Channel and thank you I'm like constantly referencing codon garden today but thank you to CJ and the coding garden who has a wonderful welcome channel of which we took some inspiration from to design this so this has a little bit of guide to what the different channels are I think the thing to highlight here is that if you're looking for coding help this is now a place in addition to lots of other places previously if anybody ever emailed me or tweeted usually say go to the processing discourse which is a forum online and if you have p5 are processing questions that's really your best bet so I still would say go to the processing discourse for general questions and discussion it's a kind of official place to get help but I also now have these discord channels and there are some things here that come up on this channel hi5 really probably shouldn't be related to get related to machine learning related to no js' that you could also ask here so try to use these categories try to you know there's a nice community of people answering questions there I don't know I've been very active in it like today and yesterday because I'm on break now for men why that goes back in the session I'll probably disappear for the large part but we'll be checking in and participating there is also you can't see it but there it let's see what else should I highlight Oh if you've ever wanted to get a notification for me when I'm thinking about what I might live stream I will do hope to get a regular schedule going I think I might switch to Thursdays this semester once I get the sort of rhythm of things going but oh and in fee is asking will there be a channel for normal web JavaScript rather than p5 sure we could add one for I I don't want to like have too many but if if there is a lot of JavaScript questions that don't relate to p5 or node I think that could make sense so I'm game for that I could see somebody won't ask about he's thinking a weight or something so yes Python could change to other but I think yeah my alright let's not talk about that too much so that's that what else oh so uh so in this channel schedule what I'm going to now do is there is a roll if you're not familiar with discord hello I mean either welcome thank you for learning about this with me but there's a thing called a roll so you can self a son we haven't set this up yet but you'll be able to self assign yourself the roll at notifications and then you can then receive a notification from me within discord earlier than when a YouTube event will be created so my process is as follows my livestream this Friday hmm what time I'm not really sure it might be Thursday that's just me and my own agony at home or in the middle of the night aren't walking this foster dog then eventually I catch oh no no I'm really gonna do it on Friday and then I will come in here and post a notification like hey I'm gonna live sure one Friday not sure the time yet and then I'll decide have the time like oh it's gonna be at 100 p.m. Eastern Time probably and then oh no actually it's really gonna be 130 and then I'll post that and also make a public event so the public event usually appears on YouTube but I'm really solidified into the time because I hate to change that sometimes I go a little wiggle room there I'll make it 15 minutes later 15 minutes earlier but I thought process baby and then it's not gonna spam you but yeah so if you want to like be clued in a bit more on when I'm livestreaming there and I'll also use that for other things like I'm launching a new merchandise store which I could show you some images and things of stuff I've mentioned it before I don't man I don't want to like go to off the rails the great thing about the train metaphor is the off the rails and off track stuff which is very on the nose for the coding train and I also really am excited to do some tutorials around making a discord bot or a coding challenge and there is an opensource train bot that NOLA set up and there's the coding train cafe assignment is mentioning so there's gonna be a lot more here to happen in the future this year 2020 is the year of the coding train discord okay if you have questions and concerns so let me go back to the Welcome channel so these are the different channels if you choose to subscribe as a YouTube member maybe I'll come back and talk about that there are some additional channels like we have a secondary live chat going here at that I see separate from the YouTube chat work as the YouTube chat sometimes just has a lot of messages that I can't follow but an important suggestion or tidbit goes in there there are some rewards that you can get that are listed you know just all I'm happy to have discussion about suggestions and either place I don't like this idea of a tiered system but I don't that doesn't it's not something that I love but you know there is a need for sort of curation and there's a practical reality of you know you know how large a group can be so it helps to have this or a subset group and yeah and I'll take a peek and there's a channel there where you can ask me questions so there are different roles here there's the conductor's the owner and it's also psy there's the admins which is sighs so give any questions about the community or concerns you could reach out to psy they speak for the coding train and then there's lots of other people who are volunteer moderators and admins under dispatcher dispatcher and station manager signal metate maintainer is for people a part of like the production team like Matt Chu who does the video editing and violet who's been helping to manage github repos and Chloe is working on some projects as well and then there's a role for community members who want to kind of take a volunteer mentor and questionanswering a role engineer you know with the train now go with the train metaphor not like some techie thing maybe there's a better maybe there maybe they should be a wonder I don't know to get taker that doesn't make sense so that could be you watching right now you could be an engineer and you don't have to be an expert you just have to be a thoughtful helpful person who wants to spend some time answering questions and that so the other thing that I that's really important for me to highlight this is that that has existed for quite some time it's in a github repo which is linked down here but this is the coding train code of conduct I this is required reading for participating we will take this very seriously and this is there is a reporting process so the reporting process for if someone is in violation of the code of contact there are two email addresses info at the coding train how much will go to sy and me this is my coding train comm email address and size coding train comm email address so if we were reporting a code of conduct violations on me which is well within your right I guess I would suggest sending that to sy and vice versa if that makes sense but all of us are required and are sort of buying into this code of conduct okay so and then so and then you can this I love I love this which came from CJ maybe other people do this as well but you can react within emoji you can pick your own emoji and it's just so fun to see I didn't know I'd become a person who loves emojis I would ask actually I just to do a little education here to not use the okay hand there's no way for me to remove that but the okay hand has unfortunately been coopted by some organizations in the United States that I usually press a symbol of hate and so you know it's a no harm no foul I'm sure people don't know about it there's a really good website maybe I'll try to find it that that explains this in more detail that I was looking at recently and I had the name escapes me but so oh and thank you too random Hanser hamster for the super chat hello okay the self assigning ah okay Co BL tells me the self assigning roles are working so just so you know I am logged in right now as a user called coding trained live which you can see here which is not my actual account in discord I just don't know it well enough that I don't want to make a mistake so this is just a generic account that doesn't have access to the supportive channels or the any of the admin channels but you can see how to join here but the thing that I'm gonna try now then is I'm gonna go here so maybe I need to need to make everything a little bigger also and I guess I can turn off like all the people's names here on the side I'm going to say oh I do not have permission of course not I do not have permission let's go where do we do a bot spam okay so I think if I in here I say TR exclamation points subscribe then now I have the notifications roll and I will be notified that's wonderful Oh tonight subscriber tonight get your Pokemon I'm not really sure oh you can actually remove reactions with your main account rightclick reactions okay hand X button okay hip chocolate chip asks is this person a professor or does he do YouTube fulltime I do not do YouTube fulltime i a very lucky a privileged person to have this full time job at New York University where I teach I suppose I have a professor that sounds a weird to say to me reason I should get over that I guess at this point and I am actually broadcasting live from here and it's actually if this is relate to the membership stuff because it's this is a very tricky line for me to walk and I have a lot of freedom to do whatever I kind of want to do but I really try to be thoughtful and think about what is appropriate it makes sense and how to think about the revenue that this coding train entity produces all right that earns for me and so um so let me let me just start by so yes I have a fulltime job coding trig YouTube could go away disappear be deleted Cody Trent could be canceled and I would be okay oh I think we would all be okay the world doesn't nice thing but anyway so but the coding train for me I'm running as a little bit of like a small business or a side job it is very intertwined with my job at NYU my work with processing Foundation which is a nonprofit I got to put this away it's way too distracting and and what I and it does cost money too for me to maintain mostly in the form of me hiring people to help work on it with me so that's one of the things mostly that you are supporting is the people that I have hired that I don't do all this myself I started it that way but the animations you're seeing the logo the community management the video editing the management of the github repos there's a lot of volunteers who participate and I really appreciate that I want to encourage a volunteer spirit but I also think it's important to pay people for work so there's a difference there and so that's mostly what I am using the funds for they equip a lot of the equipment I use is borrowed or from NYU this is a shared space that other people use to make video tutorials I'm going on way too long about this I should get off that channel oh dear okay what channels do I get I'll just going to minimize this now people are just you know there's a lot of gray hair here people talk about my age in the chat so I feel conflicted often about the supporters of so I would say but what is it ah so I also have sponsors those earn money for the channel on some videos I do enable the YouTube ads one of the choices that I've made is that if it's a video that I'm using specifically for a course that I'm teaching at NYU or that I know is being used in school curriculum and I know that could be anything really but there's some that are really integrated in curriculum then I turn the ads off if you are a teacher at a school where you're showing the videos and there's ads on them and you don't that's it that's an issue for you just let me know I would gladly turn them off or certain playlists or certain videos that's so that's that's sort of the state of things so if you want to join in support so if you have the means to support the Kodi drain first I would say ask yourself is there another worthy cause you have limited funds maybe the processing foundation is one maybe a dog organization that rescues dogs is another there's lots of wonderful organizations and maybe another content creator who you could support as well but if you choose to support the coding train right now I'm asking you to do that through YouTube so if I go back to the discord and if I go under how to join this would be the link that you would go to and I think I don't know what this is gonna take me to now and okay I got to update this video cuz it's not it's I made it a while ago so there are three different levels I am now tier to show you what you get these are the stickers now for that everyone will get it in pale might take a while but sigh thankfully is helping with this and some new stickers this is an exclusive sticker whatever that means won't be sold in the merchandise store you can only get it if I mail it to you it's also on my laptop here along with some CJ stickers some quick draw this is open moji project which I love whereas I can you see it I don't know so those those everybody gets at the nine dollar and 99 cent level I just make it ten dollars it's ridiculous I mean nobody thinks it's really less than ten dollars you okay I have a box of these train whistles wooden train whistles that really don't make the right sound unfortunately oh I might try a different better this is the one I got off Amazon but it already says train whistle and I don't know that these are produced I don't know who makes this one toy train whistle but these they're really two o'clock already it really is this train whistle i am i planning with psy and i are going to work on laser etching then so at ITP where I work we have laser cutters there's also a UV printer if anybody knows what that is that I could try UV printing on them whatever that is there's actually this giant vinyl cutter that I'm also playing with where I can maybe like cut and make my own stickers so many things coming in the new year and then under engineers I'm making this nice little like notebook which I will talk about later um what are the membership perks more its Horst is asking I think I probably just cover covered those three super chats came in how do I find those where I find those super chats come I don't see them new stickers says Alka indeed alright so anyway that's all I am I was everything was going so well I mean it wasn't going never goes well it's getting warmer in here thank you for tuning in and watching all right I got to get to some coding stuff now gotta start doing the real deal play the livestream at 2 XP to get as low as a 14 second delay says Alka alright so what do I want to program today I had a list I'm gonna go find it oh let me let me actually mention one thing about other thing about the discord let me go to introductions so if you're new I can see that some people are already introducing themselves here oh look at this and there's a little bit of a template for that if you have ideas for how to make this better where are you from I'm just curious a lot of people are students or maybe you're a teacher so that could say if you're a student or a teacher or maybe work somewhere I'm always curious about that almost curious how you found the coding train your favorite or first coding language or something other hobbies or interests you have so please I'm trying to introduce yourself if you have a moment in in the community all right all right looks like a lot of new this this by the way is a where is the passenger log is the is the automated bot posting people as they join which looks like a lot of people are joining now which is super fun and exciting I have a like I'm not playing oh please explain I have a intermission whoops why is it showing this and it realize that the claim benefit which is fine all right I'm taking it's not an intermission right now just need a moment should have a way of putting myself in front of this fine you can watch all the people chewing it okay let me find my list of things oh I think it's in them I think it's in the video description actually there we go okay this is my list I'm not gonna get to all of this I mean I'll be lucky if I get to like here I mean I have to do this I've committed and agreed to that I guess I've talked about all this stuff so so the first so I think I'm gonna start with going back and revisiting the pose classifier Coby tells me that 84 people have joined the discord since the start of the stream which is quite a lot of people so yeah so alright so let me go to the website first of all thank you to violet and some other folks who I'm apologies are nice pull requests which shows different people's contributions who have helped to redo the navigation of the coding train website which is hopefully going to make it easier to find the videos you're looking for so these are the three beginner playlists these are additional lists of like different kinds of collections of learning content there's a few things under this more category and this says how to add your own community contribution let me mention this is not this project is alive and kicking it is winter I actually had time on Thursday which is yesterday to do the next coding in the Cabana video which will be on the hilbert curve Rodrigo says read my question on the Pathfinder video okay I might need a link to that so but I was too cold I know heat in the Cabana and it was like 22 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday so I'm gonna wait till at least I think it's got to be in the 40s okay so where I was going here is under ml5 Jess beginner's guide so this was my 2019 project which was this is my 2019 project which was to really work on this series and some great questions being asked in the chat that I would like to get to now I understand I understand all of cj's systems down why how they're useful so but I didn't get as far as I wanted so I'm playing a little catchup on this series and so that's what I'm gonna start with I'm gonna answer a couple these questions it's coding the Cabana always mathrelated or is there something data related it's not always math related I was sort of starting trying to start with the theme of things that are kind of algorithmic and nature related but that could it could really go and and anywhere and actually would love to do something data related there's a wonderful data set that is a dataset on all the trees in New York City which I could do something on so we can remind me put that somewhere and yes jazz it down is asking is there a site I can learn how to use p5 so not to toot my own train whistle but I would say the place is right here under the coding train table under beginners under p5 yes this is my beginner playlist this is one of the ones that's used the most in curriculum so it doesn't have any ads on it and that fits with my budget just fine okay all right I'm really so confused about all this stuff or what am i doing so the video learning and a 5bit so the next video to appear on this playlist which is currently being edited from the recent live stream is making a pose classifier I would love to somebody somebody gave me a soup I don't know how to manage superjet and then the good question now I'm feeling all this like stress over it but I do want to answer that question that came in but I don't I don't know what the question was or how to find it I don't know what the pathfinder video is so please get in touch um but actually just like disable my super chance anyway ml5 jf because it distracts easily distractible @c now so the next video that's coming out is about making a pose classifier and I and match jube is as saying a suggestion use ml5 pose net to make a game based on your position and so one of the things you could have you could do with the video that I am about to release with the example that I'm about to show you is make a controller so you know if you go back to my snake game example you could make a controller where you control the snake based on a pose but that video is not out yet and one of the reasons why it's not out yet is I mean quite a big error Oh anybody noticed it it worked anyway without this error but I want to cover that error and fix the code and then record a quick green screen correction and I have not tried csharp but I do watch Sebastian lag on YouTube who has a lot of csharp unity code I believe okay triple dots in the live chat and correct click Super chats Thank You CJ yeah I don't some reason that's not you know what it is I'm not I'm on a weird page so that chat that I'm looking at is actually in the YouTube dashboard streaming panel and it doesn't have that option which is silly I should switch to a different page so I will somehow figure that out at some point okay so let me go here OOP let me close this let me go open I think what I'm looking for is so let me just show you the deployed one to make sure this is working let's see if this still works so I have a separate web cam ooh hooked up what is it seeing what so that's is that the outlet on the wall that's just the outlet okay okay it's still work yeah it still works okay so great this still works which is so this is a project that I made in a previous livestream from a while ago it's being edited probably to about a 30 minute video so this is you know my process it for a lot of content which is that'll happen in a live stream which maybe takes a couple hours and kind of edit it down to the try not to take out any of the coding parts but if I'm stuck for 20 minutes I'll just put that part of it at the end of the 20 minutes where I say what the error is so but the thing that I missed and I'm gonna go back to open it really only matters and I've already put it in the correction in this data collection example so if you recall or if you did watch I had this kind of horrifying code which is very painful to look at nested callback hell where I am using set timeout to give myself 10 seconds before I start collecting the data and setting the state to collecting and then I collect a tit for 10 seconds and then 10 seconds later set the state back to waiting and it times out okay thank you CJ's giving me some helpful tips to different places where I can look for these things the super chat stuff okay so the issue is there's another part of the code and I'm gonna take this out this is what the code looked like in the got poses function whenever I guess I made the font a little bit smaller then go back to 32 I think 32 is where I keep it when I'm streaming in the got poses function anytime I receive a pose whether what no matter what the state is this function happens they're supposed they're supposed there's opposed and then I add the data I never put a conditional in here to only collect the data once the collect so it actually was collecting if you can see if it was collecting the data all of this time collecting collecting collecting collecting collecting collecting click so I had a lot of socalled dirty data it sounded weird but that's you know it's not clean its data that's not any good that's just noise it was in all of them and the system was able to learn anyway and it did fine but the whole point of having that was to specifically collect during a defined period of time which I did not do did anybody notice that didn't anybody message me about that I don't think so I was looking and I look at it like so many times because I thought there's no way I missed that and nobody said anything or that I didn't even notice but I think that really really really did happen so I'm here so what I'm gonna do did I go over here do I still have this split thing by the way let me just see if it still works yes so this is by the way that I'm gonna use this today as well so that it can be over here still do that focus I think that's fine okay so um I'm gonna try to do a correction now I'm a little bit afraid ordinarily I I do have a system going actually maybe it's been a half an hour right I noticed I think much' is watching not see I'm gonna do something really quick I am going to go to everybody just hold your train caboose hold your horses I'm going to Google Drive and I'm gonna upload the first half an hour of the green screen footage just to make sure we had an issue where I record a backup of me just with the green screen and the telethon footage was unusable it was just like had so many dropped frames and I'm a little worried that that's happening today so I'm just going to go ahead and upload that so I'm gonna just tag matcha in discord also in case he's not like hearing this at this moment looks like here under vmix storage there's a is there a it's been 30 minutes oh I'm not recording yet well good thing I thought of that I haven't started recording though there's nothing to check nevermind so I am going to and I have to hit stop here fan is going crazy just ignore me everybody I am going to question is here tells me Rodrigo okay okay I'm gonna look we're gonna look I can't resist let's see Rodrigo question what's your Rodrigo I can't find it I can't find it is it buried at the bottom is it recent what do I do sort by newest message just oh there it is oh boy okay Rodrigo so I appreciate your question and I see it I don't think that I can debug this live right now but nope let me just find this question if somebody could post this into discord we could discuss it later so it's at Rodrigo see you el b.com slash rota and I guess I didn't get this correct Rodrigo huh ODOT BR there we go so something about this oh yeah there's an error so there's an error here I've lost all my different screens I will we could take a look at that in discord later but that would be the place to post this in the help channel maybe under p5 maybe we should have like a specific like coding challenges help channel so if it's specific to an algorithm that's one of the consent really I guess it's a p5 question but it's really coding challenge related so why don't we add a coding challenge go away why don't we add a PA a coding challenge related channel in the discord and we can post Rodrigo's question there okay and thank you and Naveed yo alright what was I doing I'm recording to disk alright we're gonna record to disk I'm gonna start that now I'm just going to assume it's working and that it was a fluke before okay okay close this and so I guess I I really appreciate people super chats and I understand its it's a it's a tool to highlight a question and I will try to take an eye on it but it's hard for me to do the live stream and debug code that comes in through a request that way so I would prefer the preferred way to support and get your question answered would be to do it through discord and if you wanted to elevate it may be I guess joining is a youtube memory of you just did it for a month that would be a way of doing that okay if you reload the page it works sometimes so probably I'll take it we'll take a look alright okay so I'm going to assume that the green screen thing is working and but first I am going to just test out that if this improves anything so let's go to what I want to do is if state equals collecting only add the data if the state equals collecting so I am going to do I'm gonna recollect all the data okay wait so what do I do I forgot the interaction so I think I press Y and it says oh I have to wait though it's gonna say collecting in a second collecting so now I'm really only collecting this okay now I'm going to do ym one it's collecting it's collecting it's collecting it's collecting and finished see it's really crazy out of this camera takes forever to focus it's collecting all this nonsense data with the unfocused camera it's done that's weird out Nick never focused see a okay and it's collecting it's collecting it's collecting oh yeah I should really move around I just got confused where I was doing all right yes round thing yeah I I did a terrible job let's just do this again I just I'm trying to take up too much time doing this but alright let's do yeah I so I'm not doing the C backwards it's mirrored the video is mirrored I'm doing it the correct way why come on focus there we go it's collecting the data collecting the data not collecting okay why and come on focus focus I think if I just stand like this it focuses faster all right no it doesn't why is it this particulate webcam there we go mm mm should move around saying okay see I'm doing it the correct way wait let me see if I get it to focus collecting and collecting and then the last one I don't know let's tie don't know how to turn off auto focus on this webcam somebody wants to tell them figure that out some logitech webcam collecting collecting collecting collecting collecting collecting collecting not collecting okay okay so now if I hit s this now saved all the data and then I'm going to go to my next example whoops which was model training so this should and then I just want to upload the data new data JSON let's upload that let's change it to new data and this should train the model this is all the stuff I did before okay so Clippy wants to know the model of the camera it is a logitech carl zeiss tests are HD 1080p does that help This Is It this is what it looks like I don't know the model of it okay so now it's train the model and it saved it so I'm gonna go to now I'm going to go to yeah I don't need to save this one I'm gonna go to deploy and I'm going to create a folder model too and I'm gonna leave this old model I'm going to rename these and let's add files here okay and now we're gonna try running this by loading model two and let's see if this works the same way or better or the same or different Owen luckily for me I moved the camera good work good work Schiffman okay and why hey yeah it's much more stable I mean the M in the a is a real problem because this is like all I'm doing differently but why so much better than it was when I made the video oh my god oh I really really really really needed that fix oh my goodness Wow Wow well ah it's fine the video will be fine anyway people will be surprised when their version performs better so now I need to record something that's just going to get spliced in so let me go back to s I can hit save here let me go back to the data collection one and let me go to here okay all right round things I would suggest you make a this is jet so yes so like a round thing thank you for the suggestions those are good ones so in theory my I don't know if this is true but I'm hoping that the full playlist of all the videos will give people the basics leading up to being able to do this project so there's a lot of dependency in this project but we'll see and this is basically all my own version of the teachable machine project with ml 5 and I talked about that in the video when it gets released so thank you we Roderigo for pointing out porting out that when you when you refresh it sometimes works ok alright so now what I want to do is have faith that the green screen is working otherwise what I could do is I could go to here I can record myself like this I'd feel like just I'm just like afraid it's fine I'll redo it if it doesn't work it has to work this stuff has to work okay all right here we go so in case you've just did what I'm doing right now is I am recording I mean this is live streaming but the thing that I'm about to say and do is going to be spliced into a video tutorial about making a pose classifier that will come out hopefully early next week okay it's time I think it's better for me to wear the pineapple shirt for the edited videos and it's so warm in here that I thought a short sleeve shirt would be a good thing up up pokeball disconnected okay this is my new shirt that I got over which were pretty very proud of it there's no green in it is there okay hi how do I enter a video sorry for a second I'm coming to you from almost week several weeks a month later a really long time look how much my beard has grown to issue a correction I have made a very significant error in this video that you're watching and I don't correct it anytime throughout the course of this video and the air is that I forgot to actually include an if statement here in the got poses event when I receive a pose I should only actually call add data when the state is collecting I was just doing it anyway sure I set the state to collecting and waiting and then to collecting and waiting but it didn't actually included conditional so I had a lot of messy extra noise in the data so I just redid it now and this the time that I'm talking to you right now and collected the data again retrain the model and performed so much better than it actually does in the video and the code that's released has that small correction in it amazingly it kind of worked anyway as you'll see as you continue watching but just note that correction when you go look at the code it was it's an important detail thanks then enjoy the rest of this video how's that oh it does perfect wahwah oh is this if I rehearse that for days right wait all right we're just gonna hope actually machiya what I'm gonna do is who's maybe not watching I'm just gonna see like where I am in the it the the all the archived footage records it makes a new file every 30 minutes I'm just curious where we are in that 30 minute so it made a new file at 219 at some point I can upload someone reminds me and a little bit later I'll upload I will upload the that video just to check it or I can just check it myself I don't need to upload it I can look at it myself let me look at it myself good talk amongst yourself for a minute I'm gonna go check this video see how the frame rate looks it's not playable Oh cuz it's it's still recording it oh so let me stop it is that bad stop it only has eight dropped frames it's gotta be fine right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm too nervous I'm gonna check it yeah looks fine I mean I look ridiculous wearing this pineapple shirt with my overgrown beard I think it's fine okay oh right I'm gonna send it back Multi quarter on I am recording again okay all right so now it's an hour I'm gonna take a short break and then I'm gonna do my first coding project and let me tell you what that's going to be so what you just saw me issue a correction for I'm gonna make a followup and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a pose classifier except it's not gonna be a classifier I'm going to have the output of the machine learning system be regression so I'm going to control what is what amounts to a slider with my body and I'll talk about that is and I think a thanks to the inspiration from darshan who is a viewer that's why I have a lot of white hair thanks to its Frazier of darshan who is a viewer I am going to have color be the output which I think will be interesting I am going to also turn this Do Not Disturb on my watch on okay all right so I and very briefly I'm going to thank my friends over at dashlane who are out of practice who are the generous sponsor of today's coding train live so that's the URL you want to go to link comm slash coding train let me show you why I like I love deftly so what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go back to our discord and when I open up the discord and I'm gonna just throw caution to the wind No is this where I do it logout where do I log out I'm gonna go up here I leave no not leave logout there it is you can't see I'm gonna click logout and then I'm going to come back to my computer here oh I like to log into the code etrade discord and see what's happening today I know my email that I signed up its info at the coding train calm my password I cannot possibly remember it because I am a person who uses different randomize passwords on everything because I don't want if one of my passwords gets compromised for it to go across everything I don't want to use like dictionary words I want good solid secure random passwords for everything how could I ever possibly manage that a password manager and there are lots of password managers that you could choose from out in the world whoa what just happened what just happened discord liked it and I take too long it just went to like a home page it log me and who is this what just happened am i hacked I'm in French what is going on I was talking about and something crazy just happened Wow all right I'm gonna have to figure that out later because and I'm gonna put in my but I go back to my spontaneous ad and I'm gonna open up Lane let me just let me start from the beginning here I'm gonna go to Lane and now this isn't my actual Lane account because I don't want all my stuff to show up here somebody scan the QR code oh wow that is wild wild that is really quite amazing cover the QR code is it still it's still visible all right well somebody could get it can i refresh this page yeah so hopefully generated a new QR code now we see so actually there's no way for something that's really fascinating that's that's kind of amazing the people are crazy so I have my discord here and there's my email I'm going to copy it and I have my password which I'm going to copy and I'm gonna enter in my master password which I can never seem to remember I'm gonna copy you only need one password that master password which is securely encrypted not available for anyone else and then I'm gonna put that in and I'm going to connect and then now I also and this is not necessarily a feature of dashlane although it will help you with this I have to find my phone because I have to factor you should always use twofactor if it's available so I'm going to get a I'm gonna go to my Authenticator app and get my twofactor code which I don't think matters it's gonna expire and just a buck a couple say that a couple seconds so that shouldn't matter and I am logged in now I did have to go to the Lane app and copy and paste these but if I were logged in if I were logged into if I were in the browser sorry there I have a Chrome extension a browser extension for laning it will automatically fill it in so for example if I were to just log out here like log out of here and then click login it's actually being filled in automatically from Lane and there you go so so this is how prepared I am so you know there are just click this here there are existing systems like keychain and chrome but you're kind of locked into a single system your passwords and info are trapped in one place so there's there's no credit card required it's signup link never has access to your personal data it's an adfree product it won't can't see your data and it works across every device there's apps for mobile the desktop and so if you want to give it a try go to Lang comm slash coding train you will get a free 30day trial of Lane premium so you can see all the premium features and try them out for 30 days and then if you did want to purchase it you'll get a 10% its discount by using the coupon code ik train as well so thank you so much the support of sponsors like Lane as well as youth of the supporters align make everything that I'm doing here possible okay so I'm gonna take a short break and I have a new break in term it animation for you and I'll be back I'm just gonna get a glass of water you could sign up for dash line now because you have a few minutes and I'm going to come back and do that tutorial where where am I looking just to doublecheck the chat and everything okay let me get back to the YouTube chat here we go okay I'm gonna mute my mic for a second I'll be back in just a few minutes yes if some folks are asking about if they've come late what's what's happened so far should they go back I would suggest don't go back I've really done nothing so far can't believe we're at the intermission already I don't know that I'm really Rick ready to go just yet but I want to watch this whiteboard because I'm going to use it to do some diagramming which I'll guess I'll let you watch the camera looks like it's askew yes you would think with all this sophisticated expensive equipment I'd have a camera that doesn't just like get knocked around fortunately for everybody here I do have a a level I'm gonna put the level over here for a second which way do I want to go this way right that's better tighten this up that's better right how does this look do I look askew it actually looks quite askew to me that's better okay how's the focus let's see you find a marker so fix the mic in a better place how's that look pretty good right okay everyone whoa minimize the discord close this oh I'm not even in the right screen we are gonna do some coding today everybody all right I'm good till for at least another hour so we're gonna get through this example oh by the way I should mention I should mention that I do have this plan not sure how I feel about it yet which is to focus on my nature of codebook for the time period between basically January 27th and May 14th that's the exact NYU semester I am teaching a course called the nature of code which is follows the material in the book I am working on rewriting the book in JavaScript I could make I do have a whole set of videos that go along with the book whatever made many years ago where I look younger and the quality do quality is much poorer so that's some what I'm thinking of doing if anybody wants to object to that you could let me know okay all right so I am now going to make a coding a simple okay I wonder if I could juggle these not too bad we need to relax a little bit 14,000 it always goes to this same page because it's very like perforated here look at that it also like that's weird translucent book there let's go ahead the other reason why I do this is it reminds me to go to the eye doctor because I cannot read it at this distance with my glasses on I can read it at this distance with my glasses on or I can read it at this distance with my or I could do this 90 thousand one hundred and nine twenty two thousand five hundred seventy eight twenty one thousand six hundred and fifty three seventy six thousand and eight hundred thirty seven thousand four hundred thirty I wonder if you went back and looked at all the times I read the random numbers if I just always end up like kind of going to the same page doing the same sequence still looking for that original print still looking for an original first edition print of this book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal deviates I've talked about it there's a Wikipedia page for it you can find out the history of this book and if you do anybody sees can can authenticate an original first edition print of this book on eBay or whatever kind of selling mechanism place that somebody would be selling one of these and has one or library somewhere please internet let me know I would like to purchase it for all the money in the world and yes something with this book is what I will do when I reach 1 million subscribers what it is I'm not sure yet a coding challenge where I create an audiobook version of this something like that ok now I'm just like afraid to do anything which is why it takes me an hour and 23 minutes before I start actually coding fixing my hair hello and my recording to the disc let's just make sure yes okay oh no I don't need to do button oh hello welcome to another beginners guide to machine learning with ml5 jazz video on pose estimation with pose net I've made two videos so far just a little warmup the warmup a little energy juice little ginger chamomile tea energy juice hello and welcome to another beginner's guide to machine learning with ml 5gs video on pose estimation and pose net so this is the third the last one that I'll do in this series here about pose net first I looked at just what pose that is and how it works and how you can get the key points of a human skeleton then I took the output of the pose net model all those key points and fed them into another neural network to do pose classification to recognize different poses that I made with my body and in this grand finale pose video I will do exactly what I did in the previous video with pose classification but perform a regression so the final output instead of being a classifier and I'm making a Y MC or a pose I will make a regression what do I mean by that exactly so so to review this set up I have is as follows oh so close well the cameras lower than usual it's a wet subject it rocked me oh I've ruined this feeding us the system starts with an image it sends that image into the pretrained pose net machine learning model that model does po performs pose estimation and gives as its output 17 XY pairs wrist elbow shoulder shoulder elbow wrist etc etc etc and then I take all of those and feed them into another neural network at ml5 neural network which then classifies those key points as y MC or a so that's the process that I've built in the first two videos and what I want to do here is what I want to do here is change the final output give myself some more space I want the final output to be continuous you can think of that as a slot what am I saying here I want the final output to no longer be categorical it's not one of four option if the final output is any number so you can think of it as the final output is going to control a slider and that slider is going to have some sort of range so what I did previously in other examples of regression in this full series if you go back is I controlled I I used a neural network to output a frequency value to play a musical note so I certainly could do that here right I could train the machine learning model to play the note ooh this pose and ooh this pose and I could actually have something that output like I could go and do that and boy wouldn't that be fun to watch but I want to do something different that'll leave as an exercise to you make a gesture opposed based musical instrument I am going to control color and this comes from a project that I referenced inspired by a viewer darshan who made a project that does an output so what I would because I'm specifically what I'd want to demonstrate here is that the regression output doesn't have to be a single number in this case I want to have three values and I'm going to think of those values as and are for read a G for green and a B for blue so I can say things like with this I'm the training can be this pose is this particular color this pose is this particular color and then this pose is this other particular color I'm imagining that those colors are going to appear and then as I move it will interpolate between those colors by trying to guess the value according to the regression does that make any sense do I need to go do that explanation again so me I am to be found one so I have to look at this one I've looked at a lot online and some of them are like ik stuff there printing which i guess is technically okay or it's like got missing pages which maybe is okay i whose want to find one that's in his best condition and that's the first printing I would take the third original print though I'm trying to say if I want to like kind of do that explanation over because I was kind of confused what I was talking about but I'll wait for a minute and think about it alright I Clippy wrote note so one thing I should always say is when you write something like yes or no in the chat I have no idea what you're referring to because you're so here like a minute behind me and so I don't remember whether I asked the question was was that totally confusing or if I asked was that totally clear so your gestured hope it's nothing that was a cool explanation all right you guys are all just your people you are you're like me I'm like a people pleaser I'll say that's great that's great no maybe you mean it you probably maybe you mean it I don't know why I should just assume that everyone's job okay I'm gonna go on alka is trolling me now in the most wonderful way right I'm gonna move forward I always want to redo things there's really no reason to I mean there is sometimes a reason to but I'm gonna go for it right duplicate this data collection for regression first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna to get started I'm building off of the code that I wrote for the data collection piece of the classifier and that's what I've got right here and the first thing that I want to do is just change the configuration of the neural network itself the inputs are the same they're still the inputs are the same there's still the same number of inputs of that neural network 34 of them but the outputs are going to change there's now three of them whoops ah there were four of them before because there were four categories now there's only three and the task is now regression so those are the only two changes I need to make otherwise everything is the same sort of oh those are the only two changes that I need to make to the configuration of the neural network itself there's plenty more I need to do here so let's think about what triggers the collecting of data oh I got to improve this I cannot tolerate this all right so what's a way for me to improve this is there a way for me to improve this without using a sink and a weight I at a minimum I could just use like I could name the functions I could use the arrow syntax what's a nice way for me to improve this without using a sink and a weight because I feel like that's going to cause a lot of maybe use then and catch yeah but set timeout doesn't support promises so I'd have to wrap it in my own thing just like a pain I seen bi m so me as typing so that's all the reason why I'm waiting cuz I feel like an answer my cup and CJ why the async/await name function no I don't I love a sink and a weight my concern is that I haven't used it at all in this series and so it's a little bit like I mean I guess I could pop it in here because I'm not I could just like pop it in there and like then refer to my other videos maybe I'll do that I was also just concerned about using Thank You Simon that's a nice I was concerned about my like do I need to make the key pressed function an async function and then it's not gonna mess up p5 let's just try it so I need my boy if only I could find all of my code examples really easily let's it's gotten a lot better so let me go to I think this would be under tutorials p5 promises and here maybe no cuz this is like not I'm just looking for here we go perfect great let me just grab this I'm going to put it all the way at the bottom and then delay time so then I'm gonna say can I say async function key crest this is also a I don't know why why does the web editor give me this warning cuz it totally supports it yeah actually saying it is okay as is but this is this I want to kind of take a look at here so then I would say wait delay 10000 state equals collecting let's just make it 1,000 for a night as well see that it's working okay so this should do look at this oh my goodness hi I love you wait what is so much better I'm just see if this works no error let me hit a key yeah it totally works okay guess I'll put this up here the states don't match the console.log oh thank you that's supposed to be waiting right this is what it should be so if you are tuning in now you have not worked with a sink and a weight before what I'm about to do it I'm gonna just reference other videos that I've made that go through it but you can see how this is so much better okay other thing that I just did right now is I rewrote this key price he praised other thing that I did just now is I rewrote this key press function to not have those nested callbacks and use a weight and a sink now this might be very unfamiliar to you it's not something that I've made a part of these videos all the way is something that I use very often in my own personal coding daily practice and so this delay function which looks like this uses something called promises a little bit convoluted but that's not what I want to say convoluted keep raced keep raced I got the stuff I've been doing a pretty good job of not starting over over and over again so I'm not gonna do that here unless it got rid of that callback hell and just rewrote this with a delay function that supports the a weight and async keywords this is something that's part of JavaScript es8 that I do use quite a bit it might be unfamiliar to you luckily for you I do have a whole separate video then I go through a sink and a weight and actually write this delay function that uses something called a promise and that makes it so I don't have all that nesting stuff and I can really just have these things happen in this particular sequence and essentially put a tensecond delay before the state is collecting and then I'm gonna be collecting in another 10 second delay before the state changes to waiting and this still happens asynchronously it all happens the same way this is just a little bit of syntactic sugar make a little sweeter for us to program so that's not the key element here to this video the key elements here to this video is what happens when I start collecting the data there's no longer a target label there's a target color and each color has three continuous numeric values I need to figure out some way can I name them how do i name them ah the target output has three continuous values a red value a green value and a blue value interestingly I could assign those as an array let me show you what I'm thinking about now so ultimately I'm gonna change this to target color and I'm going to say if the key is our set the color to red and then I will make and so I read the chat so funny [Laughter] thanks for tuning in cliffy I'm going to make I'm going to set the target color to an array of three values to 5500 if the key is G or B I'll send it to I'll set it to the corresponding three values for those colors thinking about this so the thing that I'm thinking about here is that I only want to then collect if it's a valid key press so I think what I'll do one issue here is I only want to collect the data if it's a valid key press so I think what I'm gonna do is set the target color equal to null here and then I'll just say if target color like so if one of these keys was pressed I'm sure there's a less awkward way of doing this that somebody watching will inevitably are right about in the comments then I can set I'll witness I'll set the target color to know if I press one of these three keys I'll get a valid color I've gotten a valid color I'll wait 10 seconds to start collecting and then I'll collect and then I'll wait 10 more seconds to switch it back to waiting I know switchcase use a switch case use the switch case thank you master stormer for telling me that if I add this J s hint is it really gonna work es version 8 the start of the file oh thank you so solar liners bringing up a good point and let me just address this for a second I was asking about how would you be pressing the keys when you're also making the pose and which color are you doing let me just remind you that this this is a terrible interface in that there is no interface and the interaction design is not thought out at all this is just me kind of doing a known to myself debugging way of pressing some keys giving myself 10 second seconds to strike a pose and then come back so again if you are going to make a project out of this something you'll want to do is be really thoughtful about how that interaction design works okay so the fact that target color is already an array means I can sorry let me just do this again the fact that target color is already an array means that I can configure it as the output the target output during the training and so target label becomes target color here and I don't even need this separate variable because I don't need to wrap it into an array I can just put target color right here so all of these so all the inputs for any given pose have a corresponding output which is a color three continuous values red green and blue if I want to make my life easier here even though a neural network just deals with numbers ml five has some helpful bits of it and I could actually use a JavaScript object which might have some conveniences because I could name the RG and B values so I'm actually going to go here on your outputs and change this to an array with red green and blue and then wait redgreenblue sorry give us off more space here pretty white and then yeah sorry and then when I set the colors I'll make them an object and again one is not necessarily better than the other I'm just showing you that you can do both of these with ml5 and a lot of cases it's convenient to have names to the output so when it comes back I'll remember what value goes with what this should be good so let's say split can go here and then where am i sorry and now I should be able to collect the data let's give it a try let me hold on I don't think I want to do is I want to restart the browser I find that the I think there's like a memory leak or something going on somewhere so I'm gonna just restart the browser just still like so the webcam is as responsive as possible no seriously okay not a fan of ya know old habits die hard I should use the triple equals alright so now I'm ready to collect the data let's give this a try oh it's showing like ukulele it's showing the drawing on the wall that doesn't matter why am I worrying about this it's suppose net alright gotta press R it's cuz it is it collecting the data I don't know if it worked because I didn't console.log anything ten seconds happened yet oh yeah it's collecting this will be my pose for a red color if they finished now I'm gonna do a green color this is my green color I think it finished like going way more than 10 seconds and now what should I make my pose for blue hmm no I'll come up with something when the time comes yeah I've got ten seconds mmm first you two focus man come on camera oh shoot I never focused and I'm getting like bad data shoot I'm really gonna do this whole thing again silly this ridiculous webcam I was a little confused as to what was going on so let me train again and let me actually add Oh let's skip all that we're gonna just go right to here so that I can see what's going on a little bit better let me also add in the console.log the key that was pressed so I'll just do this and I'm gonna try to collect the data now let's first so I'm gonna run this Goetsch mmm here we go there's the video I'm gonna press R so it should be collecting for R and 10 seconds this will be my posts collecting for are okay it's gonna tell me not collecting in a second and it finished collecting so now we're gonna do G I got 10 seconds come on camera focused camera ah there we go that's gee that's good enough and now we're gonna do B for blue Oh kiss camera okay what am I missing what is it like not hold on let's try to debug this a little bit I'm gonna do this again closer to the camera is that what I need to do yeah I went through this before but I haven't installed any drivers or anything for this camera all right hold on 330 geez Louise what what kind of camera was this again logitech camera webcam software oh my god Oh Logitech capture didn't I just press on products software solutions software Logitech capture I am going to click on you Logitech capture and it goes nowhere because they're like no Mac version of it or is this it the master series is this what I'm supposed to download I don't think so no this is something I'm supposed to buy Wu second link in my Google search ok no oh for Windows womp womp womp oh this is what I have it costs $9,000 what a very expensive camera I assume that's not in dollars I don't know why what what like G where G located me yes very nice oh this is such a nice webcam I have automatic light correction I definitely need that compatible with USB video device class mode you just have to I just have to give up okay we're gonna make this work hope you do this again and I'm just not gonna care so much just turn the focus ring around focus ring around objective there's no focus ring around there's no nothing for me there's no switch on it okay we're gonna give this one more try where was I in this ridiculous thing that I'm trying I got a collected data again oh is that actually well that that link you sent me CJ will that actually have Mac software I doubt it right it just says Windows it says I think Oh hold on can you post this in a nonmember only channel since I'm not signed on to the nonmember only channel is here like just posted here in general or something or I would manually focus it if I could I don't see how to manually focus it oh oh it's giving me something alright let's see what happens here everybody this is exciting all right yeah I'm not worried about installing this at all where did it go where did it go what did I just install lodger what did I install oh it's a leader idyllic I allowed it to delete it cuz I was done I don't know what I just did tape on the phone I agreed tape on the floor I don't even need the tape on the floor I'm only gonna stand in one spot new Settings panel and the system preferences did it had something here that I can't see I don't think so was it camera settings okay camera oh oh there it is thank you woohoo image widescreen advanced yeah yeah all right everybody we are back in business I ain't okay okay okay autofocus is off I mean that's good enough for me I could try to like actually focus it but I think that's fine whatever it is it's fine I mean I I could yeah that works okay great well I can do all sorts of other stuff too all right we are in good shape everybody okay haha with booth thank you everybody today thank you I think CJ who found that originally and I don't know why my camera is doing such weird stuff right now but there's it auto weight balancing still I should probably fix that but I don't want to get greedy let's fix that oh no not auto white balance yeah must be okay this is silly I wish it was white balance only there's some other auto thing okay Auto I know there's a brightness okay ah there we go thank you that's what I that's what I want I'll make sure this works ok it's still Auto is that the white balance that what is it the other auto thing it's making me crazy looks like it's like Auto what's that called name for it or I brained I've reached the part of the challenge video livestream where my brain stops working right what's that that's Auto something else I got greedy they got greedy everybody advanced restore defaults turn off auto focus store defaults gamma thank you turn off auto focus off auto focus there we go don't get greedy people this works fine this works fine the brightness is postprocessing yeah I don't know what it's doing all right we're fine we're good everybody ok here we go stop let's close discord yeah yeah yeah don't switch ok here we go now all right let me go back to the whole thing where I'm gonna add the key cuz I'm confused where I am because actually I want to add it here let me add one more console.log so I know which key I press just to confirm so I'm gonna just say console.log key no I'm ready to collect some data run the sketch I've got to think of poses for colors I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna press are pressed are I pose for are collecting I don't need 10 seconds apparently okay not collecting all right time for ji okay now blue I don't know what to do for blue hmm both hands up collecting the data all right I almost hit stop there now the feature that I implemented before is I just press s and it downloads a JSON file with all of the data now I can go to you know this stuff back in and so I guess I should come to here now I can go to my training sketch I could to add the training code to the the data collection code but since I had it separately in it now I can go to the sketch where I implemented training the model I could have just added that code to sketch I was previously working with but I'll go back and find the one that I made with the classification example and change the configuration rename that JSON file I downloaded to color poses let's take a look at that file just to be sure it's got the right stuff in it that's a long this looks good to me there's a date there's an a data array that has pairs of X's the inputs all of those key points all 34 and why is the target outputs red green and blue value so you can see this is all of my red data and eventually if I kept scrolling down for a really long time I would probably eventually find that I'm still in the red adventure I would find the data the training data eventually I would fought eventually I would find the pose data the inputs that are tied to green color different different color outputs I'm gonna delete the data from the classification uhoh whoa whoa I've got to duplicate this Oh yikes ah shoot did I already mess it up I did and now I can't undo it hold on the only thing I changed was this right for classification let me just I'm just gonna start over again here take the Auto refresh off duplicate okay come back to this okay next I'm going to the sketch that I wrote for the classification example where I had the model training code I could have added the model training code to my previous sketches kind of what I did before but I think it's easiest for me now to go to there and then reconfigure the the neural network change the file that I'm loading so it's no longer that YNC a pose data it's now a data file that I renamed to color poses you can see that right here that's the file that I downloaded let's take a look at it in Visual Studio code just to be sure it's got the right stuff in it yeah yeah yeah and we can see this is what the data looks like it's the inputs or X's that's all 34 key X Y key points of the skeleton of the pose and this is what the data looks like it's an array of X's and what XY pairs so the x's are the inputs that's all of those key points of all the points of my skeleton and the y's is the corresponding target output the color values in this case the first data is red and if I scroll all the way down eventually I'd find some of those other green values so I want to up I want to upload that file to this sketch in the web editor I can remove the old data files I've duplicated this sketch I didn't overwrite the previous one and I think this is all of that this is all the code that I need to train it's a very it's very little code yeah whoops and this is all the code that I need to train the model it just configures the neural network loads the data file when the data is ready it normalizes the data it's going to do that for the outputs as well remember I gave it color values between 0 and 255 and it's going to normalize those two one zero zero zero one zero that type of thing and then train the model here we go let's see if what this looks like whoo this is not good not good not good not good okay what went wrong Oh sad ah let's look at let's just take a look at everything in the actual JavaScript console huh how come we never got to date already oh this is sorry did this is it here okay let's take a look here I just want see this data here training data look if I go down to here do I have some Y's that are yeah it's normalized so this looks good hmm this looks good fair for training I was expecting to see something wrong with the data stream false yeah this is right anybody saying anything in the chat it should be regression it looks like discrete outputs but they could have been I should have made them probably to demonstrate like weirder numbers why he's warmed up true as metadata ready oh boy this is gonna turn out to be all right let's I wonder if I let's let's do something a little bit more radical here so I'm gonna go back to my previous sketch yeah I don't think I have unsafe changed I think it's just confused I'm gonna go back to my previous sketch where I'm collecting the data and I'm going to change this to whoops I'm going to change these two arrays and I was that naming to that naming it really shouldn't have though and then also just gonna train right in here if I press the T key I mean I just I'm just gonna use all the defaults let's try I must want to train right in here and then also like I don't need this much time like I can get there in just three seconds and I'm just gonna take like five seconds of data so I'm just gonna do something much simpler and then this should be three so there's no names and target color is just an array yeah let's try this just tried this way oops collecting for five seconds and let's try G collecting for five seconds stripey collecting for five seconds let me save this data so I save that day let me just try training it okay that seemed to work was that really the difference mmm so was there an issue with the named values or did I just have something weird in the data that I didn't notice so let me go back I'm gonna do it both ways here and do the same thing I'm gonna do I shouldn't have so I'm just trying some stuff here it's a debug what's going on because maybe now if I changed the configuration to be red green blue that should be the only thing that changes right these are the two ways of doing it let me give it certain number of how do I do the epochs again when I call train and keep rest or just say this give it more epochs just to give it more to train all right I'm trying this again so now I'm trying with the names hey gee I also just realized something then I think I'm using I'm not actually using the latest ml5 but we're gonna see about this and then be okay let's try training it okay so why did the other day maybe there was something wrong with the other data that I have and that way that I set the epochs is clearly not correct but did I not stop and restart it that was weird we're saving the state oats no this has the named interesting so something went wrong before for no reason as far as I can tell is there something wrong with my alright so I saved this data set whoops yeah this is also a named data set which is whoops which one the most recent one so let's call this color poses to stop color poses to its upload it unless I miss something in this particular know who works just fine okay so something was wrong with my original data set interesting there were missing skeleton points a solar liner yeah I saw you say that but I just figured so I think there was something bad in that first data set I'm gonna have to collect the data again it's four o'clock people four o'clock people I'm gonna get this to work I'm going to get this to work but I'm not getting to anything else on my todo list today clearly anybody's still here there's 300 people here what's wrong with you go go outside that's cold Brian go outside we're closed warmly well I need another break okay we are going to go back in time doo doo doo doo doo doo doo I need some water I'm out of tea go back in time and recollect the data huh fact save close all right I don't know if this is necessary gosh I hope the green screen stuff is recording all right oh this takes a long time to figure this stuff out all right in the future when there's an edited version of this node we'll know all that's happened I'm just about ready to collect the data but before I do so let me just add a little bit let me make a few so I need to read random numbers shake off shake it out yes the video the data could be collected from a video absolutely asks sorry Steve if I pronounce your name correctly yes maybe you don't wanna go outside any pitchblack freezing Danish winter okay I am ready to collect the data let me change a couple things one let me also console.log what key I pressed because that's gonna be helpful for me to see and I don't think I need ten seconds to wait I think I could get into my pose in three seconds so I'll save a little time now I am going to run the sketch and I'm gonna click something else I want to say cuz this came up during the the live portion of what I'm doing right now recording this the question was asked is this looks like classification and in a way it could be this looks like categorical targets like there's either red or green or blue but the idea is what I want to do is almost set some poses to certain colors and have the output interpolate between those colors so in a way what I might want to do interaction wise there might be a nicer way depending on what the target is to like you know kind of control the target output as I'm moving in round and striking different poses but here I'm just doing a very basic demonstration so you might come up with a much more clever scenario that really takes the full power of doing a regression by how you design your interface and training day and all of that but I am just going to do something and maybe what I'll do is I'll create kind of a dial so we'll see like you know I'll use my arm to sort of dial the color back and forth let's try that so I'm gonna run the sketch and I'm going to press I only have three seconds I'm gonna press art so I'm collecting our okay now I'm gonna press G which will be like here on the tile I think and now be one two three so my hope is that I can sort of show the inbetween as I move my arm like this and now let me save that data and also me just let me just train it does I have that code in here that's sort of weird to me this looks weird but I think it's weird I'm gonna just keep going now I'm not gonna let me delete all this other stuff so now I have this JSON file that's named that auto named sorry now I have that JSON file that got Auto named saved to my downloads I'm gonna call it a color poses let's take a look at it just to see what's in there again again huh hmm I set the outputs to three during data collection oh really oh let me go back and check oh well that was a mistake it might have worked actually do you know what I think it doesn't care I don't think anyone will notice that it's like it actually doesn't care it did it anyway get it like figured out that the three matched with these names so I think it's fine ironically it's fine but that was a mistake FML five was smart enough that have figured it out so that's fine so when you're saying their words I mean moving was good well let me just all right let me just I guess let me see what happens when I bring it into the other sketch because even if it was like noisy missing data oh because my arms like here it should still learn like it's gonna get the same stuff when I actually deploy it training regression hold on weird dislike the loss function is like crazy let me go all the way through with this let me go all the way through with this but and then I'll come back and record the explanation just to see that it's working so I want here and then I want to duplicate this so I'm adding the model I have the model okay and then that's fine this changes to regression and then this has to change to predict I'm gonna just leave it called classify for right now and then um let's just console.log the results so this are just I mean I'm gonna ignore the fact that the why is there a my getting some console logs yet so let's look at what what it's giving me to literally just give me one red zero unnormalized green 255 blue one point interesting so weird yeah unnormalized value yes was that pose for green and why is it only giving me one I do sometimes read the comments Abner I'm just like not right now why did I only get one why did I only get one results Oh because I don't put this in here okay well what did the what did that object look like oh I don't have it anymore do I what I do so I get an object that has an array I can't oh I can't just then look up the value by the label I should just use an array the whole time that's fine so let me just do something here I just want to see what this is doing so I'm going to in draw I wanted to just do this with but I'm gonna have to just test mm fill our no no I'm gonna change the back yeah fill our G yeah no I'll just do the background yeah of course oh no there's a video there so let's do fill RGB oh but I can do background here and I'll just use an alpha background RGB 100 I could just use an array I need to go all the way back I'm not going to so then our equals results index zero value so I thought I could say results dot just results dot red Oh No so yeah why is it in an array cuz like I don't want to do this yeah the the fact that it's numbered is weird to me but I will oblige okay can I do like this No how do you do that where you want to set them all does that work no I guess I can do this must be this there we go all right red yep looks like classification still though kind of so I'm not really demonstrating the regression as I didn't yes I'm matching how I didn't normalize the data I don't need to nor I I did normalize it in the in the training code right here so it was normalized you don't have to normalize it the second pass so I don't like this demonstration what's a better way to demonstrate this because it's not learning the inbetween well I'm so tired now do I need to come back to this another day all right like it's amazing how just like yeah you're getting a little bit of like switching between I guess I would have to give it more in between points so I really should give it a slider yeah I mean the way to properly do this would actually be to make sliders for RGB and then like mmm yeah yes still streaming I want to go all the way back to the training I know my training data isn't really good it's basically I'm doing classification and it's just like a little noisy which isn't what I want all right we're gonna go back to the data collection also I think to be honest that doesn't matter I'll leave it as named I think what I need is a volunteer yeah it's kind of over fit overfitting is an appropriate term to to apply here I'm trying to think if there's a way to salvage this so I could create three sliders for RGB I think that's what I'm gonna do all right all right I have to go yes exactly old channel and old Chuck so I think I'm gonna change to adding three sliders bear with me and then I'm just gonna do some kind of crazy like backandforth stuff I think it'll be worth it it'll be a little goofy but it'll work it'll work much better okay okay I'm gonna take a short break just to get a little water and like kind of reset a little bit because I do want to do this so give bear give me a minute and yeah only three data points only gives you a triangle Ashley is Ashley common everybody's comment is really good so I should have realized this I kind of knew this but somehow I thought it would just work of course it didn't story of a programmers life or my life give me a minute let me take a short break here I'm gonna go back to the intermission screen and I will be back in like five or ten minutes I'm gonna I'm gonna actually be going way back into this tutorial and do do it with sliders as a bunch of you are suggesting suggesting just another couple because I think Ivan's comment that ivory evaluate when life choices is pretty accurate all right sorry that was a little bit longer than I usually take a break for I needed some time to collect myself get I actually made some coffee this is tea before I had a granola bar hopefully that helped my voice is kind of feeling a little bit sore and I kind of need to go within an hour but let's see I hate to say this but I think I need to go back even further in this tutorial because so if I could remember what I was doing is I some point I described these sliders I think I'm actually just going to go straight into making them sliders and I'm gonna skip the naming so I unfortunately am going to you're going to do something illadvised which is go to pose net data collection and then I really want to delete these I can just there's nothing in these that I need I'm gonna delete them yeah you can't stop me I'm deleting that go hey I need to do this again it's just it's too much in there I don't know what's happening in the chat by the way you two could be the proud owner of a whoops sticker by joining as a YouTube member right now I will mail these to you all right so Mattia this is a gonna be an interesting challenge and I'm gonna have to remember to tell you that basically you could ignore everything that happened in the last like hour or two for the final edited version of this because I'm going to go and make them literal sliders oh no oh no I forgot about the async/await thing that I did that's fine I get to redo that just give me a sec what was that Jay s hint thing what was that Jay is hinting someone give me that jacent yes eight something or other I don't know that wasn't it all right this is good this is all good whoo that's gonna be worth it for the video that I had to I had to delete it it was a very little code that I added it was really bore all the training craziness and I have a better sense of now jas hint es version 8 yeah that's why I agree I need to be doing I've lost all momentum and everything so we're gonna give this another try there we go what what's this weird error bad option yes whoo yes version J he's a gay wait Oh No Oh No all right here we go oh I really thought everybody had left like CJ but my CJ probably left it came back okay oh oh oh I see hold on everyone I'm gonna get a little bit of extra time if I do something a little text message here everybody please hold your horses I need to do a little something and then I won't have this deadline of because I I i said i would send somebody some information that i thought was gonna be very complicated I'll do it when I'm done but I can send it to them now speaking of our spots I've looking up some information right now using a my password manager dashlane because I need to send some login information and then I use there's a way I can send it securely you know I just use signal or something okay hold your horses are held okay wait okay all right look everyone guess what CJ you had a meeting in your back you missed nothing well you didn't miss actually you missed a lot but I'm going all the way back and tied in fact even deleted all of the code because it was just so I just needed to start over oh the humanity oh the humanity I'm waiting to make sure this worked but I guess I'm just gonna I'll check this in a minute all right okay all right okay now pretend there was some period of time where I finished explaining this and then and then I'm gonna walk over and start the code again I just want to see that this message that it worked but I don't see it yes yet that's fine now I'm ready to start implementing this in code so I'm not gonna write everything again I'm gonna start from the posed classifier and the first thing that I need to do is adjust the configuration of the neural network the difference is instead of for categorical outputs ymc RA I just need three continuous outputs so I could actually just change this number to three because it's it's still a number of outputs but the task is now regression the other thing I really need to do is think about how am i during the training process how am I gonna create these target values and this is gonna be really tricky so I don't maybe this color scenario isn't the best one I only miss one person here but I think just to demonstrate this idea the best way would be for me to make these literal sliders so I'm gonna just the sliders and make the target outputs based on the position of the sliders and then when I actually deploy the model the model will control the sliders themselves and I'll see the color let's I think that's gonna work see okay great I'm off the hook I'm off the hook so this target label is no more I'm not gonna have a target label I'm gonna have a continuous values but let me create not slightly regret having three outputs for the regression but it's still something our slider ji slider and B slider so this target label is no more I don't have a target label there's no categorical output instead I'm gonna have sliders so let's comment this out and say three sliders for red green and blue they're all going to have a range between 0 and 255 with some default value in this case 0 and I'll have the sliders start with red at 255 and G and B at zero so we can see these are the sliders that I'm now going to control and match with a given and match their positions with a given pose now if you recall I had this horribly awkward for a variety of reasons interface as in no interface at all was just key presses to set a label and then it would have this like callback hell with nested set timeouts let me improve this for a little bit for this round so one thing that I could do to improve this and I haven't been using this throughout this video series I've been staying away from it but I'm going to replace this with something called a sink and a weight these are keywords that operate in JavaScript and they're part of es 8 which is a sort of newer version of JavaScript that allows me to have asynchronous events happen much more sequentially in the code I've covered this previously in several videos if you haven't seen that you'll want to go watch those or read up about promises and async and await somewhere else but what I'm actually gonna do is I'm just gonna go get the code from a very specific video where I wrote this delay function I'm gonna bring that in here and then I'm gonna change key press to use async and a weight with that delay function and now let me just do that and then explain what happened what I mean oh it is so lovely look at it look at this nice sequential code that's like set the target label console.log it wait 10 seconds then do this then wait 10 more seconds then do this isn't this lovely it is really worth taking some time to read up and explore a sink in a wait so that you can have some much more readable code this is all still happening asynchronously JavaScript everything happens asynchronously this is just sweet syntactic sugar to make our lives a little bit more joyful today so but and I also but ah but here's the that's not really the content of this video that's not that topic the topic is I don't have a target label anymore what I have is and actually let's just change this to if key equals like I'm no longer going to be collecting a particular key press so let's just have the collection moment happen when I do I'll sue D for data and then I'm going to have a target color and it's going to be an array with the values of all the sliders our slider and let's let me do this so the idea is that when I press the D key I'm gonna pull the values from the sliders I'm gonna set that to a target color we're gonna wait ten seconds so I can get in position and then start the collecting process collect for ten seconds and then jump out now it would be much better interaction wise if I could manipulate the sliders while I'm making the pose and if I had like there could just like open the magic door have a volunteer come in and help me with booth that might make more sense but I guess I didn't think of that in advance so that I'll do that another time sorry you're not feeling well a solar line I hope you feel better okay I also think that I'm gonna be able to get into position a little faster so let me change this to 3000 but I haven't done the important point the important part this target color needs to replace the target label when I collect the data and that that's happening right here so previously I had this like target label that was like a character that I put into an array and then passed it in ad data I think I can get rid of this now and just say target color so this should be good okay dare I say that I can collect this data now did I miss something I don't think I also want to collect the data for 10 seconds okay I also think that I'm gonna be collecting little bits of data because I'm gonna try to like show like straightup here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna try to show a path of alright take the values for the correct sliders ooh oh whoops ah Oh the chat thankfully is pointing out that I missed adjusting these to G and B well that would have really gotten me later thank you so I think also I just want to collect data for like three seconds because I'm gonna do things like set the color set the condom move my arms maybe like this and then just like set a lot of different colors with lots of in between states that'll really show I think the regression more clearly let me also console.log what colors there just so I see it all right I'm gonna start with the sliders in their original position and press D one two three okay I got some data now let me like adjust the slider a little bit let me add some of this color remove some this I really should fix like where I could see what color it is well next time add press D wait what happened to my pose oh I have a bug pose nap got something happened to pose now that was weird does that look just like a temporary glitch and let me start with pressing D I'll just get into this position Oh is there a bug in the code start with pressing D nope and I'm gonna just make this pose oh why some there's a bug alright what's the bug it's got to be oh here's the bug ah bug bad bug bad bad bad bug I read Eclair target color I'm making it a global variable so that I can use it across I mean there's a problem ultimately a nicer way to organize the code but I want it to be a global variable so I set it here and then when I'm adding it I get it here huh that was the problem okay now let's collect some data collecting okay now let me move the sliders around it should visualize the color but what are you gonna do I'll just add a little green and take away a little bit of red I don't know and oh wait it it froze again oh no that's just where it is less no no it's fine and press D again and where was I I'll go like this okay and I'm just gonna really make this pretty arbitrary would be good you'll get the idea I like this pose like around here man that's like do this okay I don't know so you following this along if you're gonna try to build the same thing think about how you might really thoughtfully make a bunch of colors with a defined set of poses that you mean something to you I'm doing this somewhat arbitrarily just to see if we can get some results now I could hit s to save the data and I have a nice JSON files default name that downloaded let me change this to color poses let's take a look at it Visual Studio code just to make sure it makes sense and looks like it does it's got a bunch of X's 34 it's got some wise width so the watts or the Y's are the outputs and it's an RG and B value so I could have done the thing where I named the outputs if I wanted to have names show up in the data I could change this too so ml5 of the neural network is just dealing with numbers but ml5 will allow you to specify oh it's a mistake here will allow you to specify names of the output so that when you get that back later you can figure out which is which but I'm just gonna remember there's three and there's order in the order red as the RL green as one blue is yes that'll be simpler right now so now I can go to the model training stage oh boy I forgot to duplicate this code I'm gonna have to revert the old other one data collection regression where now I can go to the training the model stage so the truth of the matter is I could add and keypress another option I press Treaty it trains the model but the way I made my classifier I did those in three separate sketches collect data train the model deploy the model so I'm gonna keep going in that way and I'm going to open up I'm going to open up the model training sketch from before I duplicate it and renamed it to regression the only thing that I need to change here is the outputs are three the task is classification and then I what I need a new data file so I'm gonna delete other data files I have and upload my new file called color poses load that file and then everything is the same I'm just running the train function and then when it's done save the model so there's very little that I need to change here it's just a different configuration load a different data file and train them huddle I hope this works I really hope this works no no actually if you're watching this right now you don't know how many times I've tried to get this to work where did it where it has it that's promising a little bit of wonky stuff going on but it trained the loss went down I think something it's gotten some results here and it looks like those files have downloaded and we could see those files there in my downloads directory which means I can go to the last sketch the one where I load the train bottle and deploy it clothes not posing at deploy thanks old channel okay so I opened that sketch I've duplicated it and now I just want to delete the model files and upload my new ones files are uploaded adjust the configuration of the network get rid of this idea let me I'm gonna delete some old code that's no longer being used and I don't have a label anymore this shouldn't be called classify pose anymore let's just call it predict predict pose or predict color call it predict color and this should be the brain because I'm not because I'm doing regression I shouldn't call the classify function I should call the predict function this changes to predict color and now the main work here is I need to change what happens when I get the results so before I was looking at a confidence score and getting a label now I just want the raw red green and blue values so so and so this should change to predict color let me just console.log the results so let's see what the results look like in the case of a regression they'll be formatted differently than when it came into the classification it's no longer a sorted list of labels ordered by confidence score sorted by confidence score all right here we go this is like some stuff I'm not using anymore just cleaning out like code that's not being used okay let me also make sure to comment out this pose label which no longer gets drawn but we're just gonna look at the console now so in theory the first pose that it sees I should get an output here that has red green and blue values uhoh I don't see any values what happened mmm let's see if what's that some console logging here add no pose here let's see what happens who ah brain loaded is not oh oh uh there's some for some reason that path says model I've been messing around with its code and that says model weird that it did give me an error like it couldn't find it is it in the oh yeah it's ain't fail to load here I don't know whose fault this is whether the web editor should be showing this or ml5 didn't log it correctly but that's definitely the problem path is model oops let's try this again no pose no pose no pose no pose predicting and I'm seeing Oh three objects are G and B let's take a look inside okay an are G and a be at our G and a B so I should be able to use those values now to set the positions of sliders oh I got to put the sliders in and then also dry could just draw the color I kind of want to see the sliders move though I think that would be fun all right so I have three sliders there so now when I get the result I can assign it to the slider so I can say R equals results index zero dot value pretty sure if I go back and look at what was in that object oh it's gone so with math geo we can like pull that up pretty sure if I go back and look at was in that object you'll see there was an array of three objects and the red value was in the value was in a property called value and then there's one and two so there were three then I should be able to say R then I should be then I should be able to set the sliders position to these values and then also might as well add something to draw the color so here before when I was getting a label I drew it as text let's draw a background overlay on the video with a little bit of alpha let's grab the values from the sliders which were set and and set that as the background with some alpha hit the autoformat and it loses the scroll alright did I get this let's run it okay look at the colors moving the sliders are sliding based on whatever pose I'm making if only I could remember what it was that I did but anything's gonna give me a predicted value so we can see there's different colors so this is working it's working gosh I hope the background recording is working if anybody watching this I'm not saying any messages in the chat guess you're behind this is cool okay thank you oh my god it's only five it's five o'clock that's not terrible okay hold on give me a second sorry everybody TMC in the chat says color gesticulations so I think this could be what this is called it's called color gesticulations I'm controlling sliders with my body it's all very arbitrary but hopefully you can see that if you did this in a thoughtful way maybe color isn't the output that you want maybe three isn't the number of regression outputs that you want maybe it's music and frequencies or this third that you must have a creative idea but you can see that if you can as you're moving your body match the position of your body with some set of numbers you could then train a model to learn all of those relationships and then interpolate between them as you move your body around so I imagine that there's a very creative exciting fun unique way of doing this and I hope that you will explore it so if you do please share it with me there's a variety of different ways to do it you can find the page on the coding train comm for this particular video um ask your questions in the chat on social media all the above we have a new discord which I'll just happen to mention it in this particular video coding train has a discord you can find the link to that in this video's description that's another way you can join the community and share what you've done so thank you so much for sticking with me it isn't light I don't know how easy this was to follow or if this makes sense because I used so much of the previous code in it so if you didn't watch those previous videos hopefully those would fill in some gaps for you but let me know I can always revisit this in a future video and thanks for watching good bye alright I'm like praying I'm gonna check I'm praying that the archived videos don't have like a million dropped frames in them so I'm not gonna look at the current one well I guess actually you know what I don't need anything else I'm gonna to stop if not I suppose we could make something out of just the this footage but it's just so much better with all the extra stuff now so let me see if I go to output three I think is the one that's the green screen at least looks fine sorry I'm just watching some this back I don't know what I would do if it wasn't any good yeah the footage look the footage looks fine oh thank thank God I did delete all my code but that's usually Greg so one thing that I know I need to do someone who can help and remind me of this this live stream like 7 million hours later is ending basically I just lost the chat so let me get them back up where's the discord I'm like not used to oh I don't have that ah I quit that don't oh there it is welcome to coding with unity welcome to passengers and we have a new passenger aboard the coding train Oh coding with unity eventually at some point I will mail you these stickers sometime in the next 15 to 20 years no no it'll be it'll be faster I'm Kyle like I would like to commit to getting everybody their stickers within three months ideally within one month like we would do a mailing of them every month and there's something yeah but all you need to do is contacts I see why at the coding train com if you have any questions about your member rewards okay um so what was I saying that's done the dis chords there I guess I didn't get to a bunch of things on my topic list please if you just if you joined late join the new discord I'll open this up it's there it's to find the link people will well that's that I can't talk anymore I hope this can be made into a video that was a very hard to do but I hope that it shows something interesting and people can make something with it so I do I do send these stickers to international as well it's not the the International mailing is a little bit tricky and kind of expensive but it's it's it's it's easy to do thanks Alko for posting the discord and that's it for today so I will could answer a couple questions maybe I'll try to pull them from the discord I'm gonna open up the general channel where are people people chatting live with this I am gotta go this is why we're kind of a record length livestream cuz it's five o'clock I start at 130 230 330 430 it's not that record like it's three and a half hours three it's really long died nobody has to pay for postage you so first of all you can buy you'll be able to buy these stickers so you don't have to sign up as a member to get the stickers I have a standard TV is helping me set up a store and it'll be you know there's a small I think I don't know what it will cost it's gonna be launched about I think January 23rd is when I was told so you'll be it'll just order this sticker sheet and they'll be like you pay for postage you buy the stickers at some point possibly like a few little profit goes to me but I'm mostly doing it not as a to make money but just to make this stuff available to people so but you can also join and I will mail them to you the idea being that if you've paid five dollars a month for a year you know that's you're supporting the channel I've got $60 YouTube's fee it should be about I think that's something it's a quarter so $15 hey it's $15 so $45 that's that's enough for me to mail you to print and mail you these stickers how do we do everybody clipboard what that is some new channels have popped up this is exciting introductions Oh master stormer so master stormer and richard guilt loom people are just joining so I'm trying to consolidate you can join via patreon or YouTube you just pause I repeat myself but there are some feature I don't honestly like they're all they're all have their pros and cons I don't love being part of the Google machine necessarily but I am this is a choice that I'm making for today and now for the foreseeable future but there are some nice integrations with YouTube itself if you joined through the YouTube platform that if you joined through patreon all the same discord stuff the stuff by mail I think I could do it's a little bit I hate to manage two platforms but my preference is for people to join via YouTube so I guess I'm saying that if you join via YouTube I promise you will get all of the member benefits if you join a patreon you might have to bug us for some member benefits and there are possibly some member benefits you can't get access to because they're only available through the YouTube integration alright thanks everybody and I oh no I did that I need to make a new I know wait till the store comes I need to make a new member video but I'll do that later I got to go I gotta go I gotta go umm thanks everyone I hate to leave I have this weird thing I mean I mean literally been streaming for like over three and a half hours but I have trouble leaving because you're all such wonderful nice people to be with me here enjoying this cold day in New York in Brooklyn and yeah and I will see you soon yeah bye oh I have an outro they're all the same gurgi asks are you on linked I'll let this finish its I've got my 30 more seconds um Jorgy asks are you on LinkedIn I am on LinkedIn do I ever look or check Lincoln no do I have all the LinkedIn emails go directly to trash or spam yes so I don't use LinkedIn if someone could convince me a reason to use it I could I'll just mention sign up for follow the coding train on Instagram it's the coding train that's sort of new ish oh okay coding with unity asks who do I message on discord for benefits okay great question this is worth me staying here for a minute so once you let me open up the discord so once you're on discord and let me just go to this how to join channel if if you've synced your YouTube and discord accounts and there's a way to do that in your settings under integrations I believe under user settings you can sync them you will automatically get access to all the channels that are here and there's a particular channel called rewards little gift emoji that you'll see that you can ask questions about the rewards there or you can message sigh see why they are responsible for doing the mailings of the physical rewards that find the community management stuff you can message see why on discord or also send them an email at see why that name sigh see why at the coding train calm and you can always message me or let me know about it I'm but it's you know I'm trying to give this over to psy and have them really to have the authority responsibility of doing that okay don't be misled by my pineapple shirt coating within the cabana video coming soon may be marching squares but I'm gonna do the Hilbert curve first alright goodbye everybody thank you so much I will see you next week on the coding I'm gonna do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me as always so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all we pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I think nine eleven currently but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven well this is like Perlin noise performance part but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this Perlin noise that is Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that is her pearling know her Perlin noise that is Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no this is Hurley noise but with early noise I might pick numbers like this this is like Perlin noise performance part autotuned and the internet will fix that unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it does not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do I'm really getting to something I need my sound generation analysis takes you
