hello and welcome to part two of my videos about sound in p5.js now I forgot a few things in my previous video that I want to briefly mention so the first thing I want to mention and let me just mute this tab here is that when you're working with sound in p5.js you want to make sure that you've also got the p5 just sounds library reference in your index of HTML file if you're downloading any of my code off the link on github it will already be there but what I'm what I'm talking about here is you want to make sure that in addition to the p5 a reference to the actual p5 just library itself you have a reference to p5 dot sound digest and you have that file in your directory of JavaScript files that you're using I'm also using the Dom library for the sliders and that sort of things and that leads me to the next thing that I forgot that I want to mention which is there is a highly convenient function in wit that goes along with the sound file called is playing and the isblank function just returns true or false whether the saw sound is playing or isn't playing and this actually comes up a lot we're actually going to see this in a future video that I have in mind where you have a sound effect that you want to like play over and over again and you don't want it to sound like this so you only want to like restart the playing if it's not already playing and as my camera shuts off just as I'm talking to you ok so let me come back over here and let's just let the add a feature to this let's create a button and I'm going to say button equals create button and I'm going to say play and what I'm going to do is I'm going to also then say button dot Mouse pressed play oh whoops I'll become this toggle toggle playing so I'm going to write a function now where I'm going to toggle whether the sound is playing or not so I could just say song dot play right so in this sense this toggle play is the callback whenever I press the button the code in here will happen so in this sense if just run this right now you can hear the song is not playing but if I click play do you hear it I don't hear it why is that oh whoops I've already playing it here what's going on here let's try this again hold on we're gonna make this work let's look at the code here I'm loading the sound I don't actually really care about the callback so much right now because conceivably by the time I hit the button it'll be ready to play create button play button mouse press toggle playing and when I press that button I should hear song play now I'm going to just wait to set the volume until here because I think that makes more sense oops loaded is not defined so just in case I'm gonna have an empty call I'm gonna just say I'm gonna list log swing to the console now the song is loaded and I hit play I muted my tab I can't really like edit this but I use gonna have to lose good I cleaned up my code a little bit and you did my tab oh I might've pulled something a little bit olden whatever okay thank you chat room for your kind help okay so I needed my tab but what I want to do is while it's playing I want this change to change to pause and then when I press it it'll change back to play okay so let's go back and here so what do I want to do here in toggle play I want to say if not song is playing we're getting further in the song we ever had before so here now you see only if it's not playing play the song otherwise let's try song got pause and what do I want to do now I want my button to say play when it's playing I want the button to say pause so now in addition to whether it's playing or not playing it or pausing it I'm going to have this video by the way is not about jump or add cue I'll put that in the next thing this is just a followup video with stopping and starting it is playing that's that's what this video is okay so now I'm gonna hit refresh and you can see it says play and I press play we hear the song it's about to come in and then I'm getting ready feeling it oh we're playing what's that trees dance you guys have kids is that what's called musical freeze whatever so you're you're dancing you're dancing you're dancing there you have to freeze and it says play okay so you get the idea so I can play and pause it now interestingly enough I used pause because when I play it again it's gonna pick up from where it last left off but if I were to change this to stop and change that to stop also and hit play what's gonna play now if I press stop it's like it's paused but when I hit play again it's gonna have gone back to the beginning so that's a key difference but stop function stops it from playing but rewinds back to the beginning whereas the pause function stops it from playing but keeps the play at at a current moment in time okay so I'm gonna let this video and here we added these features to it of just the play and pause button that's what this video is how to add a play and pause button and in the next video I'm going to look at jump and add cue how to how to like deal with sort of time in a particular piece of music
