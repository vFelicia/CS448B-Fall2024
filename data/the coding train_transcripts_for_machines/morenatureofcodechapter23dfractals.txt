can you all hear me talk do do so so do so do do do so so do all right my mic is on my new microphone this very new pristine beautiful audio quality with my deep morning voice is powering through do you hear me oh boy this is not uh that's the sponsor for today but i'll mention that in a second uh hello everyone welcome to the coding train on yet another friday my name is dan i'm coming to you live from a snowstorm in the hudson valley i am taking a peek over here on my monitor to see that my audio is going um and i just want to make sure that everybody five by five audio sounds great yes this is a brand new microphone it is a highend lavalier microphone with a receiver with giant antenna on them if i wander far away uh over to my whiteboard over here first of all i would like to point out to you it's very hard for you to see but this uh hello over here um the white you see outside is not is snow covering the yard uh oh no my um i have this thing of cardboard taped over a window over there to deal with this reflection here just would you mind would you let me put on some music for you i'm gonna get started with the whole coding train thing but this is really gonna bother me i just i i've had so many issues with getting set up today and it's really going to bother me if if that's an issue so i'm just going to walk over here i'm going to go back to this scene which is me i'm going to press this i'm going to play you the the full this dot song while i go and fix that glare issue ready enjoy as always get up and dance all right you're at home you can do it come on everybody stand up all right uh my audio still should be going through i'm just wandering over here i'm getting some tape nice giant piece of cardboard taped up this stop this dot in front of this window one of the worst jobs hopefully this is gonna hold i'm sure it's gonna fall down for me and regret this sort of terrible job i just did if i could just get one more piece of tape but you know that thing that happens to you when the tape gets like sort of stuck and then uh and then you rip it and then like sort of only half the tape is coming this is happening to me right now in the most horrifically terrible way okay i think a little little tape peeling asmr for you all today on a friday is it snowing where any of you are it is a nice big snowstorm my kids are home from school thus the uh pushing back the start time for a half an hour and i don't know i don't know how this is gonna go i i usually have a nice quiet if i'm going to start streaming at 10 30 i usually have a nice quiet um hour to an hour and a half to get ready and i had about 15 minutes which made me realize like i could not possibly start at 10 30 and so i started at well 11 now it's like 11 20 and i i have like a very high degree of difficulty um problem to work on today i'm back before i get too far into this mess uh let me take a moment to thank uh today's sponsor today's sponsor is a new sponsor um ai camp um and um so i'm i'm not as fluid in my what i'm about to say to you i'm going to do a little bit of reading from here but um what i want to tell you about ai camp's mission so ai camp aicamp avoids the pitfalls of traditional higher education through enabling our their students to learn through doing to facilitate their progress they provide immersive projectbased programs that cater to the students goals and interests while teaching them the skills they need to be selfsufficient and industry ready our company infrastructure was originally built by a worldclass team of experienced educators and seasoned industry professionals and now their operations many of their operations are being managed by several teenagers that have excelled during the programs and gone on to work for ai camp and in industry as developers and leaders so you can find out everything you want to know about ai camp at ai dash camp.org go to slash mission for their mission but this link here will take you if you are between the ages of 13 and 18 that link will take you to a scholarship application for their summer programs um it can be done fairly quickly in one sitting last summer they gave 10 of the students a full scholarship and about 60 of the students a partial scholarship so if you're looking if you're uh you know i've been i'm going to show you some more stuff from their website some of the projects that students have built later but if you are looking for something to do this summer uh virtual summer camp with ai camp um please check them out and you can apply for a scholarship through this link that i'm showing you right there all right now uh okay um um rico loic rico i see you sent me a message i don't have time to read the full paragraph of text but i appreciate it i am just as organized as i always am with my list of things to talk about today this is your first time tuning in welcome what i am intending to do today is record well i'm going to be live streaming but while i'm live streaming and please everybody needs to remind me about this when it gets the time for me to start the coding challenge that i intend to execute today everybody should say like hey dan did you remember to press record to disk because if i don't then i don't know it's just going to live in the live stream but the this new process that i've got going on and i just want to um sorry minimize some windows here oh boy i don't know what i'm looking at but oh i shouldn't have closed these windows some of them i wanted but i'm going to go to my youtube channel here and i'm going to press this button and so and i'm going to go over to videos so these um this is what you're watching right now me live um and most recently i released um this ascii video coding challenge this prime number spiral coding challenge and both of these are act actually occur during a live stream and then and they take probably well over an hour um and then during after the live stream i work with a team of a team huge massive production crew of editors thank you matia and illustrators thank you to jason and many other people who contribute um to put together these kind of edited um versions with some animations and additional references and more examples and that's what you're seeing here in the prime spiral video and the ascii vidi video coding challenge um i don't want to press the record button yet unbound i because i don't want to waste i mean i guess i really probably should record everything i ever do i should record which i should just record the vast archive that is the coding train should always be recorded but i kind of just leave these live streams up i should press record though um so one thing i wanted to say is that these videos have done better at least in their first few days or first week than anything that i've released in quite a while so i kind of feel like maybe i have after 10 some some 10 years of doing this and some 20 plus years of kind of teaching found something uh in terms of how to put together the live streams and the coding the coding challenges together so thank you for all of you who've been watching those and providing excellent feedback one thing i wanted to mention is this one the slide puzzle challenge here which was from three weeks ago i've been trying to do these you can see three weeks ago two weeks ago and then about uh one week ago five days ago i've been trying to get them every week although there isn't one ready for this week so uh three per month that's about what's happening um but this one didn't really seem to catch on uh i did just swap out the thumbnail so that's a new thumbnail and i added the word in javascript to the title maybe that will register more for people's radars but this one didn't seem to catch on in the same way as the ascii video one and this prime spiral and i don't think it's the topic but i could be wrong about that obviously because i don't have any real data to back that up so if you missed that video uh you know add to watch later check it out if you want i mean certainly if you're not interested please don't watch it just to to torture yourself my goodness would not want you to do that um thank you peter there is i'm being told there's a green screen issue but i don't see it on my monitor over here um okay so the next thing that i want to do here i talked about ai camp um two things i want to do before i get to well there's three i have three kind of uh quick things on my list before i get to the uh coding challenge for today the mandelbald coldy challenge just give you the full agenda i want to look at some community contributions which ah sorry i want to look at the passenger showcase it's now called the passenger showcase i know somebody at showcase station was the suggestion from last week but i've rebranded it a passenger showcase i want to look at some passenger showcase i want to look at some of your comments on the prime spiral video i want to just alert you to coding train social media and some of the things we're featuring for black history month then i intend to do the mandelbulb coding challenge which is going to be really hard i should try to get started with that as soon as possible while i have some fresh energy and uh then also nature of code 2.5 let's see if i can continue that end body simulation that i've been working on for that next nature of code tutorial and somewhere in there i am also going to talk to you again about ai camp let me just remind you uh today's sponsor ai camp thank you very much um and there whoops all these buttons i can't manage to do it okay so let's go i mean i wonder if i should just get going with the coding challenge and then come back to the passenger showcase the comments you know what i'm going to do that today let's see how that works because the the mandelbulb coding challenge i think is a very high degree of difficulty one relative to some of the things i've tried more recently and so i think it might take longer i might get more stuck than usual i don't even know if i'm going to succeed at this this might be very far on the sca spectrum of train wreck we've got train wreck and gravy train i don't know what these are i think the ascii one was kind of gravy train and this one was like in the middle between train wreck and gravy train i don't know i don't know if that's a real rating system that i can use so i think i would like to get started with that then i will talk to you about ai camp the sponsor and then i'll come back and in the second half of the stream i can go through some community stuff passenger showcase see if i can get back to nature of code that kind of stuff how does that sound to all of you top right corner of your camera capture ah yes thank you i see it now um let me iron that out that will really bother me first of all let's just take a look at the whiteboard that glare is gone awesome um let me see if i can see it yes it's easier for me so it's this light i think if i just turn this light it's not pointed as directly at me but i think the lighting is still fine and now it's not there thank you for um there and i am doing the mandelbulb in processing yes i mean i might investigate at the end if i could do it in p5 and i also should let you all know just in advance before you get too excited that my goal with the manual bulb is just to do a point cloud of the mandel bulb fractal so i don't believe that i'm necessarily going to like create the mesh and texture it and light it and all that stuff that sort of that could be at some point like a part two or another live stream or but i'm really leaving that up to the viewer i want to look at the math of the mandelbulb see how that's implemented get a version of it that i can see in processing and kind of go from there i also want to look at saving the date i want to look at saving the data out that way it could import it into i don't know i don't know any of these things like blender but i was thinking i've used like like over five five plus years ago i think i used mesh lab once um so i might download mesh lab and try that all right so let me find the references that i want which i literally just closed which is quite unfortunate mandel bulb but oh they're still uh over here so well let me go to the wikipedia page always a good starting point um let me find the references uh this i believe is oh no this is interesting this is not one of the references i meant to open let's see um let's see this yes this is the one that i intend to use as my primary reference i want to just see i think or maybe this is not it where is the one all right hold on this is a good reference oh yeah uh background no i there was a page i was looking at yesterday that had i thought it was this page the formulas on it and even some pseudo code okay maybe it's this and maybe it's this this is not this is good reference yeah this is definitely uh something that i should read in terms of the history i have not seen this one whoa uh yeah so hold on where is the one that i was looking at yesterday let me keep looking um i thought it was this page hold on formula no mandelbulb this was a good reference too um yeah this is the original i want to get the historical references correct i want to do the romanesco broccoli where was this page that i was looking at yesterday when i was reading up on it that had published the formula no this okay i mean i can use this is this the original publishing of the formula that would be good to reference 2007. i think this might have been the one i was looking at i'm really losing my mind here okay let me take a look at the chat no i didn't start the recording yet i'm going to uh okay i'm going to just look a little more carefully here because i was scanning this very quickly full size shown here other hot spots here okay order eight is what i'm going to do um okay we're looking for just those are the images yes this is the page i'm looking for just have to keep scrolling no where okay this is crazy like last night i found a webpage i thought it was this web page that had i mean i don't necessarily need it because i'm finding the same info but i felt like it was last wrote introduction existence uh this is not what the page looked like i think okay so if you will um and never stream your chrome history uh if you will bear with me for a moment i really want to find this link so what i'm going to do is i'm going to just switch to this view and i'm going to log out of so one of the things speaking of pro tips for streaming is i have um multiple accounts on this computer and i stream from one of them um please raise the sensitivity of the mic so i'm loathe to do that if somebody uh it does seem a tiny bit quiet actually let me try doing this um let's see how that let's see how that does but i tend to get quite a bit loud and also once i turn the noise down so just give me a moment here i am now logging into the login that i was um uh last night when i was reading some articles about the mandelbrot sorry manual bulb before um and here it is it's on skytopia skytopia.com project slash fractal to mandelbulb.html i'll even show you uh even though i'm kind of like this is uh this is the page that i was looking at last night with these formulas that i wanted to use as my main reference and i don't know why i wasn't finding it this is the same page i'm losing my mind oh no this is a slightly different one okay i'm just gonna i'm putting um hold on okay so i'm just showing you this everybody can see this url this is the url um that i want to look at everybody see it so i'm now going to go back to this view and i'm logging back out of daniel shiffman i'm no longer daniel shiffman and i'm logging into codingtrain i am now the coding train this will take a moment we're going to get there i'm logging in as the coding trait now i need to go back to that url can somebody please remind me um um oh and i see matia is just there in the chat let me know how the audio sounds i mean everybody should let me know but in particular about you as the sort of lead um lead um video editor i don't know what title to give you mattia the the coding train would not exist without mattia in the form that it does today i mean probably it wouldn't exist without me also you know i do have something to contribute here but really the the the amount of support i get from the community and different people who work on various projects is just extraordinary okay now can everybody help me let me just close out of some stuff here that i don't want to pop up okay that doesn't matter um i'm going here i'm going to lot links and then just trying to clean up my i have to do some stuff to clean up my desktop alright you know what ah that's fine i'm quitting discord i'm not gonna be showing discord today quitting this quitting this and now i'm back all right so let's see if we can find that link so aha so it was what was it it was like one mandal bulb or something i've already forgotten no four mandolin what was it somebody remind me tell me in the chat i can't paste the link there i have too many computers going all over the place um come on chat people help me out what was it for mandelbulb no fractal ah okay look we're finding it no i'm losing my mind what was that page was it this page two two thank you i couldn't remember that two it's hard getting older folks i i really feel like um i hope i can keep this coding train thing going all right to mandelbulb all right yes this is the page that i want this is so weird because look at this timestamp i'm losing my mind here timestamp 8 11 2009. and then if i go to this one same like these pages look remarkably similar this one has been updated in 2011 and this one was not so i as i am this is coding train classic where i very much like to um stick with the classics here this is the page that i'm going to use as the reference fantastic okay we are good um i do want to take a moment so let's see what else i've got here so i'm going to just close out some of these other tabs oops getting myself set up i'm going to hit record in a minute obviously this i want to just have a better understanding of the history here uh and let me minimize this i'm going to show you all this later the ai camp stuff deep breath constructed for the first time in 97 by jules reese in 2009 further developed by daniel white and paul nylander using spherical coordinates okay all right so here's the other thing i wanted to mention to you the viewers and i'll i'm going to be repeating myself in a moment when i start to kind of get into the coding challenge itself but let me i want to pull these up so mandelbrot coding challenge so i do have from uh what is getting close to six years ago now um okay fine i'm just gonna start hitting i'm gonna hit record to disc because it's too much danger of me forgetting so let me just take care of that real fast if you'll bear with me i'm going to say remind me later and this looks like it is good to go so i'm going to hit start recording so i am now recording to disk i have all my chat and other things up that i'm taking a look at um all right so things are things are recording now but i'm still not into the intro yet so this is a coding challenge um that i did uh almost six years ago i watched this actually last night which is a little odd feel i watched a 2x but i watched this one back to help me prepare for doing this and then i also watched spherical geometry coding challenge coding train this one back at 2x which is also necessary and this was also this was done these are these happened in quick succession so these were just a couple weeks ago it was interesting to watch these because um you know i'm really i do think a lot about now about that uh continuum between raw unedited coding and sort of like edited scored uh animated overlays uh coding so uh it's interesting to watch these but surprisingly what i think was so what i didn't like about watching these back is there were these like long i'm talking about i had like a pain in my side so that kind of stuff off it doesn't make it into the videos now so there is there's some authenticity to the sort of chatter that's in these that i quite enjoyed and i wonder if like my like there's such a different color i i got to think about i don't i don't know how to do my camera settings but i'm sure it's fine um so um but what was interesting about watching this is there were some just rapid cuts that were like okay i'm back i did a lot of debugging for the last half an hour and this is what i figured out whereas now even though there is a lot of stuff cut out um i i try to like have things be sped up or keep the more of the debugging time but put like lots of jump cuts in it in order to kind of create this sort of full story because i was watching it was a little bit jarring your eyes like i have no idea what just happened and how you figured that out so um okay so the mandelbrot set i'm going to refer to the spherical geometry stuff i'm going to refer to so i also need i need those formula formulae mandel brat set um okay so this is what i'm doing and then the spherical coordinates i want those formula which uh is here this is what i'm looking for interestingly enough yeah this is what i was expecting to see so this is what i want okay great all right let's also get something out of the way um what is the proper pronunciation for this i believe the proper greek pronunciation of the greek letter is fee um but i often hear it pronounced as phi in a sort of like more informal like way or incorrect way i guess there's another way of putting that i think i want to say fee am i going to and by the way this is totally i think like 20 minutes on this in the spherical coding challenge so if anybody who feels strongly about the pronunciation you know writing fphi is not helpful to me fee everyone is saying fee fee according to wikipedia fee okay fee fi fo thumb okay so i'm gonna say fee so that's out of the way i also just want to acknowledge i people are i see in the chat or making some comments and references to current events i am aware of kind of the horror that's going on in the world the war that is happening um i am choosing to focus on the coding train with that put to the side today that's a a form of privilege that i am able to do that but um i just you know since some people were mentioning it in the chat i wanted to just make a quick acknowledgement and if anybody is sort of suffering and having uh difficulty due to the events like i i feel for you i hope that this coding train stream if you're able to if you're able to watch it is something that can uh improve your day although i recognize it probably can't okay so that's all i have to say about that and i'm going to find a whiteboard marker and just make sure that the whiteboard stuff is going i'm also going to turn off the heaters so that the audio is a little bit better quality i also feel like i need a tissue which i have now found but i prefer to mute my microphone before i blow my nose okay my mic is back uh simon i see your comments about how i botched my explanation of imaginary numbers in the mathematics set i was feeling a lot of pain watching that back yesterday so thank you for that reminder let me just write over here to make sure i have the whiteboard focused can i push this back at all it's all the way back and i just want to see if the focus is good there's a way for me to zoom but i think i'm just going to have to do my best here you know what actually there's an easier way for me to do this if i stand back here apologies i'm just focusing the camera gosh it's really hard for me to tell um but i guess that's going to be good enough and it's a little bit that's a little better lightingwise i think just made it darker but i don't know maybe i should oh you know what i know i remember why i don't do that because it's pulling the brightness from behind it's a little bit backlit okay that should be good um how does this look to everybody i think that looks good i can go check it over here yep okay uh all right so is this four okay okay so mattia just as a note this is the this is the reference image that we'll start with um because this is precisely the version that i hope to create now mind you again to the live audience here what i intend to create will not look anything like this although i would like to get to there i would like to render it with like but that'll have to be another i mean i'm just gonna be happy if i get anything remotely close okay then what was the other thing that i ah yes processing so let's make sure i think i am using the most recent version of processing beta six i think that's what i've got let's open let's run this one how can i tell um for oh no i'm in beta 5. so let's quickly um let's get let's get beta 6. i can't believe it's almost noon what a day what a day um let me copy that over here oh do i have processing open right now because no yeah okay quit this see if it'll let me do this replace okay put this here let's try to get beta 6 going now one thing i also want to sort out is what is the uh best so i personally love the purple theme and i just want to see like i think for let me see if i can just move this over a tiny bit i don't actually need this notebook here so that can give me a little bit more space because the further i stand to the side here the more space there is for the code and then if i say void setup void draw um mandel mandel bulb and then let's make the console size 24 editor size 32. let's try this how is this for a font size and i know everyone's telling me and the other thing though is as much as i love this particular theme it's not clear to me if this is good for um if this if this is optimal for viewing the viewing experience so let's take a look here like this is the default so i wonder if um i wonder if this is better i've i've i think the text was hard to read um yeah people are saying looks good but i can't tell yeah i think the purple theme i find to be lots of fun but the this this sort of default theme i mean i could certainly pick something like this but i think a light as much as i love a dark a good dark theme i think for legibility oh i love the yellow um oh boy oh no no too many comments all right hold on we're gonna i i again i'm probably gonna go with light and uh uh for video playback not for your own coding dark light okay so i put up a quick little poll um if people want to vote i'm just curious but i personally think that for legibility in a video the light theme is better although what do i use for p5 that's not true i'm always using this in p5 so maybe i'm wrong about that but i did feel like this particular dark theme these colors the red here is not very visible so i wonder if there is like a better i'm just not happy with it with any of these dark this one this one is a little bit closer to i think what could work um but i want accessibility and contrast is a major thing to pay attention to i think i i think i need to go with the light one people are voting for the dark i just don't see that any of these i hear you all i'm sorry that i'm gonna veto it but i don't feel that these dark themes are presently high contrast enough like um how do i do that uh there is there's something that i downloaded once there was a tool that i was able to download and hover over things uh i swear there was like something i could download that allowed me to check this is for windows oh for mac i think this might have been what i was doing use an eye drop tool turquoise plus black is my favorite the top theme zero zero my favorite is three oh um um this is this is like welcome to the coding training i do everything within my power to procrastinate because i'm so afraid of trying to code the thing i'm actually getting quite warm it's getting hot in here which is like sort of the idea because i'm going to turn off the heaters let's just see how this goes look we're doing a service here because if we can help improve the themes that are in the processing ide that's a that's a good thing for everybody what was that thing called color come on run okay this is not the thing that i was thinking of but it will work so let me go here so for example oops no no hold on so the foreground color the foreground color for example is wait how come this is not working oh maybe it is showing me the colors yeah but i should be seeing black here i'm so confused this is not working the way that i expected it to all right and background color yeah this is not working correctly why did that not work ah do you see how this is not working it's like not picking up processing for some reason you've got to give it accessibility permissions okay where do i do that preferences um thank you accessibility where are those uh display somebody's going to tell me give it permission um where do i give it permission maybe that's in like privacy usually it requests let me see if i can get it to request um okay security and privacy screen recording is that what it needs um okay let's do that that must be what it needed right yeah there we go thank you everybody pass all right you know what this passes with flying colors literally uh so now i feel better about it um i kind of like this one wait hold on but wait is this the one i wanted to pick this is so important in all this time the purple i don't like the red i like to like this one this one's pretty good what was i i think actually i think i kind of like that one which one was it no i'm lost oh was this one it's kind of cute oh but i really got to check this purple is the issue so yeah it failed so this so this is the issue that that purple fails um so let's not use this one let's try this one pass fail see these fail pass oh that one whoa wait a sec interesting enhanced oh it passes for large text uh so that's fine because i'm using large text i believe fails for large text minimum enhanced i feel like we should get the enhanced large text so none of these are really passing if i'm being perfectly honest oops yellow background oh so close yeah much of these are actually having issues um so i don't know what to do now i'm lost i expected one to sort of be obvious okay i gotta put this away and um it's going to be okay i will be doing the best that i can with the tools that i have and i'm going to pick one i'm just going to pick one based on what looks good to me i mean i kind of tempted to go with this because this is just the default i'm going to use the default yeah white background is better for visually impaired okay start coding i'm gonna use the default i can't no one i can't i can't get too wrapped up in this the default is the default is the default let's use that okay um close this close this and okay okay all right everybody i i procrastinated enough i am going to make sure the recording is still working um stop recording start recording okay now let me turn off the heaters so that we have as pure audio as possible okay all right everyone it is time now no more procrastinating no more monkeying around i must code the thing that's what you're all here for it's only an hour in i kind of have to pee oh my god does anybody still watch while there's still people here i can't believe it all right 32 30. this is good this is the setup we're going for just please please allow me a 30 second break okay i'm muting my microphone do do do all right i'm back okay everybody it's finally happening here we go um i'm just making sure i have all the like views that i need over here okay okay apologies i see some people in the chat are a little uh unhappy with how long i've how much time i've wasted here and you know it's just kind of my process but it is what it is okay um if you that's why i also have edited versions sorry everybody i'm just going to put this down here so i can see for when i'm recording okay great all right here we go all right yeah i know everyone's complaining also about the autofocus it it stays stable when i stay here coding and talking to you so hopefully that's gonna be fine okay okay here we go everybody i just okay it takes so much energy to blow the train whistle okay i can do this i can do this hello everyone we are no we're not we it's just me here there's no we hello everyone i am back for another coding challenge i am quite terrified of what i'm about to make today that i'm showing you pictured here to the left of me although i have a feeling what i end up at the end will look nothing like the beauty that you're seeing but we'll see how far i get how close i can get to this no more starting over this is my one starting over and um yeah here we go hello everyone welcome to another coding challenge the mental bulb i'm a little bit terrified if i'm being perfectly honest of what i'm about to attempt to do uh i have made many years ago almost six years ago there is a coding challenge called the mandelbrot set which is the wellknown famous ah okay go dan thanks luke okay wait let me end this stupid poll it's really bothering me i can't see the chat messages okay this is this is really last time last time hello everyone and welcome to another coding challenge the mental bulb yeah i'm a little bit afraid if i'm being perfectly honest with this the formulas look quite a bit scary but the beauty of the mandelbulb cannot be exaggerated it is just gorgeous look at it so i'm going to attempt somehow to understand the math behind this form and how to take the first steps to creating my own mandelbulb in processing now if you want some prerequisites before you get i don't you don't need these i'm just going to plow ahead and try to explain everything as i go but there are two previous coding challenges that i made one is the mandelbrot set the 2d version the very famous fractal the mandelbrot set the 2d version of what i'm about to attempt to make this 3d mandelbulb and also i have made did a coding channel and also i created what am i saying here and also you might want to take a look at the coding challenge on spherical geometry because the idea here is is there a way to take the 2d form that is the mandelbrot set and extrude it extract it deform it stretch it pull it and make it into something threedimensional all right so um so a quick bit of history here the mandelbulb was constructed for the first um a quick bit of history here the first construction of the mandelbulb fractal itself was in 1997 by jule ruiz and in 2009 it was further developed by daniel white and paul nylander and and and the these ancient and these beautifully designed 90s and early 2 and these beautifully designed 2000 era web pages are my core reference for what i'm going to build in today's processing if you want to try coding along with me go and download processing the java development environment if you want to code along with me go ahead and download processing at processing.org it is a creative coding development environment built in java and there is a wonderful and beautiful community of people using both processing and the javascript creative coding framework p5.js which i also use in a lot of my videos okay so acidic is saying should probably show the old websites when you mention them um i truly should not read the chat while i'm doing this oh the chat's very critical of me today what is going on it's okay it's gonna be fine editing makes it all kind of great we just edit all that out and move it around and fix it it's going to be fine um so i am kind of like in my head have i know i have an awareness of the postproduction that i plan to do in which case i'm going to recapture and show these different web pages and images so it's a little bit lazy for me not to show them to you here right now but that's kind of um uh what's happening today all right um all right so let's go over so so let me go over here okay now people are giving me nice comments let me start by briefly reviewing what is the mandelbrot set does it matter in the mandelbrot set which axis i mark as a and which one i mark as b i mean clearly it does uh i think b would be the yaxis hold on i've got to make this somewhat continuous for matia just see if anybody in the chat is saying anything that i want to take a look at b is the imaginary axis it must be the vertical one thank you john that's what i assumed okay so i don't want to rehash the entire thing again from my mandelbrot video but the idea of the mandelbrot set is we are looking at every twodimensional coordinate on the complex plane a complex number is a number that has a real component and an imaginary component now in my when i recorded the mandelbrot set i was trying to be sort of fun and friendly and goofy and i was talking about imaginary numbers as imaginary and not real no they are things that exist the imaginary numbers are not actually imaginary we just refer to them that way i i can't get going today but i'm gonna get there i'm gonna get there people now when i was recording my mandelbrot set coding challenge i was a little bit flippant in talking about imaginary numbers as imaginary no they really do exist in theoretical mathematics the square root of negative one is i and this is fundamentally needed for all sorts of applications that ha that we do in the real world the magic of the mandelbrot set is when you take any complex number one that has a real component that i'm plotting along the xaxis an imaginary component that i'm applauding along the axis if i look at any given a and b pair and i take that a and b pair and put it into this constant c i start with z equals zero and then i say z equals zero squared plus c so zero plus c so now z is c and then that's z iteration zero z iteration one equals c squared plus c because it's this and then it's this squared plus c and then iteration two c squared plus c squared plus c right this continuous loop of taking this complex number starting z as zero squaring plus c the result squared plus c the result squared plus c and the question we have to ask is is this bounded or does it tend to infinity is it the bounded ones or the mandelbrot set or the infinite ones or the mandelbrot set i need to go look that up recursion i should mention it's like a recursion recursive algorithm um hold on is the set of complex numbers for which the function does not diverge to infinity okay yes we can keep that in by the way me having to go check what it says here i can even stage that again is the mandelbrot set the num is the mandelbrot set the complex numbers that when put into this recursive iteration they go to infinity or that they remain bounded i forget do this again because we want to include it the mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers for which the function does not diverge to infinity so the set of numbers that do not diverge to infinity are in the mandelbrot set and i'm not really going to be able to draw it but i'm going to try to overlay what the mandelbrot set actually looks like right here so this begs the question i've already gone through this i've done it as a video i've done the julius set which is another way of looking at different components of the mandelbrot set or i've done the julia set which is another way of looking at pieces of the mandelbrot set and uh we go down that road but how could this be taken and made into some form how could this be taken and made into three dimensions the a complex number by its nature is mapped to a twodimensional plane a real component and an imaginary component there is no a plus b plus there's no third axis here we need to make the mandelbulb some kind of triplex number and if you look back at the brief history of different attempts at this idea of a mandelbulb there were a variety of approaches and the one that i want to focus on and look at today is that 2009 approach by the peoples whose name i can't remember uh let's see um i guess i don't need to necessarily say yeah okay daniel white and paul nylander the 2009 approach from the 2009 approach that daniel white and paul nylander developed using spherical coordinates what do i mean by spherical coordinates well what do i mean by spherical coordinates well let me take another step back and let's just briefly talk about polar coordinates of course i have an entire video i probably have like 10 videos on polar coordinates where instead of looking at an x where with polar coordinates instead of looking at perhaps an x y location we can look at this x i kind of want more space but i want to leave this here so polar hold on okay i got it i've got it now let's make a little uh table here cartesian polar so the idea of a cartesian coordinate in two dimensions is an x y coordinate the idea of a polar coordinate in two dimensions is r comma theta meaning x y is some x offset and y offset from the origin and i'm using kind of a computer graphics window i don't want to okay hold on i got it i got it let me do this again i got the explanation now i don't know if i need all of this background but why not let's talk first about polar and cartesian coordinates i don't know i don't remember i've lost my train of thought too choo choo i don't know if i should probably go look at the chat i see lots of hearts that's a good sign let's see i can't read the chat from over here but i could see hearts going by which actually is quite helpful okay let me make a little table to compare i can't get this okay i got it i got it let me make i'm gonna make a little table here to compare so our cartesian coordinate is an x y pair you know we look at it at what is its x component and what is its y component a polar coordinate is an r theta pair what is the distance from the origin and at what angle what is the radius and angle but this is only in two dimensions what happens when we go to three dimensions well we still have a cartesian coordinate in three dimensions uh how do you draw this this is so hard i can't do perspective that's not anywhere close to right maybe i can put something here to correct that and then the spherical equivalent of that shear shear recall no no oh how do i write fee i have to go look up the greek letter theta is used for an angle but then in a spherical coordinate you need the radius and two angles one of which is the greek letter phi i got to figure out how to write that cube draw rectangles on the xaxis it's like a p yeah so i think i want to do the lower case version so i can just do like a little boom a cube fifi fee okay let's see all right hold on there that's the lower case fee i think by the way that that's a way of drawing it then i have this well i still can't really get it but you get the idea of the three dimensions i'm trying my best the idea here being if there were some way that we could take this idea of a complex number but think of it as a spherical coordinate if we could apply the same iterative formula but have this c component include three values maybe there's a way that we could determine if points within a threedimensional space go to infinity or are they bounded okay so let me come back over here um okay okay so let me get back to here okay so let me find the next part here okay let me get to this 2009 explanation for me is a sort of canonical reference point to begin with and we can see here this exact formula z um we can see here this exact formula that looks very much like the original mandelbrot formula z equals z to the n power plus c now i do want to discuss why does it say n rather than what i have over here on the white board very specifically saying z squared so we're going to have to come back to that at some point whoops there we go but the key thing to note here is that z and c are hyper complex triplex numbers representing cartesian x y and z coordinates so i want to get to the next step here and even look at the pseudo code down here but let's at least begin uh ari is saying i should explain what he means by bounded okay so you know what adi ari i think that's going to become clear what i'm writing in the code um so yeah i will that's a very good point i wonder if i can address that um a little bit more specifically but um i i will that will become clear once i get to the code so before i get into these formulas and then even into seeing if this pseudo code can apply into my code let me begin by just setting up our processing environment to have a 3d space that i can begin to work it and the way that i'm going to work on this problem is by thinking of a sort of box of voxels like if i just have a plain old 2d canvas i have a plane of pixels if that 2d canvas were to become a cube there are points contained within a box each with an xyz component and i need some variable to keep track of the dimensions of that box let's start with just 64. huh oops i went through all this trouble to set up the dimension variable and forgot to use it and i'm going to do something just i think is hopefully going to help us out later i'm going to call these a b and c instead of x y and z then i want to take those abc values and map them to an xyz component in the threedimensional space and just so i can sort of see the fact that this is a 3d space that i'm working in let me just continuously like rotate the y axis let's see what we get is my frame rate really that low i'm just curious yeah why is it so slow just to do that many points i guess it is i wouldn't have thought so to do 64 cubed points there we go that's better i'm having some performance issues doing so many points let me reduce just for now down to the third dimensions of 32. and there we can see so i've drawn basically a 3d cube as a point cloud i'm rendering every single voxel inside that cube thinking about this okay one thing i just want to do is it's a window location yeah so there's by the way there's a um i don't know if i really want to mention this in the video but there's a nice function called window move so that i can uh always place the window over there which i prefer so that the code is a little bit viewable yeah so i know that you want me to add a step size and all of that but i'm i'm in my brain the way that i'm doing this is because i'm going to use these as the triplex numbers um another thing i can do here just to i like can i like subtly um um everybody has so many questions and suggestions i have to just kind of keep going with the way that i'm doing this and and we'll see where that deletes but just to address those questions the map function takes any value within a given range and maps it to a new range and i do have a whole video about the map function and this is an easy way for me to take all those points and spread them out between negative 100 and 100. um all right i'm going to leave this window move in here actually you know i'll just address it because maybe it's going to stay i briefly just want to point out that this window move function is a way of setting where the window appears when i run the sketch and just for visibility's sake i want it to be off to the right that's the current function it was such a long explanation um i briefly want to mention that i added this window move function to set the processing window itself over to the right it's a that's just i can get this i briefly want to mention that i've i basically want to mention this window move function that i'm adding which will set the processing window itself over to the right just because i'm obsessed with the sort of layout here that's what the function is called in the current beta might change by the time you're watching this video just make sure i have pc cam oh yeah i also want to import a library called pzcam which allows me to sort min i also want to import a library called pzcam which allows me to manipulate the view of the threedimensional space very easily what is it called oh peasy peasy cam pz cam will center the view in the middle so i don't need this translate anymore and i'm going to also take out the rotate and now you can see that i can kind of move around the space myself and i can see this point cloud of and i can see this cube point cloud again now you can see that i can manipulate the view of the space myself and see this point clout now i can use the mouse and scroll to manipulate the view of the 3d space itself yeah that's all i want to say okay all right this variable 300 i think positions the camera so i want to be a little bit further away and there we go okay how's my recording going i'm going to hit stop and start oh my god i think i wasn't recording that whole time i think when i hit stop and start recording it didn't restart the recording when did i when did i last do that am i gonna have to redo the i'm excited to redo this whole thing because i feel like i was just messing it up left and right and i haven't really gotten into the the uh oh my god i mean the whiteboard stuff we can keep because it is kind of uh oh my god welcome to the coding train everybody yeah the most there's a one kilobyte file let's see what i got here okay okay no that's nothing that's i recorded that whole time of me trying to pick which processing theme to do and then got three minutes here and i went to do stop and start and i must hit the button twice or something because if it didn't work at least i discovered this now all right everybody um don't worry i'm not leaving this room today until i finish this and i think that i could redo this explanation um the thing is this was recorded because this view is just the straight view and i was pressing the button correctly um oh i'm so sad you two i know youtube recorded it um so here's what i'm going to do i'm going to take a short break um and i'm going to come back and start this over and the good news is i get to include this really helpful reminder that simon said which is that saying imaginary numbers aren't real is like saying negative numbers aren't real plus i can also explain the what i mean by bounded so those things that were confusing i can get right the next time and if all of you um next coding challenger i haven't made this um so here's the thing it's not that this isn't being recorded because ultimately this is being recorded because youtube is recording this but i have a system now that's recording every single camera and laptop feed all as individual feeds so that i can put it together in a variety of ways replacing the background and i won't be able to do any of that um with the footage that i have but i used to not do it this way but i'm i'm gonna um i'm gonna hit stop on the recording i'm gonna take a moment to thank today's sponsor which probably will never sponsor the coding trade again ai camp and i'm going to do it again like chris ray says and i can always still use the original recording so let me take a minute here um to just uh boy i let me just deep breath with all of you and say like one of the things that makes this possible for me to do is having sponsors and i'm thrilled to introduce i'm thrilled to introduce to you a brand new sponsor of the coding train today which is ai camp and this one feels like it's a really nice alignment my channel is all about education and coding i have a lot of um videos about the basics of machine learning you know i'm always surprised and thrilled by uh when i look at my youtube analytics and see how young my audience is in terms of people that are in high school or college um even some you know late middle school age folks and so if you are in that age range of like of 13 between 13 and 18 if you're in high school if you're in middle school and are looking for a summer camp i would like to tell you about ai camp um so ai camp avoids the pitfalls of traditional higher education by enabling students to learn through doing which again is super key because you know you can watch the videos but if you're not trying it yourself and making your own projects you're not getting the sort of full picture of learning so immersive projectbased programs um worldclass team of experienced educators seasoned industry professionals and i think rather than me kind of like read to you some prepared remarks um let me take a look at their actual website so this is um the summer program learn oh i'm not showing it to you let me switch over here up wrong button this is the summer program learn ai in three weeks this summer you can see um all about the program here small classes online six students max per instructor you build an ai product yourself there are guest speakers and lots more information obviously all about um here i recommend watching these student testimonials what i really want to show you which i think is really cool is seeing what the students made from this camp so you know honestly like these are all like really great ideas for video tutorials that i can do um ai detects fake news ai identify celestial bodies simulates chats mimics tweets look at toxic comments oh and ai generates haiku's like all this textbased stuff is really exciting to me this is good ai head text potholes so look at all these wonderful projects that students made i wonder if they're using ml5 or teachable machine or any of the tools i would expect that they are a lot of the tools that i use in my videos so if you're interested i'll also just point out that you can look on trustpilot.com to see a bunch of uh reviews of ai camp that i would encourage you to check out and then if you go to the link that is on the screen above me right here ai dash camp.org partner codingtrain it is going to take you to this application and um what ai camp wanted me to let you know is that they are giving out scholarships so if you're interested and want to apply for a scholarship this just takes a few minutes to fill out i guess it says it takes seven minutes there you can do it in one sitting 70 percent of applicants got scholarships check out ai camp use this link to let them know that you found ai camp through me and also you know look at all their programs read about their mission and everything here on their website all right so thank you ai camp for sponsoring today's live uh session of the coding train link to ai kev is also in the video description i should have said so you can find it there and uh if any of you sign up and go to ai cam please let me know i want to know what you make i'd be so excited to hear about it um so i'm gonna take a short break that was practice that was practice explanation i'm going to come back uh you can take a look at ai camp website while i'm taking a short break i'll be back in less than a minute uh i have a granola bar maybe i'll eat that and that'll help me uh kind of get a little bit of energy to come back and i'm gonna start over and mandelbulb take two is coming for you if you just started tuning in perfect you didn't miss anything because i'm gonna do it again we're gonna do the mantel bulb coding challenge once again we're gonna plow through it i'm not leaving this room until it's done today have no it's not not going anywhere i'm gonna be here to midnight i'm still gonna be streaming trying to make this mandal bulb whatever happens i'm i'm there so just let me take a short break to have a little bit of water take a couple deep breaths again check out ai camp and i'll be back in just one minute uh intermission button do hey i'm back i forgot to mention something important about ai camp because someone said oh if i'm outside the age of 18 i can't apply and right here in the information that ai cam provided for me it says people out of the application range with experience can apply to teach at the camp as mentors so check out the website write to them if you're interested in applying as a mentor or working at the camp that's something you could consider as well okay i'm not back yet that was uh that was just a quick uh interlude because i wanted to mention that do so do do do do as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop just stop i'm gonna do this stop stop i just stopped on this stop this dot this this dot song never forget this dot all right folks you composed that song for me i'm back welcome to coding train sisyphus sisyphean edition where i uh redo everything i just did in the last it was only two hours oh my god okay um so chris you're gonna be thrilled chris you were at a faculty meeting you missed two hours but guess what i had uh first of all i waste i don't know about wasted but i i spent an hour just setting up then i started working on the mandelbulb but i didn't hit record i did hit record but it didn't take so i'm starting over so i'm gonna do something kind of shocking excuse me i just ate a large granola bar i kind of wolfed it down i'm going to erase this beautiful white board and i'm going to draw all these diagrams again it's perhaps unnecessary but you know i need some this but it is what's happening it is what i'm choosing to do when my mandelbulb coding challenge video is viewed 1 billion times on youtube and becomes the most successful basically it becomes the mr beast video of coding videos then i will not regret the extra couple hours i spend today rerecording and live streaming this explanation because that is almost certainly definitely going to happen and you are the special people who are actually here for this one time only live experience of me redoing the same content again better the one thing i'm worried about is i do feel a little tired and all right i need to get some water for this sponge because it didn't really erase very well i do feel a little bit tired let's see how well by the way i'm walking quite far away now how well does this lav mic signal work um it's getting cold in here again i could turn the heaters on just for a couple minutes maybe i'll do that very briefly let me turn these heaters on just for a couple minutes they blow quite a bit of heat quite fast so i should have done that while i was taking a break obviously um uh and um my voice feels a little bit ratty raspy because i've been talking straight for two hours but then i could just be like yeah never mind let me come back tomorrow morning and do it because i was sort of planning figuring i wasn't going to get to everything today and maybe tomorrow morning i would do some more but i'm going to feel really good if i get this done today how come the heaters i just turned the switches on but they didn't actually come on so are you all with me here uh oh here come the heaters no okay i'm gonna hit start recording and i do see a note from fishy saying that the camera is still going in and out of focus even when i'm standing here i'm looking over to the left here to see if it's doing that i once did a stream which was five hours okay i really do need to deal with the focus on this camera but i'm really afraid to do anything about it right now okay um a minute here finding a kleenex up i didn't mute my microphone nothing i could do about that now get ready for the blowing my nose sound wiping down the white board a little bit more all right i guess that's all i get for the heaters standing under the heater for a minute warming up so nice and warm okay all right everybody okay it's recording it's recording because there is a face on the laptop i really don't that's interesting all right is the in a minute or two not a miniature just a few seconds of not speaking having a little anxiety attack it's fine all right maybe i should deal with the focus let's do that let's deal with the focus it's people keep mentioning it this is going on forever anyway it gives me a minute another couple minutes to turn the heaters on so let's do the focus you will all help me with this i'm actually going to go to this view okay i'm going to turn off the uh how do i turn oh my god okay i have these like sound okay here i am i am going to turn off autofocus i have no idea how to do that this is a sony alpha 7 3. uh maybe this was a bad idea quality aspect ratio let's see long exposure shoot mode shoot auto focus continuous auto focus uh automatic autofocus manual focus okay it is now manual focus let's see how the manual focus is at present like i'm not even touching it it just is what it is like am i in focus i don't think so the problem is i don't i don't have an arm long enough a remote for the camera or another person but i'm looking at it and i actually think that i kind of am in focus like that seems pretty in focus i could increase the fstop is that what i what was small or high fstops but i'm looking at myself on the playback and it looks fine could be better not completely all right let me let me increase the fstop which will also it's going to change it's making it darker but i can also change the iso and bring that up this should be a little bit better now as well so let me just hello hello talk talk talk code code talk talk talk code code i'm going to look over here uh and the focus looks fine to me i don't know how to looks good and the other thing i can do is i could place something here looks excellent it's fine all right all right so the no more autofocus this is the focus i think it'll be good enough looks nice okay you know at this scale looks good to me chris sears thank you um okay i can do this everybody i can do this drinking some water the heaters are going off the recording is recording and we're going to begin okay just okay okay everybody all right here we go it's actually recording i can see it okay i can see the recording button saying it's recording okay hello everybody thank you graham i'm gonna have to hit show on that oh there we go okay thank you lori hello everyone and welcome to coding challenge i'm slightly afraid it's the mandelbulb look at it it's beautiful it's something that i've wanted to try for a really long time um but i've never really thought that i could do it i think today is the day where maybe i'll be able to now i don't expect that my end result will look as beautiful as the images that i'm featuring that you're seeing right now but it's my hope that we're going to get to the point where we understand the mandelbulb able to write the code for the mando bulb and then you the viewing audience will take it from there and make all sorts of beautiful versions of this amazing intricate fantastical fractal pattern in 3d now before i get going i want to mention two previous videos one is my mandelbrot coding challenge from six plus years ago that is the sort of origin story of the mandelbulb itself i'll get more into the details of that but if you wanted to you could go back and refer to that video as well as my spherical geometry coding challenge which looks at how to take xyz which looks which looks at how to take which looks at how to map cartesian coordinates in 3d space to the surface of a sphere and we're going to need that same math when taking this 2d fractal this 2d mandelbrot set and stretching it twisting it extruding it pulling it low somehow into three dimensions right isn't this intro even better than it was the first time i'm so glad i'm redoing this and i'm recording okay now i'm just trying to think if i want to talk through this quick history thing um yeah so potential 3d version of the fractal okay this is not a new this is not a new concept the original proposal for a 3d version of the mandelbrot fractal the mandelbulb itself was constructed for the first time i'm just reading from the wikipedia page [Laughter] yeah deja vu i know now this is not a new idea the mandelbulb itself this idea of taking the 2d mandelbrot set and making three dimensions was first proposed in 1997 by jules reese but in 2009 but if you've seen the mandible before and it appears in popular culture i believe it's in the movie big hero 6 maybe i can show a clip of that where else is it and there are some other references oh that was snow falling off the roof did you hear that rumbling it's like an avalanche um the one that you might have seen and the one that i'm going to try to make is the 2009 version developed by daniel white and paul nylander so let's try to understand um is the lighting okay here i feel like i look kind of dark but i guess it's fine it's no different than it was before the lights are all on let me just check something nope it's fine i mean i could brighten it a tiny bit tiny bit brighter i don't know if i want to do it that way actually let's try that okay too bright that's a little bit washed out now i i'm obsessing over this way too much oh you know what happened is the the glare from the snow is a bit brighter now but it's fine it will be what it will be okay there's like a literal avalanche happening right now of snow falling off the roof it's crazy it's like if you can hear that before i get started let's try to before i start with the code let me take a step back and try to explain the concepts from a big picture of you i don't want to rehash the entire mandelbrot set video but we have to start there with the mandelbrot okay before i write the code let me zoom back and take a bigger picture view of what i'm attempting to do here and i don't want to rehash the entire mandelbrot set video with the entire before i start coding let's take a step back and talk about the big picture what is it that i'm really trying to do here and the place where i need to start is the mandelbrot set itself now i don't want to rehash the entire thing the full explanation is in my mandelbrot video but let me just give you the what is it i'm trying to say here what about my rule of not starting over over and over again okay before i write the code let's take a step back and let me try to explain the concepts behind what i'm about to attempt to do here and the place where i really need to start is the mandelbrot set itself now if you want to see the full code and explanation for that i do have a video but let me just give you the core elements of the mandelbrot set itself so the idea of the mandelbrot set the mandelbrot set appears as a pattern on a complex plane while a complex plane is a very fancy term for a plane of numbers that has a horizontal axis and a vertical axis the key difference here is that this complex number which has both a real component and an imaginary component involves something known as i i is the square root of negative one now the reason now this is often referred to as an imaginary number because i don't know the square root of negative one i can't calculate that that must be part of your imagination but it's actually something very real in theoretical and practical mathematics this idea of imaginary numbers it's you know calling it a saying that it doesn't exist is like saying well negative numbers don't exist because i can't actually make you negative three apples the mandelbrot set do you hear that there's an avalanche happening on the roof everything going okay just put some hearts in the chat if this is going fine because i can't see the chat i could just see emojis from over here you know put a lot of like dead skulls if i need to stop what i'm doing the so to visualize the mandelbrot so to calculate and visualize the mandelbrot set the idea is to look at every single complex number on this plane while i'm calling these a and b we could think of them as x and y so if i pick this number i might have a certain value for a maybe it's 0.4 and a certain value for b maybe it's negative 0.2 0.4 minus 0.2 i the idea is that this is this constant c whoops the idea is that this is the constant c in this particular equation and if i take this equation and iterate over and over again applying it recursively onto itself it's literal snow falling outside sliding off of the roof it's making lots of noise and start with the val and start with z at zero the idea is for me to examine what happens to the result and the idea here is to take this number plug it into c start with z equal to zero so z iteration one whoops i mean do you hear that it's crazy why what causes this only just all slide off the roof okay equals zero plus c so now this is the new value of z so at z iteration two i get what's zero plus c is c c squared plus c and then at iteration three i'm going to take this value c squared plus c square it plus c and so on and so forth and the idea here is if i apply this math over and over again the result is going to either go to infinity get really really really really big or stay bounded it's going to kind of oscillate around a stable value so i'm examining every single point on this complex plane running this algorithm and determining whether it stays bounded or tends to infinity the set of the points that stay bounded i always get this confused but the set of the points that stay bounded is the mandelbrot set if i color all of those points black and all the other points that are not part of the metal broad set white i will see this fractal pattern and then of course there are ample ways i can use different kinds of color based on the number of iterations that it that i'm taking and doing and there's all sorts of and then in my previous video i sort of looked at how like well i could look at how many times it takes to iterate before it starts to become unbounded and set colors that way and get beautiful rainbow patterns all visualizing the mandelbrot set let me just see here let me just i'm just curious here you know this isn't useful i was going to say like maybe i should quickly reference and show the code but that's going a little bit further okay so i'm not gonna reference that okay okay so um going back over to here still recording still recording still recording recording i know i should open up this garage door so you can see the snow but it's it's much too cold out so i'm not going to do that right now okay so if this is the mandelbrot set what is the mandelbulb the mandelbrot set is inherently a fractal that lives in two dimensions a complex number is a number that has a real component and an imaginary component two dimensions so how do i take this idea and make it into three dimensions well there's no one way to do this there's no exact precise sort of mathematical mapping to take the mandelbrot set and put it into three dimensions and this is why there have been various attempts over the years the one that i'm going to look at the 2009 version is the one that uses spherical coordinates and the idea here is to say like and the idea here is to say instead of a complex number could we have could we use something called a triplex number after all a coordinate in threedimensional space has three components to it x y z so i'm going to come back and start to talk about spherical coordinates in a moment but i think this is a good time so there's there's plenty more to this story here that i want to map out some of the math to but i think this is a good time to just take a little pause and actually set up a processing sketch that will allow us to visualize triplex numbers or in essence 3d coordinates in space um okay oops for this coding challenge i'm going to use processing it's a creative coding framework it's built in java you can download it at processing.org and i probably have hundreds of videos to talk about it but check out the website check out the processing foundation to learn more the reason why i'm using it is because it has a wonderful 3d rendering engine that exists in p52 but i want to explore this in processing first oops and this is a little bit of a silly line of co do you not hear the avalanche link to an explanation of triplex numbers all right let me i'm going to come back to that but i think it really just means three it's not really there's not really um um there's not really like a strict definition to it but let's it's not even on the wikipedia page so i think it's sort of like a madeup term for this purpose but anyway um you heard that okay threedimensional vector yeah okay um hello hold on i'm gonna mute my microphone i've been streaming in here for so long my son came in and he was like what are you are you ever coming back so sorry about that i know i muted because i'm talking to my son um okay yeah all right the audio is back um all right what was i saying ah okay i'm back it's not a rando it's my 13 year old son who had a question i mean there's no school today this is so this is okay here we go um all right i briefly want to point out that i'm using this window move function just because i'm obsessive and i like to have the processing window itself a little off to the right that's a new feature of processing for beta 6. i don't know if it'll stay or their name will get changed but that's what it's doing right now is there i got to be able to like say that in faster and i want to acknowledge it but i also okay let me say a few quick things about the code i have so far size gives me a window size of 600x600 pixels p3d for 3d rendering window move is just because i'm obsessive and i want the processing window to be on the other side of my desktop here that's a new feature i don't know if that name will stay but it's working right now and then i have a draw loop and i'm just drawing a background so oh here comes the plow now there's gonna be a plow so there might be some noise for the plow okay i'm just gonna i'm gonna keep i'm gonna plow through if you will i know i shouldn't do this because of what messed me up before but i'm gonna hit stop okay all right i should be back yes i think i'm back i hope i am and i am also recording to disc again okay we're good that was a temporary glitch don't worry i just checked the video file is recorded to disk it's all there uh what i what i try to what i like to do every so often is stop the recording and restart it just so that file is saved because if it were ever to crash mid recording i lose the whole thing the way that i'm doing my recording so uh and i don't know why it crashed when i did that but we're all good okay wow what a day um okay so where am i here yep the plow is going which is kind of loud but i'm gonna just as i said plow forward oh my god the driveway is being plowed right now i think i should just wait a minute i know i probably should do that corey allen is and it is recording is making a good point that i can record to like mkv and then like change it afterwards and maybe i should do that but right now it's good um okay you can't hear it then fine here i go the first step i'd like to do is just be able to visualize the voxels of a cube because ultimately i'm going to try to place this mantle bulb inside of a fixed space in three dimensions so i'm going to use a variable to talk about the dimensions of a cube just call that i'm going to call that dim short for dimensions okay so i have a nested loop of 32 by 32 by 32 and for each one of those and for each one of those x y z coordinates well i wonder if i should do i j k that might make more sense let me start this over so i'm starting off with a triple nested loop for every i from 0 to 32 and every j from 0 to 32 and every k from 0 to 32 let's create an x y z point in three dimensional space and there you see this cube all of the voxels all of these 3d pixels points in threedimensional space making up a cube every single point is spaced out between negative 100 and 100 along the x y and z axis and something that i can do just to make this a little nicer to examine and look at is add the processing library called pz cam pz cam will center the view in the center of the processing window itself so i no longer need this translate and then once i run the sketch and then once i run the sketch i can now use the mouse to sort of look around zoom in and out of this 3d point cloud if you're wondering what that 500 is doing that's kind of like the camera position how far away am i looking at the points that i'm placing in space so making that 1500 it's quite a bit further away but i can scroll to zoom in and rotate and spin around okay now let me think of what next all right i am still recording i am still recording uh so we have a processing sketch set up to deal with x y z coordinates in a threedimensional space so this value c right here is instead of so this value c right here instead of being a complex num so how do i make the leap from this value c right here which is a complex number with a x component and a y component to a triplex number with an x component y component and z component and the answer lies within something called a spherical coordinate so before i can get to spherical let's just review what it is what so but before i define a spherical coordinate let's review a polar coordinate first so in two dimensions a cartesian coordinate is an x y coordinate defining a position according to its placement along the horizontal and vertical axis a polar coordinate it on the a polar coordinate in two dimensions is something and i can describe that same point as a polar coordinate its position is no its position is indicated as a distance from the origin r a radius and an angle of rotation theta we can describe points in three dimensions in a similar way using cartesian and spherical cartesian having an x y and z axis and a spherical coordinate being described as an r just like in polar coordinates a distance from the center but then two angles of rotation theta and phi now my ability to draw this is quite limited but i will put up a diagram right here so that you can see something that helps you um now my ability to draw this is quite limited but i'll put up something here that allows you now my ability to draw this is quite limited but i'll put up something here that gives you a nice diagram of the difference between cartesian and spherical coordinates so something i have to make later um so i wanna i'm gonna have to erase this over here to do the next step but why do i need spherical coordinates after all for the regular mandelbrot set i didn't need polar coordinates i could just take this complex number and square it no problem while yes there is a way for me to and yes while i might be able to create some type of analogous version of this with just the xyz itself without the concept of spherical coordinates the mandelbulb the mandelbulb form itself is quite beautiful if we start to look at powers about taking a spherical coordinate the mandelball i'm trying to think of what i'm trying to say here so while there might be a way for me to create a version of the mandelbot set in 3d without the idea of spherical coordinates the mandelbulb that i want to make the one that was developed in 2009 uses the idea of spherical coordinates to take a 3d to take a triplex number and square it or cube it or put it to the fourth power and ultimately the one that i'm going to sort of land on is to the eighth power so we have to look at a little bit more math before i put this into the code this hold on a second just gonna check the chat to see if anything is way off don't worry we're further than we were before in the first time just checking did i say mandelbot said that's funny uh okay still recording i kind of want to do stop and start but i'm afraid i'm going to do that when i get back to the code okay hold on i just want to reference a couple formulas here which basically is this this is what i'm looking for the nth power of vector here okay and okay okay we're so close now all right um okay oh wrong view i should have known this was going to be a rough one remember the iterative formula that i'm using for both the mandelbrot set and the mandelbulb is as follows z equals z now with mandelbrot it's z squared but a more generic form would be z to the n plus c and now c is a triplex number so if z equals zero to start we have z the next z is zero to the n plus c which is just c and then the next z is c to the n plus c and the next z is c to the n plus c to the n plus c so looking at this math that i'm doing i need an answer to the question how do i calculate x y z to the nth power and the way that this is done is by taking the xyz point converting it into spherical coordinates applying a formula to set a spherical coordinate to the nth power and then converting it back into xyz you got all that is there no mods on today just doing hide user okay so hopefully that helps sorry about that everybody the spam bot so i'm just trying to think of how to make this transition and this is what white and and this is what daniel white and paul nylander proposed the formula for taking the vector v and setting it to the nth four and this is what and this is what daniel white and paul nylander proposed a formula for taking the vector v an x y z vector and this is what and this is what daniel white and paul nylander proposed a formula for taking a vector v with three components setting it to the nth power is equal to r the distance from the origin to the nth power times sine of n sine of n times theta times cosine of n times phi comma sine of n times theta times sine of n times c comma cosine of n times theta now these values don't come out of nowhere they come out of the math of spherical coordinates look at how if i had a pole look at how if i had a polar coordinate r r theta phi how i could convert that into x y z and how and how if i have an x y z coordinate i can convert that to r theta and phi this is exactly what's happening here in the mandelbulb formula if i can start with my x y convert it to r phi theta plug that into that formula up there to get v to the nth power and then convert it back to x y z so i can plot it i should have the mandelbulb i might not have gotten that exactly right but as i try i've not implemented this before as i well actually i have because i did it for um but it was like a while ago maybe i shouldn't say that um but as i start to put these formulas into the code hopefully we're going to see all of those transformations back and forth and it might become a little bit more clear oh you're right well that's what that's doing ultimately so that's actually a good point um hold on i'm modding the chat today okay um this is a good point simon okay that actually is the conversion back basically but let me give that explanation again and i'll i will uh i will try to correct that a little bit and this is exactly what paul white and daniel nylander propose a formula for taking a vector v that exists in three dimensions and setting it to the nth power using using the spherical coordinates of that sorry using thanks chris and this is and this is the innovation from daniel white and paul nylander a formula for taking a vector v in three dimensions x y z and setting it to the nth power to do that requires the spherical version of that xyz vector we need the r we need the theta we need the fee if you look at that formula we might want to recapture this stuff later matthew but and if i go back to the spherical coordinate coding challenge i did you'll see that there are formulas much like there are with polar to cartesian for taking a spherical coordinate and converting it back to xyz and taking an xyz cartesian coordinate and converting it to spherical are theta phi now i'm not going to derive all these formulas i'm just going to take them as they are written on the page and one wander back to this original proposal which has exactly the formulas written out here this is how i calculate r theta and phi and this is how i set xyz to the nth power i think i can start to put this in the code now i'm going to have to go back and forth between this page and the code many times so the first thing that i want to do is i want to look at the the first thing that i want to do is i want to look at the space the space that i'm evaluating for the mantle bulb as a box between negative one and one so first change i want to do as well as plotting the points it was useful to map the all the voxels out to between negative 100 and 100 i want to now keep all my numbers between the values the range of negative 1 and 1. then from this x y and z coordinate i need to convert that to spherical coordinates so r is the square root of x times x y times y and z times z theta is the arc tangent of the square root of x times x y times y comma z and phi is the arc tangent y comma x what do i do next okay i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm looking at the whiteboard so i need to take oh so this is that's my c i need to take i just need to look at how do i take z to the n power now there's certainly efficiencies that i could do in this code in terms of like i'm squaring numbers and doing the square root multiple times but i'm just going to precompute the whole mandel i'm just going to precompute the whole mandelball one time and set up so i'm not going to worry about that right now i need a loop no i need a z i need a c let me look back at that web page oh yeah ah okay look at this this is what it's say this is what it's telling me to do right now i need to take get a new x and a new y and a new z you now it's telling me what is n n is really important n is the order it is um now there's now there's some can you hear that that noise there's like the plow and some shoveling going on yeah let me just wait a minute here let uh this is terrible but i'm gonna do my stopping and starting thing so hopefully the stream doesn't crash i'm just gonna stop recording to disk okay the stream is still going i hit stop on the recording so i captured everything up until now and hit start again and it is now you know what it was before the button i can hit it like this stop start stop start if i do it really really fast i think it kind of freaks out we can't hear it okay it's very very quiet that's fine um okay now processing is wondering what is n so n is the order it is the power to which i am going to set everything in my formula z equals z to the n plus c and we can try different numbers to get different patterns but the sort of we're gonna but i want to start with the number eight now it's a little bit unfortunate here is that i want to use what's a little bit unfortunate here is that i want to use the variable z to keep track of z and z and 0 z1 in in a loop but z is also the component of the vector xyz so i think i need a new variable name for this what should that variable be what if i make it a vector and call it zz so it's zz then i'm going to so zeta oh people are saying zeta i love that okay let's call it zeta i love that new variable name makes me so happy now i'm going to do something that i really hate doing and i really hate that i'm about to do this but wow i could do it a different way no no i'm just going to do it the way i hate i'm going to say while true now generally speaking if you're going to say wild true you've got a problem because that's a loop that's never going to end the only way to get out of a loop that's looping while true the you know hardcoded value true that can never be changed is to put a break in somewhere so i need to remember put that break in there else i'm gonna have an infinite loop and everything's gonna crash and we're just gonna throw away all this footage and i'm gonna be done never come back to another challenge ever again because i've been recording this for like so long there's a timer going and hopefully you've just been watching this for like 15 minutes but it's been going on forever and just to set myself up for success i'm going to make a variable called max iterations i'm going to set that equal to 10 and then i'm going to have iteration equals zero i'm going to put i'm going to say iteration plus plus if iteration is greater than max iterations break now this is kind of silly because i could have just said while iteration is less than max iterations but i don't know this is the way i'm doing it we'll clean it up later this int n equals 8 does not need to be in this loop i mean it honestly could just be a global variable but i'm going to put it up here just so i have all the variables i want to mess with and then really ah hold on the order of this stuff is going to be important so zeta starts at zero and the very first time i'm taking zeta squared and then adding c to it so could i make a vector that holds the spherical coordinate and that is c i think that's right so then in the loop zeta equals power i mean this won't work because zeta is a vector power zeta to the n plus c right this is the idea of what i'm doing i'm doing this every single time and the way that i take zeta to the power of n are these formulas so zeta dot x equals nu x plus c dot x oops bad copy paste i'm thinking i'm thinking now maybe what i want to do is do this spherical transformation in a function what am i doing here yes yes yes yes okay so hold on hold on the first thing that happens is i need to get these this should be in the loop you know what i'm going to do this is what i'm going to do p vector i think i want i think it's really going to help me if i have a function to convert from cartesian to polar i kind of hate that i'm using the p vector for this because i'm putting the r and x the thick and y and the the v in z which is quite confusing because now when i come to do this this is actually like c dot x oh okay i'm gonna write my own spherical vector class might be totally unnecessary but i'm gonna do it you can all i know you're all screaming and throwing tomatoes at your tubular television thing just let me figure this out in my own way please i'm sure i'm doing this wrong but i'll get there eventually so the function returns a spherical object it's basically just like an object that holds three values but i want to be able to name those values r theta and phi like a p vector was a useful data structure but because the naming is cartesian i'm going to get way too confused so this is spherical c is the spherical version of x y z power of c dot r z dot theta and then wait but then what gets added here where's the rest of the pseudo code x plus a yeah oh but i need the cartesian to add oh oh boy oh there's no this was a mistake i'm getting very close i can feel it oh can i just do this like isn't that what these are and this should be oh hold on hold on i've mixed everything up let's go back to the whiteboard c is x y z so c to the n is defined by what i did and this gives me in my code nu x new y new z then i add c the original xyz to it and then i take this convert it to spherical and do it again to the nth power okay when i said it over there it made sense in my head and now i have to see if i can put that into action here won't it work if i just start with this because by the way why am i getting weird little errors here the variable r does not exist oh i have to define these variables i think this is fine because i'm starting with zero so the spherical coordinate zero zero zero is going to be zero zero zero so i could go through this then add x y z to it and then get the new spherical coordinate put it to the power of n then add x y z to it again et cetera et cetera i think this is good i think i've got it let's just run this code why not it's not going to visualize anything let's see if i get any errors all right and if i were to say like point if i were to multiply these i mean i could just use scale but this math is going to work for every for every pixel there ah okay i think we're getting somewhere so now i just need to figure out and am i in setup no i'm in draw so here's the thing i don't want to calculate the mandelbulb over and over again so i think what i want to do is take this code this entire thing where is the last bracket here it is take this and put it in setup then what i'm going to do is i'm going to create an array of all the points that are within the mandelbulb set itself that'll be an array list of p vectors in other words if at this point instead of drawing a point i just say add new pvector and i should do something better than just multiplying each value by 100 but that'll be good enough for right now right so right now i'm adding every point i'm doing the mandible math but i'm not checking what the outcome is i'm just doing the manual bulb math and adding every point into this arraylist then in draw i should still see that cube okay now i now all i need to do is determine whether or not i should add the point as part of the mandelbulb set itself so i'm only going to do that if i make it to max iterations if i make it to max iterations that means it is bounded i haven't gotten past some large value so i also need to test if i've gotten to some large value how do i do that well i think the easiest way for me to do that would be to check r r is like the distance from the center so if r keeps going like way way way out and way way out like greater than 16. then break so now only the points where the radius value hasn't gotten past a number the number 16 will make their way into the mandelbulb set itself oh my god what is the chance that when i run the code right now i will see something that looks like the mandelbalm after being in this room for like i don't know i've been in this room for four hours today i mean i was thinking doing a lot of stuff before i even started coding because i was so stressed out oh everybody say your 3d fractal prayer i mean there's no way this is going to work right no chance all right i'm hitting run i can't look wait a second okay that kind of looks like i don't know kind of looks like a mandel bulby thing let's make the dimension 64. oh my goodness okay so here's the thing ah that's the mandelbulb that's the mandelbaum i think that's the mandible there's something funny going on here that i'm realizing which is that i am setting a point how does how does how to say what i'm saying so i i think that i'm gonna let's okay i think i know what i want to do here which is that let me just make n equal to one like what if instead oh no squared so what if i go back to like the mandelbrot set of just doing z equals z squared plus c i think i'm gonna see a sphere uh it's not a sphere but it's like a weird other shape okay wait what if i do one oh yeah well it's kind of like a just like that cube thing right so there's no detail but so the order makes a difference why is that not a sphere somebody will explain this to me in the comments i thought that would be a sphere but it's running really slow the reason is well i need some kind of prop some kind of device hold on wait there i'll be right back here is a basketball a little miniature basketball that really needs some air bumped into it oh no oh no it's all well it's fine i'm going to make this into the mandible what i have done i'm plotting every point along the surface of this mandelbulb basketball as well as every point on the inside so i think what i want to look for are the points at which the neighbor is a bounded point or a not bounded point right like if i'm looking at where's the edge between this basketball and the rest of the threedimensional space let me go back to eight so basically as i'm looking at i guess the k is the z axis so i can do it i can just consider any every point along the z axis let's say right before i do this boolean edge so they're going to be the when i start like the manual bulb is in the center so when i start they're going to be not bounded so as soon as i find one that makes it to the end edge is true so as long as it's not the not the edge edge is true um add it to the set let's run this yeah so that's like half the shape you can kind of see it it's just one half of it look it's like the bottom half i'm trying to like get the right zoom here hold on i wonder if you know what let me make can i go up to 128 yeah so you can see i'm just getting the bottom half of the mandelbulb because i also need to say if it is an edge here then i can say edge is false i want to know if it's no no no yeah yeah yeah because if it then finds right this is like the edge variable is like a switch like first it's off and it finds a point on the manual bulb in the manual bulb it flips it on and and places that point now it doesn't flip that switch back off until it finds a part that's not so we can flip it off and then find the next one i think this is going to work yeah that's a point cloud mandelbulb look at that that's a point cloud mandelbulb we did it i mean it looks nothing like the beauty of the like fully ray traced rendered colored light lit mandel bulbs but by golly my brain somehow made it from the start of whatever i started today to this and i'm very very happy i'm trying to think of what else i can do here let's try a few things for example let me let's go back to this page oh the number of iterations that's where i would get a sphere so this is useful to look at where it's telling me like how many iterations before i escape is is the level of detail that i would get so for example if i set the max iterations to one i guess still getting a oh i got a plane let me set the max iterations to two weird getting some really weird shapes here well maybe that was not so interesting let's set it to 200 it's gonna take a really long time oh it didn't like that marching cubes could work so many things okay i crashed it all right so i really should um just trying to think of what things i want to do squaring ah yeah okay squaring power of three all right so let me so if i review the original article on which this is based there's a couple things that i could explore which is just ultimately playing around with both if i review the original article on which this is based there's some things that i could explore which is reviewing the number of iterations before i consider it reaching the max iterations and we can see here that iteration 20 is going to give us the most detail and iteration 200 would give us maybe more detail but there's it's not going to be that noticeable even at high resolution so let me change the max iterations to 20. we'll see if that results in anything different you know because this is just a point cloud it's very hard to see that detail but i believe that it's there the other thing i can play with is what value of n am i using and we can see here in this post that these are the shapes that i would get from the power of 2 power of 3 etc this is zooming in and looking at interiors power of 16 whoa let's look at that n is 16 here yeah take a look at that crazy fractal death star the other thing that is completely arbitrary in my code is my escape clause the other thing that is completely arbitrary in my code is checking if the radius is greater than 16. i wonder if i should be using a different number for that like what happens if i just say one and let me put this back to eight like am i going to get the same thing let me zoom out a bit more i just had a panic that i wasn't recording to disc that looks kind of similar so there might be a sort of i wonder hello from itp hi itp um so i don't know what that value should be i like that i picked 16. why not i certainly could also increase the stroke weight just to see or i could draw like a box you know maybe i need to add some lighting some transparency all that kind of stuff yeah that makes sense you know since the space that i'm working with is between negative one and one probably getting outside of that space is ultimately um and maybe like a little two would be good just to like leave a little wiggle room there but that might be a nice place to stop let's see what happens if i draw boxes instead of points much slower my resolution is too high right that didn't go anywhere let's not include that all right i think i know what i want to do next okay i could set the rgb um hold on i'm not seeing the chat right now so oh if i remove the stroke the number's two um okay i'm going to do my stop start thing just because i really am at the end here and i want to stop starting i can't believe it's almost three o'clock okay i could yeah um so just for a moment i want to remove pz cam and i want to see it rotate like this so that's the xaxis let's see what we get here oh whoops i want it to be closer to me okay i just wanted to see it spin like that i don't know why but i thought uh if you kind of get this sense of it folding i can actually i just want to make it a little bit bigger one one last try here just to finish this off there we go this is what i wanted to see and that this spinning of it it's sort of like even though i'm spinning this shape it sort of looks like it's folding into itself which i quite like as a sort of aspect of the mantle bulb itself so the thing that i'm really really missing here and that what i've seen other demonstrations on shader toy or with other environments whether it's blender or some 3d environment is actually turning this into a mesh an actual 3d form maybe adding some lighting i think there might be a quick way i can at least see this form um you know there are some processing libraries i believe toxic libs has a volume a set of volume classes that i could just pass it a point cloud and it'll like make the mesh for it but i haven't done this in any order where i could sort of like easily logically just triangulate all the points and make it a nice surface however i have not done this before i think the last time i used mesh lab was probably like five years ago and maybe i'll just sort of speed through this for you let's see if we can get these points into mesh lab to at least render it as a form so mesh lab is open source software for 3d triangular meshes i'm going to download the mac version of it actually no let's not do that putting it here i'm going to run it okay so this is matt just roofing okay so this is mesh lab does anybody know how to use mesh lab is there anybody around that knows how to use mesh lab file import mesh what does it want can i just import a text file text generic ascii point list okay points stored as asc files can be viewed using programs such as mesh lab this is some random site i found on the internet so here are four points of a tetrahedron okay hold on so i'm going to put these i'm going to put these points into a plain text file i named it tetra.asc open no import import tetra asc uh header row separator the separator was just a space right i don't see my points vertices 4 faces 0. well how do i how do i turn it into a mesh i use blender no but i want to use this because i don't know point size oh there are the points ah there we go how do i convert it open okay in one millisecond all files open is there something i need to run to like make it a mesh what does this do what do these buttons do uh that's drawing the points oh there we go what did this do what's this point well that's just dr what oh no that's just a box hold on file let's try this again import raster import mesh open point format space color on parsinger skip well let's try importing i i know how to format the file now all right so where filters remeshing bounding box okay process in right toolbar after selecting points let's try this again um now what happened to the points all right i'm going to import my points so now i need to go back to my code and instead of just adding all of these points into an arraylist i want to save them to a text file i don't know how many points i'm going to have let's use a string list a string list is a particular kind of data structure in ja in in processing for storing an arbitrary number of strings and append i believe it's append so now i'm making a string of x space y space z into that string list and then at the very end of setup before i go on i'm gonna do save strings mandelbulb.txt points our points comma mandelbulb.txt all right let's look at the save strings reference file name goes first the string oh it has to be an array so i assume if i go to string list there's probably a function that converts it to an array array perfect so now this should save all of those to a text file and let's take a look at that text file these should be all the points of the mandelbulb itself filters point set surface reconstruction poisson thank you so now now i can go into mesh lab import import mandalbulb.txt xyz separator space hopefully this doesn't crash all right i see it that's the mandelbulb now somebody in the chat told me filters point set marching cubes point cloud smooth normals compute normals surface reconstruction i don't see that um mesh layer normal smoothing let's try marching cubes apply i don't think that did anything do i have to select all the points i have no idea what i'm doing here and delete these filters remeshing surface reconstruction okay let's try that filters other remeshing surface reconstruction there's ball pivoting screened possible let's try ball pivoting okay did it crash i'm trying this again file import mesh screen poisson requires correct per vertex normals try enabling preclean option and retry i don't have correct vertex normals not about nothing about my per vertex normals are correct preclean i'm just gonna preclean everything that'll do it i think i have to give up filters normals compute normals for point sets okay hold on where did it go let's start over i'm gonna try this one more time let's close without saving and then i'll just work on this later and show it after the fact um okay okay filters point set compute normals for point set okay oh look at that okay now we're getting somewhere i got some normals all right now filters remeshing simplification want to like surface something surface reconstruction screened poisson apply ooh what the look at my mandelbulb i go inside the mandelbulb whoa i'm inside the mandelbulb so as you can see i'm struggling to figure out how to go from my processing point cloud of the mandelbulb itself and somehow turn it into a 3d form that has a surface to it that i can light that is a mesh that is triangulated that's going to have to be the subject for another video or for all of you to tell me how you did it in the comments i guess i have to learn shaders now oh i have to learn shaders now but hopefully you enjoyed this coding challenge i did somehow make the mandal bulb even if this was a total train wreck and i'm just excited to see if you can take this and do something more with it play around with the variables don't worry about reproducing the perfect beautiful rendered mandelbulb itself what can you make can you make this happen in javascript i bet you if you use like 3js i might try to do a bunch of these things and show them to you flying up here on the screen or revisit them in a future live stream but i've been at this for like an entire day now so i've gotta go thank you for watching i love you all so much i really do this was hard goodbye all right everyone that's all that i've got for today oh i have a list i have a list of other things i was going to do but how long has this live stream been uh invert normals okay okay hold on how do i go back to this okay can i go back invert normals you guys got me hold on let me start over let me save i'm going to do this on my own time okay i don't understand this program at all i'm just going to try it one more time import mesh what did i do filters point set compute normals flip normals will that invert them subdivision surfaces surface ring oh that might have done it it's just not lit or anything can i save this now like how do i add some lighting i think i might have kind of done it like when i zoom out okay i gotta go thank you everybody i'm sorry that i'm not gonna get to this other stuff i can't believe it is three o'clock uh how long has this stream been going does anybody know um if anybody wants to continue with this um come and uh ping me on discord the coding train discord i i'm totally brain dead right now um i i felt like this was something i really succeeded at and yet now i'm not so sure but there it is my mandelbulb thank you all for watching uh thank you to um ai camp for being today's sponsor uh if you're looking if you're if you're looking for a summer camp a projectbased learning if you're in middle or high school between the ages of 13 and 18 you can go to that link for the application scholarship application um and i'm going to say goodbye uh parker smart thank you elissai in italy chile i have all these members i really need to thank you all four hours this this is all i can do i hope i don't have any emergency text messages not really i'm gonna go i'm i don't think i'm i don't know if i can ever i was gonna come back and live stream tomorrow to do the uh the rest of the end body stuff but i don't even know after today i'm gonna be able to do that but in the next week oh oh before i go i really really need help um i really need help thinking of something for pi day so join the discord coding tray i don't think this button's going to work um no codingtrain.com discord um and uh send me your pi da ideas i i i gotta go i'm done put a fork in me i am done uh as always i always forget that this stop i'll see you all thank you so much stream is over never forget this stop i'm going to do this this star this dot this dot this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me
