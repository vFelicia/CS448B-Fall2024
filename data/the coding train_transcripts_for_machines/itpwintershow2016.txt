hello it's me dan Schiffman strangely not in front of a green screen not in this little like cramped room I'm here actually at a place called ITP it's where I spent almost all of my time ITP is a twoyear master's program there's a little over 200 students here working all semester to create a lot of interesting strange projects that make all sorts of new and innovative uses of Technology ITP as part of Tisch School of the Arts at New York University but really one thing that ITP is really about is people people in ideas not about the technology so I'm excited to be here to introduce you to some of those people and the projects that they've made so I'm gonna wander around the floor show you some stuff if you are interested in finding out more about ITP or these projects you can take a look at this video's description where I'll have links to everything and I'm talking very fast that I'm not sure why but I'm a little panicked here in this new location okay see you soon in a minute because I'll still be here hey can we video your project I'm yeah so song and my project name is illuminated path so this is a light bulb that follows you and when it finds a person it deems up and they'll follow you why lighting it's on then like when you are going out then it dims out where do you imagine this living if it were to be somewhere besides the a TV show someone told me about cave also many 12 people talked about I wish I have this at home so I can save the energy and I don't need to right turn it on and off and just uh follow me and I work in cool I love it I'm Jenny Lim I'm Tom tenkan and our project laser cats is a twoplayer game where one user controls the laser and one user is the cat and tries to catch the laser and the the paws have are lightsensitive so when you catch the laser with your paw you get a point what's that what's the high score low 30s yeah what can I try it now hi my name is Chris this play is called Tac Toe and it's my final ICM project so it always works if you have a bird flying around which are basically images people sent to this number and all the images are transformed into birds so the way it works is you take the green box put it wherever you want in the wall like here for instance and you can get a bird from that image the less people's someone sent and then you can grab this box and shake it and the wave will stop flapping and then you can text okay so I'm gonna put this here I'm gonna make a lot my name is Lindsay and my project is popup forest which is a couple spreads from a popup book that also influenced their own seeing its it becomes night time and things you do down here like rustling in the bushes bring out foxes you can add more fireflies to the scene and if you add enough fireflies all the foxes will put on sunglasses so there's another one you can scare all the foxes away because foxes are definitely afraid of Alice where'd you get the idea for like this is our story here everywhere the particular characters are the content where did you come up with that idea I think for my animation project it was outside I've been doing a lot of projects that were outside and using like outside noises and so I don't know that soundscape is really nice to me so the idea of generating an environment that you could also immerse yourself in was really nice this is Sebastian Daniella this project is called unit of measurement we're interested in light and balance and geometrical patterns and the idea behind it is we kind of wanted to make visible the interconnections of space we have been working on this break for the past couple of months a lot of experimentation playing with different ways to make bubbles and create these geometries this is our final piece well it was an interesting process because we we kind of went deep into studying how bubbles house up bubbles are made we went to a lab at Cooper Union we experimented with glycerine with all these fun kinds of stuff but right now what what is for also it's amazing is the patterns and the colors so that we can see in the film of the bubble which has a lot to do with gravity and hi I'm Haley and my project is this is virtual levator that can turn I can travel to corridors to the helipad layer of the sky so where'd you get the idea for this right well I just imagined that if there is a super long elevator then you can travel like a anywhere like a particularly so I just my name is Yoon and we created a series of musical lamps which is interactive which it can be spun by the users and can creative a light and sound try different material and then for this route land with piano music is hearty and depends on the anger to use the speed you will generate different kind of our music check and this one is like six jumps behind this a credit land and this is from Metro you can hear it like Dena named Amanda so they can come by with four different kind of firm music together and create over a harmony peace my name is Stephanie Colton and this is birds and sea which is a bird Orchestra that you control the ammos so it's based on Carey Reilly's and C project so these are different phrases for each representing each phrase that Terry Riley Road and they've been using birdsongs so you can add different birds and move them through that work this trap or the piece around our yards so the bird sounds are from this bird enthusiasts website that people have uploaded they're recorded sounds from the wild and so I grabbed a couple of those and extracted what approximated a note see so birds don't actually sort of sing notes as we conventionally know them but you can approximate their frequency and then grab a C and then I use that and pitch adjusted and stretched it to form the different notes in this scale and then place those in the order that Terry Riley had proposed them into the different phrases this is a leading question because I know the answer but what did you use to build it oh I used v5 can you believe it and the sound library for all the sound stuff or something yeah no I use the p5 sound library awesome great thank you yeah I'm ccino ccino kim and this is my project operator and it's basically an old telephone switchboard where that lets you make telephone calls to anyone and record those the audio from those close calls in and and then play around with this the recorded sounds that add sample add effects and just kind of like make my name is Becca Rix I'm Rita which is a it's a vr documentary based on an interview that we did with a friend of mine who's a refugee from Sierra Leone she moved to the United States in 2001 and so we interviewed her to asking questions about her sense of home and identity and how it evolved over the years and kind of how her view of herself has changed so we made kind of audio documentary out of nine pieces and each piece represents a different memory that he I'ma be sharing and for that for each memory we created a 3d object that we put in the VR ik environment that represent the audio that the the memory that she's talking about people said I am like the female version of my dad meaning I am very outspoken and I'm very protective I think the difference is between my dad and I I kind of discover later on even when you take your people don't forget to take care of yourself we're what are the images because when I you know I didn't have my glasses on so they they're like a little but so they had kind of like a distorted or painterly quality to them is that on purpose or how did you make decisions about the visuals the store purpose so we really liked the idea of using photogrammetry because there's sort of a fragmentary distorted aesthetic to it that to us kind of matched the way memory works and the way you recall things so we kind of liked that it's a little bit imperfect it's a little bit scrappy but it kind of feels like realistic and detailed enough to feel like it's a real memory okay I'm and these are the camel turnin cards these are generative coloring puzzles so the idea is that we have like these many different cards they have like a grid of cells where instructions expressed as arrows we have two different types of arrows two different colors and then following instructions either like continuing to draw with the same color or to switch to the other color and these are generated in a way Danny that if you follow these instructions you will eventually reveal a possible message my name is Francesca Rodriguez and this is my project called keepo what's the name mean by the way hippo means not in an Andean language that's called Quechua so it actually means not and he was also an old record system that was based on notes and chords of different colors and that's why he's pretty inspiring so what is the can you show yeah so actually my idea was that I wanted to find a way of how can I use technology to amplify those old record systems in this case people I was using the Incan Empire like thousands of years ago and I collected some stories about cultural identity and how that changes when you migrate somewhere else and I thought those stories had a lot of layers the same way that when you weave you have a lot of different layers and I kind of linked them together and try to think of an interface where people will be able to hear these stories but in the way we like consuming stories nowadays which is I will just go and touch these and hear the story I don't want to hear any more I will go to the other one and they maybe go back so that's kind of the way it works so whenever you touch these notes you will be able to hear one of these stories and if you want you can switch to the other one and then you can go back and kind of get that general feeling of cultural identity through these kind of old interface just with some like hidden technology that it's like for today okay so this is the Xperia Murrah it's a bridge between a film camera and an analogue of film and analog camera and a digital and iPhone camera I'm it's inspired by film cameras and that as you take a picture of filters immediately applied to the photo that mimics the quality of a vintage camera it is inspired by a digital camera and that you have immediate access to the photo because it's sent straight to Twitter on its own Twitter account by pressing a button I applied filter by pressing a button and two LEDs will light up signifying metafilter has been applied and when I capture a photo LEDs will go down the line signifying that the photo is captured so I'll take a few photos I think we currently have your photos Center my name is Jaso Trivedi and my project is a Dori the haptic meditation experience so what happens in the in the meditation experience so what happens is when you sit down you situate yourself you're guided through a five minute meditation on just focus on your breathing which will eventually lead you to a point of relaxation where you start chanting and as you chant the meditation platform vibrates with your voice so the whole the whole concept is to increase focus and concentration for new and experienced meditators the show is so crazy with so many people and like so much noise and people wonder if you'll really been able to meditate in it even with the sort of chaos that's happening yeah somebody actually fell asleep in the platform yeah people are people who haven't meditated before now interested in meditation which I mean has enormous health benefits and I think that's a great outcome this is something I very very much need so thank you I'm Sebastian and this is a very based on anatomical paintings and the construction of these paintings it works by reconstructing details and assigning triangles to those details so areas where the artist gave more attention are brought forward and sharper well everything is else is pushed behind how do you picking how did youhow are you picking the images that it uses like where'd you find those and what kind of content to teach you they're all anatomical paintings because I really like the big instruction of these bodies and the attention that is set to the painting so here you see a lot of triangles in this area which where is the arm that is being explained hi my name is Paola and I made this with three other teammates kochiya without any menu and basically what this is is it started under the theme of time and we wanted to focus on the right now and kind of use social media as a way that people use to record their lives so what this does is you can text your Instagram handle or your account to the eye and it'll blink and when it opens you can look into it and it'll show you your life in the blink of an eye basically that that's what it does I will text my Instagram handle to the eye and it'll blink hi I'm Dora Luna hi my name is Mint why I opened up a natural tea the project is called nom nom and it's basically controlled it allows you to play youtube videos as you wouldn't and are you picking the videos or they could be any video they're gonna be any videos you can just drop any videos you want and
