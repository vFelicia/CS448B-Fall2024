hello happy holiday is almost Happy New Year I'm standing here at ITP and ima in Brooklyn New York to School of the Arts and New York University were just a few days ago this whole floor was full of over a hundred projects student work from the ITP and ima programs on the fourth floor of 370 J Street and we looked at 91 projects you can see that full three and a half hour livestream by following the link in this video's description but what you're about to watch is a shorter highlight reel of a bunch of projects made by a wonderful group of students I hope you enjoy them I hope you have had a great 2019 and I look forward to seeing you on the coding train in 2020 good bye so I'm Aiden Fowler i'm nicole calvo quick sale and this is our lenticular portal room so we're doing experiments with the lenticular lens which is if you've seen bookmarks that have moving images that's what we're working with here and it stretches and magnifies the light so we're doing different experiments here we have a 3dimensional box moving lenses that are rotating and then these flats on Sun rises over the ocean there's nothing in the box shall we do the reveal like what actually is inside it's an empty box but there's a thousand LEDs in here hi I'm Tina I'm Chris Kristina and this project is called one amongst many is a physical data visualization representing women in computing so you pick up these orbs they illuminate to full brightness and you can see every woman that we chose is in a cohort with a bunch of other women so we have computer scientists mathematicians as you picked an orb up and read about a certain woman other women in her cohort will also illuminate and as the orbs are interacted with over time they get incrementally brighter my name is Lulu and this is an installation that show everybody has a mountain on their original hand I have to tell the rock what is the shape of my hand and it will turns into a mountain which is my own mountain and I want everybody to have a nature connection when they see their Ridge of their hand hi I'm Winnie and so these are or from my data or class I'm from Hong Kong so I did a lot of projects about the protests and specifically focusing on the narratives I'm really interested in nontraditional approaches to protest and the focus of narrative is because I feel like our ability to craft our narrative that's really powerful and healing there's two projects about police and protesters and so I have these YouTube videos that I script that transcript from and I did these generator texts and also with the most common words I made these fridge magnets that people could interact with and then this piece here is all the protest informations I have consumed from September up until now so as you hover you could see the articles and the brighter the box is the more articles I have read in that hour of the day so my name is Tammy's and my project is basically a block puzzle game when you can build the correct sentence you have to use the brain blocks in this case this is basically like a learning tool for kids carrot Oh No say that right there I'm basically that's it I'm Andrea and so my project savvy our project and it uses VR to tell a poetic experience about kind of exploring flashbacks and what it means to have control of our own experiences and memory so that man that you see is supposed to represent trauma so the first time you go through this experience it's like you're going and walking around you may experience something horrific happen and now there's part of it's supposed to represent how memory will kind of try to understand that so in a memory if you've ever unfortunate experience something like bad happen you might replay that memory in your head over and over again and if he ever chooses to stop he can stop time and stop everyone from moving but he can never prevent what's gonna happen and so he is like looping this memory so it's really a struggle it's about patience actually finding where you need to be and then adjusting it for anyway go ahead a few hours on this and still try to figure I actually gave me to play this but I see some other people do some interesting things on this the dirt Rickman um this is web / wall it's my nine projects so we build our own instrument and then we perform with it like in urine dissident interesting chaotic sounds I'm sigh I'm the coding training community manager also a firstyear ITP so this project is called the black projections project and basically I built what I call like a portal mapping device so it's like a math that potentially can help you on lappa portal and it kind of talks about or investigates spacetime and how those are all connected to a lot of different moments that are happening and you basically explore it with a magnet you move across the points and then different images are projected on the screen my name is Ada and this is my project it's noise it's an audio enhance optical illusion the visual pattern is a vortex the center shifts depending on where you're looking at it so as the viewer moves around in space the triggers also triggers the audio changes in your headphone that corresponds to the direction of the moving center of the border my name is Rita and this project is in collaboration with Max mu Silva and it's kind of a chooseyourownadventure color you can see if you put your headphones and you started by saying hi sailors and then it gives you a list of questions you can ask and you here a story that will change every time high sailors hi stranger you can ask us the following questions in any order and you can ask the same question more than once until we reach out destination who are you I am a sailor who will cross the ocean do get where I need to get and do what I need to do why did you leave I left because my father owned a dark mountain of anger where he wanted me to live I loved freedom more than I loved him hey so I'm Lachlan I'm a first year student here at ima and so I made a website called gun funded and it's a visualization of the gun lobby's funding of US Congress like where I'm from in Pennsylvania you can you can see the total and how the funding is disproportionately goes to Republican men in Congress and so you can go to anyone's profile you can share these you can see lists of top senators and representatives so that's gonna fund it and it's gun funder calm Jake Sherwood my project is called climate scape it's a kinetic art installation to raise awareness for climate change and the human effect on the climate it's representing for a future of potential climate change in there is going from best case to worst case so as you progress through the installation it gets more and more chaotic the best case kind of producing a more tranquil softer sound and then as you get through it gets more chaotic and become scary at the end my name is Alvaro la Couture I'm Nicole Genoa and our project is object tracking installation that tracks objects to control different types of animations in real time so we have these fears help with all of the animation position I'm an IDP second year and I have like installation which you don't waste on the best marriage so here as you can see there is a KGB equation which is away in a shallow water but it seems to be difficult but it can be also simulated by a very simple mathematics like like I said automata so it grows these across this bacon space so big wave grows faster quite a small wave goes slower it's similar to the real world smoke slowly my name is Jung and here thank ye creator of this project the idea of this project is to let people to interact what they are doing in the routine life and I didn't be aware of what they're doing because normally in some time people are like doing the same song Felicity so we made our parks which can reflect what people had to in do daily life so we said some of the interaction in the room in the real science room and every reaction due to in the room will be reflected in a small box so I'm Fernando and I'm creating this character called the Firebird and to embody the character image you put on the school office and imagining here at performing arts context so depending on the gestures you make you get like different a different sound and also you change the position of these 3d objects on the screen and you can like change the color of the object making different gestures related to the narrative I'm creating so you can make like fire and you get a red object or you can make like a tree and you get a green object and you can make like this and this is bird so you can fly you can embody the fire fire bird and fly around carrying this seat that is inside the land of the fire bird my name is Pippa Kalman sin' I worked on this project with Noah Curtis he also has a project we made a heart that beats the beat of your own pulse there's a monitor on the outside and there's a motor inside a elastic heart basically you just put your index finger on the pole sensor and then you can see your pulse beat in real time in a heart i'm julian matthews this is the hourglass so there is climate change related data correlated to visual on the sculpture so this is a statistic related to bees it the bee disappeared off the face of the earth humans would only have four years left to live there are some static ones another static one and then these require some user input this is meant to visualize rising sea levels so you can use a slider to demonstrate that this is the approximate cue of the Flint River water during peak crisis a little bit terrifying it this was coming out of people's faucets so these are two discs that are actually 3d printed once it slows down I attach neopixel strips on the outside and with this motor down here it allows me to spin it at 450 rotations per minute my name is Jen this is kind of like this instead okay no scope it's like detector at your distance so you like playing it it's like I've got a certain pattern according to it and then you get close to it you can like really control it by every centimeter see there's no projector just like no just like LED and tumorous and here la you can try to like we need you can throw it slowly hello my name is Matt Ross I'm a second year at ITP and I'm here today to talk to you about your relationship with your data if here today is a simple outlet but it's not just a simple outlet this outlet is connected directly to the servers at Google and what it does is it looks for any documents that you haven't even looked at in over two years so what you can do today is log in and it will find just one single file and if you're ready you can pull the plug and it'll delete just that single file and maybe just let me take a step towards having data in your life that really makes you feel good and then it's important to see it's retrieving all documents from a year and a half ago when I pulled this all of six seconds to change my mind see it's going gold and that's the whole process I'm down on a second here here at Nike feet and I work together with NASA developed a new team full of URL data where obviously you can see healthy data starts here it's just the p5 sketch asking me insert your phone into the container now all our goal today is basically to delete your or clear your browsing history so I'm gonna come here to this / llovely Pharrell and if you would take a look here my browsing history has been cleared I'm when I'm from Taiwan hi I'm KJ I'm from Korea yeah so this project's called Karim voices so this is basically a goddarn system that is based on word recognition so you can choose the word from the library we've built and say you to a microphone and see how he goes revolution yeah so this installation is about like the power of words because sometimes is it's not visible so people just ignore it and want to enforce emphasize that this is so instructed I'm Stacy again I am money I'm kinship so this is a life vending machine we want to raise people surround yourself protecting animals how the indentured animals are feeling right now please insert the coin and start your journey so here you can see an animation the tiger is falling into the trap here you will get a product made by the tiger it's a leather coat I'm Skyler DeVos this is my project I called it liquid relationships and it's about connecting with other people I'm you know I'm the first year at ITP this is the interactive scroll so it's designed to allow someone to interact with an ancient scroll physically so you can use these rods to scroll through and then this allows you to translate my name is Noah and this project is called light it's about communication with physical separation
