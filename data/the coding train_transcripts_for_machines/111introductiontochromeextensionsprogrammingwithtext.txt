hello welcome to another session for the course programming from A to Z and accept accept if you're watching this video it's called programming with text on YouTube because programming from A to Z sounds like it's a beginner course and this course is really for people have already gone through my foundations of JavaScript stuff and I want to do more things with programming with text generating text analyzing text and a lot of different things like that so one of the what what is this playlist going to be about this playlist is about Chrome extensions and words that I can't say bookmarklets I like to say bookmark lay know that does make any sense I was like the French for the book Barclay no bookmarklets it's very hard to say bookmarklets so why is why is this interesting why is this important so all of my sessions in this particular course have all been about I mean this is not entirely true but this is a web browser the sessions have all been about programming kind of what happens inside here inside the actual content of the page by creating your own I know it's a vacuum cleaner because I live in the real world where the things happen like vacuuming but I'm gonna just go on my own eyes my mind lives in its own universe though which hopefully makes these videos somewhat watchable but or not anyway so this is what we've been focusing on and maybe you make an HTML file and a JavaScript file all sorts of things to make things happen in here but working in working with text so you make a web page it generates a poem and it makes a chatbot with the user all these kinds of things that I've looked at analyzes text that a user typed in but what if what you really want to do is affect the browsing experience as a whole so what if what you want to do is say when the user is on the website github or when the user is on the website of a particular newspaper their experience the that users experience of browsing that web age changes now this is typically done and so a way to do this is with two different things one is called a book mark lint which is a way of creating a simple bookmark button that can live up here that can run some JavaScript code to alter and change your view of the current web page you're on the other is called a Chrome extension now you can imagine here the reason one sort of one what limitation of me making this tutorial video is that it is a Chrome extension it is only for the browser Chrome but it allows you to essentially make if you think about chrome like you might think about your phone you could develop an app for your phone to alter your experience of using your phone a Chrome extension is like an app for the web browser Chrome itself that allows you to alter the behavior of the browser beyond just what's happening in the page so you can add interface elements you can know about what people are typing into the address bar you can create a page that shows up whenever somebody has a new tab you could know that somebody said new tab you could know you could you could pop up a timer whenever our user is on you know some sort of like social media website to tell them you only have five more minutes to look at this website and then close the tab for them anything you could do to alter subvert change the browsing experience now this exists as a business model because companies can make Chrome extensions to you know offer you a coupon or I don't know have popup chat popup that get offers to give you help on that page I use a Chrome extension called two buddy I'm now projecting out by accident promoting which gives me extra features to see how to manipulate and know my stats and all the sort of stuff while I'm browsing YouTube so that's really but what I want to think about in this playlist are this idea I'm just gonna call it for lack of a better word creative Chrome extensions so what if you use a crow what if you create a Chrome extension to subvert distort change our browsing experience for the purpose of social commentary or art or activism and I should mention there's something important about this this is not something that you can just put on somebody's computer you can make a webpage put it on a web server email all your friends they come to my webpage but you you can't put a Chrome extension on somebody's computer without them opting into that we'll see that in a moment as we look at the Chrome extension store however I'm not really in this playlist going to focus at all about how you can deploy your Chrome extension to the store I'm gonna show you how to use a Chrome extension in what's called developer mode so you can write and create and debug and edit and change your Chrome extension right there on your own computer if it's something that you then want to distribute you can package it and put it into the chrome store and I'm just super some kind of approval process there but we're gonna stay with a sort of local development environment so this is kind of the overall picture and so in the first two first tutorial what I'm going to do is has a warm up kind of looking a bookmarklet which is kind of a much simpler lower look lower barrier of entry point to just do something interesting with manipulating the browsing experience so I'm gonna start with that and that so if youif you want to get to the code stuff you can stop this video now just go to the next one but what I'm going to do before I get to that is let's look at some examples of some different Chrome extensions all right so let's look at a couple examples of things that I'm thinking about this is a bookmarklet called the deletion ascent to me on Twitter and I believe it actually relates to something that I did a previous video about erase your poetry kind of which is that let's try it so a bookmarklet is a thing that I can drag into the bookmark bar and then in theory when I press this button ooh it got rid of stuff so let's go to let's go to github.com and let me click the deletion nest well and it got rid this is actually very very similar to one of my favorite bookmarklets called wordless web which actually gets rid of everything on a webpage that is text which has some really surprising and interesting effects trying to think of one more website that's not going to make me feel so awkward and uncomfortable to go to to demonstrate this idea but anyway I encourage you to play with the deletion so this is something I'm Mabel will make a bookmarklet that replaces every image on the webpage with like kitten kitten images or something like that we'll do that another Chrome extension that I wanted to show you is by one of my favorite artists um addy wagenknecht her website is places I've never been calm this is a Chrome extension that she created called girls versus get I'll just read to you what it does every username on github is replaced with a generic female username every Gravatar is a place with a Gravatar of a woman or female type image why there is a death of women contribute to open source software this plugin is presented as a filter to challenge assumptions about gender roles and software and to rewire your brain so you can see here you can imagine this is a chrome one something you can do with a Chrome extension is it only activates when you're on certain web pages and changes your view of that web page and so you can see this is uh this is on github I will include links to all these chrome extensions and bookmarklets in the video description I'm going to come back to wordless web this is a Chrome extension that was submitted by I'm just want to make sure I have the right name looking in the slack channel here I believe sorry Noah van boven I apologize for pronouncing the name incorrectly called web paint let's try adding it so if you make a Chrome extension that's in the actual chrome extension store you can just go and hit add to Chrome now here's something really important this is what I mean by opting in Chrome extensions get a lot more permission to do stuff beyond what you would normally have just in a generic regular web page so if this Chrome extension says it can read and change all your data on the websites you visit presumably this has been vetted by Google I suppose and in the chrome store because it doesn't do stuff like you know steal all your passwords but this is certainly other certainly security and privacy issues that are at play here but I'm gonna add this extension and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to github.com Schiffman atoz I'm gonna let know one thing a Chrome extension can do and we're gonna see this is you can add menu options to the menu like this button so now I'm gonna click this button oh wait look you can even do a popup all I'm gonna show you how to do popups too and I'm gonna pick this pencil and now I'm gonna just start doodling or it's so this is by the way this is very similar to a what else can we do this is so fun this is way better than my example ah anyway I clicked off of it but you can see this is something that I intend to make as part of this playlist a Chrome extension that allows you use p5.js to draw and make a canvas overlay over your over the webpage that you're currently browsing on ok another Chrome extension is one called code doodles this is something you can do I forgot what it's called but to create a webpage that appears so right now if I make a new tab I don't have a Chrome extension that replaces the default chrome new tab which just shows me the Google search bar and some recently visited sites but momentum is another one all my students will have this one I should probably install it let's try the code doodles one so I'm going to add this one it says this one all I can do is replace the page you see when opening a new tab add extension and so now every time I make a new tab I get whoa I get some cool interesting code doodle project oh so I would have to research this more no credits wise like who these are coming from I wonder if it's still oh it's loading wow these are all like super crazy WebGL 3d things which is kind of wild so so you can see the range of possibilities this is a Chrome extension by Melanie Hoff called deco Delia and I don't know if I pronounced that right it's a Chrome extension and glasses set that uses basic principles of color theory to read your browsers content visible only with the use of rennes red tinted glasses so you can see here I can't see what's going on here but if I happen to have the red tinted glasses so I could essentially if I'm in a coffee shop and I didn't want anybody to see what I'm doing I could wear my glasses and use my computer without anyone be able to see you know this is probably a nice video summary Melanie is an alum of both the school for a point of computation and ITP the graduate program where I teach so I encourage you to check out this wonderful Chrome extension I just want to see if there's a right so so you can search for some like things on your so this is obviously a kind of like an art project but it actually does work I've seen it it's great but I also want to mention a wordless Web which is one of my favorite projects very similar to the wordless web sorry by Corey Forsythe and Gigli which this is a Chrome extension that takes whatever website you're on so you can see this is an image of Facebook and just gets rid of all the words and all you're left with are just the images be interesting to think about doing one that does the others so I hope this video gives you kind of a general introduction to the it's the words diagram ever overview of why it is we're here and a range of some kind of creative and artistic possibilities and what I'm gonna do in the next bunch of videos is just really go through the nuts and bolts of how to make these things and then at some point hopefully towards the end I'll do a couple coding challenges to make some quirky Chrome extension or bookmarklet projects okay thanks for watching and I'll see you maybe in the next video you
