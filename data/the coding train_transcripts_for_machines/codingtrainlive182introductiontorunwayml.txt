I always forget I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this star this star song never forget the bits taught somebody composed that song for me hello and welcome to a very special summer edition of the coding train so I'm kind of on a little bit of a hiatus right now you might have heard me talk about where this very light content happening in July and August coming back full steam full force in September um so I want to talk a little bit about schedule and stuff and what's happening and what you can expect but before I do any of that but in order for you to follow along with the main content that is the content of today's livestream which is a very special exciting content that very excited about you do need to download some software so I'm just going to tell you what to download spigen said it going in the background while I babble babble on and on and on about other stuff so I'm gonna open up a web browser something like this go go glue googly I don't know how to pronounce that chromic home eh I think it's pronounced web browser and I'm going to ask you to navigate to if you so choose runway and al.com so go to runway ml comm then you'll want to head over to this link under download beta and here it should start downloading automatically and there are versions for Mac OS Windows Linux anything else so whatever you're out by the way I'm talking to somebody over here normally I'm just in this room talking to myself but I am talking to Kris Valenzuela how'd I do on the pronunciation pretty good one of the founders and creators of Runway who is here in the chat say hi to Chris in the chat to answer your questions and to answer all my questions as I fumble my way through trying to learn about Runway so I'm gonna come back to talking about what Runway is and what I'm planning to do in today's livestream but I just wanted to at least set you on Dan loading this if you want to and I'm going to give you a coupon code a little bit to get some extra credits as well so but before I do that so while you're downloading that what's happening here where are you where am I where are we with is the what is that what's what is the meaning of the universe that is not a question I will answer so this is a little neighborhood YouTube channel called the coding train and every time I say coding train I then have to blow a train whistle it's in this contract I signed awhile ago and where I make computer programming tutorials and otherwise wastes reading things like random numbers and most of my activity happens during the school year because I also work at a school New York University I teach in a program called ITP and also a that's a graduate program an undergraduate program called ima they're both part of Tisch School of the Arts so summer is a little bit lighter for me in terms of content anyway but this summer is a particularly unique summer in that this room that I'm standing in right now is being closed down and I'm moving the cameras and equipment to a new room on our in the Brooklyn campus sometime this month or next month so I mean I'm gonna lose some time where I don't have a recording studio and we'll be setting up a new recording studio which hopefully some better stuff and back full force in September however there are many videos still outstanding that I am working on editing together and releasing number one is and this is very exciting a full documentation of a video about all of the equipment and software in this room that I'm using so that's probably gonna come out in the next couple weeks which is good timing considering that I'm closing this down so this coding train studio which has been here since I don't know when I first started I got a look back and figure out what was the first livestream I did from this room the first livestream on the coding train I think was 2015 or perhaps earlier than that but I was I was doing everything from my office downstairs for a while anyway that's not super important so that's coming out I have a twopart series on how to program your own processing java library which I know everybody on the Internet just waiting that's gonna blow up YouTube that's gonna be like highest viewed video ever where I show you how to build a Java library in Eclipse cuz that's like all the rage now that's whatever is doing right right okay take a deep breath here for a second that's coming out of an the edited version of the tictactoe coding challenge that I did on a previous livestream is coming and also if I can get my act together because I forgot to record some stuff for that today a edited version of the neuro evolution steering car racing coding challenge thing so that's also coming so there's a bunch of content that will be coming out in the channel but this might be the last livestream until September or I might pop back for a surprise livestream like this one on subtopic leg runway okay now I'm looking at the chat now let's say you happen to be supporting the coding train as a member on YouTube or a patron on patreon and I think I am going to I'm putting this out there the University I'm not sure about it but I might shut down the patreon and move over entirely to youtube memberships you know I hesitate to have everything all in one platform but there are some advantages to that and so stay tuned to information about that but you might be wondering when I signed up for a membership and suddenly now there's no content for two months well I'd suggest that you unsigned up if that's really an issue but one of the things that I will be headdown working on for the next six weeks is a dish 2nd edition of the nature of code book and I've talked about that in previous live streams so I might do some memberonly live streams with work sessions on that book and share some PDF so that's that's what I'll be doing in terms of the member community in the next couple months I'm looking over at the chat that I think that's the main sort of announcement to eat things that I wanted to talk about nature of code books summer schedule tell you to download runway I don't know anything else take a momentary break here I know what it means to take a break I mean I'm just gonna take a break from talking anybody have any trouble downloading runway if so let us know in the chat now I will tell you that coding tree is sponsored by water it's not exactly wet and there are different kinds of flow like laminar flow and turbulent flow I think what I'm drinking it's more of a turbulent flow refreshing actually I make that's my joke it's very lame but it is my joke um this there's no sponsor for today's livestream however I do want to mention that I am actually an advisor to the company runway that makes runway so this well this isn't exactly like a paid product endorsement there is that relationship there which I feel is important to disclose so this is something like of a sponsored video in a way by a runway itself and you can find out more about the company runway itself and the people behind runway and I know they're hot doing a lot of hiring so maybe you want to apply for a job with runway I'm all of the runway website to see if there's any questions that anybody had any cloth Vogel rights I have runway running wax or 82 thank you for your membership of the coda train look you have a little comma waving emoji icon thing I forgot what that means a couple a couple couple of two months six months one year who's who in the chat has the longest I think if I go here to YouTube / the coding train /join it'll tell me does that tell me anything no maybe because I'm already a member oh no because I'm not logged in who knows well look I'm live okay there's me alright so it's okay cookie crumb is asking is runway okay for beginners because I'm a beginner yes why said that way too loudly let me said we're Conley yes so I think there are on the runways a really interesting thing and I think that it would be best for me to start using it to explain it but because I think there are aspects of it the the whole system by its nature the way that it's built is a piece of saw or is meant for beginners but it is a tool that allows you to explore pretty deeply the world of machine learning models some of which are quite sophisticated and you can wander down a lot of advanced and tricky and complex rabbit holes so I think there's a wide range here of kind of understanding and it's required not required but that that is part of using runway but what I like to do on the coding train is have everything I'm making my assumption that you've never seen it before I would say the only Priya lis not any prerequisites for today which is pretty rare but though eventually at some point I'm gonna move towards using runway with maybe processing and with p5.js and then you might the prerequisite would have some familiarity with those platforms and basic coding knowledge but I am here to help I am here to help and yes this is appropriate for beginners all right so I think oh somebody gave me a super chat which I have to acknowledge Charlie England thank you thanks for that all right any update on our mysterious bug that we were talking about earlier it's fixed Oh exciting I was all exciting to debug say oh we have a new member welcome to new member ball Simpson thank you for joining the coding training ring make all the noise things I like you know I should automate all this stuff whatever okay so let's get let's get going so what I'm going to do so I this is this is something slightly different from my usual live streams in the sense that this is entirely themed around runway and ultimately it may not make sense or be necessary to edit this into smaller shorter videos but just in case it does happen to make sense to do that because there's a lot of me babbling and I'm sure I'll waste some time later chasing down some weird buggers piece of documentation or reading random numbers I'm going to assume actually that I'm going to make two video tutorials extemporaneously improvising but one will just be in reduction to runway as a platform and signing up for a runway account and then the other will be maybe doing a coding challenge where I try to get the results the output of a machine learning model into a p5.js sketch I'll get to that later and really again let me just mention if you have questions about runway ask them in the chat because you can have a whole completely separate conversation without me with Chris one of the founders and creators of runway here and maybe they're also even some other people from runway watching hi people from runway I'm probably gonna screw this up so careful what you wish for alright here we go alright and let me just cover one other thing because how around is asking do you have to pay to keep using it so I will get into this as I look at runway runway is something that you can use you don't need to enter a credit card you can use it without paying any money however there are some caveats to this the one of the things that I'll be doing is running the machine learning models with runway in the cloud and that requires paying a fee by the minute or by the hour by the minute for cloud GPU usage every runway user when you sign up you automatically get $10 of free credits and as I go through the signup process I'm gonna give you a coupon code it's just coding train which will give you an additional $10 so you'll be able to get $20 in credits for free and you actually do quite a bit $20 in credits you'd be surprised and then towards the end of the livestream maybe I'll talk about ways that you can actually run the machine learning models locally on your laptop if your laptop has a GPU obviously there's some limit there's quite a bit of limitation to that depending on what computer you're using but that would also allow you to run it without paying any money whatsoever I get that pretty much right all right okay so um like you without the beard but I'm wearing the beard where is that a thing you say wearing the beard that's weird I don't think you wear a beard maybe you do whatever alright so let's go to the homepage of runway and I am now going to start artificially as if I'm starting over introducing you to runway and then going through the steps to download and sign up for runway and we'll see how that goes and I think what I'll do you I think in the new studio by the way I won't have this turning the cameras on and off thing which I'm actually quite sad about because it brings me a lot of joy Eli right no the beard wears you which i think is a very profound statement okay by the way I just have to highlight this look see this is the homepage of runway M L can zoom in here we see this is some sort of computing machine running the runway software this is probably like the dense pose model maybe and then it but I just want to like highlight this go over here into the corner here oh look at this nature of code by some strange person named Daniel okay there we go nice to see that there there's some other books there's a lot of life's little Easter eggs in here if you keep looking here comes everybody this is a great book by Clay Shirky I think I might have read all of these books here we'll see all right great alka reports that signing up and entering coding train code went smoothly which is great all right how do I have no plans for this I mean everybody's aware of that but I just feel the need to say that one more time since Christmas hello and welcome to a tutorial series on the coding train about a piece of software called runway so what I'm gonna do in this particular video is just show you the runway website I'm going to download the runway software I'm gonna sign up for a runway account and if I kind of click through and show you the basics of how it works now what is even runway and why might you use it nope no before I even get to that though I feel like it's important to say a couple things one is runway is not something that I've made runway is made by a company also called runway they happen to be some of the founders of runway and creators of runway or alumni of a program where I teach that make sense ITP and I'm an advisor to the company but this is a tool that you can use starting today if you download it for free with some with a coupon from the coding train let me do this one again I'm just I I won't keep doing this over and over again but I just needed a little like warmup that was a warmup I said too much I don't need to go on and on about this way too much okay hello and welcome to a new tutorial series on the coding train using a piece of about a piece of software are called runway so what is runway how do you download and install runway and kind of tinker around with it that's all I'm gonna do in this particular video now let me clear runway is not something that I've made a runway is made by a company a new company called runway itself it's a piece of software you can use you can download it for free you can use it for free there are aspects of it that require cloud GPU credits which I'll get into later and you can get some free credits and a coupon code that you'll find in the description of this video but really I want to just talk to you about what is kind of so excited about it I'm planning to use it in the future in a lot of future tutorials and coding challenges and teaching things that I'm gonna do and I also should just mention that I am an advisor to the company runway itself so I'm involved in that capacity all right so what is runway now right here it says machine learning for creators bring the power of artificial intelligence to your creative project with an intuitive and simple visual interface start exploring new ways of creating today so this this to me is like the core of runway I am somebody who's a creative coder I'm working with processing and p5.js you might be working with other pieces of software that's just commercial software coding environments you're writing your own software and you want to make use of recent advances in machine learning you've read about this model you saw this YouTube video about this model can you use it in your thing well before runway one of the things you might have done is find your way to some github repo that had like this very long readme of about all the different like dependencies you need to install and configure and then you've got to download this and install this and then make build this library and you can really get stuck there for a long time so runway is an allinone piece of software with an interface that basically will run machine learning models for you install and configure them that you having to do any other work but press a button called install and it gives you an interface to play with those models experiment with those models and then broadcast the results of those models to some other piece of software there's a variety of ways you can do that broadcasting through HTTP requests through OSC messages and all these things might not make sense to you which is totally fine I'm going to poke through them and show you how they work with an eye towards at least showing you how to pair a runway with processing and how to pair a runway with p5.js and I'll also show you where there's lots of other examples and things you can do with other platforms and stuff like that all right that was pretty good alright so I'm going to so the first step you should do is click here under down the firm so the first step you should do is click here on your download runway beta it will automatically trigger a download for Mac OS Windows or Linux I've actually already downloaded and installed runway so I'm gonna kind of skip that but skip that step and just actually now run the software so I'm gonna go over here and I have I have the runway icon already here as part of my what does this thing close the Mac the doc knows I'm going to click that run run right ah and now it's saying welcome to runway signin to get started ok so if you already have an account you could just sign in with your account I do already have an account but I'm going to create a new one just so we can follow along with the process so I'm gonna go here create an account I'm going to enter my email address which is Daniel at the coding train comm then I'm gonna make a username and password the user name will be choochoo do you think that's gonna be taken already my password alright let's let's pause for a second generate a password not currently sponsoring today's livestream but hey Lane I think you can sign up at like on flash go to trade or something they were sponsor of a previous livestream can find that there there a password generator somewhere in here how my password changer tools password history password generator there it is any requirements of the password I should know about let's do like oh wait that's a good idea alright hold on everybody that's it okay I'm going to generate a new password oh that you can't see it a copy password I'm going to copy it I'm copying the password in and I'm just gonna also please hold I kind of put you back here there we go alright now that I've put in my very strong password I'm going to click Next and I'm gonna give my details Daniel Schiffman the coding train create account ah and it's giving me a verification code to Daniel at the coding train comm let me grab my mobile device that'll be the easiest way for me to read that email oh it's even got a notification google thinks that an email from Runway is a very important email cuz I have it to set up to only give me a notification for important emails I'm gonna say six I don't think there's any issue with me I guess maybe though I will shut this off as well just just for security sake if you can like determine what keys I pressed based on audio signals then you're doing very well validate okay put you back on their account has now been creat account has now been created and I can click start alright so this is now I'm just gonna like minimize the browser so we can be clear on what we're actually seeing that's part of runway what's this year Oh hold on a sec let me turn that off is that the password that I just revealed by accident this is going remarkably well that was totally the past who knows my runway password account now all right I'm gonna change the password I'm sure I can do that manage my account edit profile a password change password current password new password beat you all hackers are everywhere update great I changed my password so now my account is secured again I've logged in and we go back to a runway it logged me out that was nice sorry about that everybody okay close this there we go close the password generator Oh looks like I got some sort of super chat which I will now check on thank you Oh XR 82 that's very nice of you just to say thank you okay there we go all right this is everything you imagined the code exchange could be just me trying to like not give people my password by accident that's basically what 90% of the time is all right all right so once you download it install Broadway and signed up for an account logged into your account you will find this screen so if you've been using runway for a while you might then end up here clicking on open workspaces because workspaces are a way of collecting a bunch of different models that you want to use for a particular project into a workspace but we haven't done any of that so the first thing that I'm gonna do is just click on browse models and if you've never run run way and clicked on browse models this is gonna be a very exciting moment for you because there are a lot of models which you suddenly can play at your fingertips that you could just play around with and I haven't even planned this so I think we should just pick one somewhat randomly I'm going to use style gam later anybody have one that they see that they want to request I would love to use dense pose would be kind of fun attention Gann oh what's the one is that one where I could draw oh yeah is that spayed Koko yeah so I think that would be a good one Thank You sundar ten all right so so the first thing that I might suggest that you do is just click on a model and see what you can do to play with it in the runway interface itself because one thing that's really wonderful about runway is as a piece of software in an interface you can explore and experiment with the models to understand how it works what it does well what it doesn't well do well what it does it all before starting to bring it into your own software or your own project so I'm gonna pick this spayed Coco model which I have never looked at before it's very legitimate me I have no idea what's gonna happen when I click on that and now here I can find out some more information about the model so I can find out what is the model do it generates realistic images from sketches and doodles I can find out more information about the model for example this is the paper that describes this model semantic image synthesis with spatially adaptive normalizations trained on cocoa stuff dataset remember when someone asked is this big is this is this tutorial for beginners well is for beginners in that you're a beginner you can come here and play around with it but there's there's a lot of it you can go very deep too if you want to find the paper read through the notes and understand more about what this model how it was built what data it was trained on which is always a very important question to ask whenever you're using a machine learning model so I can also we can see there are attributions here so this is the organization that train the model these are the authors of the paper we can see wet what the size of it when it was created if it's CPU and GPU supported and then very important it's down here but I'm actually going to highlight it here we can click on the license so this is Creative Commons Attribution noncommercial sharealike 4.0 license so I'm not gonna pretend to be a lawyer here I'll be able to give you proper advice on the you know the beyond the scope of what I'm doing here is the nuances of what all these licenses mean and how where you can use them but you can find out and do that research yourself right here in the runway interface we can also go under gallery and we can see just some images that have been created so we can get an idea this is something this is a model that's themed around something called image segmentation so I have an image over here what does it mean to do image segmentation well this image is segmented divided into a bunch of different segments those segments are noted by color so there's like a purple segment a pink segment a light green segment and those colors are tied to labels in the model essentially that know about a kind of thing that it could draw in that area so you could do image segmentation in two ways I could an existing image like an image of me and try to say like oh this I'm gonna segment it this is where my head is this is where my hand is this is where my hand is or I could generate images by sort of drawing on a blank image saying put a hand over here put a head over here and it looks like at least the example we're seeing here is kind of like a what do you call those things it's an art not a landscape yeah that's a bowl of fruit that has a name how come I can't think of that word so chats gonna say it instantly art bowl of fruit okay I can't think of this word I'm going crazy still life it's not what I mean I think it's a still life it's not what I mean maybe it's just still life I thought it was something else whatever all right and then we'll get editors who version of this video okay so that's what a big segmentation is at least in the way that I understand it okay so let me go here now what I want to do is I want to add this too so now I want to use this one so what have I done so far thank you James Craig and all these super chats today this is not usually happen it's YouTube like promoting super chats thank you James Craig I really appreciate it you that gets a train whistle okay oh what a time to be alive all right where was I what have I done so far I've downloaded runway I poked around the models I've just clicked on one now I want to use that model I want to play with it I want to see it run so I'm gonna go here to add to workspace it's right up here add to workspace now I don't have a workspace yet so I need to make one and I'm gonna call this workspace red I just want to leave it as this name red current multiculturalism so it'll automatically name a workspace for you and did it did it breaking news I'm being told that these workspaces are named from colors and art isms fruits Oh fruits fruits and art isms so maybe you got blueberry abstract expressionism for some all right so I'm a bit creepy I don't know I'm gonna name it though I'm gonna say coding trained livestream so I'm gonna do that when hit create now I have a workspace and you can see this is my workspace I have only one model added to this workspace over here and it's kind of highlighting up for me right now what to do I need to choose an input source so every machine learning model is different some of them expect text input some of them expect image input some of them might expect input that's from it's arbitrary scientific data from a spreadsheet then the model is going to take that input in run it through the model and produce an output and that output might be numbers or it also might be an image or it might be more text so now we're in the sort of the space of a case by case basis but if I understand image segmentation correctly I'm pretty sure the input is going to be both an image and the input and the output are both going to be an image right so let's make a little diagram here this whiteboard has shut off but let's make a little diagram so we have this what was this model called again spade spade cocoa so we have this machine learning model presumably there's some neural network architecture in here maybe it has some convolutional layers this is something we would want to read that paper to find out more runaways can allow us to just use it out of the box and you know it certainly would always recommend reading more about it I want to learn more about how to use it so my assumption here is I'm in my software that I want to build I want to I'll maybe create a drawing piece of software that allows a user to segment out an image so you could imagine maybe I'm gonna like kind of draw something that's one color look I could use different color markers like I'm going to fill you know I'm gonna sort of fill this image in with a bunch of different colors one of these markers don't work this is not important and then I'm going to feed that into the model and out will come an image so we have input and we have output and again this is going to be different for every model that we might pick in runway although there's a lot of conventions a lot of the models expect images as input and output images some of them expect text as input and output an image or images input and output text etc and so on and so forth so here under choose input source I'm gonna click segmentation oh wow I'm not even the right thing shoot well then let me um can I get back to where I was before let me actually just remove it well actually if I click the file this is fine I don't know why I'm obsessed I'm gonna try I'm gonna delete it just so by the way one thing you can do is you can delete a model but I'm gonna delete it and then I'm just gonna add it again in case you missed that part you get to see it again I'm gonna add to workspace cucumber multiculturalism no I don't want to new I want to go to my workspace Oh add a model so what did I what did I miss here let's see I'm discovering the runway interface so I click here recently used Spade cocoa add to workspace there we go oh oh you know it must sound uh saves my workspace because I there was nothing in it alright no problem we're gonna do it again red the nice thing about this is we get to have more automatic workspace needs let's see so I'm gonna say coding trained live stream again I just wanted it to be I just want it to be back to here in case we edit out I guess I can't not do it without thinking about we're gonna edit it alright and so now what I want to do is choose the input source in runway for the model so something that's going to produce a segmented image and so that could be coming from a file it could actually come from a network connection which I'll get into maybe in future video or you can explore on your own I'm just gonna pick segmentation amount this is like the greatest thing ever because what just happened is runway your image segmentation is a common enough feature of machine learning models that runway has built into it an entire drawing engine so that you can play around with image segmentation so and you can see these are the colors for different labels so maybe what I want it looks like it's a lot of transportation stuff so maybe what I want is let's try slette stride wrong some people so I'm gonna do that if we do it edited version this will get sped up how am i doing let's draw two people I don't think this is actually how people look in a real image look good it'd be interesting to see what it does with this look and let's put an airplane flying above I wonder if I don't need to do I need to be interesting I think about 20 does it matter if I do it in the shape of the airplane or is it just gonna figure it out because it knows what the shape of an airplane is that's actually a much better airplane than I imagined myself drawing what else elephant ooh oh boy there's a lot other stuff that's not transportation wine glass this is gonna be a very large wine glass well two people with a airplane and a wine glass flying overhead okay oh now I'm gonna choose an output and I just want to do preview right cuz preview right now is like I'm not actually I don't need to export this I don't you need to use it somewhere else I just want to play around with it in runway itself so I'm gonna hit preview and ah and here comes the most nothing and now here's the thing so okay sorry now I have selected my input which is just the segmentation interface of runway itself I have selected my output which is just a preview now it's time for me to run the model and here we go run remotely so a remote GPU enabled and you can see just by signing up for run away I have $10 in remote GPU credits I be interesting to see how much just running this once actually uses so one thing I mentioned now if you want to get additional credits I can go over here this is like the sort of icon for my profile I can click on this I'm going to go now to here get more credits is that where I want to go yeah I'm gonna go to get more credits and this is gonna take me to a browser page and I could have certainly pay for more credits but I'm gonna click here and I'm going to redeem credits by saying coding train right here so if you would like to get an additional $10 in credits you can do this and we can see now I should have 20 dollars in credits so I can close that minimize the browser and go back to here my workspace my model whoops where do I want to go this is this is workspace here we go there we go I'm back here so this icon up here just so we're clear this icon up here is your workspaces of which I only have one with one model that's connected to remote GPU and if I wanted to look at other models I would go here to this icon alright now I'm gonna press run remotely couldn't have a very long sound effect is so beautiful I cannot believe it so spade cocoa machine learning while generating it's really interesting to see the results here so you can think me knowing nothing about this model kind of how it works and what to expect get some pretty weird results with it probably if I were a bit more thoughtful maybe if I even like filled in the entire space right I probably I left so much of it blank I also included like a giant wine glass with two people it's very kind of creepy looking although this I think this sort of resembles me in some strange sort of way and we can see here look at this five cents here's my five softimage but what's that oh I could live paint okay and apparently I can live paint all right that's crazy let's try doing that so the reason why I took a long time was it was just kind of booting it up so one thing I should mention is the reason why that took a long time it was like spinning up the server and everything to start actually running the model but now that it's running in real time it can happen much more quickly so let's try adding I want to add something like but what if I want to add an umbrella let's add an umbrella to this person and there we go and like this one this person's gonna have a suitcase whoops don't click on that oh and I'm drawing down here look at me like not knowing how computers work this is the this is the inputs I need to draw here let's draw a little suitcase what else so let's put on some eyeglasses does to make this person look more like me I keep doing that it's funny how my instinct is to do that put on some eyeglasses here those great high glass tennis racket cop nice Bowl I kind of want to start over let me start over how do I can I clear this like they'll probably this Oh fill bucket oh that's what it been that's useful is there a clear the whole thing button I can undo or trash there real clear so let's try filling it so what would be a good thing to fill it with that's like background dirt fence let's try floor wood so let's try filling it with a wood floor oh whoa then let's put let's try to put like some fruit so was there like apple here so let me put an apple gonna paint that this is looking much better now let's put like an orange right next to it let's put a couple oranges and make a little bowl of fruit Wow crazy Wow where's my search oh here it is let's see what else what other fruits what is there a banana it's probably banana okay so let's put a banana okay this I gotta stop that's pretty amazing so again here was just a little moment later of being being a little more thoughtful to think about how this model actually works and what what might happen you know I if I knew if I looked at the data set which is the fairly well known I imagine cocoa image data set that's probably going to be give me even more information to think about what it's going to do well but you can see how it's able to sort of think about a sort of little seat a little little pile of fruit here on a you know wood background almost looks a lot more like cloth like it's sitting on a table pretty realistic and yes Charlie England points out which is correct this is continuing to use the GPU credits and we can see that you know still though I've even with doing a bunch of live painting I've just used ten since there so you could do a lot with the free ten dollars just in playing around Simon Says Spade cocoa I'm just curious here to Google Spade cocoa dataset or maybe that was from like it's the cocoa dataset yeah cocoa dataset is this data set so I would encourage you also to check out this URL but with a lot more information but something about the data that was used to Train this particularly in the segmentation how all right okay let me take a minute here let's see if people have any let me take a minute to see if there's any questions that people want to ask in the chat that I can either answer myself or asked Chris about yes and so I noticed that Chris just wrote in the chat some models only work on remote GPU so if you won I don't know if this do you know if offhand if this is one that will work locally no so this is one that only works on remote GPU other models work locally I think I'm gonna try to run pose net which can run locally and so it won't use any GPU credits for that and then some models will work locally but require another installation and another dependency which is something called docker which I could talk about or install at some point but I know that runway is working on making that process even easier to be able to run stuff locally okay can I lower resolution to speed up that's an interesting question so I I can see here that the resolution is set to 640 by 360 is that something that can change with this model no but the but the model I couldn't change that in the interface yeah so so this is a good question because you know the way most machine learning models work in particular if they're fixed inputs and fixed outputs not like a kind of sequential model the output is fixed the input is fixed it requires a particular resolution because the neural network is expecting a certain amount of numbers to come in so you can do to some extent you could do resizing and resampling if I go back to my diagram here like I could do some resizing and resampling here or I could do some resizing and resampling here before to prepare the input or after I get the output but the model itself the input image has to be a particular dimension and the output is only going to come in that dimension some some models are released I think with you know like sort of different versions of it with which may be output different dimensions I think I've seen that but in this particular one it's fixed dimensions okay all right I I could like play with this forever loop I could play with this forever but I think I'm gonna not all right all right so now let's let me think about this what else do I want to show here before I move on I think what I'll do is to separate like sort of like tutorials one using pose net with processing and then one using this style gain a rainbow's with p5.js but I want to think it's just in sort of this like general tutorial about the platform as a whole what else do I want to say so let's look at so input wise I could also so I chose to do segmentation here but I could also use a file so if I wanted to open a file on the computer I could do it that way and then output if I change to export I could also actually export that to a variety of different formats but of course I could also write here just under preview I can click this download Save button and now I am saving forever more that this particular image is a file now what's really important here actually more important here is under network so if what I wanted to do is click over here under network this means I can now communicate with this particular machine learning model from my own software whether that's software that I've downloaded or purchased that somebody else has made that speaks one of these particular protocols or my own software that I'm writing in just about any programming language or environment if you if you have a framework or module or a library or support these types of protocols so and the one the nice things here if I click on JavaScript it's actually we can see there's actually a bit of code here that you can actually just copy paste into your JavaScript to run it directly so I'm gonna come back oscy is also a really popular protocol messaging Network messaging protocol for creative coders stands for open sound control allows you to send data between applications so I will also kind of come back and in a separate video and show you about how some of these work I should also probably mention that the runway software itself works in a very similar way to a piece of software called Weka Nader that you might be familiar with Weka Nader is a software that was created by Rebecca fee brink years ago that allows you to train a neural network with data sent over OSC messaging and then get the results of that after the fact the real sort of key difference here is runway is really set up to support a huge treasure trove of pretrained models whereas Weka Nader was more for training on training neural networks on the fly with small bits of data but and I will say that one of the things that runway is planning maybe by September is to start coming out with features for training your own model as well okay so people are asking I noticed this is being discussed but I want to see if I understand this correctly as well so the model is still running but unless it's not actively so it's still you right now it's using cloud credits because it's running yeah but if I were to click so I in a way I like wasted a little bit of my credits by talking without using it but if I wanted to be but as soon as I click stop it's no longer running on the cloud ok ok I'm just looking at the questions alright I think that's most of let me wrap do a little wrap up here in case we try to like edit this together as something that's ooh chain ER coming soon that's exciting so if I go here I just want to understand the sign I do this ok got it ok alright think I guess yeah let me let me let me wrap this up here and then we'll go to doing what time is it I plenty of time go to do a pose net with processing cuz I think that'll be a good example of seeing the full workflow so thanks for this watching this introduction to runway just sort of the basics of downloading installing the software what it is from a highlevel point of view um what the features of the interface work how to get some free cloud credits and what I would suggest that you do after watching this video is download run it run the software and go to this browse models page so you can see there's a lot of different models for looking at motion generative community text recognition cook around here let's try this recognition 1 face recognition dense cap where's pose net in here that might be under motion dense pose pose net so here's a model called pose net which performs realtime skeletal tracking of one or more people I've covered this model in other libraries like the ml 5 jazz library with tensorflow J s and so what I'm gonna do in the next video is use this model pose net in runway with my webcam running it locally on this computer without requiring cloud credits and then get the results of this model in processing it's so I'm gonna show you that whole workflow but poke around click around find and find a model you lock like poke around click around find a model that you like let me know about it in the comments share images that you made with it and look forward to seeing what you make with runway ok thanks for watching all right I'm just looking at the chat but I guess I don't really need to ok so next what I'm gonna do is kind of I'm gonna go to let's let's find something so I want to go to runway ml processing I'm gonna actually just stay here so I need this I want to have pose net up here and running okay so I'm gonna go here I want to make sure I have processing up so let me run processing oh wait a sec here I'm just getting set up for the next sort of tutorial module here look let me just peek at the example to see whether I want to try to just sort of like write it or just copy it so you need the runway hose before OSHA requires the OSC library there's a lot of stuff going on here I think what I'll do is I'll bring this stuff in slowly piece by piece I've got runway open I've got processing open and I've got the browser open a V in the chat a is asking what about creative coding in blender using Python scripting interface to generate geometry or something so yeah you can you know I'm not an expert on blender I've used it almost you know I've used it for maybe less than five minutes of my entire life but most pieces of software and I'm pretty sure blender included come with capabilities that allow you to communicate with the blender software itself over the network a blender is a special case because it's completely free and opensource software so if it didn't have that capability you could actually build that capability in or more likely somebody has already done this I know there's like addons and thanks for blender but absolutely if you want it to generate I would say like textures for a 3d model in blender if you wanted to control puppeteer a like a character in blender with a like pose detecting model these are all things you could absolutely do by pairing blender and run way together all right so let me this I might also need to do some diagramming here to talk about the different pieces actually there's no clap I don't think there's going to be a cloud involved here I'm correct all right so the next the next thing that I'm gonna do I will get started with right now okay just click this here let me just check a couple things and make sure things are working yep all right excuse me hello and welcome to another video tutorial about working with Runway and running machine learning models in Runway itself now before you watch this video tutorial if you've never used Runway before you might want to go back and look at my introduction to runway how to download and install it but to be honest you probably could figure that out if you just go to runway ml dotcom and click on download beta you're gonna want to then download and open the runway software you'll go then to browse models I might go here under motion and I'm going to click pose net and you'll find yourself right here so this is where I am I've installed runway I've downloaded it and I'm on the page in the runway software for the pose net machine learning model now what is pose net pose net is a machine learning model that performs realtime skeletal tracking of one or more people and guess what I'm a person and I've got it so let's actually first click Add to workspace so I already have a workspace that I've made in the previous video called coding train livestream I want to choose an input source which I want it to be my webcam so yep run away go right ahead and there I am and then I want to choose an output source which eventually I want to be processing because I want to get the results of running this machine learning model pose net into processing itself but for right now I'm just gonna click on preview so I click on preview oh and have to run but guess what so this is different than what I've showed in previous videos I've got an option for run locally and in fact this model can only be run locally it would be silly to run this one in the cloud because I'd have to spend all this time sending the data over the network and it's very easy for it to this is a very small fast model can be run on most modern computers so I'm gonna click run locally so it requires no GPU credits absolutely can be used for free and we can see there it goes it's running right now it is making guesses as to where the various key points of my skeleton are on my body in the output that's view below I'm just looking at this here so I'm looking at now one of the nice things that I'm seeing here is there's so many options that I can like tweak and I can tweak all these in real time right now is there any of these that would make it I think if I do single pose it'll run faster right oh but I have to stop running it to change those but these can I can change in real time I see this welcome to the cony train where a person on the internet makes tutorials about things that he's never used before but that's the way to learn yeah just try it you just have to just go for it leap of faith here alright so let me just actually stop for a second let me change this to single pose can we do run locally again all right that's good to know okay so then are there other things here I'm just curious that might that that might speed up the the performance architecture like if I make it lower so let's see architecture ah okay so we can see this option here mobile net architecture larger the value the larger the size of the layers just trying to zoom into this and more accurate the model set this to a smaller value so let's let's try setting this to 0.5 and run it again that's pretty good I'm not gonna get too hung up on performance I'm just always curious about this stuff let's do stop image a scale factor what to scale the image by oh so I can like reduce the resolution even more all right I'm gonna stop tinkering around with this this is not really super relevant to what I'm trying to get at here and I'm gonna put this all back to what it was ultimately I just want to run in processing okay max pose detection x' let's keep it a single pose score threshold camera options with height okay so one of the nice things about working with runway and its models is a lot of times models have different parameters and values and things that you could tweak and change to try running it in different ways and this is really these are sort of known as paper parameters to a machine learning model and so some of them I would actually have to stop running the model and then I can start to play with it so for example this architecture one is something that I can actually make the model smaller it might be less accurate but will run faster but but but so for example I'm just gonna like change this to 0.75 instead I'm gonna run it again but some of these some of these parameters can actually be tweaked in real time so for example I can change the width and height of the image which is actually changing the resolution of the image from the webcam itself and I can you know I can make it more grayscale if I want I can do various things to actually tweak the image before it goes in but this is not the important piece of what I want to do in this video what I want to do in this video is we have a moment here where I've got a model running in runway and I'm able to play with it tweak it get it exactly the way I want it to work and I want to take that next step from having it run here to be able to see the results of it in my own piece of software so let's make that happen okay this software that I'm going to use to attempt this in is something called processing so let's let me write just in here setup I'm gonna say let me actually set all this back to default is there like a set back to default button feature request but I'm gonna set this back to 320 by 240 Oh a 320 by 181 that's good let's run it again that'll be good I just want to like have it actually let's go I just want to match the resolution let me set it back to it yes 3 640 by 360 ok Oh interesting I can mirror if I'm gonna leave it like that alright so since the size here in runway of the output is 640 by 360 what I'm gonna do in my processing code is set the size of the canvas to 3 640 by 360 to avoid draw background 0 alright so now I have a processing sketch which I am running right here how do I see the results the output of the model in my processing sketch so there are a variety of different Network protocols that runway supports and I can find out about them up here by clicking this network tab so I'm click this network tab no interesting sorry I'm like just looking at things of discovery things as I'm going so I'm gonna click this network tab and the one that I want to use for working with processing is OSC so there's a variety of different reasons why you might pick one protocol over another it really depends on what you're doing in the case of where I just want to get a single image an HTTP request would make the most sense and I'll do that in another video when I show you how to work with style gain and run way but right now I'm going to click on OSC which works pretty well with processing and it's telling me a lot of information here so it's saying hey this is the server address so this is the most important thing that I need from runway it's what I'm going to tell processing is the unique IP address which happens to be the local local IP address of this computer and the port number from which it can get the osc messages okay so I'm going to this is copy this to the clipboard and I'm gonna click here and I'm gonna do I'm gonna create a string called like IP I'm pretty sure I'm probably going to want the port number in a separate variable I'm gonna create a port number like this now I could sit here and write all the code for this which is what I usually do in Cody train videos but this is a differently different circumstance I really just want to get the example up and running and show you how to do this and one of the nice things about working with Runway is there a whole bunch of premade examples for you with different platforms and pieces of software one of which is processing so let me show you how you would actually do this in the real world how I would be doing this which is the way I'm going to do it right now so if I go to the runway ml github and I actually should go back one level and go here under runway ml you can see here's the github page for the runway software and there's a lot of information this is something you know there's some like highlevel stuff here about how to port your own machine learning model to runway itself so if you've trained your own model or you find a model that's not supported by runway how you could add it but that's not what we're really doing here what I want to look for is here processing runway and processing if I click here this repository has a whole bunch of examples of using runway with processing so you can see there's a street view one attention Gann face lane landmarks image to text and voila pose net this is the one that I'm working with so I'm going to look at this example I should say that this is an open source project processing is an open source project that I'm involved with that I've talked about in a lot of other videos so maybe this is a place where if you find another model in runway that you've made work and you want to contribute your processing example here I would encourage to do that and Chris one of the founders and creators of runway and I have been talking about making a processing library for runway and it just so happens that I have made two recent video tutorials about how to make a processing java library so I see a project in the future which is the run a processing library for a runway so if you want to get involved with that with making that you know write in the comments and let me know that they will create a github repo for that ok so I'm gonna go here under pose net and I'm just gonna click here under pose net pde so I could just copy paste the whole thing but I'm gonna kind of go piece by piece and you can see here already runway host and runway port so I made a mistake in my code where I send me this a string this should really be a number so I'll do this and there so missing one here which I'm sure everybody in the chat I already see it here the dot one is missing let's import the OSC library so I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna import the processing OSC library now am I getting any errors I'm not getting any error so I'm lucky for some reason some dime in my past I needed this library but you might not be so lucky if you go here to sketch import library add library and I search for OSC here it is oscy p5 and open sound control OSC implementation you know it looks like I haven't installed this why don't I have an error I'm just curious here for a second pause for second import library yeah I haven't installed this why didn't that give me an error interesting how there's no error here if I try it lemon well now I have to satisfy my curiosity here OSC p5 yes ok great there's my error so nevermind let me let me back up for a second here for this eventually edited version of this extra one in the port I got the port number wrong oh that one made it in there ok sorry alright let's just like back all the way up here for a second I'll redo this part so I got it Oh I'm missing the point one here which I'm sure the chat is already talking about and there's an extra one here and this should be an integer so I have and this should really be hosts so actually let me use the same variable names runway host and runway ports okay so I think I've gotten this right now now in order for the example to work I need to make sure also I have the processing OSC library installed so if I come over here I could copy paste these import statements I can copy paste this OSC object that I definitely need and we'll see very quickly that I have an error which is the class OS CP 5 does not exist this is because I haven't by are installed the processing OSC library you might have already have it installed because use it with a different project but I could go here and I can do sketch import library add library I've already I've already got it searched to you but you don't look like this for you you're gonna want to type OSCE to search for it this is a library I'm looking for OSC p5 I'm gonna click install it's going to install and now you'll see that error message goes away just taking a break here for a second all right just okay let's see where are we oh interesting I've done it this way with this properties thing that's interesting let's you won't use that set s RSP I don't even know what that is do you not that is I'm just curious let's look at the OSD p5 documentation and under examples under we just want to receive broadcast client I feel like there's an easy way to just receive send receive is the example that I usually is listen for incoming messages so I think so I wonder if this example could actually be simplified with just saying just making a sort of default OS cp5 object rather than this more this OSC properties object oh I'm really doing the same thing it's just instead of all these properties I'm just putting the port in there so I'm gonna try it and I'll come back to this if I need to see if I can simplify this example okay so let me just look here OSC new OSC yeah like I actually think you don't even need the broadcast location because you don't need to oh you're sending connect and disconnect messages so you do need the broadcast location to do that okay got it got it so there might be something I'm missing but we'll see we'll see we'll find out we'll find out I could all right so next up okay where am i processing so the next thing that I want to do is create an object to receive OSC messages and I think I could just say make this a new OSC pp5 object I need to give it a reference to this particular sketch because it's going to need to trigger events in the sketch when there's data available and then just give it the port number if you look at the this is called runway port so if you look at the runway example it's actually using this object called OSC properties which is a bit more sophisticated it says a remote address a listening port a Datagram size and some other stuff I should probably just copypaste this as an example but I'm curious if it will work with just a sort of more simplified default OS cp5 object where I just say this and the particular port but I do need this I do need a broadcast location because I'm going to have to send messages to runway as well saying I'm connected or I'm disconnected so let's take a minute to diagram this that did not turn on this cable there we go what are the pieces here there's my processing sketch which I probably sure I'm gonna write p5 for short I shouldn't do that because it's too confusing with p5.js nowadays how are you time we're getting um so there's two things that play here there's the processing software and there's the runway software they're both running locally on my computer now it's possible that in other scenarios there could also be a cloud GPU involved that runway sends messages back and forth between and this is something that I'm gonna do in the next example where I work with something called style Gann I'm going to have runway also talked to a cloud GPU but that's not happening here pose net is actually running inside of basically wrapped into runway itself locally so posing that's running here in runway locally processing is sending a message like connect like hey I want to hear information that's a one time message and then runway will just continuously send data via osc2 processing about what the pose it's detecting with the pose net model from the webcam input so if I wanted I probably could figure out a way to get the camera input into processing send the image to runway and then have runways had the results back but runway can connect to the camera directly so I might as well just do that because that's pretty pretty easy so I should also put here that the like if I make a little note here like webcam that webcam is talking to runway I might also have it talk to processing if I want to show the results in processing in a while okay so this is what's going on in this particular example so I want to create this broadcast location which is a net address object so I need to put that in here and then the first thing that I want to do is just send a connect message so I'm going to copy this in and paste it here and say connect so what I'm doing when processing starts up is it calls the function connect which creates an OSC message so all oh s see messages what's the lingo for this let me look this up there's like an address and then a value I think but somebody must explain this somewhere oscy introduction to open sound control this will give me what I'm looking for specification I just wanna know the lingo data and address I think it's just address and data so that's that's what I'm going to that's what I'm going to use you can find out more here at this URL okay every single osc message is comprised of two parts those two parts are an address which is usually denoted as a string kind of like a path and you can see this is server slash connect that's the address or you might also think of that all this is like the message name is the way I sometimes think about it and then the data now in this case there actually is no data because the address itself is the message so this is a very simplified thing where this connect message is just hey I'm connecting so the name of the message the address is itself all the only things there's no data but when runway wants to send stuff back it's gonna send the message as I forgot what the name is this is just called message maybe message keep it anyway what runways can runways sends data back it's going to have a message name like data or key points or poses something like that and then that's going to have package with it lots of data like all the exwives of all the positions of everything data is actually the name of the message so we'll come back to that okay all right so let's run this and see what happens yeah that's that's pretty good no errors we hold on I think I generally ignore all these messages that are in here address already in use that's weird I'm not gonna worry right now okay all right so let's see then alright skip that part in our nice edit now that I've connected I should probably add the disconnect message as well I don't know that we don't actually need the disconnect message because it'll disconnect I'm gonna skip that part okay now that I've connected I want to listen for messages and the way that that is done is with an event called OSC event so this is much like mousepressed or key pressed or serial event or capture event this is a function in processing that has a very special name called OSC event and the OSC p5 library knows to call that function when there's data coming in so I'm gonna just copy paste this and I'm going to put it in here and what I'm going to so let's take a look at this so there's an OSC event that has passed through it oh s see message I'll just change this to message and if the message has data so this is like its address remember that it's that address has data that's the address we're looking for oh no if it doesn't get out of here so I won't ignore any other messages coming in then what I want to do is get the data itself so the data of the message actually comes in as a string but the string is formatted as JSON which is JavaScript object notation if you don't know what JSON is I might refer you to a different video of mine that explains what JSON is JSON it works really nicely in JavaScript it's a little bit awkward to work with it in processing because processing is Java doesn't speak JavaScript natively but we're gonna make it work so the first thing in the message itself is a big string of JSON data which then is a JSON object that can be parsed with processing parse JSON object function and then I can just look at it in the console so let's see if we actually get the data in am i sending it I think I might need that other thing but I was really didn't think that I need it okay so this is happening let's see if any messages are coming in and let's run that again I have a feeling that there is something in that thing at the beginning that I wanted to skip that we need let's find out so let's go here and let me change this I think I might know what the issue is so let me go back to here and see what this does oh yeah now it's working so I have a feeling I know what it is I guess I'll come back to this in a second and try to reexplain it so why did that not work before I don't think it has anything to do with the Datagram size or this set s RSP No oh that's Oh maybe it is bigger than what it's used to yeah so I don't know what this I might be knows what this is but all right so I botched this in my attempt to want to make this simpler which I will now correct but interestingly yeah so I think it was just the size but also I think it was kind of freaking out because it was expecting the processing sketch there's like something with OS see there's a client and there's a server and I think it was expecting the processing sketch to be the server whereas really run away as the server the project sketches the client so the port is different in the oh did I also get the port run did I actually put the wrong port in there that's weird no but it says ooh weird Oh is this wrong wait what's going on oh yeah okay weird so it doesn't need the data grant the the Datagram sighs so why is this port 55 seven oh because have I just confused myself and there's two different port numbers for sending and receiving yes okay I am totally confused or I have to I have to relearn osc hold on there's there's a couple things that there's two reasons why it didn't work one is I had the wrong port number and two as I need this to be able to set the Datagram sighs so that's good we're gonna be fine this is good we're gonna I'm gonna explain this and one's gonna be super happy okay oh wait oh this is fifty two hundred wait but I did this this is what I had right okay because okay it's because they're on it's all on the same machine it has to be separate ports okay I got it now we're good I'm going to I mean if everything's gonna make sense in about ten seconds was they get myself set up here I'm gonna go back to work I wasn't getting anything I'm not getting anything and I'm wondering why and I actually know why I had to figure it out so first of all there's a clue to me here it says could not create Datagram socket port 5100 because it's already in use and I forgot there's a weird thing going on here if I were using OSC to communicate between two separate computers I could use the same port number on each separate computer because it's just one port number but here I need to be able to send data to runway at a particular port as well as receive data into processing at a different court they cannot be the same port otherwise it'll be in conflict so the port that I am broadcasting to is 5 7 100 that's what's listed in runway but the actual port that I want to receive messages at is 5 7 200 and maybe runway knows just to add 100 to it automatically behind the scenes but this is the default setup that's in runway so I need to have each of I need to have a different port for receiving the data as the port that I'm sending to and let me show you what I mean by that in the code so this is the runway port right there 57 100 that's the port that I want to broadcast to and it's part of my broadcast location that's where I'm broadcasting to but where I want to receive messages is actually 57 200 so now if I run this I'm actually receiving messages but I've got a new error array index out of bounds exception so this is a rare case where the data that runway is sent it sending for all of these poses is actually quite large and so what it needs is more space it needs a bigger packet size and so that's why in the runway example there was this extra OSC properties object which allowed setting a larger Datagram size so in the listening port is 5 7 200 so just before using osep 5 by default you don't need to do this but I'm gonna copy paste this in I'm gonna put this back here and then I am going to change this to properties and I think I now have all the pieces and what I should see is there we go a lot of stuff and look at this now I've got exactly coming into processing a confidence score for you can see the it clearly cannot see my left ankle because my left ankle is not viewable to the camera so that's why that confidence score is so low let's scroll up and do like right here it's got a very high confidence score and an x and a y for my right ear so now I'm at the point where I can actually use this data yeah not just kind of James and the chat is pointing out that not doing the disconnecting step is kind of risky but I'm gonna not worry about that right now all right gotta get to those style gain rainbows okay that's that's really what we're all here for know if I oversold it okay but I'm almost done with this so I think what I'm gonna do next is I'm gonna I'm gonna make my own example that just draws the eyes and then I'll point out that the the full example does the entire skeleton alright going back to the runway example you can see here that there's a very elaborate loop to parse through the JSON and look at all the different key points and get all the different positions of everything that it detects I'm gonna try to do something much simpler right now I'm just going to get the right eye and left eye so let's see if we can figure that out so one thing I want to do is I'm just looking here okay okay key points is an array got it so I'd have to loop oh it's it's interesting an ml five we we change the pose net API so that you could ask for something by part name and here it's an array you have to loop through it so I will gonna go through that that's fine all right that's fine I can actually might as well loop through all of them if I'm gonna do that okay okay let's hold on let me let me start that over again okay so I might actually end up doing this anyway get JSON object position okay so I'm gonna write this code okay let's now go and so one way so one way we can approach this is we can make this data variable a global variable so I'm gonna take this JSON object and I'm going to make this a global variable I'm going to call it data and then in the draw loop I'm just gonna say as long as data is not equal to no I forget that I'm in job I can just do that data will be null until it's received something from runway so as soon as it's received something from runway all I need to do now is parse this JSON let me put this in a separate file this will make it easier give me a second here let me open up visual studio code I think I can close all this other stuff and I can close this pose net JSON and this alright let's make it easier okay and then let me something I've done to make this a little bit easier is I've just taken that JSON that printed to the processing console and I've pasted it pasted it into a pasted it into a JSON file that I can look up look at Visual Studio code just so I have something to reference to for so I know that I need to get something called poses so the first thing that I want is the poses array so only thing that's really weird and processing with JSON is you have to specify whether the data you're looking at is a JSON object or a JSON array and this poses data is an array as indicated by this square bracket so I'm gonna say JSON array poses equals data get JSON array string poses and let me just say then I'm going to then I want to get the key points array oh because there could be more than one pose but I'm gonna assume that's just one pose so actually what I hold so what what I could do actually is just say so then that's the poses so then I'm gonna say the key points are also an array equal poses dot get 0 so that would be the first element of the array now get a new array called key points get JSON array key points okay so this the good news is the runway example has all this in there so if I get it wrong key points what's the error I've got the function Jade get JSON or a string does not exist poses oh because oh I have to get get JSON object index 0 sorry I have an error here because I can't just say get element 0 what is element 0 it's a JSON object there we go so now I have the key points which are the JSON array called key points in the first JSON object index 0 then what kind of what do I want to look for whoops so now I'm in the key points array this is element 0 if I knew like left left Oh left this is easy let's do nose left eye and right eye 0 1 & 2 perfect so I want to get sorry I want to get JSON object nose equals key points get JSON object 0 will do will do 3 of these left eye I'm doing this a little bit different than the runway example and on point you the runway example after right eye now certainly I could use a loop here so nose I keep going to the wrong place nose left eye right eye and then I need to get the position object nose pause equals nose get JSON object I should just do the nose I'm just gonna do the nose just to keep things simpler here you can you can extrapolate figure out how to do the left eye and the right eye nose get JSON object position and then x equals I'm gonna call it snows position nose position get X pretty sure this is right and y equals nose position get Y all right let's see what have I gotten wrong here get float again I'm in Java I've got to specify the type so if I've done everything correctly I've gotten the all the key points of the first I've gotten the object with all the data for the nose then I can get the nose position out of that object and the X&Y out of that object whew now I'm gonna say ellipse X Y 2020 and let's make it a red nose fill to 5500 let's give this a run and there we go I am now controlling my nose from runway into processing with OSC messages amazing okay so this really concludes this particular video tutorial certainly what you might want to do is see the entire skeleton you know to use pose net effectively you really want to have the camera probably around six feet from you you want to back up and allow it to see your full form you can also pass the images and get the pose the skeleton off from an image there's lots of different things you can do but and certainly I would recommend that you check the example in the runway github repo itself which has a nice loop to go through all of the different positions and actually it also has this little mapping to map what all the connections are between them for the actual skeleton skeleton itself so as a little exercise you know see if you can expand what I did to have the right eye and the left eye but even so you can just go get the runway example itself so but this is a guiding principle for how any particular model that you might find in runway itself someone in the chat was just asking about dense pose for example that you can communicate from runway via OSC to processing but in a lot of other cases you might want to use WebSockets or an HTTP connection to communicate particularly if you're working in the browser with JavaScript so what I'm gonna do in the next video if you want to watch is run style gand to generate a rainbow image and then pass that image into p5 and render it the browser itself oh and breaking news from the chat Damion writes SRS P stand for send and receive on the same port by default OSC packets are not received and sent by the same port if you need to send a receiver on the same port oh so maybe I could have actually done something with the port numbers I have no idea I'm sure people were right about it in the comments but this code works and the code in the runway can have repository works so have fun use it make something with it please share it with me and hope you enjoyed this tutorial about processing runway and the pose net model running locally on your computer goodbye okay this is officially scheduled to be a twohour live stream which means we got about 20 minutes left this rainbow I mean I probably go a little long which is fine that's always happened but I'm gonna do the style game rainbows so I can use the same port so in that case I wonder what I wonder where that other port in is happening in runway do you know Chris is it like automatically configuring it to be like 100 up of this server address that's the default you have in runway like okay so in future releases of runway you'll be able to edit the port as well okay in beta yeah great by the way if this isn't blowing your mind you haven't tried to run into this machinery it's really no my tears asking do I have a flu no I can't this like nervous tic with the longer I live stream the more I start to get the sniffles but I last time I was sick I had a cold but today I don't all right let me stop this from running let me go back to models let me close out of I'm gonna save this quit processing if you have questions you can ask them now I'm going to do one more example and I'm actually gonna do this I'm the p5 web editor because I have done that before shoot I changed the oh you logged me in perfect I changed the password at some point okay so usually I take like a break but I think I'll just keep going but I'll take a short little break to read the chat format we'll be doing the next one any moment now if you have questions I asked them to check so I'll answer will answer a few questions yes so I think that I'm noticing the chat some people are saying like oh I'm gonna need to watch this twice to understand what's going on this is jampacked I love it which is a nice thing to say it's kinda this is a bit did a little bit different than some of my live streams in the sense that I'm you know I have to use runway before I used it in a presentation at the i/o conference I've used it in in some workshops and things that I don't know that I've taught why don't I talk about I totally attended workshops at ITP using runway and I've played around with a bit by myself but I really think of this live stream is kind of like a first exploration of runway and then I might come back I certainly will come back in the fall and do some specific tutorials that are part of my machine learning course that I'm going to teach with runway as well as with ml5 GS and tensorflow Jas and other platforms but I think that I also might also be interested think about what would be most useful in terms of a sort of sequence tutorial series about runway and whether that's I'm making it or that runway itself as a company might release one but this really is meant to be somewhat exploratory and so your feedback about like what makes sense and what's working for you after you try it is really useful for me and also probably also more importantly for the runway company what's the best place for people if they want to ask questions or give feedback on after today the slack channel is the best place so if you want to I if you want to join the slack Channel I'm gathering that somewhere on the website here there'd be a link under resources of the footer okay oh yeah so here is where you want to go down to the footer and click here on slack to join the slack channel and that's a place where you can ask questions and get support and you know you know you can also of course post issues and contribute on github itself but if you're beginner a new user to the software slack it's a great place to do that okay all right I think it's time now to do the last tutorial I almost want to consider this like a coding challenge video but we'll keep this I think we'll keep this as a playlist about runway Simon is making a good suggestion which also could be Simon you could pull request this I'm sure to the runway github repo that instead of using 99.999999 there's a variable builtin variable backs into Duramax ins to get the maximum space most probably what we be best would be to find out what's the exact amount of spaces either so that you don't waste your space but whatever works all right it's just let's go let's so I need to be here and I need the web editor that's it all I need is that in the web editor okay and my brain to understand how to do this okay okay oh and I had a slide let me pull this up this might this is gonna take me a minute let me pull this up oh here's to oh this is lucky here's the starter code alright so let's see I want to I my mind just completely went blank I have no idea what I'm doing but I was looking for something oh I know what I was looking for I was just gonna come up automatically IO presentation uhoh slides oh there we go perfect so my IO presentation had some slides about various things including runway and this is what I want to have so if I do this I'll just I'll just I'll just reference this like this that's fine so I just want to I'll mention this when I come to it okay okay so I think I have everything I need right now let's start with this I'm actually logged in as something here let's see if there's a really good one I like this one I don't know the first ones probably good enough this one's kind of nice alright ready for this coding challenge okay oh can I just like hold on a sec I feel a need to do something go away trends there we go thank you just don't wanna see that I don't want for the all of perpetuity anybody comes to watch this video about style gain rainbows for them to be the like obnoxious Twitter trends from you know arbitrary date of today whatever's happening in the news that's horrible okay here we go this will be the last last part of today's livestream but after I finished making this we'll have some time for some questions afterwards okay okay hello and welcome to a coding challenge making style gam rainbows wait wait hold on no generating oneiza were generating hello and welcome to a coding challenge generating style gain rainbows with a runway ml and passing those two p5 GS to display them in the browser for our delight and so this is this is basically and making a version of software that I built for the IO Festival the talk that I gave at the IO Festival will be out on the Internet at some point soon and if it is I will include a link to it in this video's description where I generally had people play a game on stage and when they finished the game on AI rainbow is generated and tweeted to the IO rainbows on Twitter account so I'm gonna build a little mini version of this today so the and so the primary tool that's gonna do the generating of the rainbows is something called runway ml so this is the first coding challenge that I'm using with runway and I've talked in a couple other videos in a livestream more about what runway is how to download and install and how to sign up for an account how to get some free credits and that sort of thing so I'll refer you to that video if you want to find more so but if you have runway downloaded find a link to download in the description if you're if you've signed up for an account and you're on the Browse models page you will find yourself here and where you want to go next is you want to look for style again now I see style gained right here but just in case you don't I could type it in up here under browse models I could click here this is now giving me generate photorealistic images of faces landscape and more there's more information about the license for style gaen credits about who created and authored the original style game paper that you can find out about but I just want to use style again so I'm gonna click Add to workspace and if you don't have a workspace already you can click new workspace I have one called coding train livestream and then Here I am now I can generate a variety of types of things with style can and these are known as checkpoints so there are checkpoints you can see for cars and landscapes and portrait wouldn't it be nice if there was a checkpoint for rainbows and guess what there is so I'm gonna click the rainbows checkpoint then I'm gonna choose the input source which is just going to be a vector and I'll talk about what that is in a little bit as I get to writing some code to do this and then what I want to do is click run remotely so this is very important for me to be clear this requires cloud credits that you have to pay for if you sign up through the link in this video's description there you can also you'll get free ten dollars in credits and there's actually a coupon code coding train which you can get an additional ten dollars in credits as well so that's certainly enough to run this example okay and there's also in the future there this I think this is wait timeout for a second this model only runs remotely yes I'll just say some models in run way you can run locally on your computer without using cloud credits but this one in particular just runs only runs remotely at the at the moment so I'm gonna click run remotely it's running so I'm gonna give it some time to start up so generally it's always slow and you're first starting the model because it's got it kind of like boot up the instance also whenever you're alive streaming on YouTube it takes five times as long as when you're just sitting at your computer by yourself but that's the way the world works all right so now we see it starting to populate and this is what's known up here as the latent space this sort of space of imaginary rainbows that this generative model is producing and this is one of the reasons why I love using runway is that I can actually just kind of browse around this space and look for I kind of have this 2d view of this multidimensional world of all of these rainbows and I can do things like oh I really like this one and I could just change the output here to preview and so I can see it here and I can download this one and I have now have my beautiful style game generated rainbows but what if I want to have these rainbows in my own software if I wanted to show them on a web page or if I want to tweet them from my Twitter BOTS or any other type of thing that you might be making whether it's JavaScript or processing or openFrameworks or some other piece of software that you want to connect to runway the way that you do that is through talking to run way over the network so over here in the bottom I'm sorry in the top right there's a network tab if I click on this it's showing me a variety of different options I can communicate with runway over OSC this is something I did in a another video tutorial communicating with processing and runway over OSC to demonstrate the pose net model for detecting human skeletal poses I could also use socket IO for realtime WebSockets but really what I want to do is just an HTTP connection I want to make an HTTP request I want to post some data to runway and I want to receive the image back and in fact there's JavaScript code right here out of the box that I could copy and paste so I encourage you to just actually go and grab this JavaScript code and make your own example but I'm gonna do this using the built in p5 function HTTP POST so I'm gonna write my own code for doing this referencing everything that's here under the HTTP option that all is correct so far I think looking at the chat alright next get data I'm gonna post a query I'm gonna post to the query route and then that will return the image and this is what I need to post the array and a truncation number I forget what truncation is what's it's like a it's it's kind of like how crazy it is yeah okay let's see all right my next step then is to go to the browser and I'm going to write this code in the p5 web editor so first thing that I might do is let's make a let's make sure this is running this works okay great let's make a button Create button and I'm gonna call that button rainbow and I'm gonna attach that button to an event called whoops let me hit stop here for a second generate rainbow so when I run it a button will appear rainbow and then presumably when I click the button a function called generate rainbow will be executed so I need to write that function and in that function this is where I want to send my request to runway itself so I need to make an HTTP POST so I probably want to look at the HTTP POST this is a p5 specific function you could use fetch I have some video tutorials about how to use the fetch function to make a post request and you could do that here but I'm gonna use p5 in this example so I'm gonna go to the HTTP POST reference page on p5 and this is gonna show me the stuff that I need to include in the post request ok I'm just looking at this so here's the stuff that I need I need a path where am i posting this to I need a data type which is what kind of data am i sending along with this post request and then any parameters data that needs to go along with the post request as well as the callback and the error callback for getting information back so this is a nice I just take this and bring this into my code I'm just gonna leave this put this in the comments right here as a reminder so what are the things the path is let's go look at runways telling me this it's actually this the server address localhost port 8000 so I'm gonna paste that in here the data type is JSON that's the kind of data then the data I'm sending is what now this is also given to me by runway and I need to I'm standing a little bit in front of my code here let me just move this over so this is the data I need to send to runway and runways telling me about that here input specification what does it expect it expects field called Z which is an array of 512 floats what is that and then it requires some other value called truncation what is that so if you wanted to dive deeply into this input specification you would probably want to do some more research on the style gain model itself look at the paper look at the github repo and kind of understand more about the neural networks architecture and its parameters its hyper parameters that control its behavior but I whoops for some reason have lost I'm gonna get the whiteboard and I think I'm gonna talk about vectors for a second to understand this by the way how do you create the 2d latent space is it with like teeth knee or some kind of like like clustering algorithm like that genetic genetic algorithms oh that's the greatest thing I ever heard okay I'll come back to that all right I think it's worth though in for a moment taking a minute in this video tutorial to talk about what this Z is because it's a very important concept in machine learning so there is this machine learning model called style Gann and it needs some kind of input in order to generate some kind of output now the output that it generates is an image 512 by 512 I mean ultimately what it's outputting is just a whole lot of numbers but those numbers can be interpreted as colors of pixels and repackaged into the image so that's happening for you by runway right we're seeing the output of it right here packaged as an image but what's the input I mean ultimately I don't in this particular example I don't care about the input I just don't give me a rainbow give me a rainbow give me a rainbow but in order for the model to generate a rainbow it's got to start from somewhere and in essence I could start with something random but what that random thing that I want to start with is is something called a vector referred to as Z and what it is is 512 numbers so I have this list of 512 numbers probably between 0 and 1 between negative 1 and 1 between 0 & 1 so generally inputs to neural networks are normalized with some range and in this in a way this is like a unique signature for a particular output so if I want to just get any socalled output I can just make up a list of random numbers and I would always get the same exact rainbow with the same set of numbers so we can see that happen right if I fix the set of numbers I'll always get the same output but what I could do is tweak these numbers a little bit dial sum up dial sum and that's going to change the output if you've ever and that's what you're seeing here in this space what you're seeing here is rainbows with that are attached to given Z inputs and runway is being very clever about showing you similar ones in a twodimensional flat space on a computer screen but actually all of those rainbows that are generating live in 512 dimensional space so that's kind of crazy and mindblowing and very confusing you know I think I have a video tutorial where I do something with fourdimensional space and I can barely understand that but this is kind of the weirdness of working in machine learning it's you could imagine a threedimensional space would just be full of rainbows in 3d like all over this room there'd be rainbows everywhere 2d it's just like on a poster like look at all the rainbows but the only way to actually literally organize all of the rainbows generated by style again would be to have them all sitting at 512 dimensional space not a thing we can understand as human beings so that's why runway cleverly organizing them for you to look at in twodimensional space it's quite useful but you could kind of walk through that space right I could do a random walk from vector to vector to vector in that five dimensional space to produce an animation of kind of morphing changing rainbows and that's something you should really do after you watch this video and share it with me because I would love to see that okay but now that I've explained this let's go back here now a little more context about this for any one of these if I really like this particular rainbow I can actually get that Z vector let me see if I can grab it and we're doing it under export no I just look at it like right click here on options where is it oh this this wait wait wait oh here oh no here right here right here okay sorry sorry sorry sir Oh import or export okay so let me come back to the hugs pretend I know where it is so it's amazing here is with this particular rainbow this one that I liked I can actually go right here and I can download that 500 those 512 numbers let me do that and click this I'm gonna click it correctly there we go looks oh wait it downloaded sorry so let me click this and you can see it's saved to this directory which let me find on my computer oh where do i click envelope oh the but i have it has two like i have to catch it I'm really bad at using a computer let me try that again make it very seamless for the edited version of this video so let me come up Oh was I saying so one of the wonderful things about this interface also is that over here I can export that vector itself so if I click this here let me try that again oh I stopped the model oops ah what's happened no I'm falling apart let me restart runway and I'm gonna go to open workspaces it's good for us to see all these different parts of runway I'm back here we run remotely what's it we're running something I didn't run the Spade one no here hi this one got it so if this happens to you oh this is blocked because I didn't realize you can't see it here I should have been doing a screen capture but that's okay your if I go down here like I'm Chu Chu I'll just take myself off for a second if you this happens to you and you go you can click here on your profile and then you can go here and click a stop all running models which is what I just did by the way I haven't even spent a dollar miss entire live stream which it's really amazing ok so now let me go back to here I really wanted to show the vector which is kind of like not that important because I'm going to generate random ones but okay so let me go to here there we go there we go um is it not in the workspace no wait I need to go here sorry then I need to go here it perfect I need to say run got it oh we get this back up and running again I can also just find that where does it where does it download stuff your downloads directory or your documents or sort of like a runway folder so that is oh here users coding train documents got it so let me actually put this on the desktop and then I'll put it here and their favorites so that will make things work really well I disappeared I know I disappeared I haven't put myself back yet thank you for reminding that me though okay so anything is asking can you even connect to run away from the browser wouldn't Chrome not allow that it works there's no reason you can make a request HTTP requests of the server running localhost on your computer I haven't had a problem doing that yet we'll find out okay so let me go back to I am in my settings how do I close out of here if I close this what's going on here I think it's trying to stop everything still okay hold on let's try it one more time and open workspace style gam rainbows run remotely oh the save folder I didn't actually change it try that oh yeah I didn't actually change it to run way open there we go and then go back to here and there we go ooh I like this one oh wow that's wild oh I like these curvy ones especially that's pretty cool though alright so now okay alright and then I'm gonna go here all right this will be a little 510 okay so one of the nice things about if I'm working in runway and I find a rainbow that I really like for example oh I can zoom in and out that's nuts this one's kind of crazylooking if I like this one oh look at this strange double rainbow so let's use this one so I like this one I can actually click here and export that vector those 512 numbers as JSON itself so if I click here and I click back here I can see this is it this is that JSON file so I'm just gonna go do like I'm gonna call this rainbow JSON let's actually go to the web editor this is sort of nuts what I'm doing but why not let's add a file then I'm gonna drop this file in here and then I'm gonna look at this and we can see look this is just that array of numbers and actually why why even bother making it a separate JSON file because I'm just gonna say Const Z equals this array so I actually just literally copy pasted that array of numbers looks like by the way it's between negative 1 and 1 into into my processing sketch so I'm gonna call this rainbow Z that now where was I I was somewhere I was over here in runway because what I wanted to do was send that array of 512 floats as the Z property in the data that I'm sending so I'm gonna do Z rainbow Z and then I need truncation so truncation is a hyper parameter I'd spelled that totally wrong associated with style Gann if you want to learn more about truncation you know that's something you probably just want to read about in the paper itself but it kind of changes the craziness way of the rainbow that you're gonna get and it's a number I believe that is a number between and one and I think the default that's being used right now my guess is that's 0.5 so it's possible I'm actually gonna get a different rainbow out if I'm wrong about that truncation number but now I have the data then I need a callback and an error callback so I want to post to a path I want to post that data type you know this is sort of silly to have this separate variable here I can just put a JSON right in here then I want to post that data and I want to say got rainbow or you know got error so I need two callbacks so now I want to say function got rainbow data and let's just console.log the data to see if it comes back from runway all right we're gonna run this I'm gonna click the rainbow button got errors not too fine okay fine I need to define the got error function got error error console dot log error this is so good for some error checking okay now I'm gonna press this button oh I got an error what did I get wrong let's see oh I'm running the model oh I know what I got wrong I found what I got wrong so the server address is localhost port 8000 but I want to make a post request to the query route so this is actually what I need as the URL path so I'm gonna copy this go back to my code we're gonna hope that this fixes it I'm gonna put that in here slash query now I'm gonna hit rainbow look at that so it console.log something what in the world if I know you might not believe this but this is actually a rainbow right here this is the strangest looking text version of a rainbow but what's actually happening there I'm getting an object only it's got an image in it but the image is just this sequence of all these characters so this has to do with base64 encoding let's go back to run way to make sure I'm right about this you can see this is the output an image and that image is a base64 image so this is a particular way that images can be encoded here's one way that an image could be encoded the first pixel is a lot of red a little bit of blue you know I could say start like describing the image to you pixel by pixel or I could include an array of numbers that has the red value the green value the blue value but it so happens that what we could do is cleverly take every color of the image and assign it to a character in like 64bit character encoding by the way I keep seeing these like alarm bells going off but there's nothing wrong that was a message from a while ago I talked about base64 encoding the whole other video let me just pull that up here I don't need to go on and on about base64 encoding yeah six bit base fixed 64 digits anyway I don't let me I said 64 bit which is absolutely wrong so I want to double back and not say that base64 encoding it first of all this is something that I've used it a couple other videos where I've explained this more thoroughly so I'll link to that in the video's description but essentially it's just a way of encoding all the colors of an image as ASCII characters so instead of having numbers for the colors we have unique characters that that correspond to certain color values the nice thing about using base64 is the web speaks base64 so I can create an image very easily in javascript in p5 with the base64 encoding of the image so rather than console.log that let me try to do that I'm going to go back to my and that you could read more also about it on the base64 Wikipedia page but let me go back here and I'm just gonna say create image data image so the property of the image property that of the data object that's coming back from run where has the base64 encoding in it and p5 s create image function knows how to turn that into an image element that will appear on the webpage so let me bring this over here let me run this again let me hit rainbow and there it is look and it's the same one it's the same one because I gave it this exact vector but what what might be more interesting here is why not make a random one each time so I'm gonna do this when I post I'm going to create a I'm gonna create a variable called rainbow Z which is an empty array I'm gonna loop all the way up to 512 and I'm gonna say rainbow Z index I is a random number between negative 1 and 1 and that's going to be the rainbow Z so now every time I get a rainbow press the rainbow button it will be a different one so now I'm getting rain random rainbows now here's the thing they're kind of just by default making all these Dom elements maybe what I want to do is actually draw them onto the canvas so maybe I'll make the canvas they happened to be 512 by 512 so I'll make the canvas 512 by 512 what I'll do is put this in a variable called rainbow image I could push them into an array to save them then I'm gonna say rainbow image hide so we don't actually see it but I'll draw it on to the canvas so now what this is doing is it's creating the image Dom element from the base64 encoding hiding it from the Dom and then drawing it onto the canvas so every time I press this rainbow button what did I do let's not hide it oh I think I might know what the problem is Oh Oh silly JavaScript and your asynchronous nature you I think I can't draw the image right here because it's not actually ready yet so what I think that I'll do since I happen to have a draw loop is I'll move this here and I will make this a global variable that I will declare at the top you know this is I could do this in other ways and then I'll just check as long as rainbow image exists I will draw it so now this should give me every time I click the rainbow button oh and I still want to hide it Oh every time I click the rainbow button I get a new style gand generated rainbow right here in p5 chess in the web editor being generated front runway from the cloud oh we should do a diagram before I go where's the eraser here it is this camera still on alright let's review all the pieces in this example because there are a lot of them so I have my own laptop that's sitting there on the table over there and there is the web browser running that's the thing that's running and there is also the software run way that's running now Runway has spun up a local server at localhost 8000 is actually making requests to the p5 web editor server which don't necessary have to do I could just develop my JavaScript locally but I'm actually writing my JavaScript code from the p5 web jazz editor but it is executing and running that code locally in the browser so this is kind of not a super important point but it makes a post request to run way so when it makes the code makes a post request to runway runway in turn runs on the the style gaen model on a cloud GPU you need to have credits to do that that is returned back to runway the resulting rainbow and then sent back to p5 and rendered in the browser diagram didn't turn out like I imagined it would be more interesting but these are the pieces p5 and runway are both running locally and they are but but the actual style game model is running on a runway server in the cloud that you have access to through your account now at some point you might realize well what if I wanted to create a website where that would show style gain rainbows I mean you you can't run run way locally on your laptop but then a website that's deployed somewhere else how would you manage that so if somebody opens up your p5 sketch it won't work unless they're running run way themselves on their local computer but stay tuned I know that runway is developing features to be able to deploy your server that's running the style game model to like a you know permanent URL in the cloud somewhere that you could then have your your JavaScript programming accessing that other people could run without having to install runway themselves so that's the thing that you could stay tuned and follow in the future development of runway um the other thing that's really important for me to mention here is that this style gaen model doesn't just exist by accident so the style gaen architecture is something that comes from the original style gaen paper and pretrained model and then one of the creators and founders of runway honest Ossus hi my name is Jeremiah eNOS I'll say that again honest honest are you watching I should I should do well of Greek names but I don't um one of the founders and creators of runway honest us is Jeremiah neatest actually trained a particular check point for style Gann with rainbows and these worked this was trained with 5,000 images tagged with the word rainbow keyword sorted from relevance from the Flickr API using this scraping code to scrape from Flickr from Sam Levine anti boredom on github so if you want to find out more about training your own check point with style Gann I would refer you to these resources which I'll include in the video's description okay so what are you gonna do with this I hope that you use this style game rainbow model for something fun but more likely hopefully what you're taking away from this is the fact that you can write JavaScript code that connects to run way running a machine learning model that's actually running in the cloud it could be writing locally also depending on which model using from runway if it supports that and then get send a post request connect via WebSockets connect via OSC all sorts um some network connection to runway get the results back and use that in your own web application I would love to see people figure out interesting ways like how would you not how would you generate the rainbow vectors in such a way that you're kind of doing a random walk through that latent space that's five to 512 dimensional space so that's something you could really think about and play with and render something out perhaps you might not even need to use JavaScript you might be able to do this even more you know from processing for example but if you make something with this please share go to the kodi trade calm the coding challenge page associated with this particular example which you'll find link to in this video's description and may we fill the world with more and more generated rainbows see you soon good bye so okay so I've got one question here from Nathan in the chat which who asks why not send the image directly as binary data instead of as base64 in a JSON response good I'm reading the expression on Chris's face and I think the answer perhaps so you could tell me if I'm wrong here is good idea I think base64 is probably chosen as a kind of standard a web standard a convention it's very easy to pass around because you have you're able to take so much information impact packet into one character but I could imagine there are other scenarios where you might want that binary data so that could potentially be a future feature of Runway and I would encourage you to join the flack channel and suggest it there what other questions do people have so I think we can take maybe five or ten minutes here to to answer any questions you can ask them the chat Chris can type them directly or I don't want to just at least come and wave hello people could see your face or he could come up an answer I think my mic will pick him up but we could take a few questions before I go yes Chris can you hear Chris if he talks yeah so we'll see that in the chat so let's see so if you are in this for for coding train members or patrons there's a slack channel you can ask stuff in there which I'm looking at and also keeping an eye on the YouTube chat now this is the awkward thing where we just stand around because there are 30 seconds behind I'm thinking of deployment won't that open up to other people spending all your credit yes no we're working on ways of deploying your models to production so you won't spin your credit so will work in a different way and then way you have like a remote URL that will always be able for you until you kind of think stop it and then we'll be different from running okay yeah but in a way it's no different than if you have to like spin up a web server for your web application and you have to pay hosting fees for that this is just like sort of new kind of hosting GPU fee that you have to pay to run your web application but ideally there will be in the you know as many open source or ways to run your own so like reduce that cost or make it sustainable for independent Cree and as an artists I think that's something that runway is working towards which is different than what you know large corporations can do with their giant server farms would you use Perlin noise for that Oh interesting I don't know what you're asking exactly but generating the inputs with Perlin noise could be kind of interesting it's not that you wouldn't what what you might discover from that I would think of it less as like you're using the Perlin noise space to fill a vector but you might use Perlin noise to move from one vector to another so that you're just like subtly changing all the individual values a little bit so your next rainbow is pretty similar to the previous one but that would be like a way of having a random another way of thinking about a random walk somebody asked for like recommendations of books to learn machine learning you have any of it we're really helpful for you I do know why you're thinking I do know that there's I don't know if it's out already or if you could just uh but there's one that's the deep learning with tensorflow J s book that's like I think you can get the like book the meat which is like the yeah deep learning with JavaScript so I think this book is coming now oh and the Python version is excellent so there's a Python version by francois la the creator of chaos which i have definitely used that's been excellent okay whoa spin for a chance to win all right let's do it everybody manning publications not a sponsor boy they're so good with our advertising techniques I got 50% off not entering my email sorry Manny okay any other questions so let's see what other things do I want to say before we go so number one if you have more questions about runway or you want to teach a workshop with runway or you want to get involved with runway apply for a job contribute to some of the open source components of runway then I would suggest I'm going to show you again signing up here under slack what do I get if I click on community okay okay yeah if you happen to be in the New York City area runway hosts periodically meetups at their offices that I've been to at least 50% of them and it was pretty awesome so I highly recommend keeping an eye on that I know that the School of Law I think is using oh yeah is it this bots 1 so this is an independent artist run school in I believe based in Berlin that is currently running a workshop I think inning she is teaching it who you might have remember from previous episodes of the coding train it's teaching that and then it looks like there's another upcoming one in Amsterdam whoo July do I have time to make it to Amsterdam by next week I would be awesome I can't this month is so crazy we gotta gotta move ITP to a new building but and then this was the runway Meetup that was in Brooklyn and there's some other ones listed here so yeah let's see can yer it's a good good fella's book is free Thank You K week Vaughn do you think your random walker tutorial would be useful for 512 dimensions yes so ultimately what I'm suggesting and I haven't tried this and I'm certainly not an expert on generating you like artistic renderings of you know machine learning models generating images in Layton States but if you want to actually look at some artists who do this really beautifully memo Aachen is one that comes to my mind I don't know if just on his homepage if stuff will come up instant instantly but he I'm a I machine learning maybe is where I would want to click here but this is definitely an artist who's done a lot of work in that area I know that yg is an ITP current student in my recent video about the ITP show had a project with AI generated cats like a little movie generated cats and Layton space but all that is to say that the random walk which takes an XY point and adds random numbers to the X and random numbers to the Y to get the next point all you need to do is apply that same thinking to 512 X Y Z u V but we're gonna run out of letters so just think of instead of x and a y as an array of two numbers but instead of an array of two numbers an array of 512 numbers that's the right idea right and probably you could do some interesting things about wandering that space and coming back to where you started so that you could create a sort of perfect loop so there could be ways of thinking about doing that and gene Kogan is on also I I sort of like didn't reference gene Cogan because that's kind of like but of course but you might not be from ml for a ml for a website has a lot of tutorials and resources I'm not sure if any of these are currently using runways some of them are but this is a really amazing resource for getting started with machine learning for artists in theory if I can get my act together I'm teaching a course at NYU it's an undergraduate course called introduction to machine learning for the Arts and so I'll be going through a lot of different projects with primarily with the main things I'm going to use are tensorflow J s ml v GS and runway so hopefully I'll be making more possibly with the YouTube learning playlist which I need to talk about before I go so I'm just looking for how to access Mouse code for Mac sorry old fire craft I'm not sure exactly what you're asking I'm also unfortunately trying to limit the questions now to runway related stuff but that's a really great question you could ask at discourse processing org and you're always welcome to tweet me a link to your post or post a link to your post in a comment that I can take a look at it as well update on the promo code what's that referring to Neath and I don't know what that's referring to the promo code is just coding train if you're asking for the promo code for runway okay okay so uh so thank you Chris so much for being here there are many other people who are involved with runway and community and developing a design so check out the runway website to find out all those people and yeah the chat will run for a little while let the music play and let the livestream go for a little bit so Chris will still be in the chat if you have questions um the last thing that I want to mention before I go which is super exciting I wasn't able to say this before because it wasn't publicly announced but let's see if this happened so I'm gonna go to the home page for the coding train and I'm just gonna like arbitrarily click on look at this this is new it's actually set this here full learning playlist so there's a new feature on YouTube called learning playlist it's in beta I was in the learning playlist beta to create some of my to put some of my existing content into the learning playlist but more notably probably worse where's the pop pop I don't want popular uploads Owen uploads this particular this particular set of videos that were from the working with data and api's and JavaScript playlists are part of learning plan so I just want to show you some of these features I'm not logged in because I YouTube premium so I don't have to watch these ads that I've always tried to be logged in nope lean go on you can do it no it's showing the path did you all see that that's the words I click the eye and I just showed my vest I do this constantly I really have to chip that's bad hold on how do I change my Google password just be nice people please don't ruin the internet for all of us security oh I do it let you step verification that's the one account that I don't actually have it in good success I changed my password before any of you can you know what's so great about the 30 second lag no wonder you weren't able to hack it you didn't see it oh geez what a nightmare oh now my email is up oh no button where the screams not on okay great well I'm glad I have this button okay here we are back on YouTube and you could see now that there's this link here learning playlist and also browse all learning so one thing I'll point out if you go to that this is YouTube's learning channel with a lot of other learning playlist I definitely would recommend this one from Jibril's about everything you need to start programming it's pretty awesome somewhere on here maybe I'm featured if I'm lucky introduce oh there I am code program with p5 yes if you like this learning playlist or you just want to like be nice to me you could tweet at like they're really like you could tweet with the hashtag I don't know YouTube learning I think are @yt creators say how much you like the coding trains new learning playlists or something that you like beg for this kind of stuff on the internet it's very very unbecoming of me but anyway so I I'm excited about this feature if I click on it you can see there's a new interface so the course trailer pops up here you can see the different sections are divided showing you how many videos there are on actually I you know you can save it so it'll like keep track of you in it what are your progress in the in the course or the playlist and so I recommend you taking a look at those oh it's interesting it's my intro to code one that's featured there and actually crazily where's that YouTube blog so if I go to Twitter and I go to it's kind of blew my mind even though nobody noticed it somewhere here learning playlists boy they tweet too much there's this whole like VidCon conference that I completely missed here it is so here if you go to this tweet and you click on here umm this official blog from YouTube from Thursday July 11th if you read this through then you read about all this other nonsense stuff and look at this there's this chemistry course from Hank green you can see the screenshot of the learning playlist you can click right here this is this is the experience I had read August love cuz it's like oh cool they're announcing the learning playlist oh and they're featuring chemistry oh and a working in Java playlist oh cool they're featuring a programming one I wonder who made a Java playlist because I certainly did make a Java playlist let me click on this link to find out what YouTube channel has a java learning to code in Java playlist so then I clicked on that link and it took me here and I was like wait no oh I must have missed clicked because this is my playlist and it's JavaScript let me go back to that and let me click again and then I ended up here and I realized oh they actually linked to my playlist on the official YouTube blog but they kind of got the topic wrong but that's fine I'm not one to complain thank you for linking to be may be very happy alright nobody has my email nobody's reading my email nobody has my password right we're good can you let me know in the chat if you've hacked my account I'm just gonna check just gonna check really quickly it's funny I have to factor on for everything and I think I'm gonna turn that on right except for my Daniel at coding training account because I don't actually use that one but apparently now I do use it so I'm gonna go to security I'm gonna turn on you don't mind you ask questions about runway in the chat but it's gonna be here doing my twofactor authentication I'm turning that on now too so this doesn't happen in the future no can you hear that Oh your password was changed less than an hour ago I guess I'll have to do it later okay so if your password was changed less than an hour ago it doesn't let you add twofactor authentication that's fine you should really use a password manager go back and find an old video on the coding train that had a sponsor that was a password manager because I've never seen this before your password has changed less than an hour ago and find that affiliate link it's not an affiliate link it's just a link whatever okay that's right okay I'll be able to cut that out very quickly later all right so unfortunately this live stream is now ending and I'm gonna have to make it fit very briefly it's like that YouTube let lets you like cut out a frame and goodbye thank you for watching I will see you later uh so I don't know when I'm coming back stay tuned to my Twitter stay tuned to other stuff check out the community tab if you're if you're a member or patreon I've got some stuff that I'm thinking about changing the rewards program so stay tuned I hope to see you in a future livestream look for some of the new videos coming out soon and I will I might be back but I will definitely oh no I definitely will be back but I might not be back until late August or early September but if you see a notification pop up that there's a livestream that means I'm doing a special surprise livestream so see you soon and good bye everybody
