now here do you see me here do you see me here I'm live in two places at once on YouTube or this is not working I have no idea what's GNA happen is it the same URL or is this one just going to take over um someone please let me know what's going on uh it's working fine on both fantastic okay so um we'll just keep so people are asking what is this other live stream I don't know which one you are that's the thing man whoa um I don't know there's two live streams going on one is the camera that I'm talking to you directly right here this is my usual live stream that's going out through a computer down there through wirecast onto YouTube over here I'm talking to you right now you are my phone hi phone you are broadcasting through the YouTube mobile app what before I started you this camera over here I did this camera over here and I walked it around to show a walkthrough of my studio this eventually will end and they'll both be archived um so do you see the phone you see the phone I don't know what's going on okay um so I don't know I'm I'm like surrounded by computer screens and cameras I'm going a little bit crazy uh yeah the phone live stream does not seem to have a delay on it which is kind of amazing and this one uh really does seem to have a quite a big delay as it always has had okay um where will you hear the train whistle where will the train whistle go okay first thing first which is not the first thing but the last thing or the the not last thing I need to uh quit this silly thing I need to go onto up I'm there I need to uh get my soundboard uh for those of you who are on the uh this is a very ancient old iPad that I dug out of the closet at home uh and and if I turn it on and go to airplay this is me continuing now my walkthrough of the studio last step ah how come that's not oh it must be logged onto the wrong WiFi network hold on everyone I'm going to go to settings oh this is terrible what time is it by the way 609 okay oh no I'm on the right WiFi I'm not going to worry about this too much because uh I don't want to waste your time while I try to hook this up what if I go here and say this is on the right WiFi and what if I go to here and say uh rebroadcast Services um okay let's see if that works huh weird all right whatever no soundboard right now uh what is my best dad joke um thank you Josh gorin on Twitter this is not my best one she the only one I can think of right now you know I've been thinking a lot about the creators of Mad Libs and they must be laughing all the way to the shoe oh if only had my soundboard I could play my butum chunk or something let me I don't understand why is this not airplane I'm GNA just T power it off and I'm I'm going to power it back on I'm going to quit this this is really this is a totally unnecessary uh thing uh and I'm on this particular WiFi Network yes um that's not even a joke yeah uh what did the um why why did the um you know one of my my kids used to love to um tell the interrupting cow knock knock joke knock knock who's there the interrupting cow the interrupting cow moo but he would always just say the moo after you said the whole thing the interrupting cow moo thought that was so funny okay um okay um so what am I here so I did a live stream earlier this morning uh where I did a bunch of tutorials about a physics Library called matter.js and I am back I am back and I'm here to continue and I would like to do uh oh there's some good jokes in the chat why did the shy Pebble want to be when she grew up I'm a little bit afraid maybe am I am I am I starting a joke that's going to be inappropriate I hope not um uh so I but here's my okay here's my dad joke except I have nobody to do this with I have to do it with myself knock knock who's there the interrupting coefficient of friction the interrupting coefficient of friction Mew there you go okay um let's see if this works I'm going to try to airplay this wow it's completely this this is the I need a new I just definitely need a new way of doing these sound effects this way is the worst this ancient iPad doesn't even have the airplay option is like totally gone now I don't know what happened to it this is here I really should just give up on this instead what I'll do is give up on this okay I'll come back to it later okay um now I think some people really enjoyed that actually strangely enough uh okay okay yeah I I I I just this uh okay so I still oh so okay somebody tell me how many people are in the actual YouTube chat which is this camera right here because right now I see that there are 540 in my green wall chat um okay uh come on come on soundboard I just feel oh airplan ah there it is mirroring turn on mirroring appear this is the worst this is the worst this is like debugging a totally unnecessary thing it just it appeared so I thought okay this will work now and now I've made it even worse because it doesn't work uh oh so sad so sad so sad because now at least when it's Friday evening there's nobody on this floor and I don't worry too much about making a lot of noise and I can uh play music and be a little bit more loud and ridiculous so I feel like you know hey music um okay so I'm gonna give up on this uh and I'm going to get with you know you know what the thing is I can play my music anyway it just uh won't go through wirecast let's see what happens I always forg kind of works I don't know if you can hear that through the mic um okay wow I'm looking at everybody's awesome screenshots of me streaming in multiple directions okay let's see what's going on here I'm going to open up atom I am going to open up terminal I am going to run a server I'm going to minimize terminal I am going to open up a browser which apparently is already open I'm going to go to Local Host and I'm going to check out the last example I made which was this one there it is The Swinging circles um and what I would like to do first is do a coding Challenge and that coding challenge is I'm sure yeah I'm going to do the coding Challenge and I um I'm going to do a coding Challenge and the coding challenge I'm going to do is to make Plinko Plinko with matter.js um how's that going to go what do you guys think about that this is 100% something I have never done before sometimes a coding challenge is like I did it like a couple years ago or like this is an example that I already have that I know I looked at this other person's thing I have no no plan whatsoever other than the words Plinko p5js and matter.js are you with me okay affirmative I take that as an affirmative okay so uh what do I first need to do I would like to uh grab something that I can use like this folder and I'm going to call this uh Plinko and now I'm going to go to Adam and I'm going to go to Plinko and I think I'm going to delete that and I'm going to go to sketch I'm going to delete everything but setup and draw and ah goodbye camera okay um okay that mug from the phone oh did I put the I put the mug in got to stay hydrated okay um this is by the way uh okay oh my slack disconnected oh try now try now come on come back okay um sorry about that everybody okay now ah you over there you over there you over there that's me okay create canvas 400400 background 51 this is what I'll do beforehand and whoops let's go to Plinko and let's think about this now I um that's really what it is let's give myself a bit more space 600400 make it a little bigger and then let's go to index.html and get rid of box. JS um I might want to use the Dom library at some point I might want to use the Sound Library interesting okay so I think we're ready for Plinko ready for party parrot Plinko time okay uh all right how long till the my phone battery dies that's a real question I do have a charger plug and I could try to plug in in or something ah why isn't this I kind of like I want to restart my computer let me I let me just do just give me one little bear with me for one second I'm GNA turn my WiFi off here I'm gonna um I'm going to go to settings here and I'm going to go turn my WiFi off here then I'm going to turn I'm going to unplug and plug back in this router just give it another chance one last chance and it is booting up router is starting up so now I should be able to let me quit this air server thing let me turn this back on last chance I swear this is the last time I'm going to try this then I'm moving on uh then I'm going to try to log into this oops no no no there we go I'm going to go there wifi back on let's connect uh then I'm going to turn back on air server and I am going to go to airplay Mac Pro ah there we go air server there we go it worked all right so now we're live with the soundboard we're going to go to the soundboard open that up good evening welcome to the coding rainbow ah I mean shoot good evening welcome to the coding train as we pull into the station getting ready to play a nice game of Plinko let let's continue reading from the coding train story book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates uh when we last left off 9888 and now 66,9 6,830 53,6 56 14663 tune in next time on the coding train and we'll continue our story book I'm going to put this down over here now I need some new stick come on people help me out here I I got a I got I got some time so little time in the week to even prepare so I can't even come up with new material okay uh now uh here we go let's get ready for this coating challenge I really want it to have like a sound of Dan first of all it's an incredibly long snare drum and then at the end it doesn't do anything okay let me just kind of Google image search Plinko for a second I'm not sure I know exactly what Plinko is ah yes this is Plinko I do know what Plinko is uh but do I have to be kind of exact about this uh we're going to be let's see what's a nice Plinko look at this I can get Plinko all these Plinko things I can buy this looks like a good image uh okay I'm not going to worry about this I'm going to make my own Plinko ready here we go um yeah itd be interesting for somebody to edit together some sort of version of the uh or split screen the two camera views I'm happy for you know anybody who wants to mess around with that after these get archived I'm happy for that to happen Okay All Aboard it's Friday evening here on the coding train and I am here ready to create a coding Challenge and today's coding challenge is going to be ah never mind never mind all this nonsense Plinko so I'm going to attempt to make Plinko um using a physics engine known as matter.js what is Plinko you may ask good question I don't really I'm not entirely sure but I think Plinko is a thing where you have a bunch of balls that uh that fall from the top of a a twodimensional it's a physical thing you drop the balls at the top there's all these little things that they bounce into and they end up somewhere on the bottom that was a terrible explanation I should redo this whole video I'm going to make it and then you guys can if you don't know what Plinko is pause and go try to look it up and then come back okay I have a sort of vague idea in my head okay so uh yes and I'm being reminded by Ala in the chat to stay hydrated now that I've lost half of the people who maybe were going to watch this video the rest of you let's go okay so the first thing that I want to do here is um boy let's h I'm trying to think about this here there's a lot of pieces to this boy this is going to be this is going to be hard um let's think about this over on the Whiteboard for a second and apologies to Mata who will now have to edit this part and I might as well come over here and just erase this for a second uh so now I'm going to artificially pretend that I'm doing this again okay so how does Plinko work I can use the Whiteboard to explain it Plinko is a thing where there is a grid of stationary I would call them like knobs in a way and I think each row would be offset from whoops offset from the one below it so it would be something like this um all the way to the bottom and then the idea is that you would drop things from the top and it would fall right down and bounce here and you know ideally the ideas would be a 50% chance of it going this way and a 50% chance of going that way then it would hit here and there would be a 50% chance of going this way versus a 50% going and interestingly enough if we do this correctly which I'm sure we won't there's no CH we it's me there no chance I'm going to do it correctly we would see a nice normal Gan distribution of where they land like they would mostly land in the center with a few outliers boy isn't there some like TV show now called the wall I should just put like I could probably could create some sort of like clickbait title for this video but I'm not going to do that so then the idea so then they'll they'll fill up in the we could use this to like you know you win certain amount of money or whatever so this is the simulation so what I need is I need some mechanism for catching everything in different slots so these would be kind of stationary in the physics engine I could probably make these stationary rectangles if that's a thing then these would be and static is the word I'm looking for static uh Circle objects that are around and then I'm going to have Dynamic Circle objects falling from the top so I need really three kinds of things I'm going to call these particles because uh that's a good name for them I'm going to call these um pinkos because we're making Plinko and then this is going to be a bucket we'll call these buckets to catch the thing so I need to make three kinds of objects and so I'm kind of planning this out I guess I know I'm going to need arrays for all these things um so let's sort of see how this goes let's try making just the particles first okay so um what I'm going to do is oh cup is in front again sorry everybody I have a you don't want to know what's going on here with my multiple camera system craziness um okay um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a Javascript file and I'm going to call it particle. JS and I'm going to say function particle uh and I'm going to when I create a particle the thing falling from the top I want to create it at an XY location now here's the thing I'm using a physics engine called matter.js and I already have an index .html a reference to the matter.js library now I also have a reference to the p5js library that's the library I'm using for drawing and that's the library that I use in just about in many of my videos almost all of them but matter.js is new and if you want to learn more about matter.js I will link to a set of tutorial videos about matter separately I'm just going to kind of rapidly go through adding stuff for matter without maybe explaining everything but I do have separate tutorial videos okay now I do need to go to the matter.js website and I want to Google matter get started maybe Wiki um because I know that this is going to have some of the code that I want on it like this for example so one thing is uh matter is a library where all of the objects and functions that you might call of call from are namespaced uh they all start with matter do something and I'm going to definitely need an engine and a ren I don't need a render actually because I'm using P5 an engine a world bodies so this is a way of just sort of aliasing them so I don't have to say matter dot all the time and and so what I need is uh I want to have an engine I want to have a world I want to have a bunch of particles that's what I'm starting with engine world and a bunch of particles okay so uh engine equals matter dot no no engine. create I don't know World equals engine. world what's the chance that that's right so I need to create an engine and then I want to refence refence to the world that that engine creates sort of seems unlikely that that's correct oh it is correct engine equals engine. create and the world is you can see later engine. World okay great now what I want to do is I want to start creating um some bodies so the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to say VAR P equals a new particle and I just want to put it uh at at the top in the middle 300 comma uh 50 so I want to make a single new particle now I'm calling the new particle Constructor function so over here now what I need to do is I actually need to make a something called a body and body comes from B do so bodies is a thing that matter dos will make matter is the physics engine it's going to handle moving everything and doing all that so my particle object is just a wrapper for a matter.js circle thing so I want to make a matter.js circle thing at X and Y and it needs to have a radius uh uh this do r so oh but not this.r all right so I think I think that's right so I should look in the documentation I don't have matter.js uh memorized so I'm going to have to pull up the documentation here go under documentation uh go under bodies and now I'm looking for Circle XY radius now there's options and all sorts of other things which I might get into but this looks like I'm doing well so far here x y r okay now the other thing I need to do is I need to say world. add world um this. body what's this doing I have to not only do I have to make a body that's a matter body that can exist and have physics I need to tell the world that I actually want that body to be in the world it seems a little bit redundant but you know you might want to make objects that you don't actually they don't participate in the physics yet so those two things are separated and then I want to write a function where I can display it um and I should I should use H let's use the Prototype thing I have some videos that explain prototypes so let's throw caution to the wind prototype. show equals function so if you're wondering about this prototype P way of attaching methods to objects um I'll link to a video about prototype but this is a way of saying particles all particles are going to have a show function and in the show function I'm going to say what am I going to say I'm going to say Phil uh 255 uh stroke 255 ellipse and where is the body now here's the thing normally when I make an object I give it an X and a y or a position Vector but not here right now I am relying on matter.js to do all the physics for me so it's up to me to say Hey you know that body that's a matter.js body could you please tell me what its position is currently and then I can say and you know what I'm going to do I know that eventually I'm going to want rotation so I'm going to say translate this uh pause. X pause. Y instead of setting the ellipse to that location and then I'm going to draw the ellipse at 0 and I want to give it a a diameter which is its own radius time 2 now this do R doesn't actually exist so I don't think that the um oops and I have got an error there um uh I my I seem to remember looking at the matter.js documentation the circle body doesn't actually keep track of its radius in a property so I'm just going to make an extra property myself to keep track of it and that way I can draw it that way so now I've made a body I've added it to the world and I showed it I have a my own particle object that is a wrapper for a matter.js body essentially um so now whoops if I go to sketch. JS and I just say uh particles. push p and then I say p.show let's see if it shows up I hope so I hope so I hope so I hope so I would do my drum roll thing now but that doesn't never seem to work ah okay particle is not defined uh of course I always forget this this is almost as much as I forget the fail fail static oh it's super loud oh my God okay hold on hold on sorry you know what I'm sorry for everybody's ears uh Mato let me do that again and let's not have the music cue when we edit this together I always forget uh to add um the reference to uh the new JavaScript file yeah and the sound was laggy the new JavaScript file um to uh the index HTML so uh I need to add that here what did I call it particle. JS so I'm G to add that here uh okay now I'm going hit refresh okay what did I miss cannot read property body of undefined at object I must have done something wrong okay object.create bodies. Circle so where did I miss miss mess this up so let's comment out oh look at this this is for first of all nonsense that should be particles index zero. show because that's a local variable that I use just to add to the array and uh and you know what this is going to be I have a feeling this is going to be a twopart uh a multipart coding challenge I'm just saying that right now so I'll think about that as I go um because I can see that this is getting more complicated uh what am I missing cannot read property undefined uh and it create it must be oh bodies no this body equal bodies. Circle wait wait wait I'm still getting the error message even with oh no I haven't commented out let me comment this out to make sure that it's happening when I create the particle ah okay well okay that's fine we comment this out okay no error this is a good way of debugging comments everything out no errors let me just try to make the object oh I forgot to add the R I added an r and so it needs to have a radius otherwise what's it going to do well let's see if that fixes it I I'm guessing that fixed it and now we're going to see the particle there we go so there's the particle that single particle now it has no physics why does it have no physics well here's the thing a physics engine requires me to say hey go to the next Moment In Time move ahead in time and time can mean a lot of different things but it can mean real world time it can mean frame of animation and in this case I want to tie each frame each time through the draw Loop to a new moment in time and the easiest way to do that there's there's a lot of options that way that you can configure this is I'm just going to say engine. update I think that's all I say engine. update or maybe I have to say engine. update well let's try engine. update does that do it no engine. update is not a function engine. update engine it might be that the function update is namespaced in engine and then you pass in the thing you want to update that's it okay so you can see there's my Plinko particle falling down so we're in good shape we've got the Plinko particle now maybe what I want to do also is just to kind of um is to do something like let's have uh if frame count modulus 60 equals z so modulus is the remainder of division so this will equal zero when frame count is zero 60 120 180 240 300 Etc so I'm going to say uh add a new particle every 60 frames which is approximately two seconds let's do this uh show of undefined oh right and then silly me I should someday use a for each Loop but right now I'm just going to Loop through all the particles and show them and here we go so now we should see two seconds and about two seconds later oh boy something must be wrong here I'm not seeing any new where are those where are those blinko particles uh if frame count modulus 60 equals zero add a new one that looks good to me what have I done wrong uh let's console log frame count just to make sure that's a thing yeah looks like it's it started with one by the way so I'm not sure why uh what did I miss um okay the oh no this seem right put a new one I'm looking through all of them okay why okay hold on every let's console log every 60 every 60 ah so that's happening why do I not see a second one uh H that's strange let's look at first of all let's make this a little more often just so we don't have to wasit so much time and let me uh let me let me just see if that array is growing yeah the array is growing did I mess up in the particle object world. add this. body it's getting a new body each time what have I missed P Global uh should be New bodies. Circle did I do that wrong oh yes look at this thank you to somebody in the chat whose name scrolled by I think I called this incorrectly let's look at the documentation uh this is hopefully I would have um let's look at H I don't know if that's actually the case no look at this when I make a rectangular documentation I don't have to say new the function is designed to so what am I missing here H H oh oh I know what the problem is you guys see it now look it's right here it's right here right there translate pause. X pause. Y so I I knew I was going to I meant to add this earlier when I was doing it I thought whatever so translations are cumulative so when I translate to the position of one particle the next particle I draw will be relative to that one and so these are all getting translated way off the screen I need to not have them be relative to each other rather I need to say push and I need to say pop and now uh so what push and pop does is it's like save translate restore so it undoes the translation and now if I go back to my code there we go look at all my Plinko things every 10 frames my little Plinko particles falling down so we can go back to sketch and I can take out this console log nonsense and I can put it back to 60 and we can kind of oh and there's still another console log happening where's that other console log oh particles. length uh and so we can see here and you know what I'm It's upsetting me that there's not one at the beginning so I'm also going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a function new particle that just does that those two lines of code and oops and I'm going to say new particle here and I'm also going to have a new particle instantaneously in setup at the very beginning so now we get a particle and 2 seconds later we get particle and 2 seconds later we get particle I'm a little bit behind Okay um now the nice thing is it's the physics is already working as you might have noticed when I made this like if I make this every five frames you can see they're kind of like hitting each other it's a little bit funny that's a little bit like of a weird but but let's we're going to get to more physics later okay now I'm going to do I think I'm going to do this as a twopart challenge so um so let me go a little bit further let me at least add the stationary Plinko so I want to now try to add these stationary plos and the truth of the matter is I could probably reuse this particle object and just make particle objects here and give them like an argument that setss them to static but I'm going to make some a seriously redundant code just for like sort of ease right now and I could think I could use inheritance in a nice way to have them relate but I just want to make a separate object that just keeps track of these stationary Plinko because I I just want to treat them differently so um that's how I feel today okay you you can you can you can uh refactor my code later to make it uh better okay so let's come back here and let's go to particle DS and I'm going to do save as this is really I'm I'm a little bit uncomfortable with what I'm doing here I'm going to say Plinko JS and I'm going to say function Plinko and uh Plinko I really should use inheritance here come back and use inheritance another time Plinko prototype. show and something I'm going to do here is I'm going to add uh another variable called options so when you create a physics object in matter.js in addition to giving it that Circle body in x a y and a radius I can give it some options and the option I want right now is is static oh and I'm editing no I'm editing the right file is static true so and then I want to pass this fourth argument as options there might be a way that I could just make all these options actually could I make the X Y I don't know if that's true but anyway that fourth argument is options and there's other options I'm going to be I'll add later like friction and other physics settings but let's leave that out for now is static makes it something that doesn't move and doesn't doesn't experience uh doesn't experience um geometry okay um now that's right I forgot that the phone is still going I should I turn that off okay but okay so um uh that's not relevant to this particular video maybe we can edit that little thing out okay so now in and here's the thing I could Pro um matter.js also has uh these concept as a composite so I could tell it to make a stack of things with rows and columns so I could probably use that let's look at that for a second no I just not the kind of I I think that's great but I I feel like I just need to like set them in my own location right now without using the composite thing so I'm going to say VAR Plinko and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say for VAR x equals um let's use I andj actually I equals z i is less than let's make the Plinko thing 10 by 10 maybe or 10x 5 I I know 5 by I don't know what should be I I should have some variables for maybe columns let's do that and rows and uh so we're gonna have this many columns and then I need a spacing so I'm going to make a a sort of a double Loop here uh nested Loop to go through all the rows and probably rows should be on the outside actually well whatever I'm not so sure just yet um because I I is the X so actually I think think the way I'm going to think about this is to put I on the inner part of the loop so I'm doing a nested Loop right because I want to say set all of these then go down here and set all of these so for every row do all the columns next row do all the columns or for every y do all the X's okay so now what I want to do is I want to say VAR P equals new plink go at I * spacing comma J * spacing now I haven't figured out what spacing should be but I just want to know wants to be at every column and row location with however far apart they're supposed to be and let's just say right now spacing equals the width of the window divided by the number of columns so because I need five across and that's about the spacing I'm sure I'm going to have to massage this a little bit and then I'm going to say here Plinko pushp so now I'm adding the Plinko I like the I love the word Plinko it's such a great word Plinko Plinko Plinko let's make a song about Plinko uh um and now I want another loop here to go through all of the Plinko and show them and just to be 100% certain that they're different uh I would like to uh give them like a different color or something so let's make them uh like a green color color not being my strength here but let's just do that so what's going on now what's plink plink is not defined so a lot of things I probably first of all I don't know where that happened where did I say plink plink is not as good of a word as Plinko I much prefer the word Plinko oh plink Plinko and now I'm going to go to index. HTML and I now I need to remember this I remembered at this time I need to add a reference to Plinko and now I'm going to refresh it and what am I missing cannot read I've got some sort of like thing that I forgot already again I probably forgot the r again right I probably forgot to pass into radius um I certainly did so let's give each one of these things that's separated by spacing a radius of four pixels and now I don't see anything I see these things falling uh I wonder if I have an i and J issue I'm seeing they're called pegs I'm being told in the chat by C many that they're not called Plinko they're called pegs that would be a good name for them okay fine the whole thing is Plinko uh I times spacing J time spacing I put j i J's Less in rows columns rows this looks reasonable um let's just look here do I act let's look at the array let's make sure it's F full of stuff it only has one thing in it that's a little bit weird oh and look at it it's all the way up there which makes no sense whatsoever so plus equals spacing in the for Loop uh uh I oh columns no no no no no no yeah yeah this is wrong the whole point of doing this is I want to be able to think of the rows and columns as individual numbers I and j 0 1 two 3 four and when I'm drawing to the screen I want to add the spacing aspect so now we can see there they are now it's not in any place that's logical so one thing that I need is for the center column right I need I need an odd number of columns well I don't need an odd number but I need a column to line up with where the thing is falling so first of all uh if the I want the let me I can get rid of this now I want the the particles to actually just stop start at the actual top camera moment this can get this is a little nice little edit moment here as I have a sip my half of my head got chopped off there um so um I forgot what I was doing um yeah I should definitely make the canvas longer okay I'm forgot what I was doing where was I where was I where was I uh um I'm thinking I'm thinking if I press the Bell it'll make my brain have light up and have the idea was the last thing I said spacing yeah you guys are G me good suggestions of what to do next what's spacing okay I don't know um I'll just go back to something okay so I need to have one of these columns in the center I need to have one of these columns in the center so let me think about how to do that and also I want the particles to start at the top yes so particles starting at the top top and I want that I need to make the whole thing much taller so let's go down to 800 pixels great so now we can see it's going down to 800 pixels I want to shift everything down right everything should start at um and I'm actually going to do this varx equal I + one times spacing because no no no no no X is fine at I * spacing and uh y should be spacing plus I * spacing just to kind of offset everything by and then I'm going to just put X and Y here this will make it a little easier to work out whoa what did I do wrong there uh spacing plus a j thank you very much okay so that's a little bit better but I I also want to shift everything over by half of spacing I think so I want to shift everything over by spacing divided by two there we go ah look at that so okay so first of all couple things it's pretty great actually look at it just like get stuck and kind of roll over so one thing is um I this this going to be this definitely going to be a puzzle here of having uh working out the spacing but one thing is let's give these things some bounce so the way that we think give things bounce in matter.js is by working with the friction and restitution so restitution is a term for elasticity a high restitution will make it very bouncy and so what I want to do and this is why I should be using is I want to add this options thing both to particle and Plinko which really should be a Peg and this these are not static I'm going to just work only in the particle for a second restitution and I want that to be one which is as bouncy as possible so let's just add that options that didn't really seem to change anything right so let's Also let's get rid of any friction um so now the particles should have a high restitution and no friction that's a little bit better right you can see it's kind of bouncing but I probably need to work on the pegs I really know the Plinko the pegs uh so let's actually take these same variables I'm not sure what it would do here to have sort of different amounts but let's um let's add a high restitution and a low friction also to the the pegs wow I really would expect this to be um more bouncy with those numbers but maybe it just hasn't gathered oh I spelled restitution wrong that's one of the things about JavaScript it's not going to tell you this is a really unfortunate thing if I was working in another environment it would be like I don't know what that is restitution restitution what's the chance I got that right now restitution boing there we go boing bo bo boing Bo well it's going to be fun to add sound effects to this so you know we can see now we've got something we've got these things kind of kind of bouncing along here now they're all taking exactly the same path how are we going to get it to have like a 50% chance of going why is it going to the left so interesting this is super okay well first of all what I want to do is I want to shift uh every other row and and um so let's let's uh let's maybe reduce the restitution a little bit yeah that's a little bit better um and then let me alternate where uh the rows are so what I want to do is uh in sketch. JS I want to say every other row right which is if J is the row right if J modulus 2 equals z then uh so so then let's or equals one there got to be a nicer way to do this so I'm setting X then what I want to do is xus I'll just sort of like take that let's do it this way xal I plus spacing and then if it's an even row then I'm going to add in offset it by spacing divided by two let's see if that works there we go so this looks a bit more now here's the thing I probably need to really calibrate this in some way that they kind of you know bounce but let's just let's not worry about that too much and let's actually um just make this let's just give ourselves a lot more columns and rows and see what happens um and why is the top one now oh because it's not even uh I want to have uh 11 columns yeah there we go so um and I think I want so there's going to be some there's probably like a specific layout that I that's going to work pretty optimally well but this is a good start so um this completes part one of this coding Challenge and what I'm going to do in part two is I'm going to do a couple things I don't know what I what am I going to do in part two I'm going to add buckets to the bottom to catch them and maybe think about the layout and spacing a little bit more okay so that's what I'm going to do in part two does it really make sense how long have I been doing this for this live stream has been going on for 45 minutes um yeah it should be way more bouncy right um I think uh one thing so I'm oops how's my how's my phone live stream going I'm at least taking a break I I don't know if MAA is watching I don't think MAA is watching this live chat I'm so it make the pegs bigger yeah that's probably a good thing they're all going initially to the left so that's one thing can you modify the parameters to look like a normal gravity one thing is the time step here so um I'm seeing a lot of great suggestions add Randomness they to drop in from random points oh yeah dropping in from random points would be good um so um there's lots of things I can add oh but mostly what I want to do stronger gravity so I'm taking a little break here to think about this um and then I'll put the stuff in the video tutorial how could what so I'm trying to think about the stronger gravity let's look on the matter.js I think the the matter.js website is there world I mean right now it's it's starting to get really really slow over time uh is there a way to set gravity oh M as Gravity the gravity the gravity scale gravity object so the world when I say world. create oh I can give boundaries for Collision that's kind of useful uh the world sorry where was that world. create um options and one of those options can be gravity I need to destroy the offscreen particle so I need to add that as well yeah yeah definitely going to do that so those are let me make a list of things I need to do in part two uh oops this camera's off uh increase or gravity delete particles add bounds and then um I'm standing for add bounds uh add buckets and I don't know maybe I could like count a listener I might be interesting to try like a listener to count uh to count which buckets the things land in although they're not the buckets are going to fill up so they're not going to hit the bottom I'm I'm not going to worry about that that'll be somebody else's problem as a followup uh reusing them instead of deleting them is a good suggestion from Big Apple in the chat I could definitely do that um engine. world. gravity. uh thank you okay um so let me uh let me see here how's my phone B there's still 148 people somehow watching and 75 minutes into this live stream on the phone I thing about this phone live stream is now nobody's going to want to watch my studio walk through when they see it's like a threeh hour video but whatever can edit I can edit something out maybe maybe something could get edited out of that that'll be more useful anyway okay um I know so C Manny is saying I can say engine. world. gravity doy even rows need another column oh yeah that's interesting let me let me look here yeah so they're missing it's missing like a last piece there so that I can add um and then also let's see what we can do about the gravity just um so what you're saying is I can say world old. gravity. y equals you know 100 or something okay that worked yeah that's good so that's good it's interesting how it's able to fit like all the way through um so that's what is it what is the default at one maybe yeah so maybe if I just double it um oh but Collision listening I can use for playing sound so um Collision listening so but what I wanted to do when I when I come back I think I would prefer to oh engine. create so I'll just do it I'll do it that way that's fine okay okay uh hello jello in the UK thanks for watching okay so what time is it 7 o'clock yeah so I'm going to maybe make the pegs a bigger size that's a good suggestion as well okay so I'm going to now move into part two of this uh coding challenge okay so I made my list uh does and so um sound plus listening that might actually be a part three so I think I can do these things increase gravity delete part particles add boundaries and add the buckets I think I can do that in part two and then maybe part three we'll be adding sound so that's sort of like its own thing okay uh here I am okay welcome to part two of Plinko coding challenge I actually just during the little break I just took between part one and part two I made a quick list with help from the chat here's the things that I'm going to do I'm going to increase the gravity of the world so that things don't look so sluggish as they're falling I got to make sure I delete any particles that leave the window although at some point I'm going to put boundaries so actually I might hold off on that because I was going to add boundaries around the whole world so that they can't leave the window because the idea is to fill up the buckets at the bottom but uh um then I uh and then I want to add buckets at the bottom to fill those things up and then I actually might make this a part three let's see if we can add a little bit of sound with they as they hit the things as little like ding ding sounds or whatever maybe I can record the Bell really quickly and use that sound okay uh so um here we are so first thing I could do is so gravity is part of the world um and so if I look at if I just look in the console if I look at world we can see here that there are a lot of properties there's bounds which don't There's No Boundaries to the worlds right now that's something I'm going to set um there's no constraints but there's gravity here which is an object and you can see the scale is 0.001 X is zero Y is two why is Y 2 oh because I already changed it as I was practicing um why is one ah it's fine it's fine let me redo that part and I I I I'm using my one redo ticket even though I do that over and over again um okay so hold on where was I okay um so let me look over here and see what I can do so gravity is part of something so there conceptually there's a world and there's particles and there's Plinko gravity is not part of a Plinko or Peg or a particle it's part of the world so I can actually look here in the console and I can just type world to look and see what the properties of the world are there's bounds which is something I want to look at which has a maximum and a minimum X and Y whoops which is ah I clicked the wrong thing come on click again you can see those are Infinity because I haven't said any bounds and then there's gravity which has a scale I don't 100% know what that is I should look it up in the documentation but I have an X and A Y so one thing I consider the Y is one right now I can actually just say world. gravity doy equals 2 so let me double the Y so it points down a little bit more and you can see can you see that that's moving let's just make it more extreme just so you can really see let's make this 10 and you can see that gravity is so much stronger right now so that's kind of useful in terms of getting things to fall a bit more pause for a second ah sorry live stream I needed a Kleenex and the the uh the the phone um that's if let me see what the battery is here should I those of you watching this right now hold on everybody those of you watching I'm at 20% battery do you does does anybody want me to really like keep this going is it okay should I turn it off or should I keep it going nobody's nobody's answering me I'm talking to you leave it on okay so I need to get a plug I have a plug for it and what I will do is I I will plug it in to this uh USB port here on this actually let me plug it into this laptop so I'm so it doesn't like appear by accident on my screen as a device uh and then let me bring this over here and plug it in is it plugged in oh my seriously that didn't work USB ports on this laptop don't work can I turn this over rotated the device no don't lock did that work no ah live stream okay hold on a second everybody sorry for this uh digression for the regular live stream I am changing to this camera for a second as I'm going to plug this into my laptop and I don't just want my yeah I know I was upside down uh uh let's see I can't tell if it's charging or not because it doesn't give me a view doesn't let me change it's locked it doesn't tell me if it's charging YouTube get with the program man how come I can't see if I if I go out of this app is it going to stop live streaming hold on a sec all right I'm just gonna have to hope that it's charging I assume that it's charging right now and now going to use the yellow mug and this keyboard to keep it propped up okay uh so if it dies it dies okay there you go okay so oh it's definitely plugged in because okay okay I'm back okay where did I stop I changed the gravity to two okay so I'm changing the gravity back to two and let's just leave it at that for now now let's try adding some boundaries to the world so what were those again a world world. bounds. max. X so I think that would be world. bounds. max. X and i.x equals uh with if I really want to m.x is zero let's just try this will this do what I think and then uh the minimum X oh wait wait wait wait X and Y ah no no hold on Max dox and Y is is like confusing to think about I want the maximum X and Y and then I want the minimum X and Y and the maximum Y is height and the minimum X and Y are both zero okay that's right let's now run this again and see uh I can't tell if I'm actually so I don't think the boundaries does what I think it does um in that uh hold on let me let me make this just 600 by 600 just so I can see right if the boundaries and let's see hold on world I might have done something wrong world. bounds. max. Min right so wouldn't that cause it to have like a hard Edge I guess it doesn't I don't know matter.js to know well enough so I'm guess I'm going to go back and eliminate this whole uh I'm G to um I'm going to eliminate this whole boundary thing does anybody know yeah let's try different numbers just out of curiosity oh look at that so that definitely did something maybe bounds delete the object I don't know so I have no idea what it does you may need to change a parameter in order to allow bound collisions constraints switch the Max and Min uh interesting hold on I'm I'm no longer in this video tutorial this is um maybe bound stops thinking about bodies uh all right let's let's look at the documentation um bounds defines the world bounds for Collision detection so I think that means it just stops um it stops um doing the Collision detection afterwards okay so never mind that was a misdirection um I'm going to um delete this and I'm going to go back to where I just changed the gravity uh to two so I there might have been a weird edit right there but I I just tried something that didn't work out at all so I'm I'm not going to bother including it you can click a link to the live stream that has the full Archive of all my debugging but I'm going to get rid of this add bounds thing because the bounds doesn't actually do what I thought it does the bounds are something you can set just for where you're going to detect collisions but doesn't create hard edges that bounce off we need to actually create our own boundaries for that so actually add bounds should I don't need to go through that boy I was I I I should never stop because it totally kills my momentum and then I then I never um I I I have trouble getting it back okay I I know what I'm going to do now everything is fine with oh I don't know I know something somebody's post ala's posted something about GitHub and an issue but I'm gonna um I'm not going to um I'm not going to worry about that I'm looking here for what I changed 800 okay um the mobile stream could be angled up okay okay hey those of you watching this saying show your screen you're in the wrong live stream this is an extra live stream that's just going from my phone there's a full I'm in the wrong camera ah there's a full live stream over here just draw a box around the canvas is exactly what I'm going to do sorry everybody uh constraints is something else okay everything's everything's gone out of whack I'm gonna get back to momentum here okay everybody okay so Mata for you editing this later uh this is the moment where I just changed the gravity to two okay so changing the gravity to two I'm going to leave it for that right now the next thing on my list over here was add bounds and there is a thing in the world object in addition to gravity called bounds but I'm not going to use that that's more I think for where you're doing Collision detection instead what I'm going to do is just add some um objects myself so I'm going to yet again I'm going to just from particle. JS I'm going to do a save as and I'm going to call this a boundary boundary. JS I'm going to make an object that has a x a y and a width and a height it's going to be and this should be a a boundary and it has it's it is something that's uh static and instead of making a circle it's going to be a rectangle again I'm doing a lot of redundant code here but and then I'm going to keep track of the width and the height in separate variables and um I'm going to say boundary. prototype. show and this should be a rectangle with a width and a height so what I've done very quickly is show you how you can create a rectangular Body by using bodies. rectangle keeping graa a rdth and height instead of a radius otherwise everything else is the same ah I need to add rotation at some point don't let me forget because these things are rotating as they're moving around okay so for this what I'm going to do just really quickly is I'm also going to make an array call it bounds and I'm going to at the end of setup just put one at the bottom VAR b equals a new boundary and so the rectangle is actually thought of based on its Center matter. I'm going to say width divided by two it's going to be at uh height um and I'm actually going to like push it off so what I want is its location to be at height plus 50 because I want its uh width to be the entire width of the window and I want its height to be if it's plus 50 I want its height to be like 100 so it's actually not going to show up on the screen but and I'm oh boundary is not defined because of course I forgot to add it to my index. HTML so I have another Javascript file come on boundary. JS here we go and boundar is not defined and setup so what am I missing here um new boundary ah what did I probably boundary boundary boundary that looks right uh index.html I've got boundary. JS sketch b equals new boundary let's try that again syntax error line number three boundary. JS sorry about that uh is static true ah there should not be a semicolon there creating an object in JavaScript you separate the properties with commas with only one property I don't even need the commas okay apologies for that and here we go so now what we should see is I got to wait a little while but when the ball falls to the bottom there you got you can see that it's there's now a boundary down there so that's perfect that's what I want um and I I I guess I'm not going to make this 800 because it's um kind of going off a little too low down so let's just make this uh 600 by 700 just to push it up a little bit okay that's pretty good okay another thing that I could do here is if you notice every other I don't know if this is really necessary but does feel like there should be another particle right here another Peg right there so that is the odd row so in the odd row uh what if well what if I just did this would anybody really care yeah that's fine there's an extra one also for the even ones I could be more thoughtful about this but that's what I'm going to do right now Okay so we've got the stuff falling down and landing in the bottom okay I definitely need to do something I was wrong uh I do want to delete particles that fall off the edge because maybe they're not all going to end up in the bottom um so I should add something where I check if anything is way off screen to remove it to kind of keep things more efficient so let's add that next and what I need to do to do that is I need each particle is the only thing that's moving so I'm going to say particle. prototype uh do um offscreen equals a function and I'm just going to say um what makes it offscreen if x return X is less than zero that's let's let's say x is less than 00 not X okay so first of all x equals this. body. position dox so that's actually the object's location it's the body's positions X right physics the physics engine matter.js is controlling everything y equals and you know what I kind of wanted to make a nice if statement that I just return a Boolean not an if statement a nice Boolean expression that returns true or false let's just make this simpler if x is less than 50 or X is greater than I'm just going to use a buffer of 50 y + 50 uh then return true uh else and I'm doing this in a radically inefficient way but I don't actually ever need to check the top so I can actually just say return if any of these is true if any of these are true then it's off the screen so I can use an or return the result of all of these or Y is greater than height + 50 I'm I'm like hearing the YouTube comments already don't use a longwinded if statement where you could do it in one line of code but this is like kind of cryptic to watch to read but if an or statement if any of things in an or statement are true like false or false or false or false or false or true the whole thing is true right if I'm you know uh yeah okay so if one of these things are true the whole thing's going to return true so now what I need to do is in this Loop here where I'm dealing with all the particles if particles index i. is off screen then I want to say particles index uh particles. splice I comma 1 so I just did this in a matter.js tutorial earlier I'll link to it where I kind of went through the pitfall here because I'm moving taking things out of the array while I'm iter in through it so really a a quick fix that I can do here is just um that I did in that video is I can just subtract one from I because the problem is if I'm removing the I element the other elements slide into it and then I add one I end up skipping over it so this is going to cause me not to skip anything and this should remove anything that's off the screen and of course I have an error particles index I is off screen is not a function uh why is it not a function particle oh I just called it offscreen let's call it is off screen there we go so one thing I want to do just to be sure this is really working is let's not check let's not check the bottom um let's check uh let's check you know to see if they go over 100 pixels so we should see them removed now I did I forgot something really important in addition to removing it from my array I need to tell matter.js that it's not part of the physics anymore so what I'm gonna do F I'm having like a groundhog day Deja Vu thing uh where I'm removing it I also need to say partic uh I need to say uh um particles no no no no world world. remove World particles index ibody I think that's it so I want to tell the matter.js world so I want to remove something from the matter.js world the world function is namespaced in the world object so world. remove from this world which is my world this particular particle's body so take this out of the physics world then delete it from the array then go back one so let's see if that works uh so one thing one way to check if this works by the way is now what I'm going to do is I'm not going to um I'm not going to remove it from my array but I'm going to remove it from the physics world so let's just take that out this is a good way of debugging to see if it works so let's see if after 100 the physics stopped so that that actually did work did I get I probably got like a weird why did it that's interesting how it stopped doing anything but I can see plainly that this is doing what I want it to do um I'm pretty sure this is right um anybody pretty anybody tell tell me if I've done something wrong but I think I've got this in the right order and I can go back to my particle object and change this to like height I don't actually need the height of at all CU I only care if it goes cuz the the bottom is the bottom has a hard boundary so I'm actually just going to take that out I don't need that at all so I actually don't need to check I'm only going to check if it's off screen on the why oh something froze oh I crashed this particular let's just see if this comes back and it works again okay um so this should be doing fine I want to check here's actually a way that I can check so nothing's been removed so far I can say um particles. length there's six right now um particles. length seven particles. length seven come on leave the world people checking if it's working boy these these there's too much friction at the bottom because what I'm going to do is I'm going to say world. bodies oh no this is never going to work because there's a gazillion thing okay edit this part out um it stopped completely because you commented out the splice but still did hold on I got to go back I I want how what's a good way to confirm this is really doing what I want it to do I think I just have to rely on it being correct um let's you may want to check the height if the pellets get off screen by the sides no they're going to fall um so the question is does is no I can figure this out right because um how many um sorry I'm off um the only things are the boundaries so plink .length okay hold on let me de whoops let me debug to see if this is really working and I I want to be thoughtful about this so because I I really want to make sure that I've done the code correctly and I think this will show you a good way to debug this is what I'm going to do is actually completely take out all the Plinko so now I have to have this oh look at that who that's oh no no I got to do this I okay now there's no Plinko okay so now that there's no Plinko and I'm also going to remove this boundary and then I I actually unfortunately now need to go back and add this y back in or Y is greater than height so the way that I'm going to know that this works is um uh put this back in the way that I'm going to know that this is actually working is by looking at the length of the array so particles. length is one it's never going to be more than one because by the time the next one comes one's been removed the question is world. bodies is what matter.js thinks is there is that also one it is so things are working right because if I took out my um if I took out this world. remove if I didn't remove it from the the matter.js world I could look at particles. length and I'm going to continuously see one but now there's going to be three in the world's body so I need to make sure it's being removed from both places so now that now that I feel confident that that's working I can put my boundary back in at the bottom and I can put the uh Plinko back in here okay here we go now looking at my list what do I have left I've increased the gravity I'm removing particles I added a boundary at the bottom I need to add buckets so what I want to do is just add some little separators here and I probably want to align them right with that first um with that first uh row that probably is the way I'm supposed to do it although I'm sure there's a specific layout okay let's add those so how many those need to um let's add those okay so what I need to do those are also going to be boundaries so I'm going to use that boundary array boundaries. push B and now I'm going to write a loop that's similar I only need to do it for one set of columns so let me say I equals um I equal z i is less than column I want to do all these columns uh and what I want to do is say the x is I * spacing right that's what it is for um let's just see let's see what goes on let me try X is X is I * spacing the Y is the bottom so let me think of a height here I'm going to those buckets are going to have a height they're going to be rectangles that are going to have a height of like I don't know let's just try like 30 pixels and a width of like 10 pixels so the Y is going to be if I want it to be a boundary that sits um on top of the floor the Y is height minus h / to CU I need a rectangle this is confusing but basically uh if this is the bottom this is my rectangle this is its height this is this is the canvas's height minus height divided two is this location here so once I do that then I can create a new boundary and I'm reusing a variable name which is probably a bad idea but I can create another new boundary which is at X comma y with comma height because I calculated all that already and I can also say boundaries. push B and the reason why I want to put it into an array is because I also want to say um I also want to display all them so for all the boundaries uh boundaries index I doow now what does the boundary show function have it shows a rectangle and let let me I have let me say fill zero stroke zero let me get a different color here and uncaught reference error boundaries is not defined at setup boundaries boundaries boundar did I not make a boundaries array oh I called it bounds so that's nice because it's a little bit shorter of course now I have to change it everywhere so balance. push bounds. push and then I need to Loop through that balance array okay there we go those are so tiny look at the tiny I really okay so those are going to be uh have to be um much taller I guess I wasn't really thinking uh and I don't know why let's they can be white I don't know why I was like I had to change their color so um in the uh uh where am I boundary um let me make the color white and uh here let me color white and then uh what am I doing now on sketch where I create them let's make the height 100 my goodness why are you being so stingy okay does this so uh and then I could use one extra one right I could use one extra one here not cut that off with my laptops I could use an extra one I could use an extra one um so I already said columns plus one columns plus two wait why am I not getting oh because it's it's there but it's right off the screen no uh it must be right uh columns plus whoops so I don't know why am I not seeing this one here should be like half on the screen I would think because this one is oh but uh so let me just offset it a little bit uh 10 plus yeah uh I just see um minus 10 just to offset it yeah yeah it's there so I just I have to finesse the spacing stuff a little bit um so I'm going to just leave it at that uh because there's one what I want is but it should be at the center right so X is I times spacing so X is zero um and the width is 10 so I should see five pixels on and five pixels off what if I change this to 20 what what am I doing wrong here oh I know what I'm doing wrong I have I'm not drawing it correctly no wonder so I don't know if that some of that thinking could be edited out I need to move this up again because it's too low for me um but uh I forgot a really really key thing if I go into the boundaries look at this I'm drawing the rectangles in the default way that P5 thinks of rectangles with z0 in the top left and that's why they're actually so short I'm just drawing them in the completely wrong place whereas matter.js thinks of rectangles with the registration point in the center so I need to have I'm drawing match what matter. as things which I need to say w mode Center so here we go there we go so now it's right and you can see I that's what I expected it to do it had one sort of half off at the edge so you can see here are my uh Plinko things uh let me just do this oops no let me do this so um you can see it a little bit better uh okay let me make it a little bit um wider uh sketch. JS just to give us some more uh stuff to work with 700 comma 800 let's try that there we go so now let's take a look at this oh I I did something weird oh the spacing mind why did I change this I I didn't mean to do that let's go back to what it was okay so here we go uh Plinko so this ends the second part what I'm going to do is um what I'm going to do right now is take a short break and I'm going to come back and add a few sounds to this and during that short break I might also oh one thing I really got to fix is look at it always goes to the left up there and the whole point of this iser to 50% of the time go to the left and 50% of the time go to the right so I need to I'm going to add a few features to improve this in the next video you can think about maybe how you would do that yourself and look at this they're really they're all Landing basically in the same spot too so I need to work on adding a little bit of Randomness to allow for um for uh things to change okay so I'll see you in the next third part part where I'm going to improve on this a little bit see there okay so now I'm going to take a little break and like scratch my nose yeah totally violates the so I need to change the drop point at the top to be slightly off to the left or right and then I want to um then I want to uh um add some sound so I need to do Collision listening so I can add some sound so first of all 730 I need to use my phone to text that I'm running a little bit late because I got to finish this um so I'm going to um um I want to go a quick time can I do a can I just make a quick a new audio recording this is like such a terrible idea okay everybody here we go live audio recording oh too loud too loud let's try that again that actually worked kind of well though uh let's do one more time new audio recording I'm just G to have it be further away it was so close to the microphone here we go that's pretty good people are getting confused with the double stream should I shut off the mobile stream um if you're watching this on the mobile stream you should switch to what what happens if you go to user shiftman live does that end up in the correct stream um uh okay um so let me save this as ding under desktop where's my desktop desktop matter.js Plinko um ding what is what kind of fil is it going to save it as and how big is it going to be uh it is oh it is what kind of weird CR oh no it's like an apple audio something nonsense Apple EG 4 audio is that going to work with p5js does anybody know what's its actual file name how come I it's not showing me the extensions I think it's must be MP4 right okay um okay thank you uh math ma Mata making the phone stream is unlisted okay that'll help sorry everybody bigger pegs too is a good um it defaults to the mobile oh okay let's see if we can get that resolved um sorry for those of you watching this stream um um I'm looking at you uh this is surprisingly I I really need to deal with uh kind of interesting um so hopefully that's going to get worked out I can always turn off the mobile stream if that doesn't fix it okay so let me just see while we're waiting let me just add let me just test this function preload oh m4a that's never going to work right uh wait I can okay let's see what's the chance this is really I don't want to waste too much time on this um yeah ala would be great to try for your help but I don't have an easy way I I should set up like a shared Google drive or something that people can help me with files um during the where am I desktop uh matter.js let me um I think what I can do is go to a silly quick time well I have audacity I just showed me and I can um trim it to where it starts so I can do that trim and so that's going to that's going to make it start immediately by the way is that really loud is that like killing people's ears when and I should also trim the end because I have a shoot uh it's not too loud okay great so let me save this as ding two I'm also going to trim the end just a little bit here and hit save ding three okay um and then what I want to do is let me try export Audio Only and ah it's not giving me options I guess I could do it in um AAP it let's try opening it on Audacity and let me do export to MP3 that should work ding. MP3 blinko yeah okay no it's not saved yet let's see if this works okay so I think I can delete I'm going to just save that original let me just put all this stuff somewhere well let me just I'm going to throw caution to the wind I'm GNA delete those other files they're in the trash if I need to get back okay so that should be the ding did is the um is the um is the Mobile versus live stream thing sort of worked out or it's that's still an issue um okay so this is really filling up here I need to do a different color let me think about this okay so um I'm going close this I'm going leave this running have my code up am I ready to go okay okay um okay wait no okay um okay here we are I'm in the last part three of the Plinko coding Challenge and you can see I actually left this running for a little bit you can see it's kind of like got a little bit of distribution that's skewed to the left there's a lot of stuff to add to this to make it better and I I'm I hope that uh um those of you watching these videos at the end you'll check the description for the link to the code you'll make their own your own version and you'll see when you look at the code at GitHub there's a readme file that if you make your own variation on it you can actually link to so I encourage you to do if you have questions about how to do that ask it in the comments or tweet me at shiftman but what I want to do is at least make a few improvements to this so number one is I really don't want them all to take the exact same path if you notice they're all taking the exact same path do hits that one hits that one hits that one so I need to introduce some variation here the other thing that I want to do is add a sound each time it hits one of these little pegs maybe I don't know if that's going to become incredibly annoying but I'm going to try that and then I also think that I should add maybe some color to these objects because right now it's very hard to sort of see what's going on with all these balls all these particles on top of each each other okay so uh let me hit refresh here this is what it looks like at the beginning so let's at least first add some rainbow colors for lack of a better idea um and I'm going to do kind of the worst design idea possible which is just say uh this. equals random equals a color that has a random and this is P5 uh function to create a color variable so I'm going to give each object a color which is a random RG and B value and then I'm going to say uh fill with that color and stroke 255 so let's do that and now what uh oh and this should be this this do this do this do for color and now we can see okay at least this is going to help me look at this by getting a bunch of random colors so I like that that's kind of nice and then I also I don't there's no point for the pegs to be green anymore so let's make those pegs uh just plain oldfashioned white so now here's our Plinko board we've got now now let's add some Randomness now there's a few different ways I could do this number one is I could maybe like offset its X location by a little bit um I could give it kind of a little initial velocity or initial Force I could add kind of like a random wind there's so many ways but um yes I should okay okay okay uh hold on PA pause uh um so I'm getting some complaints about the color which I totally agree and also look at this they're kind of I'm getting some like I think the friction and restitution I should probably work on but I'm not going to worry about that randomize the Hue okay let's go back I'm Al I'm taking your suggestion a little bit too seriously um and I'm going to back back up to where I was filling the color and I'm at some point I'm G to say um and I'm going to say okay Matthew this would be a puzzle to edit this back in but pretend I just typed this and I'm going to fill with that color okay uh ala is making a good suggestion in the chat let me do it with color mode HSB um it'll it'll be a little bit nicer um so I'm going to say color mode uh HSB B which changes the colors to having their a hue saturation and brightness and so all I want to do actually is oops I went to that page um this this is a good suggestion it's a little when you by the way um uh thank you this is uh body. velocity is read only body Doos previous ah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so that's a great Point ala um and I maybe I'll bring it up but I'm still going to just randomize our location I think because that's I think too complex for this sorry everybody do over let me just go all the way back where am I here uh particle wait hold on I've got too many things open and what I'm going to do is put it back to what it was and try doing the color again there we go this is what it was before okay okay so let's now um let's now add color to these uh particles so what I'm going to do in the particle uh object is I'm just going to add a new variable this doc color and actually um ala was made the suggestion several times now in the chat I'm going to change the color mode to HSB so instead of creating a color as a red green and blue value I'm going to create a color as a hue saturation and brightness which I think will make it more rainbowy since that's the kind of that's about my only way of thinking of colors so I'm going to say and actually I'm just going to give it a hue of this. hue equals random 360 I believe the default range is between 0 and 360 for Hue values in p5js so now I can say uh I can say fill uh that random Hue and we'll give it um a saturation of 255 and a brightness of 255 and let's um we'll take out the stroke we can also give it a little alpha or maybe it doesn't need Alpha and let's see what happens there we go oh look what I've done so this is giving me now um some colorful um particles but notice how everything else changed because everything else now is a huee saturation brightness so what I need to do is look at everything else that I color this is why I didn't want to do that but uh so I'm just going to change first of all I'm just going to make everything uh White the Plinko things and the boundaries can also be white and then the background can be um uh oh the background can be uh in boundary I've lost my oh no the background in sketch oh I've caused so many problems best of intentions the background can be uh black let's just do that there we go okay I don't know so color is not my strong suit here this is this is so ugly but it's going to have to do right now you are going to improve this and make it beautiful okay so um here we go but now the real important thing that I wanted to do is randomize how they're falling just a little bit so how can I do that um and uh I want to randomize how they're falling so there's a bunch of ways I could do this so uh there's you going to need to really read the documentation if you want to like give it kind of an initial velocity it really actually um there's some tricky ways to do it there's a set velocity function that you can use but I'm going to do something kind of simpler which is I just want to um I just want to give it kind of like a little bit of a random offset in its location so if I go to the particle object um where I where I set the particle location is here The Circle at X so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say X plus equals random1 I'm just going to give it like a little bit of an offset either to the left or the right let's see what that does fell to the right oh fell to the left so I think this is better now so we can see that they're now moving to the left or the right and you know again I'm not sure if there's some Nuance here to really like how we need to like do all the spacing so they bounce against things um more properly well let's let this run for a little while maybe the buckets should be bigger maybe the you know there's lots of things you could do to affect this but I'm going to let this run for a little while and what I'm going to do is add sound now it's quite possible that the sound I recorded my bell so when it hits oh that's going to not be good because it's going to ring the bell quite a bit so I probably need a another and you can see that they're like going off the left and the right but I'm removing them that's fine there's all of you are going to fix this and make it much better let's at least add the sound so now what I have in the um the directory here uh I did this dur when I took a little break if I go to the Plinko example I have an MP3 file ding called Ding which makes a little ding I have a feeling this is going to be somewhat annoying that it's going to make a ding sound but let's let's give it a try anyway and see what happens I think it would be much more exciting to have them be musical notes and maybe in in a certain key or something and it plays a little song I hope you create that so um you can use sound synthesis so I am just going to add a function preload which is a an easy way to load some media assets before the sketch starts without a call back although I certainly could use a call back and I'm going to make a variable called Ding I'm going to say ding equals load sound uh ding. MP3 now one thing I need to make sure sure is in index.html I don't see oh I do have a reference to p5.js so you need to also load the sound library and now what I'm going to do is uh go back to here and I just want to play the sound so what I want to do is I'm just going to add function uh Mouse pressed uh and I'm just say ding. playay so let's just see what this does oh I I so that's basically all I need is that really loud I hope that's okay um I I think I have the volume kind of turned down as it goes in um so now here's the thing I thought oh this will be an easy problem all I have to do is play the sound every time a particle hits a Plinko or a peg oh boy I'm going to have to look at the matter.js documentation because the problem is M oops this camera's off I'm going to have to look at the matter.js documentation because the problem is I'm not in control of the physics remember I just set up the world and said put these things in in these locations and let it go about to sing a copyrighted song which I stopped myself to do okay you really don't want me to um so um how do I know if I'm not in control of the physics engine when a particle hits a peg you know I could start to look at their distance against each other but that's then I'm like the whole point of this I'm not um so Mo so I'm not the one I don't want to do that because then I'm rewriting the physics engine the physics engine is doing this so most physics engines come with some type of event listener a way that I can get a call back function that's triggered Whenever two bodies Collide so I actually have no idea how to do this I haven't tried to do this yet with matter.js I've done it with box 2D and other physics engines so let me come over here and I guess we're just going to have to start looking in the matter.js documentation um so I'm going to look in uh documentation what am I looking for events that sounds right Events off events on a call back function to a given event so this might be right trigger no events on I have a feeling that's it subscribe Now what are my possible event names and what is the object I need some more information here matter.js documentation so let me think about this maybe there's an example uh is there an example matter.js example Collision event uh uh um let's look at this event system issue Collision start um oh do I I do I need Collision matters. events object so Collision so this looks like what I want my oh the object is the engine and collisions start and then I get an event which has pair so this will do for me whoops okay so this looks like exactly what I want to do I want to know when a when a collision has started and I want to know which things have collided so let's grab this code and put it in right here so and okay so matters. event so what I'm going to do I'm gonna I'm going to keep with our way of doing things and I'm going to say events equals matter. events just to keep that in my list of aliases and I'm going to say events on and I should I need to do this in setup so as after I've made the engine I can create I want to assign a collision start event and I'm going to take this out here and say Collision so I'm GNA I think it'll be a little easier to read here if I have my own function called a collision that receives an argument called event so the idea here and I apologize for this not being let me see if I can move this over a little bit so the idea here is that I'm going to say I want to assign a collision start event with this particular engine to this function called collision and then this function Collision will automatically receive an argument called event which is going to have information about what's collided so I'm just going to say console.log event I just want to see what those events look like so let's see if this works ah okay okay stop stop there's too many just's too many of you I just want to look at one so what I see is Collision start a pair the pair has an object it has a body a and a body B I have a feeling that these are the two things that have collided body a and body B so that's good I need that there's probably other there's information about the Collision all sorts of par there's all sorts of stuff in there but I think it's enough for me to look at the event pairs index zero why could there be multip I guess there could be multiple pairs in the same time um that that come into one event but I'm going to um so I want to look at the pairs are event Pairs and then the um Collision is the I'm going to do a loop I'll do a loop that's fine there could be multiple pairs so this is an array probably unnecessary it looks like there's just one pair each time but I'm going to say body a equals pairs index I body a and body b equals pairs index I body B now bodies can have labels names and IDs which could allow you to uh and I think I'm going to need to do this actually I'm going to need to assign them a label um so uh let's just look at this for a second so let's look at what I'm getting and let's just look at console.log body a and body B oh maybe I need to do look at those separately let's just look at one of them let's just look at body a so here we go refresh wait hold on why is that stupid X thing there okay refresh so okay now I'm getting I'm getting a body oh look it even says Circle body it has a label and it has an ID so this one has a label it has a different ID so this is good so the thing that I want to know though is all these things can collide with each other I want to know only when a particle has collided with a Plinko I mean I might want to know when particles collide with each other or particles collide with the the ground body or the wall these bucket things but just for right now I want to know when so so so uh the way that I'm going to do this is there's probably a mechanism in matter.js that might handle this for me but here's the thing this is my thing particle my particle has a body in it and what I want to do is I'm going to say this do body dot uh I'm gonna this is what box2d does actually box2d allows you to sign user data so I'm just going to kind of I I'm trying to think of what's the best way you know actually I'm just say particle oh no no no uh I'm going to say type uh yeah I'm just to say type equals I'm just I'm just going to use a string so I'm adding my own property to the matter.js body called type and I could use the lab maybe I should just use its label I'm going to overwrite its label how about that and I'll call it particle because I'm not using the label for anything else I don't think internally particle. JS is using the label so I need to give particle a label and then in the Plinko thing I'm going to say I'm going to give it a label as Plinko so now what I want to do is in that listener right where I have this Collision I want to console log body. a. label let's look at this particle particle particle particle poo particle particle so let me look at body. a label and body. B label so now we're seeing particle and a plink go particle and Plinko particle and Plinko PLO and a partic particle Plinko and a particle Plinko and a particle particle in a rectangle body right that's the bottom so I only want to play the sound if it's a particle and a Plinko so what I can say now is if body a is a particle and body B oh label so hold on uh let's just call label a equals body A's label and label B is body's B's label got this whole extra Collision listening thing in this video tutorial all of a sudden so now I to say if label a is a particle and label B is a Plinko uh what is what was it called ding. playay and then uh this is a very silly way that I'm going to write this because there's all sorts of nicer ways I can write this but also you know if the first one was a Plinko and the second one is a particle also play the sound so let's give this a try and see what happens oh my God okay okay stop stop please nobody ever run this program again you get the idea though so I encourage you to think be more thoughtful about this let's comment this out right now let's comment that out to think about how could you you know have a different label or a different type for each row how could you have a bunch of different sound did that really hurt everybody's ears I'm so sorry um I there needs to be a warning is that going to be like do I need to do that again so hopefully this isn't ruining everybody's ears but I'm actually done with this this is Plinko I'm going to let it run uh for a little while uh thank you for watching this was uh I could have recorded my uh train whistle thing um so this is the Plinko coding challenge in matter.js I hope that you make a better version of this maybe you think of create I me you uh you think about the visual design of it you think about the sound aspect of it you think about why you're using it in the first place um perhaps you can use it as a part of a game or something else or a poetry generator um I'm sure there are like lots of in accuracies in terms of like an actual perfect Plinko board that creates a nice normalized distribution you should see a nice bell curve so maybe you can make a variation of it where you really see that bell curve U perfectly um so share those with me um share share the versions you make and uh I'll see you in another coating challenge someday thanks for watching okay um so there we go everybody it is8 o'clock this always happens this has now been almost a twohour live stream of the Plinko coding challenge the thing that I want to do let me see if I can find this example really quickly the thing that I didn't get to today but I'll give you a future teaser I I don't know when I'm going to get to this too many things I wanted to do today I wish I could just stay here all night and keep coding it's lots of fun um I'm going to go to my uh class syllabus github.com shiftman I'm just going to show you where this example is for any of you who are interested I'm going to go to uh repositories this is the current course that I'm teaching at NYU physics and animation I made an extra example so I'm just going to instead of cloning the repository I'm just going to download it and um I'm going to open it up and this is the other coding challenge that I hope to do and this one I've actually done already so unlike that Plinko one I'm kind of doing it from scratch this is essentially um this is um this is exactly my coding Challenge number something somebody can tell me in the chat it's a coding challenge where I made a cloth simulation in 3D this is exactly that cloth simulation 10,000 steps on my Fitbit um cloth simulation but instead of a cloth hanging down a cloth attached to a pole on the side with wind blowing it's a flag simulation and what I'm going to do really quickly before I run it for you is I'm just going to go to where I'm rendering it and I'm going to comment out out this uh texture and I'm going to say uh stroke 255 and I'm going to run it and oh you can't see that so um well what this is if I zoom in is it's a lot of uh hold on stroke weight one um you can see this is that mesh and uh you can see this is like a little flag simulation and there's a little pearing noise wind um uh pushing it to the right and what I can do the thing that I want to show you is in addition to seeing that mesh I can turn off the stroke and I don't remember what it's using it's using a cat uh this cat uh so I can texture it with that cat and now I have my cat flag so this is the thing that I wanted to do I guess I will pick this up next week I doesn't seem very likely that I'll have time to do a bonus live stream before next Friday so far in the last two days I did a live stream yesterday for two hours this morning for two hours and now for about 2 hours it's like 6 hours in two days which is pretty good thank you patrons for like helping motivate me to do this kind of stuff um but I will come back and uh show you this so someone's asking ah the reason why I wanted to show this is um I'm having trouble getting image texturing to work in P5 and I haven't dug into it I have a feeling it's mostly not implemented yet um but I have seen some texture examples this is running and processing and using 3D so um but you could do this in 2D texturing Works in 2D but I haven't really investigated how well this works in P5 so if anybody wants to download this example and sort of help figure out like what's working in P5 what's not working maybe dig into that maybe we could work together as a community to uh help add this feature to P5 to get this texturing working um that's something oh a gif on a flag yes that's got to happen right okay so anyway I encourage you to check out this example um I am now going to play my Goodbye song I have this mobile live stream is still going uh hello uh mobile live stream uh you can now uh see all the pieces for an action you can see here there's my computer there's my preview screen this is the chat that's going on right now just the simulation would be great in P5 without the texturing so that should work what well beard scratching noise is so nice oh did I have like a weird beard scratching noise um you know the Goodbye song is called uh rainbow from I believe I got it from I I think I got it from free music archive so I often use a free music archive to um to look for a royaltyfree uh public domain Creative Commons licensed music um Etc uh textures on a sphere you absolutely can do uh one nice thing about inp um Urban at work is asking one thing about processing if you want to texture a sphere is you can actually processing will texture it for you automatically if you use the pshape object so I'm doing it manually by setting all the vertices of the shape and the pixels but um a sphere you don't you don't you could do that uh yourself and I have a sphere geometry tutorial that you could watch um please read some numbers is there are people really requesting me to read numbers pause how do I how do I pause the that pauses everything that stops IT all right here's some more numbers for you guys you asked for it my children are probably going to bed right now course they're not going to bed right now on a Friday probably bouncing off the walls but tonight I won't read this to them what have we been reading that's good we've been reading some really good stuff recently uh I'm 24,179 78,500 now I'm doing it okay Q&A not numbers yes I think that's a smart let me go back to my song started over so You' got an extra three minutes so I'm going to look for some questions in the chat um pi to 30,000 digits four numbers read pie look here's the thing people people for those of you who are watching this book a million random digits I will read the entire book if I get to a million subscribers I will read the entire book I don't know if that's realistic or how I'm going to make that happened so I probably should really got to regret having said that cuz at least should read one page and figure out how long that takes cuz there's a lot of pages but that's my plan it would it be would it be possible to change that falling particle to a rectangle and change the color upon Collision right yes absolutely so and I forgot I never did anything about rotation so I completely forgot the rotation uh time uh so okay um can I solve the Rubik's Cube I'm not good at things like the Rubik's Cube no I'll just be sweating um why does this book exist it's actually a really there's actually a really good reason why this book exists this book is from the' 40s I believe and we take it for granted that we we could just have random number generators at are fingertips to run certain kinds of simulations to simulate how stock prices might to think about random walks so to speak and um you know I I could read you this introduction here the volume you are holding documents a remarkable undertaking by a group of mathematicians engineers and data processors that ran in the 1940s and 50s to create a very large assembly of randomly distributed numbers or digits so um you know there's a lot of cryptography problems all sorts of of scientific mathematical problems that require random numbers and in the 40s and 50s you couldn't just say math. random so is Plinko still running let's yeah I should always have a cat flag behind me uh yep Plinko is still running so this is not tuned very well so many of them it's not very full because so many of them are going off the edge so um I need to work on that uh what was your first computer and programming language my first computer was an Apple 2 plus somewhere in elementary school and I did learn some basic when I had that um ah on your Vimeo page I saw a video called Neo Geo that that project was actually made with box 2D um so it's a sort of crazy it's a it's a collaboration with an artist named um Marina ziral um and so this is I'm looking for the one though I have like sort of high resolution yeah this one so um this is a video that is a kind of simulation of in a way like oil drilling not an accurate scientific unfortunately it's U I'm sure the YouTube compression is kind of a disaster here trying to reshow this but and in a little bit there'll be like a little bit of a gush of oil there we go um so this is all crazily done with box 2D it does not run in real time so all the physics were surrendered after the fact okay I got to get go and get home um I'm going to see if there's one last question anything in slack uh Plinko still running I checked so thank you everybody for watching thank you for your support um I hope to next week launch the coding train store uh if you're interested in sort of tshirts and mugs I think is probably all we have at this point but I'm using a service called printful.com so I if people have real interest in other products I could definitely release them uh it's uh and then I might also if I have time then it's a you know it does ship internationally but is expensive so I might look for some other International options so that's one thing uh I talked about Google summer of code I meant to talk about it in uh that's the Tshirt I'm wearing in the earlier this morning live stream so um I should try to find but what I need to remember to do someone remind me is to tweet out a link to this morning's live stream the time code where I talk about Google summer of code so if you're interested I mentioned a bit about that um and can I sell this yellow it's not like a thing now uh that's sort of interesting idea well I'm going to have a coding train mug as soon as I get mine it just hasn't been shipped to me yet um I based in New York City show us the mug well I have this mug I have a magic mug look at this it's an invisible mug uh because as we know it's important when you're riding a train and coating to stay hydrated okay thank you everybody I'm going to go over here and click this this stop button uh I I
