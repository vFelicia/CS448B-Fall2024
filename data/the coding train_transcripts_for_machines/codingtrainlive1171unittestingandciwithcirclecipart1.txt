hello happy Friday good morning it's me dan Shipman live with the coding train and today is a special day is background research just to explain kind of loud but I kind of timed it so I started when there's only ten seconds left in this song well as everyone's kind of entering into this livestream just wait so today's a little bit different than my usual Friday's for a couple reasons one is let me just say on the outset that I have kind of a complicated schedule today yet I will be in this building for the whole day until at least 5 p.m. Eastern time which is about five out oh that's like six and a half hours or something like that but I do have all these like little appointments some of them for like 15 minutes some of them for an hour so I what I plan to do is kind of livestream my bagel oh wait I have to go pause stop I'm gonna leave I'll come back and turn it on again pause stop leave come back again so there's gonna be a probably a bunch of stopping and starting today ideally it'll just be you know a session now for an hour or so stop take a break come back and then another couple hours but we'll see I might have to stop and start at a moment's notice because I'm waiting for an important training schedule this important phone call that I have to deal with so I'm even more absurdly like kind of keeping an eye on my phone during the livestream today which is probably in some universe very unprofessional but this is by no means a professional operation nothing about this whatsoever is professional as evidenced by the fact that that camera will soon turn off and have to walk over there press a button but you know I also feel okay with doing this maybe I'm just trying to convince myself here because really my goal for the live streams is to just sort of expose the process of creating the tutorials but if you're really here to consume what might possibly be somewhat educational content you know it's certainly just wait for the edited videos that will come over the weekend or next week okay so I am not seeing anyone complain about sound or video or image now oh now that was one reason why today is a little bit different here's another reason why today is different I am doing a sponsored tutorial and the sponsor of this tutorial is a company called circle CI circle CI is a company that provides continuous integration as a service notice I'm not gonna drink any water today because I don't want our sponsors to compete with each other water and circle see hi this I just have some nice I'm also getting a cold which is not good because if I was really have a lot of content I want to do today but as many of you might remember well first of all I'm very accidentprone as evidenced by my completely now mostly healed broken arm in multiple places actually multiple broken arms anyway that's another story but I am an addition to being accident prone I'm very prone to the losing of the voice so I have to when I get a cold if this happened to me last year it was very extreme I'll I couldn't talk for like two or three weeks because I overdid it teaching and talking and presenting so we'll see I think I'm fine for today but if things start to go in terms of the vocal cords I might have to take some nice breaks and drink some more ginger tea alright so here's the thing this is kind of interesting because I am NOT somebody who knows very much at all or has experience with continuous integration or unit testing which is good which is a part of this discussion so I'm my intention is to make a few tutorials one is to talk about my sense of unit testing and integration what they what it is and why it's useful and look at a really simple kind of hello world example of a JavaScript program with unit testing and continuous integration using circle CI so there's gonna be a lot of node and github and JavaScript as part of this as well then I want to see if I can add some unit testing and continuous integration to the little matrix library that I was work that I've been working on for the neural network tutorials and then I might try to just do it a little fun extra bit to see what other kind of goofy things whatever strange little things we can get up to by having a process separate process run on a separate server every time we try to merge or commit or our code that sort of thing so um so that's the plan I really apologize who's a small chance at any moment I'm just gonna have to run for like 15 or 20 minutes then come back and the stream I could leave it on but I don't think that makes sense I probably turn it off and restart it so I have to apologize in advance so here we go so I think I want to just jump right in there is also definitely a class going on in the room a runaway going knock on the wall so I might do a little less shouting hopefully which won't bother anybody I don't think so let me see let me get a little set up here because I'm going to need oh oh I should use AI term this would be a good day to use AI term but I'm not going to I'm just gonna use my old fashioned terminal but I'm really gonna need to use terminal for this so I'm gonna have terminal like as a thing over here that you can always see okay then I'm gonna need I'm gonna need our text editor Adam a hard text editor okay so I'm gonna make a folder called Circle C I test testing test testing test test testing test test that's the name of my project oh I can't do CD I've got to make that directory make directory testing test test okay CD testing test test and then I want to open that in Adam and close these snakes and ladders game okay I don't need any code in there I need coding train github just so small maybe I can just do this for right now but the problem is I need to be able to see this button over here that'll be fine then I've got this the cameras are about to shut off was that one already did a testing test test and add them okay so let's start with this open all right cameras back on and so I'm just gonna you can barely believe this where we even like am I signed into the right accounts I'm being asked in the slack channel by the way if you're wondering the slack channel is in a channel for patrons of the coding train where you can talk about if you want and ask questions and get a little help and Oh before I begin let me thank a couple people let me thank fun fun function mpj i did watch his videos about testing and circle CI over the course of this week hopefully I won't by accident just be repeating the things he says different voice about his videos are awesome I love his goofy like coffee stick and like oh I need some I need some good coffee stick I mean I've watched his videos before but I think I've always just been watching them in bits and pieces I was really watching them all the way through and they're quite wonderful a really nice approach lovely studio going to support going get get out of here right now and go and watch some videos from mtj perhaps about unit testing and continuous integration hopefully mine will be a little bit more basic a little bit more big even beginnerfriendly than what he's doing which is kind of like is it launching more into using it with like a more complex web app alright just a fork of atom that has a train in the corner what what what coding train text editor okay alright um I'm just gonna check to see if this is the thing that I have to go do right now it doesn't seem to be a thing so I'm assuming it's good I'm gonna be good til 1130 okay which is 45 minutes from now all right we see this cold not good wake up audience all right all right here we go got a marker got a tissue I've got the coding train get up I do want to be logged into my account I think that's just gonna make the most sense all right so this first this first tutorial I'm going to try to explain unit testing and and actually let me get a couple URLs open because I think this will be useful okay so that's p5 yeah that's fine yeah great okay I need that URL as well okay here we go yes maybe it makes sense for me to have this here on my opening screen hello welcome to a special tutorial thing on the coding train with me I don't need to introduce myself I mean I probably should but anyway so I've been over time making lots of different already no no this is terrible hello welcome to a special tutorial on the coding train so this tutorial is about wow this this series I'm probably gonna be two or three or four or five and eventually thousands of videos long about unit testing and continuous integration and on this tutorial series these three videos that about three that I think I've got to make or sponsored by circle CI which is a company that provides a service called continuous integration and you might be wondering ah what is continuous integration and hopefully after you watch these videos you will think what is contagious haha continuous integration so and I actually admit and I should say that's right at the outset that the idea of continuous integration and really unit testing while not completely new to me is not something that's part of my practice or workflow but it is something that I would like to aspire to have more of in the future and actually I was I've been way off in my thinking in it that I've realized in learning and researching about this that it was something that would get in the way of my development and making of projects in a kind of creative rapid prototyping way and in fact it's something that I think can be so useful and and make contributing to open source a friendlier and easier experience now hopefully by the end of the videos I'm going to make by the end I'm gonna well I proven I don't know proven well I've made the case for that but let's see if we can do that so what is so so before let's where am I going before I even talk about continuous integration ah let's talk about something called unit dried out marker let's talk about something called unit testing and I would also recommend watching mpj fun fun function has some great videos about these same topics and npj says which kind of clicked into my head that unit testing you can think of a piece of software as a bunch of separate units right you've got this big complex idea you to break it into little parts solve all those little parts and unit testing these units is the idea of testing each one of those parts to make sure they're working individually on their own so that if you have a big code base and you change one thing here but don't realize it's gonna break this other unit testing his way of saying I made this code I can feel confident that everything is still working that I haven't broken my code so that's what unit testing is for and in fact unit testing is something that's used in a lot of opensource libraries and projects for example the probably the place where I first encountered unit testing and wrote my first unit tests was is for the project p5.js itself so this is the p5.js library this is the repository for that I use and a lot of my almost all of my coding challenges and tutorials and one thing you'll notice here is that look at this there's this nice folder called source so I don't want to get too off topic here but what's interesting about p5 you might know p5 you might remember p5 as the library file called p5.js or p5 dot min Duchess but if you're working on p5 you're not working on this giant library file there's a build process there's actually all these smaller source files write folders with different JavaScript files that get bundled and packaged into the JavaScript library so for example if I look in this math folder here and I look here under file if I say I'm gonna look under random uhoh pause timeout oh okay okay sorry so I this is so I should have just started later because I had a feeling this was gonna happen but then I didn't want to lose all the time so I unfortunately have to go and I expect to be back in about 15 or 20 minutes we'll just consider this practice I'm gonna come back to exactly where I was right now so I will be right I'm so sorry about that it looks like terrible that I'm actually doing something from sponsored content but but so I'm really sorry about this but I'm I this is just a important thing that I have to do I am leaving the microphone or I will also probably on this page like put a time up when I know when I'm getting back it's really just a phone call I'll be back in 15 20 minutes okay thank you everybody yes I knew this is terrible
