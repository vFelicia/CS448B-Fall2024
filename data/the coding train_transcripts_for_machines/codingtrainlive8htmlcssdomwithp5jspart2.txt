here test test test I'm trying a new wave of streaming I don't even have the mic in or anything it says the stream is offline uh let's see here live dashboard is anyone watching this zero people come on somebody tell me if this is working okay test test ah there's a slam on the door sorry that was very loud I'm testing a new streaming way of streaming uh oh I'm hearing myself somewhere anywhere no maybe I'm just echoing to myself hello hello hello hello echo echo okay uh great I see great thank you all right so you hear me look so actually I'm using a new version of wirecast which I have here and that's why I have this like infinite Zoom thing uh but I'm trying to see how far behind um how far behind the stream is so I'm going to make a funny expression in face and then count and see how long till I see it in the actual uh see all in the delay so here we go 1 1,00 2 1000 3 1,000 4 1,000 5 1,000 6 1,000 7 1,000 8 1,000 9 1,000 10 1,00 11 1,00 12 1,00 30 1,00 401 so about 14 or 15 seconds is the lag between when I do something and you see it uh okay um I have only 35 minutes um I swear I'm hearing myself back audio somewhere hello but I don't know where that's coming from I got like three different machines in here all doing different things uh so one of the things I need to do here is I need to actually also set up my recording output out okay that's fine this the quality may be affected for a second uh record to dis uh okay and then no no no no no no uh Pro res 720 16 by9 I don't know let's just see what that does uh more options no uh sorry I'm like live configuring my my wirecast here so apologies for that uh I should have done this in advance ah shoot cord to dis more um let me try add cord to disk MP4 let's try that uh okay HD yeah this is what I want perfect I I want to compress it uh uh here we go so I don't want this one I want this one I wanted to go to the desktop and I want it to be called ICM 2015 uh save and okay so oops no no no don't close this close this okay hi everybody Google uh I could I'm smaller than I Ed usually am I made myself a little smaller and the green screening isn't perfect I should fix that and I swear I'm hearing myself Fe feedback coming out of somewhere which computer is that maybe it's this one hold on I think I know which one it is uh it's the it's the wirecast it's it's the uh okay I need to log back into wirecast and I need to go to this computer and turn volume off and that should do the trick I no longer hear myself echoing excellent um there are two people watching which is good because I'm not doing anything um and uh I've got all sorts of analytics I've got a permanent URL stream options I could play an ad let's see what happens if I play an ad you guys tolerate this for a second all two of you are watching the based on some complex criteria some of your viewers will see an ad keep streaming anybody seeing an ad uh is the volume okay um all right um okay I so actually I'm gonna come back to what I was doing so I was making some videos before and I was trying to get something to work ah and my problem is I didn't update p5js I thought I did but I didn't okay hold on I'm fixing something uh today copy it over here uh uh no that's the wrong one hold on everybody and the volume is cool Valene well thank you for watching the Valene ad I maybe I made about quarter of a cent or something uh okay it's what's what's good about this though is I know not very many people are going to tune into this but I often take these like short little breaks I could just click the play ad button um sorry I'm trying to what I'm trying to do right now is fix an ISS issue I had with the previous videos I was making um I don't know where why I've Got Sublime Text open I need to go and get the newest p5js and I actually just want this single file and I want to close the editor and I want to find the example I'm making which was under Dom under slider other events and I want want this p5js file in there and I want this one to go away and then I want to launch the editor again I don't know uh quick Chrome close all these things and uh launch the editor again and there we go I have a feeling this is going to work now no error oh what did I do oh oh editor crash editor crash technology okay um uh I thought Lauren McCarthy are you there maybe she's in the hallway oh no she's teaching in class so there's a there's a trying to make a certain Feature work in p5js that was recently added but there was also a bug in a recent version of p5js which caused the editor to break I don't even know if I have the most recent version of the editor this is great to do this Live Well I could definitely use another editor I'm just uh trying to use um uh let me uh let me see here if I have the most recent version of the editor oh you know what I know what it is that I can fix manually aha so editor crashing with this version uh the line of code where it's crashing was comment this line out uh this doevents device motion equals null so um let me get the editor again open uh and let me go into here find let's just comment that out oops no no no no no I need to open the actual thing that I want to open other events and go to libraries p5js and I move this over here if anyone wants to watch what I'm doing def find this there we go and that should do the trick doesn't crash and this was it there we go success nobody has any nobody cares but I I I recorded a video earlier today which was like 20 minutes long 10 minutes of it was trying to debug this problem uh and oh three people somebody else joined I can see exactly the number I love this new YouTube live streaming thing who are you third person who's not Sharon Dela Cruz or Jay David I ber oh you left cuz there's only two people watching or one of you left when when you have such a small audience like me I can pinpoint exactly who's there and who's not there um all right it is 230 p.m. I am going to see I'm going to see if I can make uh another video um and uh hide sidebar uh actually show sidebar I'm going to close the browser here uh so this is where I am these are this is my list videos I'm going to see if I can do a CSS video so this video number six here is the one that was a total sort of failure and I I should go back and rerecord it or do it in a different way or leave it as it is and record an extra little section that fixes it um but in the uh uh but in the um uh in the brief amount of time that I have I think I'm going to do the uh uh CSS and style uh video so couple things I need to do one is I just need to test that my recording system is actually working so I'm going to do that for a second and I'm going to hit record and then I'm going to dance around and sing um what's the song that I've uh there's usually a song that I sing I don't know what it is never mind no singing no singing aloud I'm going to go over here fraka F I'm not over here there we go uh you can see that the camera is in slightly the wrong position there we go that maybe helps uh to focus okay can you read this uh I'm going to come back over here and test this and I'm going to hit stop recording and then I should see on the desktop a file that I just recently recorded uh and it says today 234 p.m. ICM _ 0 41 megabytes I'm going to open up this video file and play it I turn the volume on to see if there's sound I'm check uh I want to check um my God I'm losing my mind I shouldn't live stream when I'm just like doing testing but I have to test that this new way works show movie inspector uh 30 frames per second 1280 by 720 data size data rate all right I'm happy with this close this turn the volume back off close close so who would like who is there interested in the topic of more comments below only one everybody left one person who are you one person who Happ to left their left their browser open by accident um uh okay um let's see here uh uh okay um let's see maybe I should work on the green screening you guys want to this is going to I wonder if I can do this live while while I'm streaming so if I hit edit shot and I go to the green screen and I go to the chroma key and I check you can see are you seeing I should uh go back to the live dashboard you should see me right now in front of a green wall oh you can see the like Shadow here which is really because of the lighting let's see if I can fix that a little bit better worse oh you know what it is it's this table here I don't really care so much but I really should probably make that better um uh I have a light that I think just needs to point up more so if I put something under it like a book I I'll do anything to not have to record a video about CSS apparently this is an empty box let's do that o that created a strange new Shadow probably just need to put it over here and now I'm going to trip on myself I also oh look at this like weird extra Shadows I I'll work on this later good enough for now that's a little bit little bit better a little bit better little bit worse who knows um let's uh go back to use chroma key and uh I see and now I I do this okay no defaults uh pick color key with the mouse uh oh well I think that'll just be good enough uh yeah seeing in front of the text not pure green uh okay let's see do I have time 239 um I have 20 minutes shall I make this happen yeah okay I'm going to do something about CSS CSS style so I'm I just want to make an example a little bit from scratch I'll leave the button get rid of the slider and the input field I'll leave the background color variable I will get rid of this canvas event stuff um and oh I definitely need a create P I need a and I'm going to get rid of all these these events and uh and let me make this like this and uh oh yes it doesn't look so great the green screen okay um and uh let me run this and see change color is not defined a problem see kind far can I get away with this okay change color is not to find that's all right I don't need an event right now all right uh and there we go okay uh I have this web page I have the editor uh I have the HTML file only thing I want to do here is this indent it correctly and okay now getting ready here to make this video ah the green screen got a little better I think it has to do with um how much sunlight is coming in here I it was working so much better this morning because I had the Sun and uh this Shadow here which is really where is the shadow it's over here but this is a this is a table oh you know what I can do is I can just make myself I know what to do uh you don't need to see so much of me move myself down a little bit there you go over it this way myself down uh and that's going to help did that not change anything uh riveting I'm sure you guys are just can't stop watching this right if I do that how come it's not updating uh maybe it can't update live and oh it is working it's like behind oh it stops me uh create button is something built into p5js I'm a tiny person I shouldn't be I I hope I can delete this I'm going to probably have to delete this one uh let me just get it exactly where I want it and just hope it works raise my hands up to there over there okay this will just have to do um yeah the shadow keeps coming and going it's getting better and worse depending on the light that's coming in from outside uh 243 okay I I'm going to try to make something happen um let me look at my list um and okay wait wait I I need this CSS reference page open um if I go to like background color uh I don't know that I love this background color blue color color units I'm like this is not my okay hold on Mozilla CSS reference let's try this this is good background color if I click here yeah there we go this is better okay great I'm going to use this particular reference um okay so I have 15 minutes um I'm going to mute myself I'm going to I'm going to record a video in two minutes I'm going to mute myself and be right okay I'm back I don't know if anyone's still there uh for people are there perhaps if you're there say something say hello uh and tell me if the audio and the picture is fine can you see this I'm going to erase all this um and and I'm about to take 10 minutes to make a short video Lesson about uh CSS and the style function in p5js okay and it is 247 p.m. oops it's 247 p.m. eastern time I have uh office hours appointments at 3M so I meant to do this from 2 to 3 but I I set up an entirely new streaming system I'm very small here um uh um and it took me 45 minutes to do that so I sort of lost all my time but I'm going to try to at least get one more video out I did a whole bunch this morning um and uh Mark Abby is in the chat Mark Abby is in the chat uh he has done a ton of work on the uh Dom Library over the summer and and uh as part of Google sum of code a lot of the new features are thanks to him and uh if you have actual questions about how it works or what it does you can ask in the chat he knows more about it than I do and I am I shrinking I feel so tiny uh okay I'm just gonna leave it um okay um here we go oh look at this I swear every time I look over I'm getting smaller I'm going to just set check these settings One Time One More Time time on this shot um there we go ah I see I have to click in and out okay I should be I got a lot of Shadow and a lot of issues going on but it's such as life I need to the lighting somehow in here just totally changed but um here we go I only have 10 minutes now if I keep talking I'm going to lose all my time uh all right so this video is about a giant topic one again that I know very little about uh and that topic is CSS and so uh you know there's been a bunch of videos here that I've made about the Dom the document object model web pages HTML Pages JavaScript how they control HTML Pages let's just take a step back for a moment and and and look at the pieces we know about and what's this third piece that I'm adding so this web page this thing that you're seeing in the browser or in the sort of browser window of the p5js editor where I'm writing all the code there the the thing that this page loads is a file called index.html okay so and this is not a good pen I'm switching pens in this file there is some content written into that file for example uh there is a header that's at the top of the page there's a paragraph this file is also referring to some JavaScript code uh it's referring to a bunch of different things like the p5js library file uh our own code which is in a file called sketch. and in those files we're doing some JavaScript stuff like making a canvas drawing a circle to that canvas and perhaps even as we've seen in previous videos making other Dom elements like more paragraphs and affecting those and changing those elements so you can think of uh these pieces as HTML this is really the structure and you could also say like initial content in a way like what's on the page when it first loads of that web page JavaScript is logic code things that can handle events store information make all sorts of magic happen this is what you can think of as the behavior of the page so this is where you and I and every body else who's doing this stuff is writing code to control what's happening on that page over time based on us your interaction based on some mathematical algorithm based on whatever you might fancy you like to draw rainbows in a canvas unicorns do that with JavaScript I'm adding unicorns to my repertoire here only was at rainbrow okay so um then the last piece here that I want to talk about is this idea of CSS and CSS stands for cascading style sheets I don't know why they're cascading probably has to do with some sort of like nesting and whatever and somebody on the internet who really knows this stuff will hopefully write in the comments why it's cascading but the keyword there is style so if you want to affect various aspects of the layout of this page you want the canvas to actually float on the right side of the page rather than the left side of the page you want to change the font that's in the paragraphs you want to change the background color of a paragraph you want to any just about anything that you can imagine that has to do with the visual look and feel of that page can be controlled with this idea of CSS now once again we're in the same place as we were with HTML you could write HTML into that index.html file or you could dynamically sort of insert HTML elements into the page using JavaScript you can write you can sort of in give some initial content you can also control those elements using JavaScript the same thing is true with CSS there is a kind of file camera went off there is a kind another kind of file you could write uh I've disappeared from the world but I am still here you cannot see me but I am still here I will never leave until every one last person on Earth actually most people on Earth don't really need to know about CSS or maybe they should I don't really know I I that was a terrible idea but you're here watching this video maybe CSS is useful to you I'm gonna keep going um the HTML file the Javascript file now you can also add information about styles to another kind of file named maybe style named whatever you want css. JS for javascript. HTML for html. CSS now we're in what I meant by saying we're in the same situation is I want to talk about how do you add that style stuff to style.css and then or and or how much you add style dynamically on the Fly based on user interaction based on some set of behaviors in JavaScript this is the bigger picture here and then there's lots of details to fill in boy am I rambling about this but hopefully it's making some sense okay so how does CSS work CSS works on a sing a couple different principles one is this idea of a selector so you need to have a selector meaning what are are the things that you want to select to style do you want to select all the paragraphs on the page do you want to select just this one particular paragraph do you want to select the canvas do what what Dom elements do you want to select in order to style after you say after you specify that selector so for example let's say you want to style all the paragraph elements on the page your selector would be P then you need some open and close curly brackets much like you always do when you're doing these kinds of things to to denote the beginning and end of the stuff that will the style information that will be applied to that paragraph once you have that all you need are a series of name value pairs this looks kind of like a JavaScript object but the syntax is a little bit different these name value pairs are like what's the property you want to style and what's the value for that style for example I want to style the background color and I want the background color to be black or white that's white oh I want it to be like pinkish F ZF so you can be asking your question like oh my God what what is that that looks terrifying to me there's like a pound symol and then a letter and then a number so there's a lot of things to learn this is a certain kind of special way of writing a color information you know I think maybe this would have been a little bit simpler if I just wrote the word pink here or purple here that would also work there are a variety of different ways so now the question is what are the kinds of things that can go here you know font size is one of them I think so if I want to like change the font size there's so much that could go here how do you know what the possibilities are how do you add that to your CSS and then how do you do that with JavaScript how much time do we have uh I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go to the code and look at how that some of this works okay I I've disappeared but I'm going to come back to life Sun shine rain down upon me and give me some light and have I shall appear now in front of the camera okay I have to turn this down uh okay so here I am with a p5js project in the p5js editor I'm going to run this and you can see there again we're back here I have this H1 element this paragraph element this canvas another paragraph element a button some of these elements are written here into the HTML body right in advance these are HTML elements that appear on the page as soon as it loads some of these elements are created with JavaScript made dynamically when the program runs create a paragraph create a button okay this is where we are how do I start to style let's style that paragraph Okay so actually um what I'm going to do even though I said over here uh come back even though I said over here you can create I'm was going to create a separate CSS file I'll do that in a later video what actually this buttons a little hyperactive what actually I think I would like to do is show you how you can actually add CSS style information directly into the HTML page so inside of this head tag where I'm referring to JavaScript files I could also potentially refer to some style information so what's that syntax paragraph I want to select all of the paragraphs on the page and assign them a background color which is uh purple I wish I could type rainbow there do you think it works if I type rainbow there I doubt it okay so now if I save and I run this again we can see look this paragraph element has a purple background this paragraph element has a purple background you know what it's very hard for me to see the text so I think if I say this color it refers to the color of the text inside the paragraph I think and now you can see I have white text with a purple background it looks a little crowded in there so something that I might add to this is some padding and how much padding how about eight pixels PX for Pixel so I'm going to do this and look ah look at this I've got some nice padding now so this is the basic idea of CSS I need to select something on the page and then give it some properties what's the property what's the value what's the the property what's the value how do you know what all these possible properties are well you need to look this stuff up you could get books you watch other videos that where someone really knows about CSS is talking about this but um but uh and this is where so so let's look for this briefly in a moment and I have a couple more minutes left uh I am going to um uh ah so I am on here developer. Mozilla um so this is one place I'll put some links in the description for this video but here is a URL of where I could find some information about CSS I'm going to remove this part here this is a CSS reference there's a tutorial there's demos uh I want to look at the ref an exhaustive I'm exhausted already an exhaustive reference I'm going to look at the exhaustive reference and I'm going to see like look these are all of the possible things I could add there's so much I just keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling but we can look under I can look for like background color and you can see background color is right over here I can click on it and what do I see now I see here are some examples of of different ways that I can call background color I could say red I could say RGB I could say current all sorts of ways so this is a topic for another time another video for you to look on your own there's another CSS reference that I like to use if I could find it in my history here um I think it's this one right so I'll include a link to this this is a nice reference of all sorts of possible uh parameters in CSS the things that I want to focus on in in my videos is less about the full encompassing of all of the CSS reference and more about two things one is this how how do these selectors work what are other ways that I could specifically address a single paragraph or only some paragraph there's a lot of ways you can use these selectors so I want to get to that and the other thing I want to get to is how do you do style dynamically in JavaScript so um with p5js specifically so let's take at least another video um um I'm one of my future videos I'm going to talk more about selectors but in this particular video I want to look at the style function so here if I come back if I quit Chrome for a second and I come back to this we can see that these particular elements now these paragraph elements are all styled based on the hardcoded style information that's in the HTML file inside of the style tags but another thing I can do is right over here I can for any HTM any element that I create with P5 and later I'm going to show you any element that I access in P5 whether it was created or not I can call a function called style which then requires just two arguments what are those arguments the name of the style property the value of the style property so if I were to put right here in quotes background color and then I were to say in here in quotes pink you can see look at this this particular element is still getting the style from the HTML page this particular element whop I'm not there uh this particular element that down here is getting the style from my code so the when I apply a piece of styling dynamically in code uh it's going to overwrite the style that was originally set up in the HTML page so there's a lot of pieces here and for you essentially if you're following these videos along what I would suggest you do is try adding some style to the HTML file in the same way that I did here try adding some Styles this way what other tags might you reference try adding some Styles this way what happens if you add styles to other kinds of elements that aren't just paragraph elements and lastly and I'll do this for you really quickly set something style with an event okay let's think about this for example what if I say uh what if I were to say button. mous pressed change style right so now I am attaching the change style event to the Press of this button and what is that change style event it's a function that I need to write right the code inside this function right here will execute when I click the mouse on that button and maybe I'll change the text style to Pink and maybe I'll give it a lot more padding because who doesn't love padding jazz hands I don't know feel like that's going to be that's JavaScript the musical that's my first song who doesn't love padding you with me on that okay uh so now if we look at this everything's got its default style I'm going to trigger that event I got some more padding and uh a pink background so and you know maybe what I want to do I just I got to do a little bit more say text Mouse over change style oops and then uh I'll say button I'll say text Mouse out revert Style and what I can do here and I'm going to I'm just showing you some other things uh revert style and background purple padding eight pixels so let's take out the button event for a second I'm using Mouse out and mouse over I Mouse over I Mouse out I Mouse over I Mouse out I Mouse over that's a very rhythmic um so you can see here that you can start to highlight things make things happen based on button presses based on Mouse over bouse out based on the movement of a slider as we saw in the previous video so many possibilities so now you have something to work with try adding some style to the HTML page try adding some style using the style function see what types of elements what types of designs you can make and I'm going to come back and look at this again and again and again in several videos looking at other different types of scenarios with more events and more ways of selecting Elements which uh classes and IDs is the topic for that and just as a reminder uh go and look in those references that'll be linked below as to where you can find all this stuff so I'm 5 minutes over time not that that is relevant to you especially if you're watching this sometime in the future like in the year 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in my my childhood the year 2000 seemed like very far away uh the year 3000 is anybody watching this if you're watching this the year 3000 please go and get my brain out of that cryogenic thing that it's in and I don't know yeah do something with it talk to me about rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you in a future video I have toit stop now okay live stream I don't know if that came across and worked uh anybody there's some discussion here uh so thanks for I I've got to go unfortunately I'm going to try to do some more live streams as soon as I have some more time I've got a whole long list of Dom manipulation videos to make and also I um I have a whole bunch from this morning that I need to upload and correct because there were some problems in them so goodbye for now please be in touch and uh I hope to see you all again in this weird strange context that is this live streaming thing uh okay how do I stop this um I wonder if I just hit settings here no oh wait look I'll play an ad who wants to watch an ad while I wait to figure out how to stop I won't do the ad right now the stream is public advanced settings maybe I'm just supposed to stop it from clicking a button in wirecast so I'm going to do that okay I'm going to click this button it's definitely going to shut off goodbye
