so hello everyone we'll be starting in about five minutes this is just me testing to make sure my microphone is working so you can say hello in the chat if it is do do do do do hello everyone we'll be starting in about five minutes just me testing to make sure my microphone is working so you can say hello in the chat if it is hi everyone if you heard a strange echo it's because i had the live stream open on my computer so the music was going out to you and into my computer and then out to you again so apologize i have fixed that and we are starting in about 45 seconds hello everyone good morning happy saturday welcome to the coding train it's me dan oh we're on the internet together um i'm so excited today oh i have an extra light that i need to turn on i forgot to turn this light on do i look better now this side of my face looks more uh um like it's supposed to i don't know what to say i'm so excited for today this is a special saturday live stream i have a guest um that i'm uh i'm super excited to share her work with you and have her teach me something or show me how to do something which i have never done before and actually let me just briefly get started by um saying and here's our guest up on the screen you see uh chrissy brimmage and this is a an image of her work but what i want to uh quickly tell you and say is i for the first time ever in my life installed something called blender on this very laptop this morning and you can see right up here on the on the top right of my screen there it is i just installed it because i'm going to try to follow along and you know or at least look at blender again a little bit later today so um if you want to get a head start and try to follow along with the tutorial stuff that we're going to do in about 15 minutes or so um download blender and there's a link to where you can download blender in the video description let me make sure it's there so i'm pulling that up now and you can see ah there it is so um first of all uh here's uh chrissy's website her instagram so check those out i'm gonna talk uh a bit more about chrissy and introduce her work and show you a reel of her work in a moment um as well as the link to download blender and oh this is really important because the example um that we're going to work with today is making your very own mew i don't know if chrissy actually knew this but i'm kind of uh uh you know i mean i'm out in the open about my love for pokemon so uh but uh there's a lot of pokemon going on in this household in fact i've got some a lot of toys and characters and things and plushies around that i could bring but i'll i'll save that for later but you can get this mew reference image and also make sure you download and install blender which is not required you can just watch and enjoy and participate but i encourage you to download uh blender okay um alexander asks will this be a tutorial on the software or is there going to be a coding aspect so today is not really the day that i'm that we're going to look uh at coding it's really like a basic introduction to blender and i think one of the things that's exciting about it is just about everything that i do is very 2d graphics oriented in p5 or processing so this is really also a bit of an introduction to sort of thinking in terms of 3d and you know my hope is that if i can learn a little bit from chrissy about how to use blender and it might be something that i add to my workflow and one of the things that i would love to do if i make my own pokemon u in blender maybe i'll see if i can export it and import it to a p5.js sketch or a processing sketch that would be certainly be a fun thing to try i'm just taking a look at the chat v specky says i love pokemon so darn much alright me too me too v specky okay uh so what i want to say like so a quick um quick just sort of like notes and logistics from the coding train so it's the summer as you know i'm not at my um nyu workspace where i record a lot of video tutorials so things are a little bit offkilter i am doing live streams from this uh home location that i'm in in brooklyn um i recently released a video on marching squares um which is an algorithm that you can make interesting beautiful patterns with um so that came out yesterday um and i encourage you um to um if you make your own creative version of marching squares you can add there's only one community contribution here right now and i do hope to have a live stream next week where i will go through and look at some of these community contributions and show them and analyze them as well as maybe investigate marching cubes because today not so perfect i couldn't have imagined this better myself not planned but the next thing i wanted to try once i did marching squares was marching cubes which is taking marching squares from 2d to 3d but that's the topic of today going from 2d to 3d so that's what's going on in the coding train these days today is part of my guest conductor series um i want to also highlight for you let's see if i can pull this up if i go to the channel um the previous two guest conductors um amigos code and if i scroll back a little bit further um oh there there there she is um aaron davey from the twitch channel cozy cozy coding so check out amigos code uh channel on youtube and then uh aaron um live streams very regularly on twitch um making all sorts of what she likes to call i think like p5.js jan sessions and every every example that she's made in p5.js that comes out of that is just so delightful and so if you're if you're looking for more experimental creative fun with code and p5.js definitely check out um aaron davies um cozy coding train oh and we got a donation which means when we get a donation that i have to thank you with a random number because that's the weird stuff that i do on the coding train so i'm going to take my oh let me switch back to this view here oops nope wrong view here we go okay so i have my book a million random digits thank you anonymous for your donation i'm going to talk about the tender foundation in just a moment and for you uh i you will have your random number is ah oh no this book's falling apart that's terrible but we'll use the face excellent all right stop okay uh 98 0008 thank you very much so let me talk to you um about the tender foundation um i want to thank chrissy who again i'll introduce in a moment for introducing me to the tender foundation i was not familiar with tender before the tender foundation is a nonforprofit based in atlanta georgia it's run by jasina almand founded by her and it supports um mothers in need um you know being a parent i'm not a mother i am a father is a really challenging and difficult wonderful thing but i've been so lucky in my life to be able to have the resources um to not worry too much about things like diapers and food and not everyone is so lucky and the tender foundation is doing some amazing work um in atlanta georgia to help um mothers so i i was i could talk a little bit about the tender foundation um all the donations that you make um through this live stream go directly to the tender foundation youtube through their giving program covers all the fees and i'm also going to match go i set a goal for 500 i'm going to match a 500 donation um as well so what i want to do is play you a quick video message from jacina almond who is the founder of the tender foundation to tell you a little bit more about their work okay so give me a second here hopefully this is gonna come up i'm gonna oh uh let me actually turn off the air conditioning which is making a noise i realized and let me click over to her video and i'm going to mute myself hi um my name is jacina allman the founder of the tender foundation based in atlanta georgia first off i just want to say we're so grateful to christy and the coding train for allowing us this opportunity and supporting our work at tender we are committed to empowering all moms by making the essentials accessible we do this through our family stabilization program the program provides emergency financial assistance with rent utilities um grocery store gift cards and other necessities like diapers and wipes to our moms we um we do this work with like a lot of heart and a little hassle we believe our process is streamlined simple we really just stand in the gap and act as a safety net for all of the um the families living on the margins that are typically under resourced and so we really just like to surround our our moms in love and really destigmatize the process of being vulnerable enough to ask for help and so yeah that's that's what we do and again i'm super super grateful for this opportunity and i'm so excited to learn something with chrissy so thanks so much all right thank you jay cena for your message um thank you for uh sharing your work with us and all the work that you do i hope that um we can we can raise a little money and help support the tender foundation we just got a donation thank you very much from japs um and a couple people in the chat mention they that they can't donate through youtube because it's not available in their country um i will mention that of course you are also welcome to go donate directly on the tender foundation's website um but there's a little link here click under donate um and you can make a donation there so if you're not able to donate and you would like to i'm not able to donate through the youtube interface and you would like to go directly to their website you want to tweet me a receipt or something you're welcome to and i'll send you a nice little thank you message you don't need to do that i'm just saying if you feel like you want to be acknowledged with your donation i would love to know about it and thank you for it personally um okay so um i think i am ready for the next stage here which is to introduce um i actually made like a schedule and it says like oh i never do this because i'm so disorganized but it says on next on my schedule is um an introduction to chrissy's work and i'm actually five minutes ahead of schedule which is amazing so um i'm well i'm gonna pull up um chrissy uh bremenj's website um thank you oh i forgot to thank psy who is the um which i should have done right from the outset who's the coding train um community manager i realize i'm not in the uh video here um oh we got another donation from stein ovid bratomer thank you very much a train whistle uh for you for that donation um someone in the chat is asking me why don't i use donation alert yeah i tried to hook it up so the lights blink with donations but i couldn't get that to work so um maybe i can figure that out for the next i hope to do more fundraising so somebody knows how to get the youtube api with donations it works for all the other kind of transaction stuff but for some reason the donations aren't coming up but that's not what's important it's nice when the lights blink but alas we will we will enjoy ourselves uh and uh your donation is really um i'm really grateful and thank you for that oh but uh most importantly um i wanted to thank psy who is the coding trained community manager sai is the curator and and coproducer of the guest conductor series um i was not familiar with chrissy's work until psy introduced me to them and so um i was so thrilled and just like marveling at the beauty on of different projects on the website and really excited i'm always excited when somebody who's practice is different than mine can share how they how they work things that they have learned things that they want to share about how their practices and and kind of explore their creative process as a guest on the coding train so um let me play for you um uh chrissy's reel so you can get a sense of her the kind of art and projects that she makes with blender and other uh tools and then i will i'm gonna also just read from her bio on the website so now her reel is coming up here um and so um chrissy is a multiuh disciplinary artist living and working out of brooklyn by way of atlanta georgia and her work utilizes the opportunities and constraints of digital space to research social phenomena of the material world she's currently interested in the function of identity dreaming of futures beyond oppressive systems defining freedom reworking ideas of justice and how to integrate mediums such as illustration code design animation 3d modeling and vr to communicate explore and bridge my personal perception her personal perceptions of these issues as well as the variations in perceptions between different social identities so one of the things that i love about chrissy's website and the real is repeating here is that um you know i think when you are working with code you can get so lost in the technical and are working with digital media um but sometimes you can sort of forget like why it is you're doing that and on um chrissy's website i'm gonna pull that up over here um she lists these four questions that she's been asking herself what world do i want to live in what is identity and how is it used what does freedom be on depression feel like can we expand our perceptions of the world through vr embodiment and so these are such uh wonderful questions i i think it's a good exercise for all of us i should do this myself like after today is to like take a minute write down what are the questions you're asking about yourself the world uh and the meaning behind the work and the things that you're creating um so um uh without further ado i think i would like to bring chrissy on chrissy you're still muted but why don't you say say hello to me so i can make sure i hear you okay i heard chrissy now i'm gonna unmute her now say hello to the coding trade audience hello everyone okay and then i'm going to switch over to um the screen that i have that has uh your video so hold on so um there everybody should be sorry i'm kind of new at this technically with having guests so apologies for all the awkwardness as i was trying to explain to christy i was like don't worry if everything goes wrong that's kind of the point of the coding train it all goes wrong and we figure it out together so uh hopefully you see chrissy right now hi chrissy hi um is i don't know if there's anything you wanted to say about the tender foundation you brought um you you shared their work with me um i hadn't uh heard of them before that i missed or that you think would be important to say um not to put you on the spot sorry no um i just wanted to say that i know i've known jacina now for a couple of years and just the work that she does with tinder but even outside of tinder i mean she's a really awesome person and the tender foundation really does do a lot of great work here in atlanta um they did a lot for the protest as well like they are really really about the mission that they have put you know on their website and you know i wanted to bring them in today because um because they're doing great work but also it's a nonprofit that is kind of here in my hometown of atlanta and i just hope you know we find some time and space and love to donate to them and help some mamas awesome thank you so much yeah and i know that atlanta i mean everyone is going through a hard time especially in this country with the pandemic and i know that atlanta has uh it's an ep epicenter now these days so i hope that we can uh give a little support we went through this we're still going through to new york but you know we're lucky enough now in brooklyn that our numbers have come down a little bit and i know that atlanta is definitely going through a rough patch so hopefully we can offer our support to the city and the community and especially those who don't have access to uh resources um who have little babies um that's really like i i'm glad to be able to do our small part my small part in being able to help for sure um great so um i don't know if you uh how i don't know what the best way to get started is but you know if i'm gonna uh if you're ready i'll pull up your screen shall i do that now yeah okay so i'm gonna switch where to see i'm i've got a button here i'm gonna press we're gonna see if this works so now you should be seeing um chrissy's um screen and we can i'm just gonna kind of like turn it over to you i'm gonna launch blender on my laptop and try to follow along and i'll ask questions along the way if there are things that i'm confused about and i'm also keeping an eye on the chat as well and thank you to nick k um with your for your donation to tender or not uh um you know i don't want i want to let chrissy be able to have some flow here so i don't know that i'm gonna pause and stop every time somebody donates but at the end i'll try to say some thank yous again to other people who who donate as well um and so if you have questions you can ask them in the chat i'll try to keep track of them but we'll also um have a little bit of time towards the end if people want to ask um some questions about to chrissy about her work or just working with blender and and the like cool all right let's jump in okay so first and foremost hi everyone i am super excited to be here um just a little bit of background on me um i actually when i was learning to code and when i was getting my background or trying to get my bearings with machine learning i lived on the coding train okay i was on the coding training like every day watching videos so it's really cool to be here and to share something maybe new to some of you maybe not so new but either way i think we'll have some fun today um the way that i'm gonna kind of outline this video or the kind of overarching goal here is that i want to try to get everyone kind of familiar with moving around in 3d space so if you've never heard of blender never opened blender saw blender and thought smoothies like you have no clue what it is this is like the perfect video for here we're gonna walk through kind of the concepts behind moving from 2d to 3d then i'm going to show kind of like how to navigate in 3d space and then at the end we'll go ahead and hopefully have some time to do a demo of how to model that new reference so like dan said if you are interested in following along there is a link in the description to both blender and also the new reference okay so first and foremost just a really quick note about blender if you haven't heard of it before i have the description here on my screen it's a free and open source 3d creation suite and it supports a bunch of things from modeling rigging animation simulation just anything 3d you can probably do in blender and that's specifically why i picked it today so we're not going to do any coding today but it has the capability to link encoding so if you do hard coding and you want to try like generative code you can do some of that in blender if you've been working in 2d but you want to move to 3d if you've been doing static work you want to try animation um if you want to create some obj files to put into p5 dan has a really great tutorial on that already so there's a lot of really great things that you can do in blender so it's a really great transition tool which is why i wanted to talk about it today because it just kind of opens the doors to new explorations new mediums more dreaming if there's something new that you want to try one question that just came in from the chat that i thought i would ask is um somebody asked if um which version of blender or does it matter which version they download are you using the latest version for today we're going to be talking about blender 2.8 um i think they just released like an update like 2.83 or something like that but as long as it's blender 2.8 will be good got it okay so before i even do anything major i just want to give a note that for the first part here um while i'm talking about concepts i'm not going to note every single thing that i'm doing like functionality but if there's anything that i don't know when it's time to model i'm going to completely backtrack open blender again from the very beginning and walk us through every single step so don't worry if you don't quite know what's happening movement wise or function wise in the beginning it will all be explained later okay so let's talk about first just kind of the concept behind moving from 2d to 3d or just creating 3d work in digital space periods so the biggest difference and i'm going to actually pull up an example piece um so again don't don't freak out when you see this this looks a lot more complex because i use this for animation blender doesn't always look this scary i promise but i'm going to use this piece as an example um so the biggest kind of difference and i'm going to actually show the reference photo as well the biggest difference between 2d and 3d work are making 2d and 3d work is that when you are making 2d work you are creating the illusion of 3d okay so you're doing things like using your composition using shadows using foreground background to create the illusion of a full picture because you can only draw in like one or maybe two i guess depending on how you how you outline things perspectives okay so what you're doing is you're creating that picture in that one dimension and then your brain or the audience's brain is doing the leg work to kind of imagine everything else so for example when we're looking at this picture here um you know we see it's like a person and when we look at the head from the way that i drew it i mean hopefully we would imagine that it's like a rounded head so we look at it and we imagine that there's like a back um hopefully we imagine that there's like another ear these fingers that are hidden we imagine them there because that's what we're used to seeing in real life so the difference when you're moving into the 3d is that these things that are imagined what our brain usually does the leg work for we actually have to do the legwork in the 3d space so i want to show kind of an example of what i mean with this piece here so this is the 3d version of the picture that you just saw that i did so what's going to happen usually or at least what happened to me when i first moved into doing 3d work is that i'm so used to drawing in that one perspective that when you move into 3d work there's a tendency to kind of do the same to work from the front or to work from the back so usually what will happen is you'll go into blender you have your model you're ready you're like this is great this is going to be good you go and you completely model the front and then you expect or you're used to your brain kind of doing the legwork of completing the rest but then you turn the model and it's completely flat and you're like oh okay so like in our heads we know that there is a third dimension in 3d space but kind of moving and um working with that is what's going to be kind of the most kind of shocking thing when you first move into 3d so with this model i kind of got away with it because i only needed the front view but when you're doing things like making characters or if you're interested in 3d printing things where the model has to be 360 you have to keep every single dimension in mind which sounds really really intimidating and it sounds like a lot but blender has some really great kind of features to help with this so i'm going to show just a couple of suggestions i'm i'm gonna open a completely new project here okay so this is what blender usually looks like when you first start when you have a new project as you can see it starts to go off with like this cube here i'm gonna use this cube to do a kind of demonstration of ways that we can set up our viewport here and our viewport is just the screen that you're seeing whatever you're viewing is the viewport so the first thing that we can do to kind of help us when we're ready to make our first model is use a reference okay so in the same way that references are super useful in 2d they are your best friend in 3d and what's cool about blender is that you don't have to like navigate back and forth so i'm going to go ahead and pull up the mu reference so you know usually when you're like drawing something you have your drawing here you have your reference off to the side or maybe on your computer and you're going back and forth trying to make sure that everything's right or maybe you're tracing it what's cool about blender is that you can drop your reference right into the viewport okay so i can just take this i can drag it and drop it right on in there and that way when i'm modeling i can put my model right in front so i'm just going to grab this also if anyone just joined um you can find that reference image if you want to use the same reference image there's a link to it in the video's description so if you scroll down you'll be able to find it yeah and one thing i want to note about references in for 3d space so i picked this new reference for a reason one because it's absolutely adorable but also because it has three different views so something that might also be new when you're transitioning from 2d to 3d if you're used to drawing in one perspective when you move to 3d again you have to have a full kind of 360 understanding of your piece so things that are usually hidden in 2d you have to make decisions about in 3d okay so for example if you drew a character that is facing backwards if you draw them from the back you know usually in 2d you don't have to really imagine what their face looks like but in 3d you will so when it comes time to choose a reference you want to try to look for things like this like this new reference so something that has at the bare minimum like a front reference and a side reference but if you can find something with you know a right reference a left top bottom as much as you can the more references that you have when you're doing 3d work the more comfortable you're going to feel because you don't have to imagine anything that's not there everything will be there for you so try to look for references like this if you can't find something that has all three of them in one like let's say you're i don't know you want to make a reference of you want to make like a elephant or something you can't find a picture of an elephant from three different angles just try to find three different pictures that you like that are kind of similar that you can see it from the front and from the side at least and then if you can find other views from the back or whatever other angle it's gonna help a lot okay so right now my reference is in here um i kind of have it at a funny angle though so i'm gonna actually delete this i'm gonna back up and now so i keep talking about all these different views in um blender or we talk about how you know you can see a piece from the front you can see a piece from the back when you first go in blender you're probably like i don't know where i am like am i am i in the front am i in the back i have no clue luckily blender has views so we can and i'll go through this again when we go to the modeling but just to show really quick if you go up here to the view tab and you go to viewport it has all of the different views that you can look at so you have top you have bottom you have front back right left and you can navigate these using your keys so i'm gonna do that with my keyboard so now i'm in the front if i press three now i'm in the right you can even jump to opposites using nine so that way you always know where you are and it'll show you up here in the top left corner if you ever feel lost and click a button you're like i don't know where i am anymore blender will always show you in the top left here okay so now that i'm in the front view i'm going to go ahead and drag this new reference back in here okay and so usually what i do is once i put my reference in i move whatever like base that i'm going to use to model in front so i'm just going to do that really quick i'm just going to scale this down and again don't worry if you don't know what i'm doing i will explain all these keys a little bit later okay so i have this in the front right and now you're probably thinking well okay chrissy you said don't just model from one view though like we're only in one view this doesn't help blender actually allows us to split screens so we can actually model from different views all at the same time so there's two ways that we can do that one manually and one through blender blender will set it up for us so i'm going to show the manual way so if you ever want to split your screen so that you can model in different views at once all you have to do is come to a corner and you'll see the mouse turns into a crosshair and when you get that crosshair you just drag oh so there we go okay you just drag and it'll give you another screen okay so now both of these are in front because when you split your screen initially it's going to split it the exact same way so whatever view you're in in one screen it's going to duplicate in the other screen but let's say that i wanted to model in both front and maybe like right view so what i'll do is i'll come over to this right side here and i'm going to hit three okay so now i have the front and the right so when i make a change so let's say i decide to wrote this rotate this i can see what happens in both views at once which is really really useful because as you're modeling and you're getting used to what i call walking around the model so just making sure that we're using or viewing the model from all angles as we move is that again as you make a change in one view it's going to show how it affects in the other view so it kind of breaks you out of that one perspective kind of view and mindset now we only have the reference in the front view though so that doesn't really help us but we can do the same thing we can drag you can drag and drop our reference over in the right view as well so i'm gonna move this i'm gonna move this over some just gonna rearrange my is a little bit right now because as you can see they're stacked so i'm just gonna move this one back a little bit and put me back in front okay so now i can move my box i'm gonna grab it i had a quick question which is um so i noticed like this like for example the pressing the numbers doesn't work for me because i'm just on a laptop without a number pad and also like i'm using the track pad so i'm assuming are you using a regular mouse or some of the stuff you're doing like is that like is that recommended let me actually show you how to fix that thank you for bringing that up because that was something that was like chrissy make sure you know this but i'm so sorry so if you are on a laptop and you're like i can't move what's happening blender is built for using a mouse um and using like the three click system so using the wheel as a click so if you are on a laptop right now and you want to be able to move without a mouse and just use your trackpad all you have to do is go to file or sorry go to edit and we're going to scroll down here to preferences and then we're going to go down here to the input tab and then you just click emulate numpad so this is going to allow you to use the numbers on your keyboard and then you also click emulate three button mouse and that'll help you move around thank you dan for bringing that up so again if you are on a laptop and you want to be able to move without a mouse and you want to be able to use the keys that are already on your keyboard just go to edit preferences then we'll go down here to the input tab and then we'll click emulate numpad and then we'll also click emulate three map three button mouse and how did you delete the mu image that's one that i could get to work maybe i should okay so i was gonna wait to completely do like oh sorry it's fine i think it makes more sense for me to talk about the buttons that i'm clicking while i do this i'll just i'll just go ahead and say all the buttons on these things that way it'll make a little bit more sense okay so in order to delete what we'll do is you just click so a regular like left click and then you hit x and it'll prompt you here say okay delete and you just click it and then you can delete anything like that okay so i'm going to bring this back in really quick and just a note if your reference isn't coming in there can be two reasons why that's happening one reason why it won't come in is if you click on your object your reference for whatever reason might not want to come in so you just want to click off of it and then try to drag it in also if it's not coming in it's very possible that you're in a different mode so make sure to look up here and make sure it says object mode so if you want to bring in new objects anytime you want to bring in a new object whether it's a reference photo whether it's another mesh such as this cube here you always want to make sure you're in object mode okay so for whatever reason your reference isn't coming in just make sure we're an object okay so again what i'm going to do is really quickly i'm just resetting everything to the center where this crosshair is and to do that all you have to do is press option and then g and with my scrim and do the same thing just press option g and that just moved everything down here to the middle okay so again on the right side here we are in front view on the left side we're on we're in right view and something else i want to note really quick too is that as you can see up here it says right orthographic and if i press 5 it's going to say right perspective so i want everyone to make sure that you're in orthographic mode okay there are two different modes in blender orthographic and perspective i don't want to explain that right now because it's very very confusing long story short you mostly use perspective if you're doing like scene modeling so for example if you want to model outer space you'll probably want to use perspective but if you're doing like character modeling anything that's going to use details you always want to make sure you're in orthographic okay and again you'll know where you are because blender will say it in this top left corner here and let me make this bigger sorry so you can see everything okay so again if you're in perspective just hit five it'll put you in orthographic mode okay so we have our reference set up in the right side and left side i'm going to move my cube over so in order to move it i'm just going to click it i'm just going to left click it once then i'm going to hit g which is grab and then what i want to note quickly before i move it is as you can see up here um this is kind of like your axis that's going to tell you kind of where you are in space or how to make a movement okay so as you can see on this side if i want to move right i'm going to move it on the y but on this side if i wanted to move right i would move it on the x and the reason for that is because we're in two different views okay so again if you're you feel lost you're not sure where you are first make sure that you check on the top left and then if you're like well i don't really know how to move then you can check on the top right just to try to figure out where to go okay so i'm going to come over here to this left panel because i want to move my box in front of this right view of mu or this the left view of mu he's facing left so what i'm going to do is i'm going to click onto the box so just one left click and then i'm going to hit g to grab and then remember we're on this side so if we want to move right we're going to use the y axis so i'm going to click i'm going to hit g and then i'm going to hit y so that i can move it left or right and now i'm just going to move the box right over mu and as you can see on this side it disappeared a little bit that's only because my references are kind of crosshaired like this so i'm going to move this reference back this front reference here by clicking it i'm going to hit g and now this time if i want to move right again we're going to use that yaxis i'm just going to move back here okay so now on the right side where we're in the front view we have our box in front of the right meme reference here and on the left side when we're modeling in the right even though i guess technically it should have been the left but that's okay um we have our box in front of the side reference of mu so again as we make a change in one so if i come over here and i rotate and to rotate you just hit r so if i rotate on the right i will see in real time how it affects the front okay so this is really important again because we are working in multiple angles all at once and we always want to know how kind of what we do in one angle affects the other and on that note something i just want to note really quickly is that references in 2d don't always perfectly translate in 3d so everything here with mu you know looks up to spec from our eye because we are seeing it in separate angles but sometimes when we try to combine all the references we'll notice like maybe the arm was like a little bit higher in the front reference than it is on the side reference and maybe the ears are a little bit more back in the front reference than they are on the side reference so with references they are your best friend you want to love them you want to cherish them but you don't want to marry them you want to stay flexible because as you are manipulating different angles you're going to notice that things may not line up and that's okay you can just use your best judgment to make adjustments from there okay so this is our split this is usually where i like to keep splits because it could get a little a little tight in the area but you can actually split the viewport as many times as you want so let's say you have 16 different references if you wanted to split the viewport 16 different times in 16 different ways you totally could so again all you have to do to do that is come to any corner and just drag up okay and now i can change this one to the back so now i'll know what's happening in the back and i can do the same over here i can just drag it up and i'll change this one to the left so now as i'm making a change in the front i will now see what's happening oh the bottom one is kind of blocked but you can see the point that as i move in one i know what's happening in every single angle okay and now if we want to get rid of these if you're trying to like grab and you're like oh no i keep making a million windows i've been here before and i panicked and i completely like closed out a project and started from scratch so i was like i don't know how to get rid of all these windows don't worry there's an easy way to do that all you have to do is come over just hover over the line where it gives you that two kind of arrows you'll right click on your track pad then you just hit join area i'm gonna do that again just right click join area and then you'll click which way you wanna join so you can join up you can join down and then again i'm just going to join all these i'm going to bring us back to two screens now if you don't want to do all the dragging or if dragging feels hard or maybe your trackpad doesn't work all that great you can also do this a blender will set things up manually for you so you can come up here to the view tab you come all the way down to area and you'll see a couple different options so we have a toggle quad view which will give us before again which that gave us four on one side just because i already had it split so then if you want to get rid of that you can come back to area and just hit toggle quad view again it'll get rid of it and there's also options for the horizontal split we have vertical splits however you want to split it blender can automatically do that for you this is also really useful if you want to start to make a transition into like animation or rigging or even when you're rendering um i can set for example i'm just gonna really quickly show you what edit mode looks like and again i will explain this later when we're actually modeling so on the left or on the left here now i'm in edit mode and i'm gonna make this one whoops sorry i'm gonna make this actually so this is a rendered view so i haven't made any changes to the square so you're not really going to notice the difference but like if i change the color for example which i can do that really quick just so you can see what i mean so i'm going to change this color to blue okay so as you can see on our left side we have the rendered view so when you start to do things like adding textures or adding colors none of that is going to show when you're in object mode or when you're in edit mode as you're reworking the mesh but if you want to see in real time kind of what everything looks like you'll be able to see it if you have kind of that split so splitting is really useful for one keeping track of how all angles look like at the same time but it's also useful in your workflow as you're creating things like the render or creating the animation you're just able to see everything all at once which is really really useful okay so i'm going to come back out of that rendered mode okay so i'm going to put us back in right and in front and i'm going to reset the rotation of this cube by just hitting option r so it's just going to clear any rotation that we did and i think this is a good point to start to move into the demo from you but before we get to demoing i just want to explain how to move period in blender one what one question came up in the chat and i wasn't gonna ask it because i was having trouble with it too i'm having trouble figuring out i have exactly what you have but i'm having trouble on the right panel the front orthographic view getting the mu uh the reference image to move behind the cube that should be along the x axis so to do that yeah so okay so we're in the front here right now we want to move this reference back what i usually do is i'll just kind of like turn to see which way it needs to go and these lines here correspond to every axis so this green one is y this red one is x you can't see the z one right now but the z is always blue so um since our y is the one in in behind the reference we're just going to click the reference and then we'll hit g and then we'll hit y and that'll allow us to move it back got it cool great question okay so let's talk about movement before we even start to make our mute okay so first since we already talked about kind of the views just to review if you want to change what view you are in you can either come up here to the view tab and go to viewport and it'll show you all the options or if you are a hotkey person you can come to memorize them and you can use your keyboard to just move around so one is front three is right uh command three is left i think command one is back and then if you don't wanna memorize every single one what i usually do or what i have done is i just memorize front and right so front is one right is three and then if i want to go to the back all you have to do is hit nine to go to the opposite so when i was in front it sent me to the back and now if i hit nine again so i'm in the back it'll take me back to the front and this will happen again with right view so if i hit three to go to right view and i want to go to the left view i can just hit nine that's going to put me in the left and if i want to go back to the right view just hit nine again and now i'm back in the right and that way you don't have to memorize every single key okay so that is moving views but we can also move in between views okay so if you want to look at three quarter if you want to look at the top and there's actually top buttons as well i think seven there we go seven is top and if you hit nine it'll put you on the bottom if you hit nine again it'll take you back up top but again there's angles in between top and bottom there's angles in between the front like sometimes we need to see some weird angle maybe like under mu's tail or like i don't know if that looks right you can move just by putting two fingers on your track pad and just moving about okay so this will allow you to rotate we can go up and down we can go all around and then if we feel dizzy and we're like oh gosh i'm seeing too much take me back to front we'll just hit one to go back but now you're probably like well okay i can rotate but i can't go left to right like how do i move left to right so in order to do that you just hold shift and use those same two fingers and you'll be able to shift left and right or up and down or diagonal whichever way you want to go okay so we release shift and just use two fingers if we just want to rotate around something and then we use shift in two fingers if we want to shift to the side shift up shift down okay so that is the basics of movement um so the basics then of kind of manipulating we'll talk about now so there are multiple modes if you click this tab here where it says object mode oh and that's actually not showing it for some reason oh there we go okay so if you click this tab here you're gonna see there's a bunch of different modes don't worry about any of those right now the only two that we're gonna worry about today are object mode and edit mode okay so again right now we're in object mode we use object mode to add in or take out objects okay so let's say that i wanted to add in a sphere for whatever reason we can do that either by going to this add panel up here and then you'll go to mesh and you can pick any type of mesh that you see there so add mesh and any mesh that you want to add you can go in there or if you are again a hotkey person you can just hit shift a it's going to bring up that same exact screen and then we can pick something here so i'm going to pick suzanne which is the monkey i think her origins are from i want to say silent bob something like that i don't remember but she's like blender's mascot so i just added in a suzanne here but now suzanne has nothing to do with mew so when i want to get rid of suzanne all you have to do to get rid of an object is to click it so you just left click you hit x and then delete okay so again we add with shift a and then we'll pick a mesh and as you can see there are other things to add but again we'll talk about that another day object match i deleted my um uh my cube instead of the the monkey so i can just so i could just do add add cube back in is what i would do you can add queue back in and if you are like oh it's no longer in the center so let's say for whatever reason you added it in it's like over here or something and you wanted to put it back in the center where that crosshair is all you have to do is to option g and that clears the location and puts it right back in the middle there because i'm going to get rid of that one so now as you notice when you add in an object so i'm going to add suzanne back in here it's pretty big at least it's bigger than our reference so you're probably like how do we make this smaller all you have to do to make things bigger and smaller is you just click so left click and then you'll hit s for scale and then you just drag up or down as big as you want there's other ways to do this you can scale precisely by typing numbers in you can also scale on different axis so right now i think i'm scaling on the zaxis let's say i wanted to scale on y all you have to do is i'm going to go ahead and click this again i'm going to hit s and i'm going to hit y and that's going to allow me and you'll see on the right side now i'm scaling in the y instead of the zaxis you can do that with any axis that you want to do okay and now let's say we have this and you're like i hate this how do i get back just with any other program to kind of redo or to go back to what you had previously all you have to do is hit command z or control z if you're on a windows computer and now we're right back okay and then let's see what are there some some basics um you probably saw me earlier rotating so again if you want to rotate it's going to be the same deal so you'll just click the object just regular left click then you'll hit r to rotate and then again you just click and drag and it's the same deal with scaling if you want to scale on particular axis so let's say i wanted to rotate on the y then i'm just going to hit y it's going to switch it i guess you can really see in that one let's say i want to do it on z then it then lets me scale it in a different way and now this is x that i just hit so now i'm rotating x now i hit y and i'm back rotating in y okay and again if you're like i don't want this how do i go back you just hit command c and also just to note when you find an angle that is perfect you're like this is a perfect rotation in order to keep it here all you have to do is left click again and that'll set it wherever you want it okay so those are kind of the basics of moving your object in object mode so now let's talk about editing okay so i'm going to get rid of this suzanne head again by clicking x and then delete and um let's go to edit mode i actually don't model with the cube but i'm going to show just the basics of editing with the cube and then i'll show everyone how i usually go about modeling so in order to get into edit mode there's two ways that you can do that of course so either you can click the object and then you can hit tab and that will take you to edit mode you'll know if you did it right because it'll say up here into edit or you can again click the object you can come up here to the tab and then you can just come down here to edit mode and again you'll know if it takes because it'll it'll display it right up here okay now that we're in edit mode you see that things look a little bit different you see like the little points here and the reason why is that blender is a vertex based okay so the way that we make models is by manipulating vertices you can also manipulate edges which are just any lines you can also manipulate faces which are just any faces created by connecting the edges and the vertices but the kind of basis is vertex manipulation and just in general the more vertices that you have on a model usually the more realistic it's going to look so i usually do low poly art as you saw in the real so i don't use a whole lot of vertices but if i wanted to make things smoother if i wanted to make things look more realistic to it's a material world i would just add in more vertices okay that's just something to keep in mind okay so let's talk about manipulating these so in order to do that there's a couple of different ways that you can grab and move your vertices okay so i'm going to talk about first the ways that we can grab so one the simplest way is you can just drag and drop and you'll see i guess it's a little bit hard to see on my screen but you'll see it'll highlight whatever you grab is now to be this yellowish orange color okay so i'm going to do that again so to let go of anything that you grab you just click off so you see it turn back black and then if i want to grab it again i can just drag and drop now there's other ways to grab as well there's something called uh box selecting which honestly looks the exact same but i'll show you anyway so if you hit b it's going to give you this crosshair you can do the same exact thing you just drag whatever you want over whatever you want to grab and drop and you'll see it highlighted okay and then to release we'll just left click and there's one more that you can do which i actually think is really useful called circle select so if you hit c now we're going to get this circle in the crosshair and if you drag it just allows you to kind of grab vertices that are not in the same area so if i wanted to grab like all of mu's foot for example and there's like a bunch of vertices i can just drag this circle select all over it okay and then to release it with circle select you have to press enter and then you press left click to let it go okay so those are the basics for grabbing but i want to show you all something because this is another kind of wall that i hit when i was first modeling is that i went and i grabbed uh i used the cube because it was what was default here so i was like yeah this is great i'm about to model i went i box select here or i dragged to select i grabbed this vertice using g and i moved it and i was like yeah this is great everything's going wonderfully the whole cube is moving and then i turned it and i realized oh the back the back is the back is not it's not moving at all okay so if you want to grab in a way that's going to move your entire 3d object so i'm going to ctrl z or command z to get back here if i want to manipulate all of the vertices on one side another trick that we can do is we can change this to wireframe mode so right now we're in solid view so we see every single face we see every single edge but if we click z it's going to bring up this wheel this option wheel and again don't worry about these other two here we're going to worry about just solid and wireframe today but if we click wireframes it's going to allow us to we get this xray view of our 3d model it's going to allow us to see the reference in the back but it's also going to allow us to grab any vertices that are kind of in the back i just have to say that is so cool i know it's so great i didn't realize there's so many like key commands it's almost like you're learning a whole separate language because i mean it's it's friendly and intuitive in one sense in the sense that you're sort of manipulating this 3d physical world but i imagine it must take a ton of practice to get all of the like key sequences it's uh in like i just keep making mistakes and like undo undo and do yeah is that was that your experience yeah absolutely i mean it took me i mean i've been i think 3d modeling on my own for maybe two years now and i have learned a lot of really cool tricks but there's still there's still so much to learn it's a really cool program though and there's a lot of ways to do certain things like dan and i were kind of talking before the live about how modeling is a lot like code where you know there's multiple ways multiple solutions to get to the same thing so even as we're moving through this if you're seeing something kind of interesting that i haven't talked about or if you just want to try something weird and of course i totally recommend that um the more that you experience experiment the more you're going to discover and the more you're going to find like a way that works for you so definitely feel free to poke around don't feel like you have to do exactly what i'm doing get lost make mistakes i'll make mistakes too it's going to be great it's all going to be great okay so we are in wireframe mode now so again if you missed that we started in solid so to get to wireframe to be able to see the reference and to be able to see through the model all you have to do is hit d and it's going to bring up this wheel here and even these have hot commands so you can hit z4 to go to wireframe if you don't want to learn hot keys all you have to do is click wireframe and that's going to bring us here and when we're in wireframe again the benefit here is that you're able to grab any vertices in the back that you can't see okay so for example if you remember when we were in solid mode and i grabbed that front vertices i only grabbed the front but now if i drag and grab so i'm going to hit g to grab all of the vertices are going to move so i'm just going to do the same thing i'm going to grab and click and drag hit g and i'm going to drag again and hit g so now if i take this back to solid and i turn oh the model is a little bit behind but you can see that v here let me just move this so you can see it perfectly let me grab this whole thing there you go okay i'm gonna put this back in solid and i'm just gonna move this a little bit to the front just so you can whoops grab okay i'm just gonna move it away from the reference a little bit just so you can see it but as you can see when we move the front vertices it moves the back vertices as well so whatever we did in the front corresponded to the back so whenever you want to move like a whole side of something you want to make sure you're in wire frame so that those back vertices that you can't really grab from the front get moved too i'm going to move this back just so you don't get lost okay so like i said though i don't often model with the starting cube i usually like to start with a plane so i think i think now's a good time to get into this mew reference so i'm gonna um i'm gonna start from the beginning i think i'm gonna close out i think i'm gonna close out blender i'm gonna start us up from the very beginning as if i was going to model this that way we can walk all the way through and i will know every single thing that i do and should we do that too do you think or like should i keep mine open like right now i have mine with the two new references and my warped strange mangled cube that i've been really enjoying twisting all the vertices i feel like i have to show it really quickly i'm going to show it people can see that i'm showing my screen you can't see it it's the problem [Laughter] but now i'm back now i'm back to your screen perfect i think do what makes you feel the most comfortable if you like what you've set up so far definitely keep it if you want to just kind of walk through what it feels like from the very beginning do that too whatever feels more comfortable is what i would encourage okay so i'm going to x out of blender now i'm not going to save this but don't need this okay so i'm back on my desktop i am pulling blender back up okay so this is what blender looks like when you open it any recent files that you have will show up here so you can just jump straight into them if you want to do a new file you can just go ahead and over here and click general if you don't want to click anything you're just like i want this box out of my way you can just left click off of it and it's going to put you in that starting screen as well okay so again when you open blender it's always going to start you off with a cube but then you probably notice there's two other things here so this here is a light and this here is a camera i don't i want to explain this but i also don't want to get too deep into this because you use these for rendering and we're probably not going to get to that step just yet but just in the same way that you kind of have to set up your composition in 2d how you have to set up your light to create certain shadows you have to do the same thing in 3d and you use the camera and use the light to do that but today we're not going to use that so i'm just going to get rid of these things so again to do that we're going to just uh left click on the camera i'm going to hit x and then we're going to delete it and we're going to do the same with the light by left clicking i'm going to hit x we're going to delete it and now like i said i don't use the cube either to start some people do some people use the cube to start some people use the sphere to start some people use a single vertices to start you can literally do whatever feels most natural whatever shape feels most natural and also what feels most natural to your model so for example if you're modeling like a snowman you might want to start with a sphere but i usually my bass is that i usually start with a plane so i'm going to delete this cube as well by left clicking hitting x and deleting okay now before we even pull the plane in we just want to make sure we are in the right perspective so remember when you're doing character modeling anything that you need detail honestly most models i would say probably at least in the beginning you're probably going to want to use orthographic modes only so to make sure that we're in orthographic we're just going to hit 5 okay and we're going to know that we're in orthographic because it's going to say it up here in the left okay so now i'm going to hit one to put myself in front view and we're going to bring the mu model in or the new reference i'm sorry so to do that all we're going to do is grab the new reference and drop it right in and another navigation thing that i forgot to mention is that if you want to zoom in and zoom out all you have to do is press the uh the plus icon on your keyboard to go in and the minus icon go out okay so plus and minus and something else i forgot to mention is that in the same way that you can manipulate your objects you can also manipulate your references so as you notice when i first dropped it in the reference was pretty small so i reconciled that just by zooming in but if you're like i want the reference to be bigger you can just click the reference by usual left click you can hit scale the same way that you would with a model you can just drag it big or small as you want okay so we have our reference set up in our front view now we want to at least have one other view i'm going to be honest with y'all i often set up my split screen and i will set it up in front view in right view and then what i usually do is i end up keeping one in a view and then my other view kind of just becomes my whatever view i'm in like i just move around a lot but i'm gonna set it up in the way that what we've been talking about and if you feel like you know the two split isn't what you want you can add in another split you can use just the one view so again whatever feels the most natural for you is definitely the way you should go about modeling there's no like right or wrong here all right so again if we want to create that split we can either go to we can go to view we can come down to area and we can click horizontal split or vertical split or quad view whichever one that you really liked or if you want to do it yourself again you just come up to a corner until you get that crosshair icon just left click and drag all right so now we have our split here and let me make this full screen again okay so i'm gonna make my right side front view again which is already in front view and if you're not in front video and you want to get there you just hit one and i'm gonna make my left side right view by hitting three okay now as you notice once we hit that right view we can't see the reference anymore but we want to be able to see the reference so i'm just going to drag another one in there again and in order to do this drag again you want to make sure that you aren't like grabbing this reference or grabbing anything so just make sure first that you just click off so just a regular left click off of any object and we just drag this new reference right on in here and now again this is like floating in a random spot so if we want it kind of in the middle where the crosshair is we're just going to left click it we're going to hit option and we're going to hit g that's just going to clear the location i'm going to do the same thing with the one over here on the right so i'm going to click it and i'm going to hit option and then i'm going to hit g and that puts it in the back now if we remember from when we had already split things like they're kind of just sitting on top of each other which can create a little bit of like cluster when you do rotate out of a view so if we want to move a reference back i usually move the front reference back so we're just going to click so this is the front reference here just click it and then as you can see once i turn it the way that i'm going to want to move is on this yaxis so i can move it backwards so i'm just going to hit g to grab and i'm going to hit y and then i'll just pull it on back that way they're not oops i'm like hitting my zoom screen here it's not letting me move all the way back okay don't hit g and then i hit y okay and then i hit one to put myself back in so you can see on this left screen here that this is uh the front reference so they're not like cross hair on each other okay so let's put in our object i got all of that by the way i just want to say yes you're doing great okay so i'm going to show you the way that i usually model as like i said i usually use the plane instead of a cube i usually don't like to start even though it sounds i guess kind of backwards i don't like to start with a 3d object in blender even though we're modeling 3d because of the fact that um like i kind of like to get there's just less vertices to worry about it's the short answer um to keep yourself kind of like um free from like manipulating something in the back that you didn't really intend to i like to use the plane because it is just that one so if i'm moving one in the front i know that i'm not accidentally kind of messing up something in the back which is why i use planes but again if you like the cube that you already started you can stick with the cube you can just start with one single vertice you can start with a sphere whatever you can even start with suzanne whatever feels comfortable for you go ahead and start with that so in order to get our object in that we want to start modeling with first we want to make sure we're in object mode so if you're in edit mode right now you can either come up to this tab and click object mode or um you can hit the tap button it'll put you back in object and once we're in object mode we're going to go ahead and add in our mesh by pressing shift a so that's how we add something and then i'm going to choose the plane okay now our plane got set kind of flat on the ground so i'm going to want to turn it so that it is kind of facing the same way that mu is facing in the front here so i'm going to rotate it so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to hit r because it's already grabbed and we know that because it's yellow so i'm going to hit rotate and i always rotate in the wrong direction so forgive me if i do this wrong but we'll figure it out all i'm going to do is hit d because i think we're rotating on the v and hit 90. okay that was the wrong way so i'm going to reset that i'm going to hit r and i'm going to hit x and i'm going to hit 90. there we go and that's going to bring us forward okay so again to get it to flip in the same way that mu is facing we'll just hit r to rotate and then we'll hit x because we want to rotate it on the x and then i'm just going to type 90 and that's going to bring it 90 degrees a 90 degree rotation and then you just hit enter okay now this is huge completely covering mu so we want to be able to see mu so again we're going to go to wire mode by hitting z and then we're going to go to wireframe so now we can see precious mu in the back and then we're going to scale down this plane because it's way too big for me right now so we're just going to hit s to scale and we're just gonna bring it down and i'm gonna get a little bit closer so again if you need to zoom in and out you can zoom in with the plus button you can zoom back out with the minds button all right now what i usually do when it comes to modeling i usually start with the body of anything i do a lot of character models i do a lot of like human models so i'll usually try to start with the body and then i'll move to maybe like the head and then i usually worry about limbs later so we're going to start with the body here i usually start with the very base of the body and then i work up but you can start at the neck and work down whatever feels more comfortable but um for this just for the sake of demoing something i'm going to start at the bottom sorry to interrupt you how do you get the wireframe again i thought i got stuck there you're fine so to get the fire screen you just hit z and it's going to bring that wheel got it got it all right so we are going to start at the base of mu so to do that um with our plane already selected and again we know it's selected because it is that orangy color we're just going to hit g to grab and now if you want to grab with precision you can hit g and then z and that's going to slide it like perfectly kind of up and down if you don't care for it being perfect you just hit g and just like place it freely wherever you want i know it's a little bit hard to see because mu is also white but i'm just going to place it i'm going to place it right about here i'm thinking i might change that but we'll replace it here okay now the way that i go about figuring out where to create new vertices is that i just kind of follow the curves of the body so if things start to curve i add new vertices so i'm going to show you what that looks like so first i'm actually going to set this at the very base of mu i'm not going to include mu's legs in there um so to oh and before we even can manipulate vertices we have to move into edit mode okay so with your plane selected you're gonna hit tab and that puts us into edit mode now if you hit tab and nothing happens a reason why is because it may not have the plane selected so if i hit tab right now i'm hitting it nothing's happening it's because the plane isn't selected so you have to have an object selected so that blender knows what you're trying to edit okay so we're going to hit the plane and then we're going to hit tab and that puts us into edit mode and you know you're in edit mode again because you'll see it up here but also all of the kind of vertices will become more visible in the object all right so the way that i do this again is i just follow the curves of the body and i manipulate the vertices that way so i'm going to start with this bottom one here i'm just going to drag and drop and i'm going to hit g and i'm just going to move it right about here and i'm going to click off and i'm going to do the same over here i'm just gonna move this maybe like right here i'm just gonna adjust this one too let's put it like right at the base okay and i'm gonna grab this top one and i'm gonna move it i'm gonna go pretty wide on this one because why not then i'm just gonna drop it and i'm gonna drag and i'm gonna grab with g and then i'm going to drop it okay so this is our very very bottom now we want to add more vertices and again there's a lot of different ways that you can do this but the way that i do it is through extruding so i'll show you what that looks like the way that we're going to extrude by first we're going to grab these top two vertices and then we're just going to hit e and that's what's going to allow us to extrude up you can really extrude any way that you want but we're going to go up because we are working on mu's body upwards so then we're just going to click to drop it i'm going to click again just to make sure i'm not holding on to any vertices then i'm going to do the same thing that i just did i'm just going to grab this left one gonna hit g to grab i'm gonna move it to align it with mu's body and click off and i'm gonna drag over this one hit g to grab i'm gonna move this vertice and then we're gonna do the same thing so we're just gonna drag we're gonna hit e to extrude and we're gonna go on up and click off to place it click again to make sure you're not holding any vertices you're gonna drag drop hit g and set this one to right about here maybe and do this again g to grab and move okay we're going to repeat this same process over and over until we get up back so i'm going to set this one maybe like right about here kind of where that curve starts to like taper another way again i'm going to drag grab place drag grab place do this again e to extrude put this right about here why not drag grab please drag grab place all right we're going to do that again i like two more times so i hit e to extrude i'll put it right about here i'm going to drag grab place drag grab place and do it one more time click shoot maybe right about here and then drag grab place drag grab place okay so i'm just gonna fix that firstly really quick okay so i'm gonna bring us back into solid mode just so you can see what this looks like so i'm gonna hit z i'm gonna go over here to solid just so you can see it filled in and then if i turn oop sorry i know that this looks like a lot just because our i'm gonna actually really quickly i'm gonna move this one i'm gonna move our left kind of reference back so that it doesn't get in the way when we do turn so i'm going to tab really quickly back to edit mode i'm going to grab our left reference here and i'm just going to rotate a little bit to see which uh which axis i want to move it back on so i want to move it back on this red axis here so that is the x so i'm just going to hit g to grab and then hit x and just move it out the way of this front view so it was about right here kind of blocking you so i'm just going to move it back that way it doesn't get in our way all right i'm gonna put us back in that right view and it wasn't hard to see right now but our model is still in front of that right whoops actually sorry i just realized we didn't do that but that's okay we'll we'll come back we're ready to move it because i don't want us to do too much at once so right now i'm gonna put us back in our front and our right we're going to hit tab to go back to edit whoops first i'm going to click the model so it knows where we're editing and we're going to hit tab to go back to edit and i just wanted to rotate it just so you can see what this is looking like so far so it looks like nothing kind of we have a front body outline but right now it's just that flat plane because that's what i picked because i didn't want the back vertices to kind of get away but now we do want muse body to be 3d i mean that's why we are in 3d why we are in blender today so i'm going to show you how to make it then 3d so what we're going to do i'm going to tap back just so we're in front view and it doesn't have to look at too much stuff all at once i'm going to grab all of these vertices just like this and i'm going to kind of turn it a little just because i want you to be able to see this all right actually i can do it in right view see that's why we split our views so we can see these things so i'm going to put this back in front just so you can see it in real time so i'm going to grab all these vertices and what i'm going to do is i'm going to hit e to extrude and now when we're in our right side so i want you to look at this right panel here if we want to move to the right we have to use the yaxis okay so on this extrude i'm going to extrude on the y so i'm going to hit e and i'm going to hit y and it's just going to bring all of these vertices back so now we have a bit of a body now it's very square but that's okay now kind of a cheat code that i want to show everyone that is going to help when you're modeling anything bilateral so anything like humans animals anything that's kind of mirrored from one side to the other there's actually a mirror it's called a modifier in blender that will help you kind of model the same thing on each side which is really useful for body stuff really useful really again for anything that's bilateral so that you don't have to make changes on both sides as you change one side it'll make a change on another side so i'm going to show you how to do that so again we have our body here what we are going to do is i'm going to click off that i'm going to come over here to our tools panel which i know we haven't talked about yet there's a lot of really useful tools here but i don't want to confuse everyone so today we're only going to really focus on this tool right here called a loop cut and all that loop cut does is that it cuts something all the way around okay so we're gonna and i'll show you what that looks like we're going to click loop cut and we're going to go over our model here and you'll see this line form and there's different ways that we can cut it if i want to cut it around vertically i can do that or horizontally i can do that if i want to cut it vertically i'll set it here and we're going to cut it vertically so that we can mirror one side on the other okay so to do that to lay your loop cut all you have to do is left click now let's say i don't want to write in the middle for whatever reason you can drag it as well i don't want that i do want it right in the middle so i'm just going to click left click right where it is and then hit and then we'll just go back to our just go back to your selection okay so now we should have a cut going right down the middle of mu's body okay so what we're going to do now is going to hit b to go back into wireframe and then we are going to drag everything on the left side of mu's body all those vertices but not the middle ones you want to leave the middle ones alone you just want to grab all the vertices on the left side and we're going to hit x and it's going to bring up our delete panel and we're just going to hit vertices okay so that left side should be gone now which probably is like oh my gosh what's happening i'm scared don't worry it's gonna be great it's gone we're now gonna grab the right side of mu's body make sure you grab make sure you're in wireframe so that you can grab everything including those back vertices we're going to come to this panel over here on the right side we're going to hit this wrench looking thing which is the modifier tab and then and let me move my zoom screen a little bit a little bit in the way you can't see we're going to go to add modifier it's going to bring up a million different things that you can do in blender this is one of the areas where you should definitely explore there's some really really cool things that you can do but for right now all we need is the mirror modifier which is going to be under generate so come down here and hit mirror and bam now mu's body is back on the other side so as i change one thing so if i take this one and i move it it's going to happen on the other side as well okay so as we're trying to get that body perfect now we only have to worry about one side and the other side the mirror modifier will do the rest of the leg work so i'm just curious so that wasn't entirely necessary because we had vertices for the other side but because we were doing it manually it wasn't necessarily like perfectly symmetrical so now by like deleting it mirroring it it's like it's kind of like a cleanup step yeah it's definitely not necessary it's just if you want to keep things perfect which i don't always do this honestly i will usually go in and adjust every single vertice one by one by hand it's totally not necessary so if you want to just have like a quicker way to do that um if you wanted to just model half of it this is the mirror modifier is a really great way to make sure you don't have to do as much work as you would if you do it manually okay so now that we have our mirror modifier on there i just want to note that once you delete that you know i can't manipulate the left side on my own now just whatever happens on the right side is what's going to get kind of moved to the left side okay so just keep that in mind that if you're like i can't grab anything on the left side it's because it's being mirrored so we can only manipulate things on the right side now okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna start to i think make this body a little bit more realistic now what i also want to keep in mind or just note when it comes to 3d work is that when you are rendering things you don't want to do every single detail in one view because once you move to another view what's it's going to get kind of manipulated and change so you want to capture the shapes of things in these kind of initial stages so just like how we did we captured the shape of the body but i don't want to go in and like add the arms and then like make sure his body is completely like perfect because once i start to model from like the back or model on the side that's going to get changed a lot so make sure you're capturing the shape but don't do every single detail just yet because it's going to get kind of like manipulated kind of later on okay so right now we have like this really square kind of thing going on it's not really that cute and mu as we know is like more rounded so we're going to do first i'm going to take us back into solid mode by hitting z and then going solid just so we can see and like i said earlier the way to get things more realistic the way to get things rounder is by adding in more vertices so that's what i'm going to do now with another loop cut so i'm going to go over here to the panel i'm going to click loop cut and i'm thinking i'm going to cut it in the middle here and then i'm just going to hit click to land it and i'm going to go back here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to scale this a little bit so i'm going to hit s whoops and i'm going to scale it on actually i don't like how that's happening i'm going to let's see hmm okay so instead of doing that i think what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to actually take this front part and i'm just going to kind of like shift it a little bit to the front so that it is like creating a more rounder effect so to do that i'm going to click these vertices here now what you're going to notice that as you click vertices you're going to like lose the other one so if you want to grab multiple you'll left click and then hold down shift so i'm just going to grab this front line here i think and then i'm thinking i'm just going to hit grab i'm just going to kind of like move it in a bit oops sorry my computer is freezing sorry my computer's a little bit old and actually i'm going to go back to wireframe just so i can see i just want to make sure i'm not grabbing anything i don't need to grab so that looks fine i'm gonna go back to solid and it's gonna i like that extra point here for some reason so let's go to wireframe and grab i'm just going to circle select these and hopefully i'm going to unselect these by grabbing oh oh boy how did you circle select again what's the looks like you just hit c c okay got it you get bigger or smaller by um two fingers just dragging up and down so if i want to make this pretty small oh okay and then i'm going to i'm going to drag here and then you hit enter to get rid of the crosshair but like i don't want these so i'm going to click okay and let's see if that'll there we go okay so i'm just kind of like pulling it in just a little to get like that initial like roundness it's not round yet because we're gonna have to add more vertices but i'm just kind of pulling it in just to have it be a little less square you know it's very very square right now and that's not really what we want so i'm going to do the same on this side i'm just holding shift to grab multiple vertices at once i'm going to grab all these and then again i'm just gonna hit grab just kind of just push it in a little bit and we have just like some roundness again it's not gonna be perfect in the beginning but that's okay we don't need it to be perfect in the beginning we just want to try to begin to capture the shape now something i want to note that you might be seeing as you move vertices because of the mirror modifier you're going to start to get gaps kind of here in the kind of center where it was split don't worry about that though we can merge them back together in the end so if you're noticing like splits it's not a mistake it's just kind of like an effect of the mirror modifier okay so it's looking a little funky right now but again that's okay we don't want to add in all the details and have it be super perfect just yet because we need to add in like the head we need to add in the feet and that's going to require like us to keep it basic so that when we attach things things don't get too funky okay so what i want to do is first i just noticed that over here on our right side our model isn't aligned on the right so let's just first move that really quick okay so we can actually move it in edit mode we don't have to go back to object to move it i'm just going to go to wireframe just to make sure that i'm grabbing all of it and then i'm going to hit g and then i'm gonna hit y and then i'm just gonna move it in front again it's not perfect right now we're gonna have to like we're probably gonna have to rotate it because mu's body's got to rotate uh we're gonna have to like remanipulate stuff but that's okay we just want to know where we're at right now so before i do any more kind of like body work again i don't like to get too detailed in the beginning because we have to attach other things so i want us to move to the head so to do that we there's multiple ways we can do this but for me in order to stay kind of like clean or to keep my viewport clean i'll usually kind of hide objects and i i like to model separately you can model different parts all together so if i wanted to take this top part and like grab these faces so i can do a face select i can grab these and i can like extrude and i can start to do the neck of the head i don't like to do that because it can get really like and get really finicky in there and it's just it never really goes super smooth for me when i do that so instead i like to create a whole new object okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to hit tab to go back into object mode because we want to add a new object okay and what i'm going to do is i'm going to hide the body so to do that up here in the top right corner you'll see steam collection and that has everything that we've put in our scene listed and you can use these little eyes to show or to hide them so uh the plane here or whatever shape you use if you use a sphere it'll say sphere if you use a cube and say cube is going to be our body and we can if you want to rename it just so you can keep track you can double click it and just go ahead and name it body or whatever you want to name it and then i'm going to go ahead and just hide it that way we don't have to worry about it as we do our head okay so to do our head we're going to do kind of same exact thing that we did for the body so we're just going to start by hitting shift a to add in whatever shape you want to use to make the head i'm going to use a plane again just because what i like it's going to put that plane in there but again it puts it flat so when we want to turn it we're just going to hit r to rotate we're going to hit x and then we're going to hit 90 and then we're going to hit enter okay and then we'll hit v if you want to see it wireframe and then we can hit s to go ahead and scale it down and i'm gonna place it i'm gonna hit g and i'm just gonna place it kind of arbitrarily in front of him now before i start moving dan i notice we're at 12 40. and we're not super far in the model but i just want to see how we're feeling time wise how much i don't know i think so i mean i don't have a super strong opinion i'm happy to go for longer the audience seems to be enjoying this i think maybe though it might be good what we could try to do is just get um like a basic version of the head which is kind of similar to what you did with the body we can move quickly through that okay and then and then i think the most important thing is for people then to learn how to like save and even like share it in a way because then um what i would love if for people watching i'm going to do this myself if you work on your mew or whatever model you're making throughout the day or the weekend maybe there's a way we can just share it with each other on social media i mean that could just be a screenshot but even if there's a way to like export um export directly from blender like something i wonder if there's a way i know we're not covering animation but is there a way to like make like really quickly export just like a your model spinning around video but that's like a complicated thing yes there is i mean there's definitely a way to do it as far as is it simple yeah well maybe just an image just an image of the model yeah i can definitely show how to because i've already completed a muse so i can pull to show how to right right we can look at that and then also like even if just export as to like obj or whatever the yeah what file format is because one of the things that i and next time i live stream is try to import it into processing or p5 and see how that goes right for sure okay cool yeah let's do that and i definitely want to make sure that we have time for like questions right right here there are questions yeah so let's move towards wrapping up we can add the head and then we will have like a mewtwo is just like body and head and exercise for the viewer is try to add the feet and i guess the tail would be is like a really high degree of difficulty but try now that would be cool the tail i actually really this was actually the first time i ever modeled the tail and i actually really enjoyed doing the tails the thing that gave me the most trouble is like actually these little arms like they're just so small right harmless an armless mew is okay i think so honestly okay so let's get the head so again we're gonna do the head the same exact way that we did the body so we're gonna start just by grabbing it with g we're going to move it to the base here and then we're going to hit tab to go into edit mode and then we're just going to start manipulating the vertices alright so we're going to drag and grab with g move it i'm going to put it i want to make sure i capture the nose so i'm going to put it all right about here it's going to drag grab drag and i'll put it right about here for now drag grab and then we'll take these top two and we're gonna extrude with e okay and then we're going to drag and grab i might actually lower this i might adjust this later but that's okay this is good for now g to grab again and then we are going to drag again and then hit e to extrude g to grab g to grab and what i want to note so mu has ears and eyes as you can see but these are things that we want to add after we kind of get the base of the head so as you're extruding up and trying to capture you know mu shape i'm gonna actually move these down um don't worry about the eyes and don't worry about the ears just yet we'll add those in a little bit later i'm just gonna move these down just wanna capture more of his curves all right we're going to do the same thing and go ahead and hit e i'm going to do it like right at the base of the ear there i think g to grab g2 grab do this again and right about there g to grab g to grab i'll probably do this like two more times we're going to hit e to extrude again g to grab g to grab extrude one more time and then g to grab place it right about there and g to grab right about there okay so if we go to solid view this is what it looks like it captures the head pretty well i mean there are some gaps kind of down here that we can fix later on when we do more detail or if you want to add it in now you can um it's not something you really have to worry about right now we just kind of have that basic geometry of the head and uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna extrude it okay so we are going to grab all of the vertices here and i just noticed i keep accidentally moving it on the right so don't be like me like i said i tend to kind of focus on one viewport but if you want to make sure that you are using both of your ports just you just want to make sure that this model is in front here you don't necessarily need it just yet because we're not modeling um we're not kind of like getting the details of his side profile yet but if you want to move this right in front we'll go over here and we'll hit g and then we'll hit y just like move the head back actually i'm going to move it i'm gonna move it like right about here so that when i extrude it back i can see how long i want his head to be okay so we have all our vertices selected we're just gonna hit e and now again we're gonna want to extrude to the right so if we're in this left panel to go right if we look up a little compass here we're going to use the y axis okay so we're going to hit e to extrude then hit y and then we're just going to bring that bad boy all the way back to maybe right about here because his head is a little long and then we'll just hit left click just to set it okay so if we turn as you can see we have his long mushroom looking head right now which is great and again the key to making things more realistic is to add more vertices just a standard practice i like to loop cut a couple of times on the body i just did one just so i could show you but with this head i think i'm going to loop cut it a couple of times so i'm going to come back into the front view here i'm going to go over to our panel here go back to loop cut now when you think about your face you know it's like this rounded thing right so there's like a cut like if i cut right down here that will get like the mirroring for both my eyes but i also want to capture like you know this rounded part here and this rounded part here and that's kind of what i think about what i'm doing like a body or a head i'm trying to figure out how to cut it i'm trying to think of like how round i want it to be so because i want to capture the full roundness of his head and i'm going to loop cut it maybe three times we'll see so i'm going to hit this loop cut button and i'm going to click right down the middle and then i want to loop cutting i'm going to loop cut it again why not and then i'm going to loop cut it again over on the right side and i also so remember we're not just modeling in one view right we want to make sure that it's looking good on every angle so i'm also just so we can see it solid i'm gonna bring it back to solid mode i'm gonna loop cut it at least once here i'm probably gonna end up cutting it more but just for now i'm just gonna loop cut it here and i'm just gonna go back to my mouse now you have the option again of doing the mirror modifier if you want to make sure that your head is like completely symmetrical on both sides if you want to do the mirror modifier again all you have to do is hit z to go to wireframe you're just going to pick whichever size that you want to get rid of so if you want to get rid of the left side you'll grab all the vertices on the left just make sure you don't grab that middle kind of partition and then you'll just delete it by pressing x and then vertices and then to add in the mirror we're going to grab everything on the right and then we're going to go to our panel here we'll go back to this wrench looking thing which is the modifier tab we'll go to add modifier and then we'll hit mirror and now it's on both sides and now again you might have some splitting going on uh don't worry about it if you don't like the splitting or if it's making you nervous you also have the option of just not using the mirror modifier which is totally fine and i guess i can i'll show that here with the head just so we can get an idea of like what it's like to not use the mirror modifier i mean it's really just more kind of manually manipulation so okay so from here we have our head again it's looking very boxy so i'm gonna actually come to our right panel now so i can start to move things to match the shape of mu's head so on our left side i'm going to hit z and hit wireframe so i can see where all the points are okay and again i just want to start to kind of match things really to the shape of his head okay so i'm going to start by dragging and selecting and again you want to make sure you're in wireframe because if you're in solid and you grab something it's only going to grab the very front one so whatever is happening on one side is not going to happen other side so make sure you're in wireframe by hitting z and then wireframe and then we're just going to start to drag some things well we're just going to figure it out all right so we're going to drag this i'm going to drag and drop and then hit g to just kind of move i'm going to take things a little bit slow because there are multiple vertices and it's really easy to like kind of tangle vertices and i don't want to do that so i'm just gonna start by getting these to kind of go where i'm thinking i want them to go and i mind you this might look a little bit different to what you're seeing if you decided to keep the modem the mirror modifier but it's the same kind of concept you're just kind of lining up where you think all of the kind of vertices should go for this side of the head i'm just going to grab it drop it grab this move it up a little i think i want to i'm actually gonna shift all these forward just a little bit and then i'm thinking move this one up and again you don't have to do this the exact way that i'm doing it if you're looking and you're like chrissy this varsity should obviously go over here please definitely do that you want to do it in a way that feels comfortable and feels like whatever makes sense kind of to you so i'm going to put this one here i'm going to quickly move these up so that i don't tangle this one because i want this one to kind of come over here but it's still a little low so i'm going to move all of these up again i'm just going to bring this one in here i'm going to bring this one kind of up here i'm gonna take these and bring them in close it to the head and then let's see let's take this one down now remember we don't have ears yet and the ears are kind of blocking part of the head so you just want to kind of assume where his like headlines i guess would fall so i'm going to take this one and put it here i'm gonna take this one just kind of put it whoops i didn't mean to grab all those i just want to grab this one kind of place it here i'm gonna bring this one just a little bit back i'm gonna bring this one here i'm gonna bring this one maybe like right about there we can make some adjustments and now again as you can see like there's like gaps that the vertices can't quite cover because we don't yet have enough but that is also something that we can kind of fix later on okay so we just moved things around you may have seen things kind of happen in the front view but i'm going to change this to solid just so you can see it so it's looking pretty good it looks like his head i'm going to view but as you can see it's pretty wide so we're gonna have to fix that but that's okay but we're starting to kind of capture what his head like the shape of the head from both the front so if we take this back to solid you see it's still capturing what it looks like in the front and if we change this one to wireframe as well it's all kind of captured on the side as well of course we're having some proportion issues but that's okay because right now we're just trying to get shape all right now from here i want to have it to where we have something that at least looks decent before we go so let's let's do like a little bit of detail work on the head again i usually don't try to do too too much because in order to connect the head and the body you kind of want the you don't want the mesh to be too unbalanced when it comes to vertices so if i have like a hundred vertices on the head but then i only have like 20 vertices on the body connecting it might get like a little bit funky but for the sake of just like getting us familiar with modeling and like kind of making pushing things around to make it look like what we're trying to model i'm gonna go ahead and do just a little bit of detail work to get this head looking a little bit better okay so from here this is definitely an area where i encourage you to go off the rails move things as you feel they should be moved i'm gonna make adjustments and i'll try to talk through what i'm doing but honestly it's going to look a little bit sporadic because that's kind of the way that i model i just kind of like try things and then see how it looks delete it if it doesn't look so good try other things but this is definitely the area where you just kind of want to freeform and like experiment and see what's working and kind of not working okay so for me as i'm looking at this head it's just looking like it just looks very alien it's looking kind of wide it's not really like as round as i would want it to be so what i'm thinking is now mind you i don't have the mirror modifier on so i have to keep in mind that whatever i do on one side i'm gonna have to do on the left side if you decide to keep the mirror modifier you're a little bit in luck because as you adjust one side it's just gonna automatically do that for you so let's see again i'm looking at this head it's looking a little funky and it's looking a little flat so i think first i'm going to try to kind of round out the front now something i haven't shown just yet is that so far we've been manipulating vertices and i think i talked about this just for a second but if you want to manipulate whole faces or edges you have the option to do that as well so if you come up here and you look right next to our edit tab we have these three different boxes here and this tells us which kind of editing mode or selecting mode that we are in so so far we've been in vertex select so if you have this selected you're going to see all the vertex present but if we want to manipulate some edges we can hit edge select and that's going to show us all the edges and let's say we want to manipulate a whole face then we'll click face select and it's also going to then allow us to click faces okay so edges will let us just click the edge and then vertices is going to show you to click those vertices now the benefit of vertex select is that it's going to be the most detailed so if you're trying to get in and like make really small kind of adjustments i would suggest sticking to vertex if you want to make kind of like wide things so usually when i'm trying to like round things out i oftentimes like to come into face select and i'll just kind of grab like some middle things and again if you want to grab more than one thing just hold down shift and like usually when we're rounding things out like the kind of front of the sphere is a little bit further than the rest so i'm just gonna grab this i'm gonna hit y and i'm just gonna bring it forward a little bit just kind of round round that part out okay so we're getting a little bit of roundness here now these um these sides here are giving like they're getting a square they're serving a square right now but we want round again so i'm also just going to like kind of grab these now another trick to grab things kind of more quickly if you know that you want to grab like this whole line you can just hold shift and double click and it's just going to grab everything kind of in that loop and then i'm going to hit grab and now i did something funky with the way that i laid so as you can see it's kind of like pushed in and out and this is something that i will have to fix later if you're getting some of those like funkiness where your mesh is kind of like overlapping the way that you'll want to fix that is just going to hit b in wireframe and now i know this looks a little bit scary but it's just going to show you you just want to like look and just kind of see what is what are the ones that are kind of like inverted so if i get close here if you can see right here oh this point sorry i'm trying to get close in there it's actually not it's this point i'm just kind of looking to see what part is kind of inside of each other also going to like i just switched to edge mode so i can see what the lines are let's see i think this line which i'm having some trouble grabbing is just like a little bit it's kind of going over this other line here so i'm just going to quickly just kind of bring it out so i don't want it to be in the way i'm going to see how that feels and again this is the part where i'm saying it gets really funky and like if you're like chrissy you should do something else like try whatever works for you here because you want to try to get these vertices to not be on top of each other like this like i'm having this like concave like funky thing going on here that is like not what i want at all i'm gonna go back into wireframe just to see what is overlapping i think this one i'm just gonna bring this a little bit in and bring this one a little bit out just see if i can try to like correct some of these things dan how are you doing over there how's yours looking mine's mine's looking kind of interesting i i'm going to bring it up on the screen so people can see really briefly it's not as it's not as beautiful as yours this is i mean looking very very funky right now oops one thing actually that's happened to me um and i i'm going to show this i i actually there is a way that i can have you see what i'm doing by like sending it but back into the zoom meeting but but let me just explain it so when i'm i'm in my um front orthographic view and as soon as i go to rotate it like takes me somewhere like really not rotate as soon as i go to like a spin so that i can look at it from a slightly different angle it takes me to like this weird other place like far far away from the model oh no oh okay i'm showing it to people so maybe maybe somebody if somebody you don't need to answer this for me right now figured out but i'm just showing it if somebody in who's watching the live knows i'm sort of demonstrating it because it doesn't happen for me on my left panel like that works as expected like like where it thinks the center of the world is or something when i start to spit i'm wondering there could be a couple different things going on i think i'd have to see it yeah i can work that out with you later but i think you know i think we're in like a pretty good place like i mean you could probably um i'm i'm moving it back to your screen now work on like the detailing here like forever yeah i mean this is this is the hard part to i guess kind of show because this takes forever like because vertices get lost vertices do things that you did not want it to do and it really takes a lot of just like manipulating for a while so i think i would love i would love to show and walk us through getting through them all because i know probably right now like this looks like nothing i don't know but i do want to show you kind of how to export yeah and also um i can just yeah i said oh maybe i can show maybe i can do something after to walk us through like after like a different live stream or like a video or something i can show kind of better how to detail because trying to do it quickly is kind of what got me into this anyway yeah well i think you know detailing to me also feels like that's like a huge like subject unto itself yeah this is like incredible i mean i was i mean i've never made a model like this before and i was totally able to do it which is kind of unbelievable oh people are answering my question now um so but i do think that's what's really important for us to show is i mean obviously i see in mine like there's like file save yeah so i will show kind of the difference between saving and exporting and also really quickly i think i saved my mew before i connected things so let me see if i can let's see what this looks like oh yeah i'd love to see the um the finished view yeah i think i moved it to a different file sorry you're like seeing my whole desktop right now okay i can switch to mine i'm switch to mine for a second while you're looking so people said i should hit preferences navigation orbit around selection tell me when you're ready i'll switch it back to yours okay let's go maybe your anchor point is not center click shift s cursor to world origin cursor to world origin no oh okay let's see let's try one more right marcos writes and this is exactly how i feel for beginners like myself making two boxes with rounded corners is a victory i totally agree like i got this sort of like lumpy frumpy little like beginnings of a mew and uh bar and i'm just like so excited to see where it goes yay i'm glad i wanted to be able to walk everyone through but it is kind of like a lot for the time that we have but i'll do my best yeah and also you know one thing that that i don't know if anyone asked this but um certainly i'm curious is like where like what are what are you know resources that other people that you found useful as your learning blender like if people want to learn more do more is there uh a book that you looked at a website i mean there's um are there recommendations yeah so first i mean youtube is definitely my best friend um a couple one modeler i can think of off the brain i think his name is olaf 3d hat i think has some good tutorials for modeling but also if you're really interested in animation um i can't think of any more off the head i can try to gather some things after just look through but there if you just um like youtube like uh 3d model humans or yeah 3d model or character modeling or modeling for 3d printing you'll get some really good things also on the blender website they have some references built in as well they have a whole library that you can go through that has some really great like tutorials and tips and um one other thing is like i you know uh coding train regular viewers probably know about this but if you're new here because you came because you want to learn about blender you want to learn more about chrissy's work um we do have a discord so i think if i press this button here the link to the discord is going to go into the chat just did um and so that could also be a place we could create a blender channel in there um you know people could sort of like share resources or ask questions or even if like you know we could share some like model files and different things there as well i mean chrissy you're welcome to try to obligate you to suddenly joining our discord answering everybody's question but if you want to pop in there and like that's also a place where people who want to go further with us could reach out to you for sure um we could we can switch back okay look at that it looks a little funky uh the reason why these are um pink right now is because these are actually the reference photo but i move them off my desktop originally they were on my desktop and then i moved it off my desktop and then i moved it back so the file path just kind of got messed up so i'm just going to hide those we don't have to worry about that okay so this was like kind of a beginning stage for the mew um right now it has the mirror modifier on it on both of these and but it's all um none of these are connected right now so i can just really quickly show you what i would do to first apply the mirror modifier and then kind of sew the head back together in the body and then like connect i i think i'll sure okay hopefully i can do that quick so then i can go all the rendering stuff okay so again right now everything is separate um let's start with maybe sewing the head back together so i'm gonna hide body i'm gonna hide the split on the head all this good stuff okay so we have our head now in order to apply a modifier you have to be in object mode which is what we are in right now and then once you apply it it's basically it just doesn't it's not going to mirror anymore so we are at that point like we have our head it's looking decent we're just going to hit apply so now all of these vertices are their own again so if i do something on the right it's not going to affect the left anymore so to sew this up honestly i'm pretty sure there's a quicker way to do this and like i feel like i've done in the past but i can't remember that way so i'm going to show you the way that i do remember the way that i merge kind of uh vertices together is i'll just click one and i'll click its buddy and i'll hit option m and then at center and i'll just go and be a surgeon and stitch mew right on up so this is what you can do to if that mirror modifier left you with a split you can just sew him right back up by doing this and as i'm doing this i'm realizing that if i'm going to do this for the head and the body we're probably going to take a little minute but i do want to show what it is like to connect so i'm just going to sew these bottom ones really quick and then i'll try to don't want that there's some interesting suggestions in the chat that people are saying also the way that they do this like solar liner writes you don't need to uh there's a merge mode in the mirror modifier that merges vertices and edges that are close to the mirror plane oh sleep and luis says select clipping in the mirror and select the middle vertices move them to center i don't know what that means but it sounds very it sounds like the right idea i already applied this modifier so i have to go back but those sound like really great yeah they sound like really great and simple selections it's the same thing as with coding there's always like in javascript especially there's like 10 ways to do the same exact thing so and everybody has their own sort of like tricks and style thank you for putting those suggestions in there because i will that will save me a lot of time um again i did want to show how to do that but i want to make sure that i get in how to render and all that good stuff so i'm going to skip to that i'm so sorry yeah i think that's great okay there's no way that this well first of all there's no way that this single live stream could comprehensively cover everything there is so i think i just want to show everything i want everyone to be able to have their mind but what we what i think what's really amazing that you're doing is just like i wouldn't have even known where to even start i can't believe that i've already made a model and so like obviously there's you know it's what's the like a mile wide an inch deep but i've got that wrong whatever the expression is you know we've got that basic and there's obviously you can go super deep into blender and and a couple people also posted some of their uh youtube channels that they um that they suggest for so one of the things that i can also do is this when this video gets archived the uh it'll be on youtube but i can always add an update to the video description so if there are additional resources or things that we want to add we'll just put that in the video description perfect okay so if you saw like the kind of screenshot or the image of like the final mew that was on like the coding train page or on my page this is what the model was so this is my finished one um again i usually do low poly work i usually keep things actually lower poly than this but i wanted the mu to be a little bit smooth so there was a couple things i did to do that but here is my little mew um i added if you're seeing these boxes um i just added some plain so i can create like a stage to uh take a picture in that's a whole other doing background stuff is like a whole other thing in blender that i can't really get into right now but if you're wondering like why are these huge planes there that's that's just why you don't need to add planes right now okay so let's say you know you you got it you work through all of the manipulating of the vertices your mu is looking good you want to save it that's first and foremost we want to make sure we save so to save you're just going to come up here to file you just go to save as and then you can save the file whatever you want to save it as i saved it as new final i usually save as i move through every process so like when i finished which i guess i didn't do that with the oh what what i did like when i had all my finished pieces well first i'll save it in the very beginning and then as i have all my finished pieces i'll save that as something before i connect things just in case i messed something up and i'll save it again after connecting and i'll save it again once i have like my scene set up you want to make sure you save and then you just save it to whatever folder whatever box you just hit save a splendor file if you want to make this like a obg file i'm in obj file for putting and processing or any other type of file you'll then go to export and you'll see all the different types of files here so you have obj right here you have stl stl is good for 3d printing and a whole other range of files okay so again if you want to save saving is one thing and then exporting is another thing exporting is what you'll use to put it in another kind of software now rendering is its own third thing so like i said in order to render so to take a picture of it you have to have a camera okay so that's what this little doohickey is right here this is my camera that i had set up um i can't well just to make sure everyone knows how to add a camera since we deleted it in the previous one i'll do that with us so i'm going to delete this and we're just going to hit shift a make sure you're in object mode if you're not in object mode you just wanna hit tab to get back to object mode hit shift a and then you can come down here to camera now sometimes when you add the camera it's like already i'm pretty much every time when you add a camera into a scene it's like already kind of at this like funky angle it's just like why are you rotated slightly i don't really understand this if you want to clear that you can just hit option r you can hit option g to put it in the center if it's not in the center already and then as you can see it's pointing downward so we just want to rotate it so i'm going to rotate it on the y i'm going to do whoops sorry i'm going to rotate it on the x 90 degrees so that it's gonna be like facing our precious mu okay and then you move things the same way that you move a mesh you can move the camera so you just hit g to grab and you hit y and we can move this in front okay now our camera has its own separate view from what we are seeing in the viewport so viewport view and camera view are different so if you want to know what your camera is seeing there's two ways you can do this one is you can just come to view and um you can go sorry if we go to view you go to viewport if you hit camera or if you hit zero you'll see what your camera is seeing now once you rotate though it's going to instantly take you out of that so if you want your camera to kind of move with you there's a way you can lock that so to do that we're gonna first hit n it's gonna bring up this panel right here okay and we're gonna make sure we're in this view tab and we're gonna hit lock camera to view okay so then we're gonna hit zero again to go back to the camera mode what button did you press to bring up that tab to lock you'll hit n so as in number yeah and then you'll go to the view tab and then you hit lock camera to view and then now when we rotate or as we move the camera moves with us so this is really good for making sure that like when you're ready to take your picture but it's at the exact kind of angle that you wanted and so if i want this like bird's eye view like mew or maybe i want this like side view because i think he looks adorable for the side i can go ahead and just set that right on up and whatever is within the um orange or yellow kind of outline is what you're going to get in your camera there's different ways that you can adjust your camera which again we don't have time to get in here but there's a whole camera panel over here on the right where you can adjust um your camera we can adjust the dimensions and all that good stuff we're not going to worry about that right now so in order to render then so we have our camera set up at the angle that we want um i do want to know that if we don't have light in there your picture is not going to show so you want to make sure to add a light i already have a light set up because again this is my like final scene type of thing so you'll be able to see what happens here but just know that if you go to render if you do the same exact steps that i do here and it's just like completely dark it's because you don't have a light and if you want to add light you can add do shift a again and there's a bunch of different types of lights here you can just kind of arbitrarily throw one in for now just so you can have some light around me for when you take your picture okay so to render there's a couple different ways that you can go about rendering as well i mean the simplest way is you can come up here to the render tab and you can just hit render image and now my computer is a little bit slow because it is old but i will show you i got mine i'm gonna switch i'm gonna show it to people wait everybody here's my view and mine just popped up it's pretty here we go back to yours yours is much nicer back and forth everybody really simple again just wall and floor and color just so he can like be in something nothing fancy but that's why you're seeing like the little teal colors because i put a color onto the wall now so you have your picture this is what it looks rendered what you'll do to save it is it'll just go up here to image and then save as and then i'll just name it i'm just gonna put on my desktop and save it and then when i go to my desktop we have the image right here and this is what you can use to share you can always just take a screenshot but the screenshot is not going to be as good as a resolution the benefit of rendering is that you're able to up the resolution um i could make it like better than this if i wanted to i can change the dimensions of it um when i want to animate that's how you'll capture it through rendering so yeah when you're ready to export your picture that's all you have to do you just want to make sure you have a camera and you have a light in there and you just set your scene up however you want so if um this is amazing by the way i'm so excited we just i don't know why that step to me was just so exciting to see the sort of like high quality render um which especially when working in like real time graphics with 3d and processing or p5 generally you don't have that sort of like level of resolution um so i i guess as an ex i guess one thing so let's think about this for a second if people make their own models that they learn to make from today and they want to share it with you or me or both of us um so that um obviously we have rendering the image is perfect um do you would you like is instagram or twitter like what's um what's a good and should we should we come up with a um a plan a hashtag um oh hashtags are cute let's see so i'm gonna pull up um well i'm not logged into my twitter right now it's gonna post mine but if you do want to post it um either to twitter or to instagram and to share it for me to see i'm chrissy bermidge on both okay so i would love to see it please feel free to tag me i would love to see your mew and also if you have any questions feel free to reach me on there as well i'm happy to answer questions um i'm pulling it up so it's on my screen now i'm pulling up your twitter which has um when you by the way if you want to see the reel again it's right there i posted the reel on my twitter which chrissy has here at the top of hers as well um let's pull up your instagram also so people can see it alright and there's mew there's exactly that image yay perfect so yeah please feel free to share please feel free to experiment feel free to ask questions i'll make sure to what one one thing that came up in the chat like so um so we can we can answer maybe um we we we should probably wrap up like let chrissy and everybody have a break because we've been going for a very long time thank you so much for spending so much time with us it's like incredible the amount of um uh information that you were able to pack into such a like one singular live stream i know if i if i had my whole weekend free i'd just be uh which you know would be stuck in like in blender i think yeah definitely have to find some more time um somebody a couple people mentioned in the chat um you that that you can shade it with smooth on or smooth shade yes so you can what is that so let me get out of this rendering here then go back and blender so i usually don't use smooth shading because i do low poly but if you want to you can just and let me um let me add in like a different like model because this is already pretty smooth or let me just go back to one of the other ones that i had open it's gonna be like oh oops i forgot that i moved it okay so like this one for example uh let's say that i wanted to just make like i wanted to render where it's not so boxy or i want it to the shading to be smoother just automatically what you can do is just right click whoops first sorry we're going to tab into edit i'm just going to right click that amaryllis writes um this stream was the best as i have a good confidence of making low poly the stream gave me next level confidence um and and the people in the chat are are suggesting i think i suggested it if people are thumbs upping it our hashtag is mewtrain so mewtrain i love that i love that so yeah okay so with that question you have the choice of um having with it being flat or have it being smooth so i've been doing flat because again i do low poly stuff but if you want it to be smooth just right click whoops make sure you're on the object and then right click and then hit just shade smooth you see it on oh yeah wow yeah the way that i made the mute though um smooth in that final reference was actually a modifier so i can show that as well let me move my zoom screen again it's in front so i'm just going to take this head here i'm going to go to the modifier tab and i'm just going to apply that because i don't really need it anymore and then the way that i did that was i went to da da da da da where is it subdivision surface it automatically just kind of smooths things out for you ah okay and then you just hit apply so in your um the final mu version that you made that's the stuff that you that you added yeah because i like like i said i love low poly and i wanted those kind of like planes in there so i usually do the subdivision surface but if you just want it to be completely round you can go ahead and just switch right over to shane's food um so funny story is that when i first was experimenting with some new 3d printers that we got at nyu my kids asked me to 3d print a pikachu and so i found some model that i online and i just like downloaded it and 3d printed was great is there are is there like anything you have to keep in mind like could that mew that you made be 3d printed or do you have to like conform to some specification like you can't have the model do this twist or this turn i mean it probably depends on what 3d printer you're using i'm sure i'm uh opening up a huge can of worms here but in in the basic sense if people want to 3d print what they've made is there anything any extra steps they should think about yeah so i'm still honestly trying to figure this out myself because i i started modeling in 2018 but then that first model that i made it was to be printed but i had someone else printed i just bought my first printer last year and what i am learning is that there definitely are things that you have to keep in mind um just off the brain some things i'm thinking about are like inverted vertexes so like how i had some of those like when i was playing around with that initial model and i had some vertexes that were kind of like under other vertexes that can cause errors but honestly there are software's out there already that people have made like open source things that will correct your model for you so at this stage if you're like i want to print things right away but i'm not sure if my model is kind of up to par for that you can i can give you a link to one of them so that you can just pop your model in it and it'll correct things for you and you can go ahead and print it but yeah there definitely are things that you have to learn about on that front but that's like definitely a whole other beast to kind of tackle and and people in the chat are are agreeing with you that the low poly aesthetic has a beauty all of its own and um uh someone else wrote and oh yeah a vedang writes voxel art also looks cool as well which i would agree yeah i mean i think there's in many ways sometimes you can get so wrapped up into creating something that's photo realistic or so highly detailed that you can sort of like lose sight of your artistic intentions and a lot of ways you can express yourself or be more creative with through abstraction and through um like lowering of the resolution so and i definitely see that in your work i mean the i mentioned this to you before we came on the the figure pointing at the sort of like planetary like orb that's just uh filling the space with stars and light is just so um to me this is so beautiful and there's not there's no color there there's no there's no fine details but there's something about um the energy that emanates from that simple um scene that's like really impactful thank you um uh marcos writes usually 3d printer software converts 3d models to what a 3d printer can easily read so yeah so it sounds like that's also along the same lines of step of putting it in um what is it called oh gosh i cannot remember slicing software i forgot it i'm forgetting what it's called but i use something called cura where it's like once you make the model oh i've used that yeah yeah you then and then you can correct things in there as well so yeah awesome well i think this is a nice point to wrap up um if everybody in the chat could give a little love and thank you to chrissy for spending so much time with us today i mean i i feel like i often teach new things to people on the coding train but and so i don't usually get to experience the other way around it was like such a thrill to have like something that i really don't know anything about and to try to follow along and i'm i'm so excited as soon as i get off i'm gonna share my model on twitter and all of that and i hope that all of you will also share um if you want to learn more about chrissy's work again um the link to her website is i'm i'm pulling it up right now oh you don't see my screen i'm gonna switch to that i'm pulling it up um is uh is in the video subscription chrissyprimage.com you can go to um her instagram as well as twitter make sure our hashtag is mewtrain hopefully no i'm i'm just gonna like uh i shouldn't be doing i'm gonna i'm just gonna switch off my uh screen for a second because i'm just gonna check no results from utrain so that's good i always worry like i'm gonna pull up something on twitter and by accident i don't wanna pull up something right without looking at it first so you can see you can see that there's no results from utrain so we can fill the universe with beautiful 3d models made in blender and utrain and i will i'm certainly making a commitment to in a followup stream try to see if i can take my obj model that i exported and bring it into processing or p5 which i know that will be of interest to people and um you know we can always consider us as sometime in a future date if chrissy wants to come back and show some additional steps of course you're more than welcome to do that um i can also make my um my final mew available like the file the obj file so if you guys want to go ahead and start playing around with it and processing i'll make that available that's a great idea yeah so we'll that's a great idea and i'll try to um figure out you know just look for in the video subscription but certainly if you join the discord if we have a webpage or github repo or something where we put some of these materials um i'll make sure to link to that for sure um let me also just briefly let me i'm gonna check um i think if i pull up the live stream i've saw so many donations come in i'm just gonna pull this up and it looks like oh i i wonder if we either exactly reached the goal of 500 or we went over it and youtube just doesn't list it it's awesome so that's wonderful thank you everyone thank you everyone i'm i'm looking for my train whistle which is my way of very strange way of saying thank you to people that's wonderful that we're able to support please um if you want to learn more about the tender foundation or if you want to you know get involved or volunteer make a donation you know check out their website it's thetenderfoundation.com and i believe also um tender foundation is on instagram as well so if you want to i don't know that it makes sense to share our 3d models with the tender foundation but why not you know give them some love if you make a 3d model um that you were inspired from this live stream um so that i think really wraps them i'm almost
