oh hi again if you made it through the previous coding challenge on circle morphing Wow I'm I'm amazed if you didn't that makes a lot of sense to me you could be here anyway this is gonna be much simpler famous last words this is probably gonna be like really complicated and I don't know check the time maybe this video is like three and a half hours long my classes are all smudged my hair is falling out it's been like I've been here for like 17 hours straight coding things there's no windows in this room anyway but but here we go okay let's see so what do I have now I have taken my last circle morphing coding challenge and I've made this very very simple sketch it's very little code in it it has an array called circle path it has the spacing variable as a function to convert a radius and angle to of the polar core into a Cartesian coordinate and then it just makes the circle path and draws the circle path here it is and there's the circle it's so nice it's so lovely it's so round and elegant and quiet and I'm happy with it now I want to turn this into a triangle and I don't want to get lost in all this code like I got lost before let's figure out if we can do this in a simpler way and one way I could do this is this is all my notes from before what do you think about it remember I have the circle it's all these points then I have think about a triangle which is really just the path of these points what if I just start deleting these other points so eventually I left wit I have maybe like 90 points around but I'm left with just three points I think I could do this so what I need to do is start deleting the points so one kind of crazy thing I could just try which I know won't really work is I could say I'm gonna say here at the beginning of draw I'm gonna do one per frame while circle path length is greater than three not while if if circle path that length is greater than 3 if there's more than three points let's get rid of one so I'm gonna say I'm going to say let index equal floor random circle path length that's me picking a random index from this particular rate I should do this at the end of draw because I should at least draw it once with all the points so let's do this at the end of draw this videos could be so short I'm so excited I didn't code the beginning part but I did in the last video okay so if I find that then I'm just gonna say circle path dot splice index 1 I'm just gonna delete that just it's gone I'm gonna bleed it let's watch this down let's I got a triangle so every single time this is kind of kind of like morph to be a triangle but it's not the equilateral triangle so what I need to do is only pick a valid set of points so what are the valid index values so I need to have an array I'm gonna call indices indices plural of index and while I'm doing this I'm gonna say indices I'm gonna have a variable called let I equals 0 and I'm gonna say Indus indices dot push hi so I want to put all the index values that are in this array into a separate arrange yeah that's probably a better way to do this but this is the way I'm thinking about it first so now what I'm gonna do is instead of picking a random number this is kind of nuts I'm going to first I'm gonna use our pick a random number that's part of the indices then I am going to and so this is indices that link bear with me for a second I think I might need to diagram this so what I'm doing is actually completely redundant and unnecessary but it's going to allow me to do something else in a moment so I have this array you could imagine this is one array maybe it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 elements in it 0 through 7 and these are all of those points these are all the vectors XY XY these seven points now I make another array which just has 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 & 7 in it so now I could start saying hey let me take this out of here what number is that which is a 3 go delete the third one okay oh there's a problem here if I'm removing things from the array well let me keep going my thought here then I'm gonna have to like fix this problem so what I want to do is only put the valid index values in here and then I can skip the ones that are the points of the equilateral triangle that's what I was gonna do this isn't actually gonna work well I'm thinking this through and realizing it's not going to work oh don't worry we're gonna get there when we come back let me accept why this isn't gonna work this was a nice idea because what I was gonna say is so now if I pick the index is this particular element of that array then I could splice it this is gonna cause all sorts of strange and weird problems oh that was kind of fun what would what just happened there index yeah because so I put all that so what I wanted to do is say what I wanted to do up here just bear with me for a second is if a modulus 120 is not equal to zero then it's a valid index I don't want to be able to delete I have a better idea well okay no hold on I got to think this through someone's gonna give me a good idea in the chat probably right we could just mark some points as fixed or something that's probably gonna be better interestingly enough so this isn't gonna work why is this not gonna work because when I start this is the thing when I start deleting elements of the array then the index values change as the array elements change so while this was like kind of a nice idea like oh let me just put a list of valid things that I can delete once I pick one valid thing to delete then those other things move around and those I have to like reshuffle all the index guys this is a terrible idea so another thing I could do what's the one thing that's kind of weird that you can do in in JavaScript is that you can attach properties to existing objects so I think this might actually work for me here because I have all these vector objects and so let me get rid of this idea of the indices that was an interesting idea I'm now going to get rid of and let me get let me get rid of this here leave just comment this out so what I want to do is with these I'm gonna say I'm just gonna attach a property like active so this this function polar truck Tejan returns a p5 vector object and I could make my own class and make my own object but I'm just going to keep track is this active they're all active to start and then what I'm gonna do is I am going to when I'm drawing them I'm gonna say if V dot active whoops then draw the vertex so this has to go here so as I only draw the active ones so I can instead are actually deleting it I can remove a flag I mean the thing is if I was gonna do this in order it would be much easier I was gonna do it randomly probably should just done this in order cuz I could just delete them wanted to talk and then skip the ones that I didn't want to delete anyway I don't know why I'm doing it this way now I actually go back to my index thing but I was gonna say I can also say if if angle mod 120 equals zero this is one of the fixed ones so I can also say it's a fixed one this means it can never be deactivated so one thing I could do now and actually this is kind of ridiculous what I'm about to do but I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna every time through draw I'm gonna pick a random one I'm going to and I'm gonna say I'm going to get that vector so circular path index and then I'm going to say as long as V as long as it's not a fixed one I'm gonna deactivate it now here's the thing ah so this is me doing it randomly I'm leaving all of them there I'm never removing anything from the array and so I'm just deactivating them as long as they're not a fixed one and we should see here now the thing is it's happening in this like weird long amount of time because it still could pick ones so what I could do here now this is kind of ridiculous but I could say what I could do is I could say let active list is a new array every time oh boy I could sure I could do this in a better way but now I could look at everything that's there I could probably use like oh I could use filter I could use filter I won't use it right now but filter is a way of saying like give me a new array by filtering out all the ones that are not active or not fixed that's what I should do so I should say if but I'm gonna just do this a manually if circle path so so here's my vector if it's active and not fixed then it's part of the active list and so I can add it to that active list so now I have this I'm rebuilding this egg I can do this because you know it's just like a hundred points I can mess around as much as I want so I'm making this active list and now I'm just gonna pull from the active list and there's no way it can be fixed cuz it couldn't be in there there's no way it could be active so I'm gonna do this and now whoops index is not defined sketch line 45 I and whoops so sketch line 53 I have to make sure as long as as long as there's something there right because when it gets to nothing oh I'm gonna have to put it back oh I got to put it back maybe I'll leave that as an exercise so let's let me make this let me make this circular path let me make this stroke wait just to let me make the radius 200 and the spacing just two degrees so this will be more interesting it's happening really quite slowly but it that's crazy how it jumps too cuz the thing is it can like it's deleting all these little subsampled ones and you don't really notice it so I think probably an order to deleting them would make more sense so like for example I mean now this is ridiculous that I did all this stuff just to be able to do it randomly but for example if I just took the first one that right now this is one that Golan has already I believe so now I'm just deleting them one at a time and then I could add them back one at a time so thank you this is yet another example see you can see there's so many possible ways you could think about this I'm gonna be done with this this was another coding challenge I'll leave it as an exercise to put all the points back you know but you can see these are two possibilities so let me remind you if you go to github.com slash goal on 11 / circle morphing here is where you're going to find many many other ways of doing it so Oh super ellipse formula that would have been a good way treating it as a rounded rect also many better ways than I could have thought of so I did two coding challenges kind of trying to do this triangle two circle morphing I hope that you make some you can tweet them at me hashtag circle morphing at Schiffman you can these the code from my two will be on github and you can and you can what am I talking about I you can link to your own on by your pull request on my readme and all of that I plank my new outro music which though but also be out for music afterwards what I hope I hope get a copyright violation for this music I got it from a place where it said I was allowed to use it okay thank you thank you goodbye you
