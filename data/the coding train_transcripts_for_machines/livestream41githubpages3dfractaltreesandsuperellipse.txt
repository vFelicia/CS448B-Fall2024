hello good morning welcome my name is Dan this is coding rainbow I believe that I'm streaming live now to three outputs um I'm going to check those in a second but I just want to mention for those of you who might be watching this at some point in the future as an archived video on YouTube check this video's description it will have links to the various time codes where certain things happen because now at least for the first five or 10 minutes is just going to be me getting set up introducing myself and checking to make sure everything's working and seeing in seeing what questions there are so I'm going to do that right now I'm first going to check and look at my uh YouTube preview I see that I'm Live on YouTube that's good uh are um so first of all those of you who are watching live please let me know uh YouTube chat is the place that I will check most often um let me know if the audio quality is okay if you can kind of see everything picture quality Etc I'll show you the whiteboard in a second to check the focus on that um I'm going to now check twitch uh I think maybe I am streaming live to Twitch looks like I twitch is actually working today it wasn't working last week when I did a live stream and then the third place that I am attempting to stream to three outputs all at once um making good use of this internet connection here is to uh Facebook so I'm going to check and I should be streaming to the Facebook to the Facebook uh coding rainbow page doesn't look like it is hold on I don't want to waste too much time on this um but I'm going to just check and see and look at my page over here uh I don't see it going anywhere but I you know what Facebook schake Facebook schook is what I have to say if anybody is seeing this or Got a notification on Facebook please let me know um I'm just going to check my output settings one last time uh claims to be going there but I'm just not not going to worry about it okay I'm going to hit record to record a now I am also recording this entire live stream to dis as an archived backup and I want to talk about a little bit about what's going to be happening in today's topic so let me go back and get the YouTube chat here I am live on Facebook apparently okay ah okay hold on uh mat uh who is uh helping me with uh organizing the YouTube channel and editing has reminded me of a very important point that I forgot I've got to check so I'm stop in the record to disk and I'm going to check my uh output settings this might the stream quality might be reduced for a moment I'm going to go to record to disk and I'm going to ah check settings um hold on everyone this is just going to take me a moment view details frames per second should be fixed strict constant bit rate key frame aligned um all right let me see very fast encoding default uh all right this should frames per second 30 let's try that let's see if that fixes it um profile main key frame okay all right uh so I'm going to see if this uh fixes it uh if not I will have to investigate that more later so now I'm recording to dis again okay um looking at the chat yeah forget about Facebook you know the only reason I don't know what the okay so I'm streaming the place that you should be watching this if you want to interact live is YouTube YouTube shiffman live um but you can wa the quality might be better you might have a preferred platform and then you could just watch it and enjoy it so let me say a few words about myself and the topics that I'll be addressing today in this particular live stream so my name is Dan last name is shiffman uh I have started this thing which is a live internet show lesson tutorial something um that I'm doing once or twice per week uh and I am demonstrating a variety of different programming Concepts and techniques covering topics from JavaScript to Java JavaScript using p5js Java using something called processing I'm covering other things like node I'm looking at computer vision with the connect I'm looking at other kinds of tools like git and GitHub so just a variety of Topics by request uh through different um means um and what I'm doing is I'm doing these live streams and that's what's happening right now today's will uh go for somewhere between one and a half to two hours I'm definitely last time it was almost four hours that's absolutely not going to happen today um and I have three topics that I intend to cover today the first being continuation of fractal trees I'm going to do a a tree in three dimensions in processing I'll show that to you the other thing I want to look at is been been requested several times is how to use GitHub pages to host a website and the third topic is I want to look at something called the super formula um so this is what I'll do live after this live session ends various pieces of it this hour and a half to two hours will be edited down into probably three uh short 10 to 20 minute video tutorials and those will be uploaded in archived on YouTube so you can enjoy this live uh if you're if you're watching this in the archive you can look in the description of this video where there will be links to various time codes or you can wait for those edited videos to come which usually come online on YouTube within a day or two um let me mention something else uh which has uh briefly been asked about um so I now have something called uh patreon uh patreon.com coding rainbow I'll show you this URL that's URL you can go to patreon.com coding rainbow this is 100% optional um what I'm using this patreon as a means for helping to fund this channel so I want to just talk about this for a second so uh I work fulltime at New York University as a teacher um I um my job at New York University I teach at a program called ITP and I am paid to teach classes I am paid to do research and really my research in my mind is uh educational initiatives like this YouTube channel working on open source of uh software like p5js or processing um administering other types of community initiatives that the processing Foundation does those are the kinds of things I work on in addition to my teaching I'm also required to do a service to the university which means things like help plan a student show or serve on different committees and that sort of thing so um one thing that people who work at universities often do is they publish textbooks and those textbooks are sold and uh sometimes you'll get paid a royalty for a textbook that's sold so you can do that with the publishing company I have for ex uh for example I'm going to totally just ramble about this for a little bit you could skip ahead if you're watching this the archive so I have a book that I've published called nature of code one of the things that I'm interested in doing as part of my uh research and kind of practice is looking at new models for open source publishing so I don't necessarily mean free I mean free as an open but not uh but a but with a paid option so I have done this now with something called the nature of code this is a book that you can read entirely online for free I will go to chapter number two here is all of chapter number two here um I could make it bigger so you could see it if you want so the entire book is available online for free you can also buy a print book or you can uh if you want uh on the homepage of this website also get the PDF for whatever price you choose whether that be $0 you know or whatever so this is something that I experimented with a couple years ago and it was successful in my mind for what I wanted to do I get lots of people who email me and say oh my goodness I would have never been able to you know I'm a student and I can't you know spend money on this but I'm able to look at your book thank you so much and then I also get people being like I'm so glad you did this and I'm here's $10 um so it is a second source of income for me and it's also a nice uh thing I think to have open in the community um that so so to me you know one of the things I have this other book called learning processing which uh was done with a traditional publisher and if you could just find the PDF for free online anywhere through pirated means so I feel like if it's going to be available that way why not just make it available for free and people can pay if they want to or not pay um uh but it's out there so that's what I've did with book publishing that was my experiment there so now uh I started a few years ago I started making videos for my courses that I teach at NYU and so I just was doing that as a supplement for the students I would also put them online so other people could watch I was doing that on Vimeo for a long time telling a story this is me telling I don't I'm going to be done with this story soon but I want to give some background here so I should have like slides to show you this is not this is a stream of Consciousness not a prepared presentation so I um uh over the summer over just last summer even though I've been making these videos for three or four years just over last summer which is Summer of 2015 like almost a year ago I started putting these videos on YouTube and I noticed a new audience appearing on YouTube if I look in my analytics there's a lot more of an international audience discovering the videos um just more people in general so I experiment think I thought okay so what's I want to keep these videos online and for free but is there also a revenue stream involved what if someday I decide to quit working at NYU could I be a fulltime person who sits in my my fantasy you know my cabin in the woods with a recording studio just making videos and talking to people on the internet so what are some uh you know I'm lucky enough that I can kind of have the flexibility to do this whether it makes money or not because it's supported as part of my quote unquote research but I think that what if what as an experiment and also possibly like maybe this is something that I do want to do what are some ways of funding this so I have experimented with YouTube ads currently the amount of views that my channel gets the income from Those ads is about between $100 and $200 per month that's what it is so another thing that I am now experimenting with which is totally optional is this thing called patreon so what patreon is is it's sort of an optional Subscription Service you pay a monthly fee to support this Channel and you know it's like a Kickstarter it's supposed to to come with some set of rewards so what I don't want to get into the business of is there are private videos that only the patreon subscribers can see so I want all of the content to always be open so um what you can if you're interested in what I have done is that I have and this is what I have so far through feedback and discussion made as the particular reward so what makes sense to me is for subscribers is to have maybe a forum where people can ask questions and discuss topics related to things things that are in my channel so I'm using something called slack which honestly I had never used before a week ago when I set this up and seems to be fairly successful um I'm also you know I'm always taking suggestions and questions from the audience and I will continue to do so but I am going to you know use that as a particular Forum to pull uh questions and topics out for the videos um and the other thing that some people have requested is having uh offline access to the video file so I haven't done the best job of organizing this so I'm going to attempt to do a better job but I currently have a Google drive folder with MP4 files of every video I've ever made and I'm sharing that link with people who subscribe to the patreon so um this is something I'm doing and you can see that currently this is now at $165 per month so in total um you know the channel right now is between $300 and $400 per month I um I do have expenses associated with doing this uh I have purchased lighting equipment I have purchased Computing equipment equipment uh I have hired uh I mentioned Mata who is helping me with uh organizing the channel and editing videos I also one thing I really want to do is close caption every single video um and I'm just going to use a paid service to do that so as soon as um I I reach a certain level of funding I'll start using that money to do that um and I'm cycling the cameras now and I expect uh also um that as uh time goes on I have more ideas and maybe want to get more of a this might be the permanent space I want to speak a little bit about that in a second but so all these things I'm just kind of giving this a try so your feedback is encouraged and and welcome that's my Spiel uh and I'm going to uh end the Spiel if you have any questions about that funding patreon open source publishing video making all that sort of stuff please that's them in the chat and I will answer those questions otherwise I'm going to start getting to today's actual topics sound good I hope it sounds good to you okay um I don't have any coffee or tea today it's much too hot I have some water I do have a fan going already and oh I'm going to close down the patreon okay close down these links so um let me speak how do you somebody in the chat will help answer how you spell shiel I don't know how to spell shiel I'm all I know is I'm a little Miga uh okay somebody can figure out how to spell that uh okay so let me first um get to my first topic of today ah I didn't even actually um so let me go to my YouTube channel for a second I have a new uh playlist uh called algorithmic botney and this playlist currently has three video tutorials on it one is just basic recursive algorithm to draw a fractal tree another is using that same algorithm to draw that tree again um but uh using all keeping all the branches and leaves of that tree in objects so as to be able to sort of imbue that tree with physics and animation that's video number two the third one is using a particular algorithm called an L system um to uh to generate the tree so I'm not going to go into those right now because those three video tutorials exist I did them in last week's live stream and there's a fourth one that I haven't yet uh U turned on into this playlist it's ready it's sitting in my channel on private right after I finished the session I'll turn it to public but it is called uh it's an algorithm called space colonization so I want to show you where this algorithm comes from uh and actually I think maybe I'm just going to go to uh um this particular uh video description hold on a second I'm going to get to this link uh this is let's see if this will work there we go so so there is a paper called modeling trees with a space colonization algorithm I just love that name because yeah because I'm like today's topic will be 3D space colonization it sounds like wouldn't it be amazing if this YouTube channel could somehow colonize space I mean someday it will because the aliens will come and take over and they'll all be watching my videos on the planet zorg typing on their Zord bot computers or whatever but uh for now uh space colonization doesn't refer to outer space colonization it refers to in a way you can think of the screen your canvas as a twodimensional space or a threedimensional space and this sort of Dre tree growing up and colonizing it so I want to um what I want to do is let me get the example so um I did this particular algorithm in I'm just checking the chat uh I'm trusting you guys that if anything goes wrong with audio video sound goes wonky the screen starts going going crazy if you're in the chat uh on YouTube please type something because I I'm I'm able to see it yeah volume conation is I think is is is a good way is a term that's relevant for 3D so what I want to do first is let me just open up um this particular processing example and I'm gonna I think I haven't looked at this since last week so hopefully this is going to I don't okay so with this is doing here and I'm going to minimize this oops I I've got some stuff running hold on a second here let me just I don't want this running in the background although will if I if I watch my YouTube video while I'm making a YouTube video will increase my views and watch time could be very exciting um okay so um so what I want to do excuse me uh for getting lost in my own thoughts for a second let me run this for a second so you can see what's happening here Loosely so the way that space colonization works is you fill a space and right now in two Dimensions with points and then you start from somewhere it could be from the bottom from the center from outside of it and you start to use all of those points as attraction points so you have this kind of single Branch moving and it's kind of attracted to any of those points that it's close to and as there are more points it will Branch off um it the so the C okay but here's the thing this is what always get confused because the way that this looks it looks like the way that we're solving this it looks so much like the way that we're solving this is we have this thing moving from the bottom and being attracted to all these points that's the visual result but the actual algorithm works in the reverse what I'm actually doing is iterating all over all those points and saying are any of these points near to an existing segment and if they are pull another segment towards me so in that sense U there could could be multiple uh multiple segments start getting added we just start with a single segment at the bottom and then a bunch of points to pull a new segment and a bunch of points over here pull another new segment let me try to um draw this a little bit over here and you guys tell me if this makes sense so in other words um let me uh I'm just going to make a very simple demonstration of it like this so let's say there's only four points and what I do is I start with a single segment so this is the first segment so essentially what I do is I iterate over every single leaf every single one of these seed points in a way and I say okay here's a seed point is it in between some minimum distance and some maximum distance minimum and maximum is it in between some minimum and maximum distance if it is pull a segment Out close to it and then this one is it between some minimum and some Maximum if it is pull a segment Out close to it now the next iteration this is now no longer um this is now uh within hold on like this is so hard so hold on I I it makes sense to me in my head but you draw these diagrams over and over again sometimes I get a little confused so let's just do it with for a second here let's do it with one point for a second here is the segment and here is the leaf I want to draw the leaf as an open circle and the segment as a uh with closed dots so what I'm saying is again let me say that again this is actually in between the minimum and maximum so I would another segment would get pulled towards it now now the next iteration I look for is it between the minimum and the maximum it is not so it does no so this ends right here so if this were the only Leaf it would end but you know if there were another Leaf here then suddenly this one might be in between that and then this would get pulled this way so these branches start getting just pulled around segments get pulled around and once they get close to a given leaf that leaf is kind of done and gets deleted from the system and obviously this is just with like a couple but if there are all sorts of things everywhere things start like branching around you know like this okay so this is the idea I'm going to look at the chat to see if that and so I could run this again and you can kind of have a sense of maybe this is happening every iteration so I see I don't I don't I miss the whole I I miss maybe everything in the chat Oliver WR I just noticed is writing a comment I don't think that happens in one iteration so let me explain to you what happens every single iteration every single iteration for each Leaf every single branch is checked if the leaf finds a branch that it is too close to it's done and I say branch and segment I'm using those words interchangeably branches are segments that are growing if if the leaf is close to a given Branch then a new segment is added pulling towards it um but that new seg M hold on let's see what I'm here's the tricky thing um that new segment could also be close to other leaves and those forces that are pulling get averag together for what that segment actually go does so we can see that happening here boy this is this is like one of the hard this by the way I had like nightmares between last week and this week about like how confusing I was in this I Haven that's why I haven't that video this space colonization video is 45 minutes long the one where I build this from scratch so let me just show this to you so this is where I'm looking in processing this is me looking at every single leaf so for every single leaf I need to find what branch is closest to it and so I start looking at all the branches if a particular branch is within that minimum distance that leaf is done so we're done we get out of this Loop so a leaf can't act on other branches if it's already close to one if that particular branch is really far it's a otherwise we try to find the closest one and that closest Branch that's get then gets a force added to it from which it'll make another segment attached to it uh okay um yeah so actually so I forgot I did this last week at the end um Oliver uh in the chat Oliver Wright was extreme I want to just thank Oliver again in the YouTube chat was extremely helpful last week when I tried to build this from scratch cuz I kept having bugs and getting things wrong and and he was typing in wonderful helpful suggestions into the chat which fix things so um so um so what I want to do so so that's the sort of does anybody have any questions I'm going to give you guys a minute here to think if you have any questions about this particular existing example because what I want to do is now take this example and move it into 3D so I'm going to give and I already did this last week but I'm going to do it again let me while I'm waiting to see if you have questions I'm going to pull up that one and just see what it looks like right so this is what I've got so far um using py cam I'm trying to think if there is a better anything that I could do here to make the rendering a little bit nicer uh when I start to build it from scratch again oh yeah a lot of a lot of people have asked um so I'm getting a bunch of questions in the chat which I'll answer sort of briefly randomly before I go onto this tutorial um a lot of people have asked for mandal brat set as a challenge I I absolutely would be happy to do that um I will check in the slack group uh if people are interested in that and sort of where I have a poll running um and then I'm also been asked if I'm planning new videos on genetic algorithm and artificial neural networks I am planning but I've kind of got this list of things to get to um the My Caden course which is an online course that's out and running uh that I did with a partner with a company called Caden a session five is all about genetic algorithms so I'm going to wait for that to come out um and see how accessible that is to people and if it's uh not I might just redo some of those videos on YouTube um um but yeah please keep asking about that okay uh uh Razer in the chat asked if I'm American I am American I live in New York City ah I didn't mention uh just mention this now that uh I am doing these videos from uh the school for poetic computation um if you're interested in learning about the school for poetic computation please go to sfpc doio uh this space is completely empty right now there's nobody here but me but starting tomorrow they have a 10week program with about 12 students learning and creating lots of amazing interesting art projects so there'll be lots of people in this space so maybe I'll bring some people in to show their work or that type of thing as well so that that should be interesting oh yes Branch thick okay all right so let's um uh branches have a preference to go up yes that would look good so you know on the one hand I want to make this look better on the other hand I just want to get the sort of basic drop Deads version simple version of the algorithm out there and then people can actually put their own design ideas on it but um let me think about Branch thickness for a second because that should be pretty easy to do the tree where I am drawing it gets these lines with a particular stroke so it seems to me that the branches are being added over time kind of from like bottom to top or from Center to out so and they get appended to the array so the later in they are in the array the less thick they should be so this should be something I should be able to add which I'll um so um the total branches is branches. size and I should be able to do something like say the stroke weight equals map uh oh I need to so I'm using this enhanced Loop but let me do it this way uh let me uh do this um branches. size uh and then I'm going to say a branch b equals branches. Getti so I'm just looping with I right now because what I want to do do is map I so if you're if you're at the beginning you're very thick so the I starts from zero and goes to the length of this array list and if you're at the beginning maybe you have a stroke weight of 10 and if you're at the end maybe you have a stroke weight of one let's see how that works now I don't know if the stroke weight really works in 3D let's um let's try to make this much more extreme I don't see this really working um let me go to the 2D one for a second just to like see if this idea works I think the thickness isn't just determined by how early it is oh whoops what did I do did I miss something oh my goodness I didn't even add it in there uh I'm missing some really obvious things sorry everybody thank you I just made up the variable didn't add it in no wonder it didn't do anything you're yeah it kind of did something but you're right that oh well see the branches keep getting added and added and also by the way using Strokes in 3D um is uh like kind of uh not the best you can see there's some sort of flaws in the rendering all right so how do I want to do this I need to um stretch yeah so um so uh wreck makes a suggestion instead of lines what about stretch cylinders 100% I should absolutely do that I'm just being kind of lazy about it and I didn't feel like I'm kind of I have a secret to confess I'm not really a 3D person so I'm not really prepared for this 3D stuff I I I know I could do it I feel confident I could do it but I I don't want to spend all day figuring out elaborate 3D geometry so I'm just kind of using stroke and stroke weight as a trick and then I what I would love is for people who would then take this example and do some more thoughtful 3D stuff with it but I would really like to figure out this thickness thing let's go back to before I before I actually start the 3D tutorial let's go back to the 2D version so um so I think um just let me go let me uh let me grab this for a second oops here and uh I'm just going to do this in 2D because it'll be much easier to see and oops and I think oh I forgot the if parent is null uh uh so this is it happening and you can see that no that seems about right now what's going to happen is they're just going to keep getting no that seemed to do the job so I think my instincts were right they are getting thicker over time because I must have forgotten there must be something that I need to add to the code to stop adding branches over and over again at the end so um so let's take a look at this right where is my core algorithm here let's um let's print uh let's in in tree there is this grow function let's print line branches do size I think I'm adding branches over and over again at the end so you can see here right now this is the total number of branches in my system and we look at this growing right let's look at these together we should see it like kind of like it should be done you know what's happening I think some of these little flaws are causing there to be leaves that never get they're like these two leaves are on perfect equidistant sides of a branch so they like never get removed from the system H it continually grows the equidistant problem we've got to solve that equidistant problem okay let's look and think of where we could where we could figure out to solve that um so where do I remove the whole thing is that remove branches need to be removed it can't possibly be as simple as this right I think it might be of just like checking if it's it can't possibly be that simple right no because that just is like making a Le smaller minimum distance I could add small Randomness to the direction o that's a really good idea Oliver is like my savior so let's do that what if we add uh um I love this idea okay so where would be a good place to do that so here is where um so I could just say something like P Vector R is um random equals P vector. random 2D and then I could set the magnitude of that Vector is something kind of small like 0.01 so it's a tiny little thing and then I could say closest d. add Rand is just having a little bit of random Direction going to fix that equidistant problem let's see I think I still have it uh uh okay so let's what if I make this kind of bigger now I think it's eating up everything for sure okay there we go so that fixed it interesting just adding random Direction but did I lose the sort of purity of this fractal I'm not sure but so this worked thickness wise which is nice to see um and let's so what if I say like what's the sort of like minimum amount let's try 0 2 yeah that looks like it's eating it up oh no I still yeah it gets it eventually yeah so that worked let's see if I can do 01 I wonder if there's a time that I could Target adding Randomness more specifically oh the normalization is broken now but don't I normalize it again I can just I can just normalize it again or I can do this before I normalize it let's do that I should do this before I normalize it so the normalization doesn't get broken uh okay so that didn't appear strong enough there's still some places like where I have the equidistant problem like there so let's make it a little bit stronger to see if that does it yeah that seems to be doing it I don't see any more more yep we can see it finished at 3577 and you can see the thickness thing is working so they're thicker at the bottom and less thick at the top um but it's this isn't really great to be honest because you know there's probably like these should probably match more I don't know maybe it's reasonable you know this all sort of depends on what exactly you're trying to do but it's it's a one strategy you could come up with other strategy IES um ad is still after normalize oh thank you uh boy I'm really I'm really thank you uh let's see if this at0 five are still pretty good you know let's make it a little what if I give it like a completely random direction that doesn't solve it as well uh do I make it much stronger well that does it I not so bad it's not so bad to like add like a kind of strong r random Force to it it still has kind of a nice quality to it okay um okay so uh I think I'm far enough and I'm going to start I've got there's uh 79 people watching here which is great I'm just going to check twitch to see if there's anybody watching in twitch 10 people twitch definitely doesn't have as as large an audience here as YouTube and I'm just going to sort of check the Facebook thing uh I'm going to uh okay Facebook is working hold on I'm just going to do something silly actually never mind um uh okay um uh all right so sorry everybody I'm kind of okay okay so let me recap where I am for those for people who are maybe joining late so I have a um YouTube uh whoops uh I have a YouTube playlist uh called algorithmic botany which has uh three uh videos currently in it recursive fractal tree the same thing but with objects and then L system video what I am going to add to it which uh is oops let's is this other algorithm called space colonization um so you can see what space colonization looks like here so I'm going to um I already went through this particular piece of code um I'm going to uh do about a 10 or 15 minute tutorial on um doing this now in three dimensions okay so that's what I'm about to do uh and I am going to uh I'm getting the chat here so I can see it uh and I'm going to get myself set up for that so what I'm going to do here is first of all I'm going to undo I want to get this back to what it was without the thickness thing let's see what I've got here okay so that's without the thickness and with this sort of equidistant problem um and I'm save this and I'm going to this is this one this is the 3D one okay I'm going to close this and uh this is the paper I am going to have this paper uh as my image reference it has by the way this is a nice diagram I think which helps illustrate what's going on um that I would recommend probably better than my kind of crummy diagrams uh and um and then I'm GNA here so this is so a thickness is probably discussed somewhere in this paper and I did read this paper and that was last week I don't remember it but this is like the basic idea of uh what I'm trying to create so I'm going to leave this open here as kind of my starting image uh and then and let me um make this is the 2D version of it oops and in processing I'm going to have this running and you know what I'm going to do just gonna um have it start from the center um uh so hold on I want to start the tree from the center okay so I'm going to do it this way just as a kind of a way of looking at it uh okay um so I think I am basically ready let me zoom in on this and uh I'm going to cycle the cameras and I going to erase the Whiteboard here and hold on I'm just about ready to start this particular segment I'm looking for this um just erasing the Whiteboard over here I didn't switch the camera view sorry about that all right how's everybody doing everybody feel good about this ready for this I think this hopefully won't be famous last words that long um I oh it's raining in Paris it is hot and sunny in New York this is not the best space to be when it's hot because I have these Bright Lights which generate heat I've got a fan going but but there it is okay um here we go everybody I've got my by the way this is the processing classic tshirt this is the original first processing tshirt I feel like we should do we should make these again I I saw people have requested coting rainbow tshirts and stickers which I somebody will remind me I will uh uh I can try to make those available um okay um let's see uh here's this pen here's my tree and I am ready okay here we go everybody I cycled the cameras didn't I yeah raining in London raining in Germany ah I got a lot of European viewers today that's great what what it's like s s in the evening I guess so this is a kind of good time you're all at home you're like got your popcorn watching me br which is you know I'm very very happy that you're here okay uh okay here we go hello this video is a followup on my previous space colonization video now I wish I was talking about outer space colonization I am not I'm talking about an algorithm called space colonization which is outlined in this uh PDF paper here that you can find a link to in this video's description and it is possible with this algorithm to generate trees like this so last week time doesn't matter here but in my previous video I made a version of this algorithm I actually did it in JavaScript um using a JavaScript library called p5js but I have this same uh code running now in processing and I switched over to processing because the point of this video is to extend this algorithm into 3D so I want to take and let me run it here for you I want to take this idea which is using this branch algorithm come on and run please code using this branching algorithm uh to take this from a 2d world to 3D so let's let's talk about how this has to happen so first what's the what's the basic idea for this um what's the basic idea behind this algorithm so the idea of this algorithm is that you have a canvas and you fill this canvas with points and these points are known as leaves so maybe you fill this this canvas with a bunch of points and then maybe you start at the bottom and you create a branch segment and you keep growing Branch segments all the way up until you get close enough to a particular to some of these leaves then what the algorithm does is it says okay any Leaf that's close to this particular Branch segment pull a force have it become an attraction Force so maybe this one and this one are close so a new segment is made and then this one and this one and this one are close to this one so a new segment is made here but this one is also close to this one um so another new segment is made so all of these Leaf points become these points of attraction that start just pulling out these branches and you can see that happen I'm going to come back to the code and I'm going to show I'm gonna I'm going to change here I'm gonna I'm going to in setup I'm going to say frame rate uh I'm going to just say five so frame five frames per second and we can watch this happen a bit more closely so you can see here these branches are getting pulled and pulled towards all of these points and as they get pulled towards these points those leaves disappear now there's a couple things I want to mention about this I'm kind of recapping my previous video but I think it's worth it before we move to 3D to make sure we understand all the pieces here so number one I just want to kind of recap this particular program uh has a set of objects it has a leaf object that are these seed points here it has a branch object uh the branch object being these particular segments all of these segments and then it also has a tree object and the tree object keeps track of an array of Branch objects and an array of leaf objects so the algorithm goes something like for every leaf see what branches are within a minimum and maximum distance and add a force to those branches and then all and then have all those branches grow a new Branch off of them with the direction of that Force so the tree itself is iterating through all the leaves then uh applying forces to all the branches then making new Branch segments and as leaves are close enough to a given Branch they get deleted so this leads me to a to an issue though that I feel like is worth resolving in this example before we move on look at this there are some leaves that just won't go away they're there they're stuck there I can find another one uh over here is another one the reason why it's stuck there is that they're magically somehow exactly equidistant from a particular Branch segment so the force can never go towards one to get a little bit closer um and then be removed from the system so I don't know I'm looking at you internet watching this video to come up with a a a solutions for this problem I had a wonderful solution uh suggested by Oliver in the chat recently um which is just to give each branch a little bit of extra random Force to it so that every once in a while as it's going there it'll randomly turn and in that case uh it'll eventually find these branches uh these leaves and get removed so let's add that here and I'm going to go uh to the part of the algorithm uh where uh we add those particular forces and actually what I want to do I want to do that I'm going to do that in a different place than I did it before I was practicing this so this is where those new branches get added and this is where the Branch's Direction gets averaged based on how many forces were applied to it so what I want to do right here I'm just going to try making another random vector and I'm going to say I'm going to add that so right before the Vector is about to be um right before the new branch is about to be born I'm just going to give it a little bit of random motion to it to see if it can like if when it's getting stuck if it can skew towards one of those leaves so let's run this again oh and I have the frame rate at five so let me cancel that out let's run this again come on I don't know why my command R isn't work oh I'm in debug mode no wonder a so oh that's way too much look at that that kind of ruined it it did something but it's kind of like a crazy now so I probably shouldn't have added it here um okay so let me uh let me go back here let's so let's try to make that not so strong let's make it really really weak so I'm going to set its magnitude to uh something much much weaker and you can see maybe that wasn't strong enough so it's still like I've got these equidistance spots there so let's make it 0.1 that seemed to do the trick ah there's a couple spots that are still stuck there let's try 0. five it's a little less kind of like curvy and fractally but it did work so I'm going to just like try three that looks pretty good so I think I settled on0 three as kind of my number that I want to do so you can see I at least have now resolved that problem the reason why I wanted to resolve that problem is I'm going to add something I I don't want to be adding branches infinitely um and the other thing I want to do quickly to this before I move into 3D is uh is show you let's do something that's changed the thickness of these branches so every Branch right now has a stroke weight of one but what if branches that are made earlier at the center are thicker than ones that are at the edge so a way that I can do that is right here this is where I'm actually drawing a line for every single Branch so every single Branch here is just a line between the um the Branch's position and its parents position connecting the one that's connected to it to itself so one thing I'm going to do here is just change this Loop to a regular Loop using index I uh to branches do size the reason what I the reason why I want to do that is what I want to do now is I want to say each branch is going to have a stroke weight so for example if I say stroke weight 10 you can see all the branches are really thick they have a thickness now of 10 pixels but what if I were to create a variable and map its index so the the the older branches are added at the beginning of the array so its index goes between zero and branches. size and have that go so the earlier ones have a thickness of 10 and the later ones at the end have a thickness of one and what if that is its Branch thickness you can now see we've got something here where the earlier they are at the beginning the thicker they are the more at the outside the less thick they are and I could like mess around with this mapping um I could you know just start with five or six I could actually go down to zero to get them like much skinnier even at the end which is kind of nice so I think this looks kind of nice and you can imagine what how this might have what kind of effect this might have depending on how you're seeding the points and where you're starting the root of the tree okay so I somehow said I this was a video All About 3D and I probably spent 10 minutes here just getting ready for that but we've recapped the algorithm and we've also made it a little bit better by adding thickness here and solved a particular problem and now we can actually do something that I believe will be quite simple uh in turning this into 3D so let's think about this so this is what's happening in a twodimensional plane I create in the canvas I just created random Leaf points anywhere so what I want to do instead in 3D is I want to think of the canvas not as um not as a flat plane but as a sphere so I'm going to create random points all inside a sphere and then I'm going to have my first Branch the root of the tree in the center of the sphere again if you really want to create a tree what you might do is create some kind of like ellipsoid in 3D seed all the points start the root at the bottom but I'm just going to do something simple just to get this algorithm working and then that's up to you to be creative to try to create a different set of seed points with a different starting Branch okay so let's come back over here and see if we can do this okay so the first thing I need to do if I'm going to move into 3D is just add p3d oh I'm not here is just add inside p3d so what did I just do I just added p3d so I want to so now it's rendering in 3D I can actually just run this and see like hey same thing but it's actually in 3D now just so we can like get a sense of the camera a little bit better I'm going to add a library called peyam so I've already installed this Library um if you haven't installed this Library go to add Library under sketch import library but I've already installed pcam so I'm just going to click import and uh all I need is this import statement at the top then I need to create a pey cam object I'm going to say cam equals new peyam and I have to say this so py cam is this library that just automatically like makes this mouse interactive camera so you can spin around and zoom in and out of your scene um in a very default way and what I need to do I so I need to say this referring to this sketch is where I want this camera to take over and then I also need to give it a um a z value like how far away do I want to be looking at it so I'm just going to say say 100 for right now um and then I'm going to run this and sort of see what happens so I can't seem to find like oh there it is so I'm off one of the things that py cam does for you is it makes z00 the center of the window as opposed to the top left so here in my tree where I'm creating the leaves um I actually want to create them I want to create well first of all I want to create the root at 0 0 and then where I'm creating the leaves uh sorry I want to make the leaves not offset by the center of the window anymore so let me just do that and we should see now there we go now one thing is I'm kind of zoomed in so I can zoom out and I can spin you can see now this is totally flat this is kind of a nice effect just in of itself so I still have my twodimensional space colonizer but it's in 3D and I want to look at it from further away so let's make that 500 so you can see here so this looks exactly like what we had before but secretly it's in 3D now so this is actually I believe going to be incredibly simple all I need to do is instead of making a twodimensional plane of leaf points right I'm not actually let's not call grow so what do I have here this system is just a whole lot of uh a whole lot of points in a twodimensional plane why are they that because all I did was make random 2D vectors so watch how simple this is going to be Random 3D I want to make sorry Random 3D vectors and I'm going to run it and now you can see whoa okay so what's going on I made 3D vectors but I only see two dimensional points well there's a bit of a problem here which is that my points are ellipses so what I want to draw I need to draw those at their threedimensional location so I'm going to change this to translate pause. x pause. y pause. z and now the ellipse can be at 0 Z and I'm going to say push Matrix pop Matrix to make each ellipse its own thing so I'm going to run this now oops let me Zoom back out and you can see now I have this let me Zoom back in I have this 3D sphere of points now they're ellipses so as I turn to the side they're not they're no longer facing forward and I can make them spheres you know there's any number of things I could do let's just make them spheres for a second just for fun what's more fun than making them spheres I'm just curious to see how slow this runs now notice look how slow this runs so I don't want to make them spheres because I don't even need to see them for this algorithm to happen but spheres require a ton of rendering because each sphere has like a zillion polygons and I could reduce the detail in the Spheres and there's all sorts of things I could do but I'm just going to leave them as ellipses so I'm going to run this again and you can see here now I have this so now all I should be able I I should just be able to grow the tree I mean all the math is going to be the same whether it's 3D vectors or 2D vectors so let's grow the tree again I'm going to turn grow on and we're going to run it let's see what happens it's something is working I can see all those branches happening something didn't but look it's still flat that's so sad it's still flat so why is it flat well am I drawing the branches in 3D I probably have a line function that's just doing 2D so let me go back to the tree all the way at the bottom this is where I'm drawing each branch as a line between the Branch's position and its parents position so I just need to add the zcoordinate for these this line and I got to go all scroll all the way to the right here to get also b.p parent. doz so now I should have a threedimensional line and let's see what happens it's growing it's growing it seems to be getting everywhere and now look at this there we go look at this crazy threedimensional wacky strange shape that I have and I can zoom on into it and look inside and scroll around and we can see there's different thicknesses it's thinner on the outside now some branches just didn't some leaves just didn't get reached and it's hard for me to uh I'm going to I don't I can't tell if I have this equidistant problem anymore I don't think so I think some branches are just some leaves are just kind of too far away so uh you know there's some ways around that I could futs with the um uh this this sort of minimum and maximum distance like let me make the maximum distance 200 and I think that's going to help things so that uh I think that's probably going to yeah you can see now I got to everything um so that just by increasing that maximum distance leaves that are kind of too far away will get found now here's the thing there's a bunch of of things that I've done here yeah it doesn't look someone in the chat writes it doesn't look like a tree it doesn't look at all like a tree so maybe before I go I'll make this look a little bit more like a tree but here's really your job so your job is to be a designer come over here please um so what have I done all that I have done is create sort of a default view of the algorithm working so and think about it in two Dimensions I made a sphere I filled the sphere with points and I started with in the middle and stuff is growing out so really I almost made this like veiny blood vessely like system um so if you want to make a tree you've got to be more thoughtful so on the one hand I I made a suggestion of what if you kind of create uh and actually something like this might work well what if you this is all your seed points look like this and then you actually start the root from the bottom so you need to come up what's your Vault and if you read the space colonization paper it will give you suggestions what's the volume where you create all of your seed points and then where do you start the route so that's on the one hand going to make it look more like a tree the other thing you need to think about is just you know I just use threedimensional lines which aren't really there's not a lot to them so you might think about well actually what you want to put are cylinders for each branch segment and maybe you want to texture those cylinders with some kind of like wood looking texture and then you want to add some lighting to the SC and then maybe you actually want to put at the points that are at the end you want to actually put actual leaves on like various parts of the brain so I think there's a lot of kind of visual dressing that you can add so there is two there's your seed points how those seed points are organized there's where you start the root those things will um get you sort of closer to the tree as well as your sort of visual dressing what's your lighting what's your texturing how you drawing the branches are you adding like leaves attached to the branches that sort of thing so I would like all of you to explore those types of things um okay yeah the other people are saying it looks like Connections in a brain or a plasma ball thingy those are all excellent points so let me at least get you started to show you where you can make these kinds of changes so I'm going to uh save this as space colonizer 3D all the code will be uploaded on GitHub with a link and I also uh um and I'm let's just add a few more things to this before we go so what I'm going to do is say um uh let me make the scene that we're looking at a bit taller so I'm going to make it 900 by 600 we can see um uh sorry I want to make it uh 600 by 900 so I want to make it kind of oops oh my goodness I I hit something by accident here um I want to so you can see I just want to have my window be a little bit taller and then what I want to do is have the leaves start uh I want the leaves to just go out by like uh um still be a sphere but I want to offset them um so I want to say y minus equal like height divided two so that should offset everything up yeah there we go so um so this is what I wanted to do but then I also want so that's way too much and then I also want the tree's root so in the tree object the root gets a point I want it to actually start at the bottom of the window which is 0 comma height divided two so I want to start the root at the bottom so this is a bit more tree like so uh you know how successful this is I'll let you be the judge of that but you can see just by having kind of a tree at the starting just by having like a sphere of points up top and the root of the and starting the root at the bottom you get this kind of stock root like thing and then it starts to Branch out at the top but again maybe the there's a uniform distribution of random points now all in that sphere maybe there should be even more along the top and less on the bottom or some type of like cone shape I encourage you to experiment with it but this I think will get you a little bit further into seeing its kind of tree like and I'm just sorry I'm addicted to spinning around this um okay so I think this concludes um uh this video I'm just going to some people in the chat are asking like what did I do to change so let me just mention again since I did that kind of quickly in the leaf object the leaf object this beginning function right here this is where the initial Leaf positions are set every position is a random 3D Vector scaled according to the width of the window which is about 300 pixels and then I'm offsetting it by height divided by four so moving all the Y positions up that's where all the leaves are set now where does the tree begin growing the tree begins growing in the tree object object and the variable is this root Branch so the root Branch incidentally has two arguments the root Branch gets where it's positioned so zero height divided by two so down at the bottom and also that Vector is the direction where it starts growing so incidentally if I were to change this to this we'd have a problem because nothing would happen the branch is grow the tree is growing off to the right to Infinity so it needs to grow up so to speak there we go okay so I the PRP at growing is really quite lovely and nice and i' also be interesting like you know all those branches are objects what if you start moving the points after the fact add some Physics to it have it Blow In The Wind so many possibilities okay so um this was much longer than I had intended but this is hopefully a nice followup to the previous space colonization in 2D video and what I did here was fix a few things about it add thickness move it into 3D I hope that you make something with this and that you share it with me in particular add your own kind of visual design spin to it um and look forward to seeing what you make thanks for watching okay live chat um that was that's the end of uh space col we've space colonization hopefully everything is still working okay let me see what time it is it's 130 so I've been going about an hour that was probably quite I don't know if anyone was tracking how long that was but I think I got up to like I think I was doing that for like at least a half an hour um so um and uh okay so I'm looking at the chat um okay uh all right so here we are so I'm going to save let me just save this and close this and and close this and let me now so the other two things I had to do today are I'm going to show you guys this and I'll I'm going to do this in P5 so this is just what something called a super ellipse it's a simple algorithm to instead of drawing like a regular a set of points and make up a regular ellps you can make these kind of like crazy shapes and then if you make the formula even crazier I don't know where I put this is that this yeah you can start to do weird crazy stuff like this so this has been requested it was requested on the slack that I have going with patreon and it was suggested I think also just on Twitter so I'm thinking of doing this as a tutorial today and then a lot of people have been asking for me to do GitHub pages and so let me let me go back to I'm going to open up something else too which is just I've been doing a set of git and GitHub tutorials uh where where is that um maybe under documents I had a todo list old desktop oh boy other documents uh let me open up text edit probably has it in its um open recent yeah get tutorial to do so this here this was my list todo list about git and GitHub tutorials so I where I got to was number six oh and I did number seven so um I think having done all the way through number seven I could actually do GitHub Pages now so the two things I have left for today in the next hour would be uh GitHub pages and um G GitHub pages and uh the super formula anybody have any in the chat anybody like dying for one of those uh let me know and I'm going to sort of get myself organized here I feel like I should do the GitHub Pages first I kind of want to take a break from algorithms especially algorithms that are hard so let me get set up to do that so let me get myself logged in on GitHub uh I'm logged in as coding rainbow and okay I want to test something so I'm just going to test this real quick so um let me try to make so you guys can watch here um so I'm gonna the GitHub website does not comply with my desire for a larger font um I I don't know how if any of this is legible let me move this I think I have this much space if I stand over here and so that's pretty good can I make this one bigger okay so let me make a new repository uh test test GitHub Pages testing GitHub pages so uh I need to make a branch I'm just going to do this really quickly and I'll talk through it when I do a tutorial and then I need to go to set I just want to remember where everything is branches make the default Branch GitHub Pages update I understand um go to here and then uh go to branches and then I want to delete Master because I don't want it anymore and then GitHub pages and then I'm going to create a new file so I'm going to just create a file like test um poem. txt uh let's see if it will do it host a text file this is my poem and uh commit and then if I go to settings here should be here uh and I should be able to say poem. txt there we go yay GitHub pages okay GitHub Pages works even with just a text file um okay I'm looking at the chat here I see a lot of people discussing um because it's a what's what about the rainbow is revers is it the colors are in like the wrong order um okay so what I need to do here is uh wash my whiteboard I'm going to do a GitHub Pages tutorial by the way uh um so I'm going to do a basic I'm going to do two videos one I'm going to do with um one I'm going to do with no not you don't even need to know HTML I'm just going to put a text file in and then I'm going to do another one actually you know what I'm going do that one with HTM a text file and then with HTML also um and then I'm going to do uh then I'm going to show you how to uh host your p5js sketch with GitHub Pages um okay so I need to go back here and I want to go to here I'm going to delete I want to delete this repository uh how do I I go to settings and I go to the the danger zone we're in the danger zone everybody delete this repository test GH pages I understand the consequences there we go um okay so let me come back here uh let me go to how do I go to my repositories um oh I want to go to Rainbow coder uh your profile okay okay everybody here we are let's see okay how are we doing um got 80 people watching online which is kind of amazing I'm just going to check um hold on I just want to do something kind of silly if you don't mind if you will just um if you will humor me for a moment I moved my Facebook live stream from my personal Daniel shiffman page to the coding rainbow page oh it's probably already over on Facebook because it only lets it so I just G to quickly um share it um just so people know to switch over to there um so uh what do I do I do share oh no this is all about algorithmic botney no no no is where do I find it um oh no I'm in okay hold on I just curious about this so oh wait wait wait wait I know where to go okay where how do I see where I am live oh there it is it just says about it just has the wrong description in it that's fine uh uh yeah so this is all from today I think yeah yeah there I am okay I see myself live so I'm just gonna share sorry about this you guys oops um share uh so sorry everybody um okay uh and then I'm going to say public okay okay sorry I just thank you guys for humoring me there I lost four viewers in doing that uh okay okay uh all right so here we go everybody I am ready to talk one of my actual this might seem strange but one of my favorite topics is get up Pages get up pages is awesome and some ways it's a little bit Overkill like what do you really need GitHub Pages for because you got to deal with all this git stuff but it's completely free web hosting um and um it's super fast and it's great for all the collaboration stuff so I think it's a really nice option and so this video tutorial will be all will will be about using GitHub pages so let me just think about this for a second um so I want to make a list here here I'm going to try to recreate for a second um that list of terms uh commit uh repo Branch Push Pull I haven't done merge yet but I don't even worry about that what are some of the other terms uh in knit was one but it's not really relevant as relevant for this I think this is all we need um uh for this particular um for this particular uh okay so I think I am good okay [Laughter] okay um every in the chat writes switch to Facebook it is ahead of this video by a second uh um okay um okay so um so 's asking if I could do a five minute Q&A I would like to since I've just got the momentum here do this GitHub Pages tutorial and after that I will take uh questions if that's okay with you guys um just because I want to just get moving here so um here we go um and how's my I like want to fix my hair but I got it all cut off and there is no fixing of it anymore okay here we go everybody just got to kind of warm up a little bit here we should do everybody stand up and stretch do some like stretching I don't know what I'm doing okay this is going to be the tutorial about GitHub Pages get this let me get my button in place the button really is not working for me I got to work on the button it's like I need some physical Computing help when the school for poetic computation students show up somebody will come and help me with this hopefully uh okay um here we go hello uh welcome to part I don't know what let me look at my let me look at my uh this this was not this was not the uh beginning of this video I want to look at my GitHub playlist I I don't uh get and GitHub playlist okay this is part eight so that this is the eth this will be the eighth video in this playlist okay and and I can close this okay and also let's get rid of the super formula for a second just not as much as open okay uh and then oh sorry hold on I do want to have terminal open sorry everybody I realized I'm GNA want to use terminal briefly um and I'll just do desktop uh okay in this video as well okay now I'm ready okay part eight right okay hello welcome to part eight of GitHub git and all that stuff for poets and in this particular video I'm going to show you how to have your poem or whatever it is you're making web page hosted through GitHub so your git repository on GitHub can actually be uh uh you can get free web hosting with it so and this is by using something called GitHub Pages GitHub pages is a rather large topic because there's tons of features that it has available for you but I'm going to show you the very Basics just how to take your files and have them viewable through a URL so that's the first thing that I'm going to do in this particular video so um I if you've been following these videos along there's these important git Concepts that I've been covering in each one of these videos commit we have a repository a commit is like a Save branch is taking uh is having a separate branch of changes that you might merge into your uh Master Branch later if you like those changes there's push and pull pushing being to send and pull being to to retrieve so there's all this stuff that I've covered in all these other videos and the exciting thing is that using GitHub Pages all of this stuff works identically exactly the same way so you can have a project that you are working on through git keeping track of its history collaborating through git but if you flip a switch and it's on GitHub you can actually view that project as a directory of as as if it's hosted on a website so let me show you how this works the key to it is the under Branch the key is that typically by default your git branch is called Master that's the sort of like fundamental core branch of your project where your like finals things are your main poem your main code whatever it is lives in the master Branch for GitHub pages to work you want to get get rid of this idea of having a master Branch you still can have one but for Simplicity you can just think of your master Branch as being called gh pages so as long as the branch that you're working on is called gh Pages there is automatically a secret URL by which you can access now um there's a there's a lot more to this and I but I'm avoiding saying that now and I'll get to it later so let's come back up and let's so let's just do this right now it's actually going to be quite simple and easy I'm going to go I'm on my profile page I'm the rainbow coder for lack of a better username um and I'm going to make a new repository and I'm going to call this poem website so this is my repository name poem websit this is ridiculously bad repository name but it's fine you can come up with something better and this poem will be on the internet and really on the worldwide web talking about so that's my description it's going to be public I want to initialize it with a read me so you can see what I'm doing so I'm just making a new repository through the GitHub interface just like I always have before so I am going to hit create repository um there it is now I have this repository so notice here that by default the repository lives in the master Branch so in order for to use GitHub Pages all that I need to do is click here and make a new Branch so I'm going to type in GitHub Dash pages and I'm going to select create Branch GH pages so now I have this Branch GH Pages now here's the thing that Master branch is still there and in fact if I were to go to this repository Again by default it's going to put me onto the master Branch so to make things simpler I want to make sure that gh pages is the default Branch so where I do that I need to go to settings so I'm going to click on settings and under settings I'm going to go over here to branches I'm going to click on branches and over here notice here this is where it says default Branch so I want to go to this default Branch place and I want to switch default branch and I want to switch it to GH pages and then I want to click update now it's gonna it's going to say like oh my goodness changing your default Branch can have unintended consequences is it can and this is you know we're living a little bit in the danger zone here but what what's the big deal there's nothing in this repository yet I'm just making a poem I'm messing around this is actually quite okay to do with a brand new repository you're not affecting anything else that's happened in the history because there is no history so far so I'm going to say understand update the default branch and now the default branch is GH pages so if I go back to this oops uh poem website repository you can see that I am now by default in the branch GH Pages now there's a little bit this is fine and I could stop here but I want to be really I'm really serious about GitHub Pages I'm not I'm not stop I'm I'm all in on GitHub pages so I also want to go over here to branches where this is the link where I could view what are all the branches associated with this repo and I'm going to click here and I'm going to see that the the default branch is GH pages but I still have this other Branch master so over here on the right hand side there's this little trash icon I can click this and actually delete the master branch and this is worth doing because I don't want to by accident ever work on the master branch in this particular case so I'm going to delete this branch and you can see it's gone it's it's kind of xed out and all I now all I have now is a GH Pages Branch okay we did it this repository is now a repository hosted through GitHub pages so I can uh I can go to settings by the way and I can scroll down under GI Hub Pages you can see here your site is published at this URL so by definition if you have a g GH Pages branch in your repository the URL for that that repository will be your username do github.io thee repository name which in this case is poem website now here's the thing you absolutely can use a custom URL so for example I have plenty I have several websites hosted through GitHub Pages natureof code.com for example is hosted with GitHub pages but it isn't at shift. github.io of code so there is a way to do that and in in another video maybe I'll explore that as a topic it's just a sort of configuration thing but you get this sort of free URL that you can use now let's go to that URL and you can see here it's going to say page not found the reason is there are no files there there's no files there for me to look at I mean maybe in the repository there is a file called read me I might be able to look at that but let's let's take a step further let's add a file so I'm going to go here under create new file and I'm just going to name the file now I'm just going to make a plain text file and I'm going to call it poem. txt and I'm going to do oh I'm going to write some poetry um GitHub Pages oops GI hug oh it's let's I wrote that by accident but I'm going to keep it GI hug GI hug is a hug on the pages oh dear this poem is terrible okay so that's my poem you can send me a poll request to improve it and I'm going to do commit new file and you can see that it's committing it directly to the GH Pages branch and you can see there it is so I can see it here in my GitHub repository but now look at this I can go to the URL and I can put in there poem. txt so I can access that particular file and there you can see there it is I now have a web page with this particular poem on it now that web page is a plain text file so all it shows up as raw text those of you who have used the internet before or browsed the web have noticed that web pages have you know different fonts and images and animations so to go further with this to actually host a dynamic web website through GitHub Pages you need to actually have HTML files perhaps also image files perhaps also something called CSS files I happen to have a whole set of tutorials about how to use HTML CSS and JavaScript to create different kinds of web pages that you could go and look at and then come back to this but I'm at least going to just in one step I'm going to make an HTML poem just here so that you can see a little bit more so what I want to do now is I'm going to go back and I'm going to say another I'm going to create another another new file and you know what I'm going to call this file index.html if you name a file index.html then you don't actually have to type in that file name on the web it will be the default file that's open whenever I go to uh rainbow cod. github.io poem website so I'm going to call it that and then I'm going to type whoops I'm going to type some HTML into this file you know I'm probably missing some things you're supposed to have in HTML but HTML is all all about having these tags open HTML close HTML open body close body and in the body I can put something like H1 which means header one and I can say poem and then I could say like H3 by Daniel schiffman uh and then I could say like P which is for a paragraph and I could say this um you know rainbow rainbow you are my rainbow and then I could put a period and close the paragraph and you can see this is you know you can check out my other tutorials to learn a lot more about HTML but this is writing some markup which is giving it some formatting and I'm going to just add a little more formatting like I'm going to add strong so this is going to make that particular rainbow bold and then I'm going to hit commit I'm going to say making an HTML poem and I'm going to commit that new file and you can see now what do I have in my repository I now have index.html in addition to poem. txt and if you remember this is what poem. txt looks like however now if I go to the URL and I just get rid of that right and I want to go to just the the core URL rainbow cod. github.io um poem website and I hit enter you can see there's my poem and format it so I've now used a little bit of HTML and it's freely available on the internet this is a website people can contribute to this website by making poll requests you can make changes to it through the GitHub interface you can clone that repository down to your computer the same way I showed you in other videos you can make branches you can make changes just remember the one thing that's going to be different I'm actually going to let let's do this really quickly um let's say you want to work with this locally I want to get a I'm going to go to clone or download I'm going to copy this particular this URL and I'm going to go to terminal uh this is something that I did in a previous tutorial if you need to go back and look at that and I'm going to say first of all just so you know I'm on the desktop of my computer and I'm going to say get clone so we can see now that here is that you can see there are the files one thing for you to remember if I say no it's telling me I am on Branch g. pages so if I ever want to get updated changes get pull normally we were saying things like get pull origin Master no longer is there a master Branch so I have to remember if I use any of these other git commands to always use g. pages okay so there you go that's the basics of it you can put image files anything that you can do in a web page you can put into this repository you can add stuff you can commit stuff your whole web page is there online for anyone to work to see and for you to work with through the through the git uh platform what I'm going to do in the next video for those of you who might have come to this series by working with something called p5js is I'm going to show you how to actually take a code example something that has HTML CSS and JavaScript and host that with GitHub Pages which will actually be quite simple but I'm just going to um put that in a separate video because it does involve programming and source code but you can actually just uh still just with this video put a text file or some basic HTML online okay thanks for watching and let me know what questions you have in the comments okay um all right everybody so that was my GitHub Pages tutorial I think that was relatively short at the most 20 minutes um um okay um so it's very hot in here so I'm going to I'm I'm going to have to wrap this up soon because it's getting oh it's it's 200 already I definitely I'm okay till 230 I want to see if I can do the super formula thing today let me just think about a p5js sketch really quickly um I'm trying to think the best way to do it let me get let me uh let's grab like um um I'm trying to think of what would make the most sense to use you know this was a fractal tree example I had from before I I don't know for some reason I don't feel like using them maybe reaction diffusion yeah this is these are all so slow um running game uh what was this one oh yeah so let's use this one this is my silly little platform game that you have to and platforms was the wrong term so let me use this one um okay so I'm going to call that's called running game and uh okay so all right um uh okay everybody um there's some interesting comments in the chat okay I'm going to really quickly just do a quick video of getting a P5 sketch um hosted with GitHub pages okay um great um so I'm gonna do that really quickly uh or do I already have poll requests on this let's see yes somebody already has a pull request uh I'm just going to merge this site unseen let's just look here uh I need a gith hug thank you uh okay so I'm going to I love this pull request I'm going to emerge it it thank you very much uh great um okay so uh is this worth it because I think I'm gonna I'm gonna do this anyway so I'm gonna do um yeah okay okay everybody uh here we go let me cycle the cameras I just sorry I like a little bit of a headache for a second here all right this is going to be quick five minutes famous last words okay this is a short tutorial to to show you how to take a p5js sketch and host it uh with GitHub pages so in order to follow this tutorial it assumes two things you have a GitHub account and you have a p5js sketch and the p5js sketch I'm going to show you is uh this one which is just a little uh little simple game demonstration where there's a obstacle coming at you and you've got to hit the space bar in time to jump over the obstacle okay so you can see that's the basic sketch now what is this sketch it is a directory in the directory it's called running game which is I don't know why I called it that and it has a set of files associated with it has an HTML file two JavaScript files and libraries files the point of GitHub pages though is you can host anything you can make whatever you can have as many CSS files HTML files as many JavaScript files you can have directories images all that sort of stuff but I'm going to take just this core basic directory and host it on GitHub using GitHub pages so the first thing that I need to do in my in my GitHub account under rainbow coder is I just need to make a new Repository and um and make a new repository I'm going to call it p5js sketch um obviously you should call it something better but that'll work fine um showing how to host uh p5js sketch with GitHub Pages um I want it to be public so people can see it um I'm going to uh I'm going to initialize it with a readme so it has something in it to start and then I'm just going to hit uh create repository then I'm going to add a branch this is key I need to go under here branch manager I need to add add a branch called gh Pages I'm going to create that Branch then what I want to do just for safety reasons I want to go to settings under branches and I want to switch the default Branch to GH pages I I'm going through this a little bit quickly because you can watch my previous video where I do this in a bit more detail but you I'm going to show you the steps again here but more quickly so all I need to do is hit update I want to say I understand update the default Branch I want the default Branch always to be GitHub GH Pages only only the stuff that's in that branch is viewable on hosted online as a web page so then the other thing I'm going to do just also for safety is I'm going to go back to my repository I'm going to click here under branches and I'm just going to um under master here I'm going to click this trash icon all the way over on the right because I just want to delete the master Branch so there's no more Master Branch this particular repository only has a gh Pages Branch so here we are I have an empty repository with nothing in it a gh Pages branch and now I need to commit those files my sketch to the branch now there's a bunch of different ways I could do it I could clone this repository down I could add the files and I could push it back but just for Simplicity right now I am going to just actually grab this whole directory and drag it in here so um GitHub pages is per GitHub as a tool it allows me to upload files directly to it and so it's uploading everything and now I'm going to say um uploading my P5 J sketch and I'm going to say uh commit directly to the GH Pages Branch I'm going to hit commit processing my files it takes a minute and there you go now one thing you'll notice here is my files are in a directory called running game I could have had them on the core directory which I mean in the root directory which probably would make some sense maybe I'll show you that in a second but you can see that the files are there so now where do I find where do I where do I see the stuff so the URL is always your username.on settings and then scroll down and you'll find here under GitHub pages that your it'll say your site is published here so I can click here now the irony here is it's going to say it can't find anything I'm getting a 404 era that's because I actually have my index.html file in a directory called running game so I've got to go add that directory right here running game and I'm gonna hit uh and I spelled it wrong I'm gonna hit running game and now you should see there it is so there's my sketch online and I have a permanent URL to that sketch so there it is there it is hosted on GitHub Pages now if you want it to just appear at the root directory P5 jsor sketch what I would recommend doing is I'm going to go back to the repository U and actually I'm gonna just I'm gonna clone it I'm gonna fix this by cloning it so I'm going to go um uh sorry everyone uh I'm going to go to uh this repository rainbow uh where am I uh p5js sketch I'm going to grab the URL for cloning it and I'm going to go here and I am going to CD back up to my desktop I'm going to say get clone here and I'm going to open that D here and I'm going to look at running game so let's look at this so whoops no no no no p5g sketch so in p5g sketch this is what's in that particular repository I'm just going to take those files and I'm going to put them in the root directory uh and then I'm going to delete that folder and when I go back here I can say uh CD into p5js sketch and I can say get status so you can see it's telling me I moved all these files around I did all sorts of stuff so I'm going to say add do a to add everything and delete everything thing and then I'm going to say get commit move files to root directory and then I'm going to say get push origin and now the really key thing I want to put those changes back up I don't want to say get push origin Master remember everything happens in gh pages so I'm going to push everything up and I'm already authenticated it might ask for your username and password and now I should be able to go here and you can see all of the files are now here just in the root directory there's no more running game Direct directory and I can actually just now go to rainbow rainbow cod. github.io P5 sketch you can see this is the URL that I'm going to I can hit enter and there is my sketch so you can easily just have files in your GitHub repository as long as they're in the ghpages branch then you know where to view those pages hosted on the web so I showed you all the possibilities I showed you uploading files just through the GitHub interface I showed you cloning and making changes but you can you can work entirely through the GitHub interface you can work entirely locally through terminal all of those possibilities are open to you the only thing that you have to know to make sure is that all of your work is happening in gh pages and that you know the URL which is your username.in you can also have a custom URL that involves creating something called a cname file I'll make another tutorial uh which will be like part nine at some point of this series of how to do that or part 10 somewhere in this GitHub get and GitHub tutorial series will be that video as well okay so hopefully you found this helpful and I will see you in some other part of the universe somehow I hope okay um so I don't know what was that 10 minutes maybe that was 10 minutes I think it was pretty short but it was definitely longer than five minutes uh okay so that concludes that um do I have the time and it's 211 so let's see if we can do this super formula thing I need to work on the math for this for a second and I need to get set up so I want to do this in uh process in P5 so um let me make uh let me get that uh running game sketch so let me call this uh super formula oh it's already taken yeah uh underscore processing I'm going to call this a super formula really okay hold on uh super formula ah I thought I oh it doesn't not giving me permission I I have too many accounts on this computer and the permissions are all screwed up uh there we go now I can call this one super formula I'm going to go in here super Formula One and put all this in here uh and I'm going to open this with Adam oh it's like a kit repository that's fine uh and I'm going to get rid of all the code and I don't need this class I'm going delete this um save and I also want to run a local server now move this over here uh all right okay let me fix this sorry I'm just doing some setup stuff and I don't have the energy to talk through it just for a second so I need my need to play my background music but I don't have any background music some coming soon background music uh uh okay um let me add setup and draw just to make sure things are working here uh create canvas 400 400 should be fine background 51 okay that looks good this can move in a little bit this can also move in a little bit this can be minimized okay um okay so the other thing I want to look at now is super ellipse let's start with this um yeah okay so I'm going to um uh I'm wearing a pebble time watch in case people were wondering it's not an Apple watch um okay uh okay so um I need to discuss the math for this with you guys for a second because I'm not 100% sure about it I don't think I'm GNA I don't think I'm going to in this video tutorial do like derive everything I'm just going to kind of like talk through how it works but I want to do this once so here's a circle a circle has a center point and it has a radius and we know that if you were to make like a right triangle like this this is like the X this is a y and this is like the radius of the circle and this is an angle we know a couple things we know through Pythagorean theorem that x^2 + y^2 = r^2 and we also know that given R and Theta we can solve for x equals r r * cine of theta and Y = R * sin of theta now I've skipped a million things here if if this kind of math this is something called polar coordinates is not familiar to you I would refer you to my polar coordinates and trigonometry video tutorial um but um these are the basic formulas for dealing with a a plain old Circle sorry it's very hot in here I've got of running out of steam but I let let me make this super ellipse tutorial since I said I would do it um I'm G I just need to uh point the fan at me here that'll help okay um okay so now the super ellipse is written this way so the circle is in a way all the points a unit circle is all the points where A and B are uh one and N is two so let me let's that's the super ellipse formula let me write that over here come on uh is X over n sorry X over a to the N Power Plus y over B to the N power and these are the absolute value equals one so you can see this is that formula when uh When what when A and B are one sorry when A and B are equal to R and uh n is equal to two right because let's just say let's say x / r 2ar + y / R 2 = 1 this is the same as x^2 + y^2 = R2 right so this is a simple version of this formula with this formula we can also extract the polar to the equivalent of the Polar to cartisian coordinates you saying x equals and this is where I have to look this up I'm just coming over here for a second um I'm just going to leave that I'm going to write it over here while I have that open x equals x equals as a function OFA equals cosine of to the 2 absolute value to the 2 N power time a Time the S of cosine of theta oops and I ran out of space okay so um we can sort of do the same thing with these formulas so I think and you can see sine of T is ne1 if T is less than zero is z if T is equal to zero and it's plus one if T is greater than zero so I believe I could derive this formula but I think I'm gonna I think I'm going to skip deriving the formula and then and just implement it so this is the super ellipse oh boy is it hot um uh okay so if you guys don't mind I'm also just going to take a one minute break to get some more water um so I'm going to just short twom minute break oops put this note up here okay okay I'm I'm very concerned with my notes okay yeah I'm going to go over what the sign function is people are asking in the chat okay so I'm just muting my microphone and I'll be back in uh I'll be back in in two minutes okay I think I'm back audio wise you guys can hear me okay um I'm uh trying to get some fresh air in this room I turned the fan up higher um so you might be hearing some like audio in the background but I will um I'm GNA turn the fan down once I uh once I um uh once I start this tutorial I'm just going to wash the Whiteboard so um the idea here by the way oops here I am so let me figure out what I am talking about um uh so first of all I just want to fix one thing change this to say super ellipse um so what I want to show what I want to open up first is um so this is ultimately where this leads we're kind of going to the point where you can do these kind of crazy 3D shapes and maybe are you asking me if I feel unwell because I do feel a little bit ill but I think I'm gonna be okay for another 10 minutes no I just got I got a little overheated I think um I'm going to have to think about what to do about these hot days in New York in this room and get some different lights but for right now I'm actually just taking a break I feel I feel fine now and having a little water um so the idea here is kind of working up to doing these more complex 3D shapes but um with this particular formula and the same technique that I'm going to show you with it's just an extension of this um ellipse formula see also super ellipse which I'm going to get from here okay so I think I'm going to start with this particular visual reference uh okay so this is going to be the last thing I'm going to do today uh I think I'm just going to do the super ellipse uh and then I will reference the super formula which I will do a you know I'll release the code for doing that which is pretty similar and then I will do a followup video on that next week okay everybody super shapes all right let's see if we can get this is going to be three parts super ellipse super shape 3D super shape shape that's my goal I'm definitely afraid of the 3D super shape but we'll see if I can manage to get to that at some point uh okay Super Rainbow would be nice okay I got to do this here we go last last tutorial of today and then I'm gonna go outside into what will be cooler air I'm I'm going to turn this fan a little bit down just so it doesn't mess the audio up okay here we go here we go uh and I guess I'm just going to start I think I cycled the cameras let me do it again just in case okay hello and welcome to another coding challenge this challenge is going to happen in three parts the goal is to eventually in processing make these 3D super shapes so there's like these weird crazy formulas that you can find this is my reference that uh there'll be a link to it in um in the uh video's description on paul.net which goes through the math Behind These super shapes and what they look like when you render them with different variables but but I'm going to start way back I'm going to go way back into time into a much simpler place and rather than make a 3D so the last piece is 3D super shape the second piece is 2D super shape but the first piece is actually just something called the super ellipse the super ellipse is going to be uh an a simple example to show you how to build a shape that satisfies a particular formula and that particular formula is right here sorry on Wikipedia IIA it is this particular formula right here so let me talk to you a little bit about the origins of this super ellipse formula okay so you might be familiar you might remember this shape from my previous video polar coordinates and trigonometry it is called a circle so a circle is a shape that has a center point and a radius and you can think of describing any point along the outside of that Circle by that radius and some angle of rotation but you can also think of it as U sorry a x and a y and so we know through the Pythagorean theorem that with a right triangle A2 + B2 = c^2 or x^2 + y^2 = r 2 we also know through the definition of what s and cosine mean s being opposite over a hypotenuse cosine being adjacent over hypotenuse we can solve for x and y based on R and Theta so x = r * cine of theta and Y = R * sin of theta so knowing this we can actually use these formulas to set a whole bunch of vertex points and draw a circle without the ellipse function with begin shape and shape and vertex let's actually go do that really quickly right now in the code and we're going to come back so we're go do that and I'm going to come back to this formula and show you show you what happens to that particular ellipse so if I go I've got a a blank oops excuse me a blank code example right here um it's running in the browser it's doing absolutely nothing but I can in draw I can say okay let's make a so let's make a loop I'm going to say for VAR a equals z a is less than 2 pi A+ equals some amount like 0.1 I'm going to say okay I need to solve for x and I want to have an r a radius R equals 100 or 200 100 is fine so x equals R * cosine of that angle and yal R * s of that angle so if I just draw a bunch of points at those x's and y's and if I start also by translating because I want the origin point just for this example to be in the center of the window if I run this and maybe I need to say a stroke 255 so you can see those points you can see they're all the points along a circle for every I'm incrementing an angle and I've got all these points along the circle now I could connect them by saying here begin shape and I could say N Shape and instead of point I could say vert ver and then now you can see I've got a circle and it's actually even filled in but just um just so you can see I can say no fill and you can see this now you notice there's a little break point here it's because my last point doesn't actually equal my first point and I could be more thoughtful about this but I could also just say nshaped close so if I say nshaped close there then it's now closed so there's the circle so this is me this is like we just easing into this this is not a super ellipse it's an ellipse and it's entirely based on this particular formula now the super ellipse formula looks a little bit different it looks like this x / a to the nth Power Plus y / B and by the way the absolute value of those whether X is plus or minus to the N value equals 1 so you can see this is actually short sorry this is actually a particular case of this formula what if a equals uh r and b equals R I'm in the wrong side of this pen or maybe I'm not this Pen's just getting worse if a equal R and B equal R and Nal 2 what is this formula this is x / r^ 2 + y / r^ 2 = 1 or x^2 + y^2 = r^2 and the absolute value doesn't matter CU a negative or a positive is squared and becomes a positive so this formula is actually just a simple case of this formula and in some CA in in the same sense there this is a simplifi this these are the ways to calculate the X and Y based on Theta for this particular formula so a circle is actually all the X and Y points that satisfy this equation x^2 + y^2 = r^2 a super excuse me I'm falling over here I don't have I have superpowers of clumsiness a super lipse is all of the X and y's that satisfy this particular formula what if it's n to the fourth power what if you have a different a and a different B what kinds of shapes can you get if you plug different values in so the question is though what are the equivalent polar to cartisian transformation form how do you get from Theta all the different angles to the X and the Y that's how I did it codewise over here right these two formulas were rather simple how do I get the equivalent formulas for the more General super ellipse shape so I could try to derive it but I'm just going to look up the answer for that on Wikipedia and and Implement that answer here in this particular code example and perhaps if people are interested I could do another video we could try to look at bit more behind the math or maths depending on how you like to say it um uh behind this so let me go back back to Wikipedia and I can actually look right here and you can see by the way you get different kinds of shapes based on what the value of n is but this is really the formula that I care about so what I care about is how do I solve for x and y as a function of theta function of the angle and here I could see X as a function of theta is the absolute value of theta to the 2 over n power * a * some function called s of cosine of theta okay so let's at least see what happens can I copy paste this into my code I can't even select it so I'm going to try to remember this we'll go back and forth between it so I'm now going to change this to be super ellipse I comment that out and I'm going to go down here and I'm going to say varx equals I've already forgotten the absolute value of cosine of that angle and now i' I've got a little awkwardness because I've got these variables called A and B here and I want to keep that so I'm actually going to just change this to angle I'm going to use the word angle here um just to be a bit more explicit there so I want absolute value of cosine of angle to um and I want to take that and put it to what the the absolute value of cosine to the 2 / n's power so let's make a variable called na which is going to be 2 / n so to the na power so X is I know the absolute value of cosine of the angle to the 2 over n's power times what a times what some function called sgn which I will make up myself sgn of cosine of that angle so uh this I don't have a lot of space here so I'm going to move this out so now you can see it you can see this entire this is me implementing that exact formula the absolute value of cosine of the angle to the 2 N power time a times this function called s of cosine of angle which I'll get to you and now I need to do y is actually the same thing but change this to S change this to B and change this to sign so and this is y so we need a few more variables here instead of R I Need A and B so I'm going to I'm going to make them both equal to 100 right now and I need an n and I'm going to make n just for right now equal to two so if n is equal to two this should actually get us just that original plain old Circle right because what's two ID two is one to the on power is just cosine of angle so now how do we deal with this sign function so the sign function is actually a special function that just says that you want the sign of whatever any number that you pass in there if that number of positive I should get the value one if that number is negative I should get the value negative one and if that value is zero I should get the value zero so the sign function is just a function that takes any value and tells you whether it's positive or negative so we can actually write a function in P5 that does that for us so back over here if I write a function and call it sgn and it gets some value all I have to do is say if value is greater than zero return one else if value is less than zero return NE 1 else return zero so this is a sign function it receives a value and this is very longwinded I'm sure you could come up with some clever condensed shorthand way of writing this but I'm being very explicit greater than zero give me a one less than zero give me a negative 1 or else zero this is actually going to kind of tell us what quadrant we're in in that super ellipse so we should now we have the formula in here we should now instead we're not using this simplified version anymore we're using this formula now we should be able to get a nice super ellipse so let me go back here whoops and hit refresh I see the regular old Circle that's good so let's get a little crazy and let's put like the number four in here and see what I get ah you can see now I have a rounded rectangle kind of almost so let's make a slider for n so I'm going to create a slider and I'm going to say slider equals create slider slide when you make a slider you need four arguments uh what is the minimum value what is the maximum value what is the starting value and what is the increment and uh what I'm going to do is in draw I'm going to say n equals slider. value so now whenever I tweak that slider I should be able to change FIP so that's n equals 2 and you can see as I move the slider what I get oh now that was like really really hard to see but you can see as I'm moving so I'm getting all the different possible uh super ellipse shapes now I could also change A and B like for example what if I make uh a 200 and B is 100 you can see that's just an ellipse now and I get other kinds of shapes with that so you can see this is the beginning of a super formula it's just a super ellipse I have a single angle I have some weird sort of conversion that I need to do to get an X and Y and then I have a begin shape and end shape so in the next video what I'm going to do is instead of showing you how to do this with just and let me come back how to do this with just this particular formula the next Formula I want to approach is how do I get all the X and y's that satisfy I'm going to scroll up to un this particular formula so when I use this particular formula which just has a lot more math in it but essentially the codee's going to be exactly the same I'm going to you're going to see how you can get all the variety of these different kinds of shapes and then at some point once we get to there we should be able to then take this formula and move it into 3D to create volumes so I actually have never done this part before I've done the one the superellipse and the 2D super shape and this that'll come uh in the next video which I'll release at some point from now and then uh we'll move into 3D so I hope you enjoyed watching the super lips video give it a try try adding some colors in it can you make a super rainbow I don't know what that would be try making that uh and see what you get uh what other kind of interactive features can you do what kind of questions do you have about the math and let me know how that goes thanks for watching okay um ah so somebody is pointing out in the chat that JavaScript has a math. sign function so I could have just used that um and I wonder if P5 actually has that function let's try replacing it math. sign uh oh yeah looks like that I could just use that so I should have just used that I don't think that's overloaded in P5 in global scope yeah so it's not but you know we learned something so that's that's a good um yeah the formulas are scary the point of me is these videos is try to make them seem less scary I don't know if I succeeded at that okay everybody so it is about 240 I'm about 10 minutes past when I said needed to go but I'm I can tolerate a few more minutes here if anybody uh I know that some people requested like a little some question and answers if anybody has any questions they want to ask I can answer maybe just a few General random questions before I go um I'm looking in the chat to see if I anybody made any other good points that I missed uh oh yeah so I should one thing I I'll mention this when I do a followup I should really be more thoughtful about um here like so I probably should create a variable called like step and say like 2 pi ID 100 just so it's like there sort of an number of points for all the angles from 0 to 2 pi but in the end it kind of looks the same but yes that's going to matter more when there's a bit more of a fine finer detail on certain things so um I'm going to leave that out though because I'll try to remember to mention that in the next video let me see what other questions there are so yeah so the funny thing is someone's asking if I have feet so first of all I do have feet I don't know if there's any like non awkward way I can show you my you know legs but well I'm almost knocked over the table there everything's fine though I just I just bumped um but I actually what's funny is I have these rainbow socks I was think oh I could wear the rainbow socks but nobody able to see them need a rainbow tshirt I guess okay um uh are your polar coordinates and trig tutorials on YouTube yes they are so let me find those for you uh let me just Google uh actually so let me go to YouTube shiffman um and the place that you could find them is under here I don't know if how well you can see this uh the nature of code videos and I would I'm pretty sure most of them are in this chapter 3 oscillation playlist so trigonometry and polar coordinates here this now this I should warn you about some of these videos are really old being like I made them like four years ago quality isn't as good I think I was funnier that then that's a little bit crazier um but uh so you know let me know how that goes if that matches up well um but this is the one and obviously there's other aspects of this in U because this is going towards like simulating pendulums and springs and that sort of thing as well um uh are you ending soon yes I'm going to go in just a few minutes I've been this has been a 2hour and 15 minute live stream two hours is really my limit I need to do a better job of keeping myself to that um also ask are you a teacher uh so I teach at a program uh it's called ITP I'm just going to go to the website it's at NYU this is the URL tish. nyu.edu ITP it's a twoyear master's program in technology art and creative applications of Technology Loosely I encourage you to learn about this program and I also do have an online course uh which is with a company called Caden and this is the URL for that cad.com courses thee of code modinfo so this is something you can sign up and take online as well um uh what temperature is it well let me look at the weather in New York City and I would say it's probably like five degrees 5 to 10 degrees of warmer in this room it is 82 degrees uh sunny and 82 in New York City right now I would say it's probably 90 degrees in this room um ah so everyone's uh I'm getting a lot of people have been asking about uh 3D reaction diffusion so to be honest okay so the reaction diffusion example tutorial uh works on so I'll mention this I'll try to get people started on this so the reaction to diffusion tutorial works by having a particular amount of chemicals of A and B in a particular cell in a twodimensional plane and it involves having weights um sorry 0 2 .05 sorry 0.05 2 052 0521 so it involves doing using a formula to add up all of the chemical amounts of the chemicals of this cell and its neighbors if you watch the video you'll see that formula so to do that 3D what you'll need to do is not only consider 2D Neighbors which there's only eight of them but in 3D there would be 9 + 9 plus those eight so or n there's 27 cells total so you'll need to and actually if you look at my mener sponge video I do a sort of 3D cube thing with 27 cells which you can look at that as some some Clues so a it's just about taking that formula and that instead of having a nested Loop through two rows and columns you need a three nested Loop through row rows columns and depth I guess and once you've done that you also need a way of visualizing it so one way of doing it might be to have each cell be a cube with transparency and have the level of transparency tied to the amount of chemicals I'm not sure so um there's a variety of ways you could try approaching that so I honestly haven't done that before I really try to stay away from 3D stuff but I would encourage you guys to get started on that and I'm absolutely happy to try doing a video at some point uh oh yeah everybody really wants to do uh I've defin I've made a bunch of videos about pear and nois already so if you um I'm curious what would come up but if you Google peino shiffman YouTube you can see there's a several videos uh 3D terrain with pein noise there's some other people's pearing noise there's this pearing noise video there's a Caden video on pearing noise so you should be able to find that yes reaction diffusion is a is an example of a cellular automaton works exactly the same way in my view um um uh S I know everyone really wants me to do videos on sound I gotta I gotta bump that up so that'll happen let's let's make a let me commit to doing that maybe next week I want you guys to keep me honest about that especially in the slack uh the slack is where I'm uh kind of have a discussion the slack is a group you can join if you subscribe to the patreon and I have a topics discussion group going on in there so um but just tweet me remind me in the comments that sort of thing um uh a harmonograph I don't know even know what that is but I'm gonna look like that so I'm definitely going to do sound I apologize for not getting to it honestly the stumbling block is I got to like set up a like a mixing board in here and get sound coming out through the stream and so um I need to do that and I'm sort of motivated to do that I just haven't gotten around to it um because a lot of times what happens here is like come here and I rather than like work on my setup or topic ideas I just like turn on the recording but if I do another live stream this week it would be Thursday or Friday otherwise the next one will be next uh Monday or Tuesday so uh okay so let me briefly just mention now that I'm kind of wrapping up if you want to subscribe to updates email updates for when I'm going to do these live streams you can just go to shiffman domnet and there's a little like uh place where you can put in your email if you're interested in uh supporting this channel through patreon uh and I hesitate to plug this too much because I'm I'm thrilled for people just to watch and enjoy and participate in the community but you can support it through patreon at patreon.com coding rainbow and the benefits that I'm offering for that are a private slack Channel um something else I can't remember oh and a shared uh Google Drive where you can sort of download all the video files if you want to watch them offline honestly if somebody really wants that stuff and doesn't want to subscribe to the patreon I probably would say okay but but I guess I have to have some some stuff anyway okay um okay so um uh oh will so I'm going to use P5 GS for sound so I'm going to do all my sound stuff in the browser using P5 GS I will do sound effects sound synthesis and even analyzing um sound from a microphone um so I'm going to do all that type of stuff in p5js uh okay so I think I'm going to go I'm going to try to find some cooler air thank you guys for being patient with me today and watching and participating and being enthusiastic and supportive I really appreciate it I'm having I feel like some of these math topics are kind of difficult and actually to be honest with you I would be so pleased to do the sound video tutorials because I feel like those will actually be a lot simpler and many ways to do and uh hopefully we'll have cooler I don't know what the weather's going to be in New York next week New York weather 10day forecast let's see when are there uh uh so uh how do I get the 10 Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday H Monday it looks like it's still going to be warm but hopefully we'll get some cooler days while I get some cooler air in here and figure out uh to make it less hot but also I think if I just if I do like one hour take a break one hour it'll it won't heat up as much so anyway okay so um thank you guys for your support I'm going to turn off the stream I have still have many more that will be more videos that will get uploaded as Standalone chunks uh I haven't I I think I actually thing I'll say that I'm pleased with is I actually have enough people now watching my YouTube channel that I honestly can't keep up with the comments so I was daily making sure I responded to every single comment on every single YouTube video for a while and it's now not that it exploded but it but I will there uh I I will try to go back and answer as many of those that I can and you can also contact me on Twitter at shiftman as well with feedback and suggestions okay uh I'm gon to hit a button over here which is going to turn off this stream and I'm going to say goodbye and I look forward to seeing you guys in the next live stream I'm 100% committed to doing these at least once per week and if I can I'm going to do them twice a week so right now it's up in the air whether I'll get one in on Friday but if I so either be on Friday or next Monday or Tuesday okay see you guys soon thanks for watching
