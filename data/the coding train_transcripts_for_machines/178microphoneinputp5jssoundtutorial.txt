hello welcome to another video about audio in p5 yes if you watched in these other videos you'll know that audio is not really a thing that I know that much about but I'm gonna give it a try I'm gonna look at the reference and examples and try to make something the thing that I'm gonna look at and make in this video is how can I have a webpage listen to my voice and respond to my voice now that I just sort of mislead you there on that that could mean a lot of different things and at some point we might look at I might I'd love to make a video that tries to listen to the words that I'm speaking and respond to those words but really all I'm gonna do in this video is start with the basic simplest idea which is the microphone of the computer listens to the volume of whatever sound is it's hearing and visualizes some results based on that volume so how do what do we need for this we need the p5 sound library so I'm gonna click on this here you can see this is the reference page for the p5 sound library in particular I want to use this object called p5 audio in here something really important and I should just state before I even get into this I am using this web browser called chrome and Chrome and you know possibly other web browsers have a security restriction where you cannot access the microphone or the camera of a computer first of all without the user giving your permission so we're gonna see this we might see a little popup saying oh can I have permission for the microphone but beyond that the page has to be hosted through HTTPS what does that mean well let's go to some website I don't know google.com you can see here it says HTTPS and a little like lock because it's locked it's secure so when a website is served through HTTPS there is additional security and encryption involved if a website is not served through HTTPS google won't even not serve through HTTPS let's try to find I don't know yahoo.com yeah okay fine let's let's go to Schiffman net there you can see here this website is not served through HTTPS and in which case the sketch that I'm going to make if you publish it to the web it's got to be published through HTTP which sort of depends on where are you hosting it and how are you doing it and that sort of thing okay now the exception to that is when I run my examples I'm running a local web server on the computer just so I can write my code and look at it quickly chrome allows you to do any of this stuff with localhost so while you're testing and debugging you know it will work we're gonna find out if it works at least okay let's so let's go back to the reference page and let's look at the pieces that we need so I need to create I want to create a variable I'm gonna create a variable called var Mike and I'm gonna I'm gonna go to my code which is right here and I'm gonna create a variable called Mike for microphone and I'm gonna say Mike equals new p5 audio in so this is making audio in object a lot of objects that you can create with a p5 library like p5 dom duchess or p5 sound fjs have the p5 prefix it's kind of like a name spacing thing this is not a audio in object it's a p5 audio in object and then for to for it to start listening I've got to say Mike dot start so let's just run this in the browser I look at this localhost 8001 Stu use your microphone this means by the way if I'm gonna give permission I've really got to protect myself so I highly recommend doing this before you click allow click allow and I you can see some I get some messages here so it should listening and I'm seeing this like red record button there in the top corner so things are working good stuff right ok so now it's listening how do I get access to it well I need to call the function on the Mike object to say hey could you give me the current somethingorother right now and I what I want to listen to is just the volume so I'm going to save our volume equals Mike and I think the function is called gate level it might be called get volume who knows let's just write it and see what happens and then let's say console dot log volume so I'm gonna run this again and it's like look at that these numbers now here we go did you think that learning coding would be really rough can you say you I think it's saying that I can't say inside these numbers that's definitely saying that so you can see that the volume as I speak the volume gets live so one thing we can glean glean from this is that we're getting tiny little numbers and I'm pretty sure the range that we're getting is a number between 0 and 1 1 being a very loud sound now here the microphones over here by the way so my microphones here so I go we can maybe we solve some big numbers go by there so what I probably want to do instantly I don't think I need this anymore is I could do something like let's draw an ellipse let's set a background let's create a canvas let's draw an ellipse in the center and let's give it size volume times 200 volume times 200 and we can run this again and here we go so now as I speak the circle it really messed up my hair wearing that wellthank how as I speak you can see the circle growing and shrinking and you know I guess I said I was gonna try to make it like a little mouth talking so one thing I could do is I could give it a fixed width and now I could just sort of talk and I puppeteering the thing running in the browser and in a way this is kind of all I want to show you in this video I mean you could think of some things you might do like what if I use lurk go find my lerp video and smooth it so the the mouth kind of like opens and closes more smoothly well if that's the kind of response you want you know what other types of interactions and responses could you imagine doing based on a person speaking could I play a game like the lap as I you know pong so when I speak I think somebody IIT P made this project actually where you would shout it to your phone I'm gonna have to look it up and maybe link to it in this video so what if I were to speak and as I speak the one of the paddles moves up the louder I am or moves down so there's all sorts of kind of ways you might apply this particular analysis and visualize so in the next video I'm going to move from reading the volume of my speaking voice or whatever is going into the microphone and actually read the amplitude of an mp3 file while it's playing well and at some point I'll also look at frequency analysis with that as well okay see you in the next video perhaps
