Hello! This is not actually a tutorial video. You could just skip to the next one if you want the actual tutorial content. But if you happen to be watching this as a playlist, because you're learning to program in JavaScript with p5.js for the first time, I just want to give you a little warning. All the videos you've been watching, before this video, were made as of right this moment a couple of years ago. I am now programming in JavaScript with a slightly different style. It's a bit more modern style. It's part of ES6. What's ES6? You could go watch a different video where I talk about that that I'll link to in this video description. But where I use something called classes to make objects. So the videos that are coming next, the older ones are deprecated. They'll be off in some other playlist somewhere that you could go and find. But the videos that are coming next, I will look like I do now just like with more gray hair. I have a scar on my elbow that I didn't have before. But those videos will not assume any prior knowledge. They will assume that you are arriving here just at the moment where you are about you just learned about the basics of functions and you were about to learn objectoriented programming. Also, I should mention that in these videos, I'm using a slightly different editor. At this point, I'm kind of hoping that maybe you already have an editor, maybe I had a different tutorial that showed you an editor to use. This is the Atom editor, you can use it. But I'm going to focus on the code in these videos and not the editor. But if you wondering why it changed, that's why, I'm using something different in these videos. So if that is what you would like to do, please stay with me and just watch as this video doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo transitions to the next one, probably with an ad on it, sorry about that, sorry. OK, see you in the next video, maybe. [BELL DINGS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
