hello welcome by back this is like sort of like a part two of my circle packing animated coding challenge thing because you know kittens I guess so uh what if we took that I think will be interesting to just look at the circle packing algorithm visualizing a generic image so if you recall where I left it last is it's kind of circle packing around the letter formations here we're seeing 2017 but what if instead I were to load and let's go to this kitten image and let's look at what is the size of this kitten image it's 800 by 800 so let's make the window 800 by 800 what if I were to load this kitten image well if I run this we get a lot of things broken because it's kitten touch JPEG so if we run this we can see okay well I don't see the kitten so one of the things I want to change here is instead of drawing the circle seeding the circles locations based on brightness values I just want to like put circles everywhere and pull the color value from the kitten itself so a couple things I should change is one is we don't have this idea of spots anymore so I can get rid of this idea of a list of initial possible spots although I'll discuss why that might be interesting to bring back in and I just want the circle locations to go back to being a a random with value and a random height value and we don't need spots anymore the big difference here so there's this circle packing thing going on again the big difference here is I want the circle to store a color so I'm going to add a color variable to the circle object and when I create the circle I'm going to add another argument that I pass in for color I get an error here because the circle is expecting now a color to be passed in so what I need to do is I need to go and get from that image I need to create a color value and then pass that in so the question becomes what pixel do I look up well I want to look up the color for that X&Y point and the way that I do that is with this formula that I've used in countless image processing videos before where I say the index is X plus y times the images with now there's an issue here x and y are floating point values so this won't actually work but it will work if I just quickly convert X and y into integers using this int function and then I put that in here and now this runs and we see all these circles up but I need to use that color so what I need to do here is come back and say ah forget about a a white circle let's fill based on that color let's say no stroke and now if I run it we can see here is my kitten made with circles okay so you could do this with any image you could do this with live video it would be interesting and this is just one possible way of doing it you can also sort of think about I didn't really I don't remember what I last left this the target number of circles I'm trying to create I'm still trying to create ten so let's look at this actually what happens more slowly and we're going to get more bigger circles because they have more time to kind of grow and this leads me I think to an interesting point which is the how I'm where I'm putting the circles in the ultimate size of these circles is entirely completely random but you might think about what is the creative way you could analyze the image and place a lot of initial circles where there where there's detail in the image and place very few initial circles where there is no detail in little detail in the image so that you grow larger circles and smaller circles for the points where you need to refine to have refine color and and and vice versa so I think that is something that I would love to to investigate you could probably think of like edge detection or other ways what are some other creative ways that you can figure out where to seed the circles based on based on the quality and the properties of the image itself and then if you do that with live video what would happen there so I hope you enjoyed this little addendum in a way it's a second coding challenge and that you make something with this and I'll try to also remember to release JavaScript versions of these for those who you want to try this stuff run it in the browser okay thanks for watching
