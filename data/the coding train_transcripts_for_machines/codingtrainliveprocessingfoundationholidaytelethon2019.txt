I love that okay so we are going to um we're going to merge this in I really need to talk about the fundraising uh application here um and then come back and um let's find that one here we go since Simon gave a donation when there's a donation I will sing a song so one thing you could really really do that would be awesome not required not required you can put the chords in here I'll show you how I I did that for the let it code one which was submitted by um uh this was submitted by and let me find it here um submitted by elst preacher on GitHub created this let it code to the T of Let It Snow and also and all I want is for code to run which will definitely happen at some point uh so I'm looking for the coding train Jingle Bells which is right here oh and I was going to show you that if I go to the let it code markdown file this morning see this is the thing I prepared no code for today but I did spend about 15 minutes trying to put the cords in with the lyrics cuz I don't have any of this I don't know what I'm doing here I but also have this sheet of paper here that has like the actual chords on it this by the way I also have to thank Cynthia Lynn um I think if you Google Cynthia Lynn ukulele you'll find her work I've watched many of her ukulele tutorials on YouTube uh uh to learn to play a little bit um and so let's see if we can do um let's see if we can do our coding train Jingle Bells now do I have that so the other thing I have at hand here came came last night um arrived in the mail for me is 100 holiday songs I suppose it actually says Christmas carols here but I'm trying to be as holiday secular as possible with this live stream I mean that'll be impossible but um and there's got to be a jingle bells in here right it's got 100 songs I'm looking under Jay maybe we should uh there's no Jingle Bells in here because it's not is that not technically a um Christmas Carol jingle bells jingle bells I mean there got to be so few chords right somebody somebody watching put the chords in here for just these six lines and I will come back and sing that in a second because first I want to talk about what is really the important aspect of today um and that is um the processing Foundation fundraiser so um let me start by going to uh donorbox oh let me H let me start by going twitter.com processing org and um I think actually my tweet here will have the uh donate link Okay so so let me start by going to here so this is the campaign uh support P5 this giving season I I I would say so you can now um donate either via this web page or via the um or with the link that's on this live stream page that I believe is there and I'm going to pull it up here on my other uh computer CU I should see a notification or something pop up if somebody donates I haven't yet figured out to see that um so those are the two places you could donate um and there are a bunch of rewards and giveaways um that are part of this campaign drive that you can that I'm going to show you and talk about here in a minute I just want to be clear that uh thank you to YouTube uh in particular Dorene who's my YouTube Partner manager who I must have sent probably a 100 emails in the last two weeks asking for this fundraiser feature to be unlocked on my channel um so thank you so much for having that this program um any 501c3 nonprofit uh Foundation charity can be uh part of a YouTube giving campaign I think a lot of the stuff is in beta so I was able to get access to that um YouTube covers all the transaction fees so from what I've been told and what I understand if you donate um and I guess I could just go to the live stream here but if you donate on what would be on the right hand side of your screen or with the chat viaa that donate button um that money will go to the processing foundation and there will be no fees taken out of it um I also however want to say though that um this is your uh clear path to donating where the processing foundation will get your information to send you a thank you and also depending on if you're donating one of these donor tiers to receive your gifts so I don't think that if you donate through YouTube the money makes its way to the foundation but um you don't I don't know that we get your name or any information to thank you but I will thank you here um if you donate and in fact I am going to match so let's see whatever there's got to be a way for me to see this if I just go to like YouTube the coding train um I'm always hesitant to pull up the chat but why not if I go here I am going to match personally any donations that come through up to $1,000 here so right now at the end of this live stream I am also going to give $162 to the processing Foundation and I suppose I if I can figure out the amount that came into the donor box page during this time I will also include that up to um $1,000 so um thank you everyone for why why should you donate now a lot of you might be watching just because you enjoy the channel and the weird stuff that I do that's great and aren't able to donate that is absolutely fine you are welcome here I realize that not everyone is in a position um to give to give money um there other ways to support um the processing Foundation of course and I can talk about through your um through just being part of the community which I will also mention and talk about during this live stream um but let me first talk about why this um support P5 and by the way this should say this is where I got this wrong that should say support P5 that's the hashtag people um why this is important so you know let me start with this pitch to you what you let's say you are a creative artist a cre creative coder somebody who works and makes stuff on your computer perhaps you've you you use software tools like Adobe Creative Suite that I don't know what is the going rate for Adobe Creative Suite these days um $30 a month no yeah my watch is trying to answer the question for me uh $30 a month I don't know it's quite a bit processing and P5 just Library are free they are maintained by volunteers by people who are paid through Fellowship programs and other types of stipend to um an Institutional support to work on that software we're small um a lot of people are donating their time or even if they're being paid working additional hours on top of other a lot of other responsibilities um and um these software projects don't just happen by Magic and volunteer unpaid labor is not enough to sustain these projects it may have been in the past and there may be some people who are in a privilege position where they can donate their time but a lot of people can't and to have the most inclusive and healthy opensource Library uh we need to pay people and so processing Foundation is raising money um uh um there's a a medium article uh which will go through this quite a bit more to help sustain the software projects so let me mention to you what those software projects are processing Foundation processing the Java based processing which started all was 20 years ago p5js uh so processing in case you're not aware of the history was created by Ben fry Ben Benjamin I like to say I don't know if anybody calls him that but I say hey Benjamin Benjamin are you watching Ben fry and Casey Reese while they were students at the MIT media lab in 2001 that's the original Genesis of all of all of what I'm talking about and uh today p5js if I'm correct began as a project in 2013 which somehow is like six years ago I don't know how that's possible um Lauren McCarthy uh created that project along with Evelyn Eastman and Lauren McCarthy has been leading that project for years and years um so many people have contributed I couldn't possibly name them all although I hopefully I can come up with some to mention over the course of this live stream but I I do want to give a special shout out to Cassie Terian who created the P5 web editor that I use in all of my teaching and all of the stuff on the coding train so um um so those are some people to mention um there's processing Pi which is processing python um uh Jonathan oh why am I playing on I'm the [Laughter] worst prepare uh let's go let's go to processing.org there's the python mode of processing there's processing. piy which is a um hey this season we look at that that's great where's the usually there's like this like bar bar across the top that goes to other projects um oh there we go uh this this is why I just want to mention these so there's processing. py um why am I forgetting fineberg Jonathan fineberg I remembered it popped into my head I'm sorry Jonathan fineberg uh processing for Android created by Andre kbri uh processing for the pie created by gotf freed hater uh Ryan Brown Ryan Brown donated $50 to the processing Foundation thank you so much I just that I tried to get this thing where an overlay would Pop Up when somebody donates because it does that YouTube will send through the RPI alerts through super chats but I don't know how to do that with the um donations um so code Marshall is saying sorry you can't donate in this country or region yet so that might be true for you I will remind you that all you need to do is look in this video's description and there is a link to this donor box page I believe this will take donations from any region through uh whatever kinds of online credit card hard PayPal things you can do so all of these projects uh that are up here in order to sustain them um um we're raising money in a new way uh we do we've been lucky and uh thank you so much to Dorothy Santos who is the program manager for the processing Foundation who uh you should thank and give claps and shout outs to on Twitter or wherever or or any other social media where you can or at an event if you if you see them um but uh we have been uh doing well in terms of getting some grants uh and institutional support thanks to large part to to their efforts um and um but we could we need more and one of the things that I think that I really want to talk about here um and let me find this by going to medium.com processing foundation and first of all check out create canvas this is the kind of thing you're also supporting this is a wonderful new podcast called create canvas that's been spearheaded by uh saber con the uh education Community uh manager for the processing foundation and Johanna Heda who's the director of advocacy I hope I'm getting these people's titles correct um and Sharon Del delar Cruz is a former processing Foundation fellow for actually former student at ITP where I teach but that's a separate thing um she is absolutely amazing and wonderful learn more about her work support but this is what I really want to highlight for you if you haven't uh if you know maybe you're just you want to just pay you're glued the screen to see me really poorly play the ukulele um but but um if you if you could after this is over uh or now if you want to take a break because what am I doing but nonsense um take the time to read this full article seven minutes out of your life to understand uh and the thought process and the goals for the future of the P5 GS project we would really like the P I would really like the P5 Jaz project to continue and I think a model um there's you know burnout is a thing that happens in a wide variety of communities and careers and uh all sorts of efforts from work rated activism related um you hear about it with like content creators on YouTube I think o burnout in open source is a thing that I have felt maybe you're watching this have felt if you're leading a project um how do you uh and and there is a time where you want to just fully immerse and put yourself into that project but you also need a break how can a project really build itself for the long term and I think one way of doing that that Lauren uh speaks to in this article is a rotating model of leadership so um there's more to it than that and there's lots of information about the history and people to thank in within this article that I would um highly recommend that you read through I would um take a look at our community statement um but uh so I think what our goal and I think I can find it somewhere here is to um I'm just going to talk about it I'm not going to scroll through this article for you but um is to have a rotating model of leadership so what if there were somebody who' come on board and paid their work valued and acknowledged through being paid to lead the Project Lead the um open source software the community for a year um and have that person then transition into a mentoring role for a new person to rotate that there's so many benefits to that in terms of bringing in more voices sustaining over the long term but that's going to require more money than uh we've been able to raise or have in the past so please uh I'm a little out of focus I for thank you mat for not I forgot to focus the camera so that you should always tell me that I'm going to fix that and then I also just remembered I don't think I'm recording to dis so I just now I just now I completely I've forgotten all of my usual thing I'm so so enthused about this fundraising that I didn't even focus the camera although to be honest I look a little better with a soft focus don't you think um hold on Multi quarter go okay I am recording everything to disk now minimize that um hi from Brooklyn says saber Sabra is in the chat hi to Ala um and let me fix this C let me fix uh the camera so um I'm going to use my uh focusing device which is this you know one of these days I'll uh actually do these live streams with another person in this room but I'm put this here that's a good spot to focus on I think we might be ready for our Jingle Bells to thank our donors I'm gonna Focus there so much better there we go I focus the camera and here we are by the way I am going to do some coating today I don't know how much uh where are we how come I can't see like a running tally so let me go over let's at least go here and let's see if there's anybody to uh thank so I'm going to I think if I just go down oh I want to talk about these gifts okay ah so first let me thank uh oh look at this Gregor so an Vincent um I I'm just gonna thank everybody that's on here right now it's not so many that I can't Jesse Louie Rosenberg dimma Derek Barrel suun Douglas Alvaro Philipe eron hi eron Elliot Anonymous uh Anthony Thomas uh I wish that I was capable of reading this but thank you Jean G Nicholas Andrew Michelle Clayton Z deac Gabriel jels olich Neils Vincent and Gregor now look at this this is a wonderful a very generous donation uh donated Revenue by the WIP GitHub app this is not something I'm familiar with but I'm definitely going to take a look um H at that um that's a wonderful thing that you can do uh one thing that you can do if you are not a able to donate yourself but maybe you're affiliated with an institution perhaps you're a student somewhere are you a student somewhere and your school is teaching with processing or P5 did you know that your school could make a donation your school probably has like a really big budget for software licenses and they spend it on lots of stuff which they need and they should spend it on that but they should also give some of that to the processing Foundation um and one way actually that they can do that is and be in touch with the processing foundation on social media or just to me Direct I think there's people in the chat who can help you right now we have an invoice generator so if your school or institution needs an invoice as if they're paying for something we can create that ultimately it's it's a donation but we can create an invoice for you if you need that um paperwork so and then thank you to Ste uh Muller Hansen uh who uh we is the how's the focus now is it better um who uh been talking about something to do with uh graphic design and the coding train that might be coming in the future um thank you for this donation I'm gonna hit refresh come on people um I want to see new donations here I want to see some new donations here people the phones are ringing they're not ringing don't make me oh wait no no no no there is a new donation Brett Cooper thank you to Brett Cooper M thank you for your donation that deserves are coding train Jingle Bells what's the chance that there's like a poll request or an issue with the co cords no no all that time people were posting it all in the chat over and over again but nobody put it here for me to see come on people uh help me out here like gotta be C and G you know basic stuff right all right I'm going to make this happen cing train coding all the waying all the waying train cing train cing all the way way way oh it's just all C something like that right cing train cing train this coding train when I code I use node and JavaScript every day coding train coding train this do coding train when I code I use node and JavaScript every day oh no Danos solvin $50 for the proing foundation thank you thank you to Danos solvin he's kind of in charge of me I might be getting in trouble for what I'm doing right now I don't think so it's very hard to get in trouble with that Thanos Sullivan I've really tried I try I try if only I could just get fired from this ITP job I could spend so much time making these videos all right thank you that deserves perhaps another holiday tune but I think maybe I'm too embarrassed to move on let's start thinking about some code stuff that we could do that was by the way without really knowing what the chords were I'm sure I got it wrong but uh I appreciate your efforts everybody all right uh let's see where we how do I get this running total um I there must be a way for me to do that uh okay ah 340 I do actually see does it refresh automatically it's just higher up on my screen over here I'm over here people by the way so by the way the theme as it always is first of all let me just mention again Maro um who uh works at Google and who um I met last year doing a a video with uh mpj from fun fun function um Maro spent a whole weekend making this sweater which is just like the most wonderful thing I could ever imagine anybody doing for me um and I love it so much the last time I wore it was last year uh if I could get my act together if it wasn't this whole like semester thing and lots of stuff to do I would spend some more time getting ready for this really all I did was start last night um um but maybe next year I'll I get I'll get a new sweater um but uh thank you for that I have some snowflakes here which has always been the theme so today I think I this is my plan by the way what I'm going to en code and thank you to Violet Graham who um uh who H um uh has been uh helping me with would maintain a lot of the GitHub repos uh Violet had this excellent idea of of generating snowflakes and then training a style Gan model to generate new snowflakes and I'm going to do that with a tool called Runway uh thank you to Ellen Nichols who has been giving me some help and advice about that in the last 24 hours so I'm gon to um that's what's going to happen today it's been a half an hour and I haven't touched the computer really yet so we'll see I mean I could go I I at some point I got to got to be off for the holidays myself this is like my I got to turn in some grades still but other than that I answer some emails today is my last day of work for a little while I'm going to definitely take a break after today oh if let me just quickly mention if you didn't catch the ITP uh show live stream that's also on the channel uh lots of wonderful work by students many of whom are using processing and P5 and these tools um and uh check that out but I'm going to make a nice edited version it's three and a half hours I'm make a nice edited version of that that will come out soon as well all right um okay we've got $344 coming in this is good I want to get to $1,000 I'm not leaving till at that number says $1,000 although that might encourage you not to donate so that I stay here forever I'm gonna leave if that number doesn't keep going up that's what I have to say all right uh get going on some first still sitting here for let me briefly mention also um the YouTube fundraiser if you make YouTube videos or if you know somebody who makes YouTube videos that or you know anybody really can but especially if they're in this world of math and science and creative coach an art um who might want to participate in this fundraiser um oh thank you uh gruel house is mentioning starting to work on the holiday songs oh the music is too loud okay sorry about that better I need it to be loud for my own enthusiasm um what was I talking about this is so hard ah yes um this fundraiser can be added to other videos if you would like to make a video about the about processing P5 and have it be a it doesn't have to be a live stream it can be a recorded video I've added it to a bunch of my videos it will just show up next to the video you do need to have access to the of YouTube giving beta um so the way to check that is to go to your creator Studio go under monetization go to the giving Tab and if you have a button there that says join fundraiser then you can join this fundraiser if you have any issue I opened my direct messages on Twitter that's probably like the easiest way to get in touch with me right now but um just be in touch uh um Enrique Nelson says they donated $100 to the wall um I don't know where that came in there's too many places I'll look over uh I'm just gonna believe that that donation came in Thank You Enrique um but if just get in touch if you would like to make a video and have it be part of the processing Foundation um fundraiser okay uh so what else am I ah so yes all right ah both XP M thank you for your donation okay so uh the first order of business that I would like to do is just revisit what I made last year which was this Brownian uh motion snowflake pattern so the reason why I pull this up in processing the next thing I'm going to do I'm going to do in p5js on the web because I want people to do it along with me but what I want to see I'm just curious if I um if I can make a variety of these very quickly I want to create a data set so I want to create a data set of maybe a thousand snowflakes and so I believe that I can do this with processing because I'm going to use those thousand snowflakes to cook a style Gan snowflake machine learning model to generate new snowflakes why I don't know because it's what on my mind these days so and I like to use the word cook I like to think of machine training a machine learning model as a process of baking I wish I had like like an oven and some good props here to really like make that happen in a more uh um specific way but we're going to bake we're going to bake well first we're going to to prepare our ingredients we're going to prepare our in this is a cooking show all of a sudden we're going to prepare our ingredients so let me get rid of this full screen so this is if you want to know how this works um I was just on that page um this is the coating challenge page for the snowflake challenge that I did last holiday season you can see I'm wearing this hat what was that that was like a weird sound oh my snowflake fell oh it's so sad this snowflake which I had so nicely t taped up to the wall I'll just like bring it over here with me so sad um how how does this look by the way so um so if you want to learn more about this the people made all these wonderful versions of it here which you can take a look at um um there so what I'm going to do let me do something so to what I uh to create this snowflake so let's think about let's let's use like 512 by 512 that's kind of like a standard image resolution that a lot of um that a lot of imagebased machine learning models use a machine learning model a neural networkbased model has inputs and outputs and those are typically fixed length unless it's a sequential model um and so uh you'll often find it's 28 x 28 or 256 by 256 let's go with 512 x 512 so what I want to do is uh rewrite this program to basically automatically run multiple times and every time it runs to save the snowflake so one thing is I I don't need for it to animate so right now it's doing all of this uh how does this work while current is not finished current intersects snowflake current. update count Plus+ if count equals zero snowflake is completed so I think that I could do while count I I'm just trying I don't even remember this code that I did last year by the way you should comment your code people people people of Earth and Beyond because we all know that eventually the aliens will be watching the me and they will think I just watched the movie Galaxy Quest the other day which I love but it would wouldn't it be wonderful if I don't know maybe this is this is a bad idea I'm not representative of Earth but I was just thinking that the aliens of the future will learn to code in processing from me and think and remember think of our culture as being something there all right so uh so I want the whole thing to appear at once so I think I can just instead of having it stop turn off when count is zero I can just do a while loop while count does not equal zero do all of this stuff I hope this works and uh oh but all of this should be oh I'm in Java people one equal sign uh then this actually should be here no no no no no this is the whole snowflake yes okay that should be there it's fine okay this doesn't seem to be working oh no wait count starts a zero oh count plus plus let's have count B one no all right I guess I have to look at the code and figure out what it did all right so what is this doing uh where if count equals zero stop so snowflake add while current is not finished and current intersects snowflake current count plus plus the particle doesn't move at all oh this is an exit condition not implemented in the video oh no I added it after the fact someone's going to help me out here who remembers this better than me current show show all this I six uh this is uh current equals new particle I don't understand where where did my manipulating count oh oh I get it oh I see I see okay I got a better idea let's just do this Boolean snowflake finished is false while snowflake is not finished count equals Zer so this is just checking like is it going and if count is still zero after it's checking all this stuff then you're done so then I'm going to say this not no Loop I'm just going to say snowflake finished equals um false equals true must have spelled this wrong ah and then actually oh and then I could just draw it afterwards like only need to update I don't need to draw it all the time I see so this is the algorithm for because I'm am I erasing the background or no well let's put it in here just in case this should work interesting I got the 6 point count minus minus not count Plus plus I don't think that's what's going on but thank you Simon um so this is just checking to see if there's something not finished oh but there's no oh it finished immediately because um I don't have a first snowflake yeah I need to uh snowflake add current I think I think I need to do that this is not going well all right hold on hold on a second people what's going on okay um here hold on I need to think let's go back to let's go back to the beginning King all right so I see so count is counting how long it takes for a particular particle to um for how long it takes for a particular particle to intersect an existing part of the snowflake so we can see so when there's a new particle and it and it doesn't um intersect anymore then um then the snowflake is done so I'm just curious here what if I take um scale one one oh this is what if I take this whole thing I'm just curious to understand this and put it here and just draw it only when the snowflake is completed okay so this is what I'm trying to do I want to just create the snowflake all at once when it's done so this is so this there's no reason why and this should be able to this should be able to go here okay that still works so I should be able to do this over and over again and this is part of drawing it one more try here here all right that's part of drawing all right there's no reason why I couldn't have this happen multiple times right while not finished do this over and over again and if count equals zero finished is true finished is false this should work right right what's my Lo what's wrong with my logic here if the idea is just to like do this a whole bunch of times um uh and this this should still be the same thing and then I don't need this if statement anymore I'm just going to draw it at the end of draw there we go I don't know what I was doing wrong before but this is what I wanted okay this is what I wanted this is what I wanted now what I should be able to do is when I'm done I should be able to clear everything so what are all the things that happen at the beginning so let's make a function called reset snowflake we'll call that here after it draws I'm going to say reset snowflake um oh I don't say function oh I my sound effects are not available to me in the same way this should be void okay now do I still have a no Loop in there okay take out the no Loop take out print line snowflake completed we should see this there we go I am now making many many snowflakes the other thing I want to do is I think I want the whole thing to be rotated by some random angle so I'm actually going to change this to random to high right so this now is generating snowflakes and I should be able to say uh save frame uh snowflakes snowflake and by the way if you don't know about this in processing if you use the save frame function and use these hash symbols the pound symbols um you we'll autonumber the files for you so if I do this we should be getting a whole lot of snowflakes now is there a way that I might want to make these have more variety or is this good enough what do we I can't stop clicking through them um is this what do we think I mean I could give them different colors I like I mean snowflakes they are white if they're actual snowflakes but I suppose I could give them a random color um so what I could do is and where where does everything get that's color it does here Phil stroke so let me say color mode HSB um I I don't remember what the defaults are but I think if I just say 256 it'll make everything within 0 to 255 so then I could say uh I just want a random Hue random Hue is some random number between zero and 255 what this always makes me crazy if I want if I want I guess if if I want an integer between zero and 255 then I would give my random the maximum 256 but this gives me a floating point I think 255 should go in here because I'm not changing it from a float to an INT um and then I just want full brightness and saturation oh wait no no no oh wait what's this GNA do oh this is not what I meant to do I meant to pick a single uh color so let's do this so this is going to be a single color for all the particles and we'll pick it we will pick it uh right here right before we create the Snowflake and then and then we can just put this in everywhere so now I'm also making them different colors all right um so this is good I'm gonna let this run for a little bit there's probably some ways that I can tweak this particular algorithm to get a lot more variety out of what I'm creating but let's just see I would like to get about 2,000 snowflakes so I really should be keeping track of the frame count but one way to do that is just sort of see where we are so while I'm creating these snowflakes oh wow we're already actually we're already quite far along I think it might be time for a song have we had any donations come in let me see if I can look here total raise 396 I'm going to refresh I think it updates automatically um let's go to wow I I really would like to get to $1,000 today people I'm going to match all donations up to $1,000 oh I didn't talk about about the rewards that you can get okay this is a good moment to pause for a second okay but let's stop this stop this craziness here we probably have enough snowflakes now wait did it stop did I stop it hold on hold on everybody let's just start over let's be methodical about this I'm going to say if frame count equals 2,000 uh no Loop okay so now this should give me 2,000 snowflakes and Danielle is writing in the chat you can never have enough snowflakes and I could not agree more while we're doing that let me go to to the donor box page so if you just tuned in um if you just tuned in this uh live stream that you're watching is a fundraiser for the processing Foundation support P5 is the hashtag I talked a lot about why we're raising money what the money goes to and why you should give or advocate for your institution to give um to the processing Foundation um but what I fail to mention is that at the different levels um you can you'll get a giveaway a present um and maybe aha maybe you maybe you need a holiday present for a friend or family member a loved one um and you don't have anything for them guess what you could do I mean they're gonna it's going to take a while for you to get it but you could you could gift them the the re the you could gift them the future thing that's going to come from your donation you could make a donation in honor of somebody and give them the giveaway as part of your holiday gift somebody should really fire me from this job instantly the donations are just coming in I I need a only I should have gotten a telephone ringing sound effect that would have been good all right um so uh what so okay so first of all if you want the giveaway please donate through the donor box URL that's in this video's description it's there in the first line um it you please donate through YouTube as well if that's an easy thing for you to do especially if you just want to make a small donation of five $1 $5 $10 any amount is welcome but uh we don't have a way of tracking of getting your information if you donate through YouTube so if you want one of the giveaways donate through here let me talk to you about the tiers at the variables level of a donation of $25 you will receive a sticker pack maybe there'll even be a coding train sticker in there I don't know there could be there could be but you'll get a P5 and a pro processing sticker and and whatever other stickers are in there at the objects level your donation of $50 will get you a sticker pack and your choice of one of three Riso Prince by the created by the artist Maya man so let's see if I click here let's go to Maya man's website um and this I believe that the Riso prints are based off of this work Maya man is a dancer and creative coder amongst an artist many other things I'm sure if we find Maya on Twitter I believe she was posting like some of the documentation of the Riso prints um so let's see if we look on Twitter here yes so these are what the prints will look like um I don't know too much about Riso printing but apparently it's like a really cool new thing that people are doing there's even a P5 Library called is how they were created so using P5 or processing uh to track her body as dancing and then keep track of it over time and then paint layers of different movements it is just absolutely beautiful wonderful work um and to be honest this is why I want to match everybody's donations up to $1,000 doar I would like to have all these artworks myself um okay so um so that's Maya's work at the um $50 level if you go to the uh $100 level you will get fine art prints of an artwork called computer Visions 2019 by Kate hollenbach let me go to Kate hollenbach's uh website if you're not familiar with her art she's based in Chicago and Los Angeles um she's an educator an artist a a bigtime contributor to the P5 library has done fellowships and mentoring and Google summer of code projects um oh Zachary MacArthur thank you Zachary MacArthur uh $10 donation thank you so much um and so uh Kate has created um this work called computer Visions um and you will get a fine art print of that um oh oh also at this level you will get do I have the oh that's like a very ominous sound effect you will at um the coding train Zen so Sai the coding train Community manager who has been working on the coding train since the summer who helps out with all sorts of things like um social media and getting people I have like patreon and all that kind of nonsense and getting people their rewards for that and YouTube membership that's not what today is about but thank you so much to SAI for all of their work uh keeping the community afloat um I've been thrilled to have sii's uh help and and thoughtfulness um but Sai also had the idea of creating a Zen uh to contribute to the processing Foundation fundraiser so this is completely designed and created by Sai um and it has pages about some of the coding challenges with the accompanying source code and I we're going to print these I'm going to sign them and you will get that um as a a as part as a gift as part of your donation um along with this uh conditionals level at the uh make sure I'm getting this right $100 donation then the loops level you will also get uh these are just so awesome A A Fine Art print sorry uh trip tick of fine art prints by Sasuke freck who if you don't follow on I don't know Twitter or Instagram uh Sasuke makes daily artworks um these look these are all things 2018 oh I wonder if saskia will have an all things 2019 I have never gotten myself to managed to do one of these things um code bulletin is asking is shipping international yes so for I I um the the shipping for all of these uh gifts is for anyone anywhere in the world um uh you can write to Dorothy processing.org to confirm that um or info I think Foundation processing.org also goes to Dorothy um just to confirm that I don't know if Dorothy is watching to confirm that but it's certainly Our intention to send these gifts to anyone who donates anywhere in the world so um Sasa has been working on these daily uh animations and artworks and geometric uh patterns for it looks like since uh 2015 there's some wonderful um talks about Sasuke's work on the internet that you can find um and with the um the loops level where am I here you will get a a tripti on these fine art prints of saskia's uh work that you can see here and then um at the arrays level donations of $1,000 and up will receive a sticker pack all of the prints uh high resolution videos of mayam man's performance and the coding train Zen which is what you all want that coding train Zen it's going to be like paper with some pictures on it but it's special um so that's uh that's my plug if you if you're interested in these giveaways please write to Foundation processing.org uh reach out to processing on social media um but the the donations should go through this uh donor box uh website um and we will now hit refresh I see there's a new donation enrio oh so t uh Tam tanoy in the chat is saying how can I donate it says sorry you can't donate so I think um that um the do YouTube donation feature is not available for all regions but you should be able to donate at this URL which um I don't if someone could post it into the chat that would be great but it's it's in this video's description donorbox.org support pf21 nf fundraising campaign advice don't join me if I say hi give a donation to the processing Foundation all right I will say hi and but you know let's let's try to live in a world where we don't try to negotiate and hold people Hostage to their social interactions online let's all just be as friendly as I'm not saying that's what you were doing um so samarth once again those of you are saying you can't donate please um um go to the donorbox uh.org link and uh enrio is one person I'm going to thank with a song and we're going to see if there's anyone else this is a very long stair drop the telephone is ringing enrio thank you oh you're thankful for P5 Android Java and JS that you use so often whether as a playful tool or making scientific research it is great software thank you enrio and I will now treat enrio to a song let's see here let's see what's seven minutes ago refactoring all the way since this was done seven minutes ago let's try this one oh we've got the chords okay all right this is this song goes out to enrio and everybody else who's donated to the processing Foundation dashing through the code dashing through the code in the processing ID through the lines we go factoring all the waybe I'm the wrong key way way way code is way too long long making functions tight what fun it is to make long coat a handful of lines handful of lines tonight oh refactoring refactoring refactoring all the way oh what fun it is to use you it it is to use what's the D chord use four Loops everywhere hey ref factoring ref factoring ref factoring all the way code is oh so short now with iterations and array that doesn't sound right refactoring refactoring refactoring all the way oh what fun it is to you you four Loops everywhere factoring factoring factoring all the way code is so short now short now with iterations and array oh chat you're going off the rails all right um all right thank you to everyone who's donated let's see if that song inspired some new donations we're up to 46 uh dollars on the YouTube fundraiser and we're going to go to donor box again and wherever that page is we're gonna hit refresh Nico another donation from Nico thank you so much appreciate it okay let's go check our data set and I'm going to open up something called Runway and I'm going to train a style Gan model woo this is going to be fun all of you have been waiting for this uh okay so let's check this did this actually end I hope this ended we've got our data set of snowflakes are there 2,000 of them there certainly are um so I'm going to now go to a tool called Runway Runway is not um Affiliated I mean Runway is not uh a project from the processing Foundation it certainly is Affiliated I would say in that it is a uh software tool for the creative arts and in fact let me um there are a lot let me let me go to um the runway GitHub for a second Runway ml uh GitHub um because there is a uh processing Library there is a Runway ml for processing library that created by George um let me find um his information here on GitHub um I think if we go to uh the commit the what where where do you do this on this GitHub um three contributors uh the so orus on uh GitHub is the creator of this Library um Ellen and and Chris Valenzuela are from Runway ml um and so maybe I'll use this Library I'm more likely going to do what I'm going to do in P5 but either way um um there's and there are also if on the runway uh website there are um p5js uh examples to work with Runway so if you want so processing in P5 exist as tools that work with a variety of other things that are things that cost money Runway an example of them you can use a pro I always like making stuff in processing and opening in Photoshop I like to just use Adobe Creative Cloud as the catch all example because it's a thing that people pay for and it's expensive and a lot of people can't afford it and so we don't want that to be the thing for processing but if you can uh you should think about contributing and donating to processing the same way you might pay for something like um Adobe Creative Cloud um and Jack TR7 which is my daughter's roller derby number Junior Gotham girls junior roller derby little shout out plug for them uh uh thank you for your donation of $20 um all right so Runway uh thank you to Ellen and Chris and I'll also mention again this is a fundraiser for the processing foundation so I hesitate to uh mix up too many other things here but I do want to mention that if you want to follow along and try what I'm doing um I have a coupon code for you that will unlock this feature that I'm going to show you is a training uh training a model in Runway which is not available if you just go download Runway itself um but this coupon code let me just find it here in my messages if you'll give me a second on my secondary computer uh I'm looking for my messages ah here we go ah okay coding trainer all caps coding trainer all in caps um I can type this into the chat this uh will give you some free GPU credits um you know if you want to find out about what Runway is and how it works I've made some video tutorials about it that are on my channel I'm sure if you just search coding train Runway ml you'll find them also Runway has their own so I'm not going to uh spend too much time on that today I will be in January I have a lot of plans to do some like proper tutorials about this stuff today I'm just going to like poke around but if you want to attempt this training feature um you can use that coupon and it will provide let me just read what um Ellen sent me from Runway this code will provide $10 in GPU credits and access to the training feature if you don't already have it in their account if they already have training access you still get the free $10 access to training comes with one free training experiment okay uh all right let me turn this music off um and now so what I want to do is you can see by the way I've already trained a snowman case snowman style Gan and a Santa Style Gan these are quite disturbing perhaps but you know what are you g to do um but I am now going to go to training and I'm going to create a training experiment and we're going to call this Brownian snowflakes processing Foundation okay we're going to create this all right now you can see all my data sets in here trying weird things with like Thanksgiving turkeys I'm a little bit obsessed with I trained a style Gan on all the number file thumbnails uh okay so I'm gonna do this and then I'm going to go to my where did I have that probably in downloads where's my data my data I should talk about what style again is a little bit which I will do in a second um where is this uh downloads processing okay yeah that's where it is processing snowflakes open this up it's now so it's uploading my data set so let's talk a little bit for a moment about what uh what style Gan is so you can see all my images are there it's 95 megabytes 2,000 files so style Gan uh and I'm going to go to the browse models and I'm going to search stylegan and I'm going to go here style Gan is a generative model it's a machine learning model that will generate photorealistic images of faces Landscapes and more uh in Runway you can find um the original research paper and the GitHub repo here um there's a little paragraph about it um and um a gallery of things that people have made and the license all that sort of stuff so um I would like to in January come back and do a tutorial about what a gener adversarial network is and how it works the short version of that uh is that it's actually two neural networks one is trying to make so think about the snowflakes if we it's like if you if we had if there were two of us here and I'm trying to draw snowflakes and then then another person here I'll use my hats this is how I'm going to explain this is the generator so a generative adversarial network has a generator and uh discriminator Somebody by the way I'm recording this as green screen footage maybe somebody will like take my explanation here and animate around it which would be ridiculous um so the generator is trying to make snowflakes I'm over here making the snowflakes I'm a neural network that makes stuff making snowflakes and then the discriminator says that does not look like a snowflake to me and that's the that's basically Bally an error and then the generator it's like oh I'm going to take that eror and trying to make you more snowflakes more snowflakes and discriminator at some point the discriminator at some point the discriminator has access to what real snowflakes look like and at some point that discriminator is not going to be able to tell anymore the distinction between a real snowflake and a snowflake generated by the generator and then the model is done that is the is trained so um style Gan has a particular kind of architecture for a generative adversarial Network um you know it's quite well known for uh generating human faces that aren't of real people it's kind of that I think that could be problematic actually and there's a lot of uh I think critical discussion to have around what it means for a model to generate a face of a somebody that looks like it could be a real person on this Earth and who's left out of that equation what data was used and do did people give their consent to their faces being used to train so there's a lot of stuff to discuss about style Gan there but um we can have some fun with it and instead of using it to train um what you might typically see faces Landscapes we can actually generate abstract patterns from processing make a data set and then train the model um and so Runway U you know is really the the one of the first examples of a software application that lets you do this with a user interface traino model so I'm going to click next now here's an interesting thing I need a starting I need a starting model so um this is this is like transfer learning in the sense that we're taking a pretrained style Gan model that knows how to generate something like faces or portraits or bedrooms and then it's going to that's going to be the snowflakes and it's going to keep making adjustments till it looks more like snowflakes I think these flowers would probably work well as a base model that's just a guess um let's train let's just train for about an hour this is the baking we're going to bake this model I have a don't worry I have another oven with one premade actually I didn't do the snowflakes so we're going to bake this model uh we're going to let it go 1500 training steps and by the way don't don't be misled this if you're using Runway this does cost money although uh you you know if you want to train one model you can do that for free uh start training so I'm going to start training the experiment is starting and it can take a few minutes um I'm going to just uh the the nice thing is here I can close or use this app normally I'm just going to minimize Runway maybe I'll quit it I think I'll just quit it we'll come back to it okay and we're gonna see maybe we'll do another song um and see uh see if we can get some more donations all right what am I looking for here all right so we've got we're up to $432 on YouTube which is pretty awesome thank you everybody um I think it's just and now we are Nico was our last donation here on donorbox I don't think I missed any coming in on YouTube please let me know if I did if there's another donation I'll be singing another song oh whoa Patrick stepan and Ma Blanchette Mata if you don't all know you should be thanking Mata for all the videos that you've watched in the last I don't know how many years now it's crazy Mata does all the editing for the coding train and you might have noticed that it's really upped upped his game and we have a lot more stuff that's happening now with new technology and better editing techniques and so even though these live streams are just live streams a lot of times we'll take what happened to live stream and repackage it and make it more clear and fix errors and that kind of stuff so um thank you matio for your donation and thank you to Patrick step on this song goes out to Patrick and ma uh what song will I do now now that it's 1120 I was going to just do this till noon we might go a little past that I'm getting a little I need a break um all right let's see what's been recently updated 17 minutes ago 17 hours 31 minutes coding train Jingle Bells this dot this came in I think this was um this was also from I believe uh um All I Want For All I Want For code to run I don't need a lot for coding this this is another is this the same song um I don't know um but I'm going to go do the one that has the chords maybe it's better for me to just uh oops have this behind me I don't know it does say starting soon guess I should have one that doesn't say starting soon oh there's some chords here I don't know oh Jingle Bell Rock somebody that's a good song somebody should write me some lyrics for that all I want oh no wait all I want for Christmas is you is a different song no that's the same song I don't want yeah yeah there's also last Christmas that's the Wham song three years says MAA that's crazy so B7 is this that's a chord I don't know E minor that's one one that I do know E7 do I need to tune I should probably tune okay this one's a hard one Let's uh let's let's have this be tuned if only I could code my own ukulele tuner I don't I don't want I don't want this dot for Christmas there is just one I don't know what the melody is far I need I don't care about the syntax or the wasted memory oh yeah I did this last year I remember this now I just want my sketch to play more than you could ever say let's try let's try Java mode all I want for Christmas is I don't want this dot for Christmas there is just one boo and I need I'm just going to keep on looping until I run out of memory I won't make a link list and send it without the use of websocket I won't even stay awake this is calleda speak singing try debugging with an i e I just want my I just want my code to sing more than you want machine learning maybe it'll maybe it'll work with node no that's not right maybe it'll work with node I have the CHS wrong this is really a hard one all I want for Christmas is cold yeah cck pares check the right Melody on YouTube it will be fun that song went out to uh all the people who just donated this is what I was looking at by the way look for it without lyrics version and play guitar to it okay people are giving me some good suggestions well I tried I think I should do this Jingle Bell Rock I think this would be a good one for me anybody have any lyrics for Jingle Bell Rock maybe I can make some up factoring refactoring refactoring Rock I'm going to make them up on the on the spot factoring Rock and ref factoring Rock factoring ref factoring we factoring factoring now the debugging has begun debugging debugging debugging Rock debugging and the debugging time factoring and debugging refactoring debugging in the coding train what a bright time it's the right time to refactor the code away debugging time is a swell time to go fixing up the no pointer exception gy up gy up or factor comment your code comment it all the time time mix and mingle and refactor your code that's the refactoring Wait no that's the refactoring Rock that's the debugging that's the debuging that's the debuging thank you made up on the spot I want to transcribe that and make some better lyrics I'll do it again feel like that's like a good one I know all those chords also Last Christmas by Wham that that would be a good one to do the 12 days of coding yeah I should definitely do the I think think that'll come we we'll do that at the end that'll be the grand salami as I like to say Grand Finale okay also I brought my 5x5 Rubik's Cube which I could attempt to solve that could be something to do let take a break okay it's getting warm in here 77 degrees I've I've I'm on my uh holiday break and I've gone to Florida with my my sweater apparently because it's so hot in here please fix the air someday someday I'm going to have a place where I can live stream where the air is cool oh let's check on our uh baking our model I'm going to check how our model is doing all right so our model has gone 100 steps it started as flowers we can see this is what it generated this is a random assortment of flowers that the style Gan model generated and we can see uh what it's at now do you see the snowflakes coming in it's starting to change right this was a beginning and now up to here so we we're going to definitely need a lot more steps it's just 110 steps this is going to take quite a while 41 minutes remaining well going to have to be here for at least 41 more minutes all right I am now going to do a coating challenge thank you to Violet for this idea I always like to do something with snowflakes and I thought that would be impossible because I had done too many snowflake things oh I should let's take a look at what's so this is my idea was holiday style again that's what we're doing coding challenge tellan idea optimization of Santa's gift wrapping Department that's fascinating oh that was from last year so these are are all the ones that have been suggested recently although some more might have come in that weren't tagged holiday Telethon because you if you're submitting you can't tag it yourself um so I guess I could just go back and take off the label but there aren't any anyway um so falling snowflake with realistic physics this uh comes from uh Chris orbon of the stem coding YouTube channel that you should definitely check out um and um here's a code with a falling snowflake that has re realistic physics Let's Take a Look So This what I love about the stem coding YouTube channel is and I I I don't it's very similar to what I do in that and with the nature of code book and materials where I will take ideas from physics and apply them to animations and code examples but I don't do them with a lot of rigor I just kind of you know Tinker and kind of use in inspired by the ideas and kind of try to create the illusion of something happening in physics but stem coding as a sciencebased channel it's you know primary purpose in I don't maybe not primary purpose but a main purpose is to teach the science through the lens of coding and simulation so the terminology and the accuracy is much more true to the science itself and you can see here this idea of a snowflake falling with a certain amount of forces and visualizing all the vectors I do believe falling snowflakes uh coating challenge that I do have uh snowfall that I did make this coating Challenge on another holiday I used to use a keyboard which I'm actually quite a bit better at playing the piano than ukulele so maybe I should do that we we can look at the live demo of this to see what it looks like um so this is what I made a bunch of years ago you can see I think this is just using pearlin noise for the motion of the snowflakes not realistic physics I'm not a physics engine like uh can kananelo in the chat is suggesting matter. JS another open source library that you might want to support um but I did make this uh project so um you could go back and check through that Violet is in the chat now hello Violet um thank you for helping with maintaining the repositories um okay but I am going to go to Violet's suggestion and look at this snowflake Kaleidoscope sketch so I have explored a lot of different ways to create snowflakes you saw the brownie in motion example I used uh something called sketch RNN which is also a machine learning model trained off of drawings the Google Quick Draw data set to generate snowflakes um I think there's probably some other ones that I'm forgetting um but another one another way to create a snowflake is to let uh a a user draw and just tile that pattern now this is more than sixfold symmetry I believe the uh a snowflake should have it sixfold symmetry this isn't this is just a kaleidoscope painter so this isn't trying to be a snowflake so I think I could make a version of something like this that allows the the viewer the user the person the human being operating the computer trying to avoid using this word user um to uh draw a snowflake so maybe we'll try to make something like this now I always hesitate to make things that are Recreations of somebody else's work so one thing I'll just do here since this is being inspired by um um somebody who runs a website called perot.com let's just go to the main URL um I encourage it looks like the collidoscope painter and lots of other uh kinds of activities and apps and tutorials so there's even tutorials and things around o rayc casting Source coded demos check all this stuff out lots of stuff there and you can support I mean I know this is a processing Foundation fundraiser so so I hesitate to mention other things but since I'm going to base my idea off of what's come here I think it's important to mention that they do have a link down here uh support me on Kofi so someone will remind me in the slack channel to after this is over for me to make sure and I go uh donate there because I'm GNA uh be using it as part of my uh inspiration all right so I want to do this with P5 I'm going to use the P5 web editor and if you want to see me in the next year continue to do c videos and coding tutorials I mean it's a lot of you support me and I um I'm very lucky to have this uh audience on YouTube and um it's it's um allowed me to do a lot of things and um I'm really grateful but it would not be possible without the work of the processing Foundation uh the p5js library the processing project so uh you know it's not just gonna I'm not just going to keep doing this if these projects don't exist so uh that's why you should uh donate um okay so I'm going to try to make a kaleidoscope snowflake in P5 by drawing and that you know so I wasn't thinking that I would have anything edited come out of this live stream but because I can have an edited video also like reup the fundraiser um I think maybe I'm going to now do the weird thing where I act as if I'm in a brand new video because we'll sort of edit this later so um so yes but first I really want to solve my 5x five Rubik Cube because I learned how to do it takes me quite a while though um just check in $432 people I want to see some I want to see that number up I want to see it but up to 500 at least by the time oh neon animus donated $20 um Zachary MacArthur is asking how are the processing foundation and p5js connected thank you for asking that um so the p5js project is is maintained by the pro the processing Foundation is the legal entity that maintains the open source p5js project processing Foundation does a lot of other things too other projects processing python processing processing for the Raspberry Pi processing for Android a bunch of software projects as well as many educational initiatives fellowship program events processing Community which is something I should mention but um but uh the so what we would like to do as part of what we're fundraising for for is hire someone to be the open source maintainer the lead maintainer of P5 for 2020 I like to say processing 2020 vote for processing in 2020 um and so it's it's not a given that P5 is going to is is going to continue being developed uh we need uh we need funds to be able to pay people to continue that work okay um Francesco is asking what is the processing foundation so let me point you to uh processing foundation.org this is URL where you can read more um you know since people are just joining I will just reup some of these links uh would if you want to know about why we're raising money for the future of P5 amongst many other things um this article by Lauren McCarthy making space for the future of p5js is a must read okay let me close a lot of these URLs and links oops just to kind of clean stuff up here and okay so I'm going to do Kaleidoscope snowflake okay $452 thank you neon an anims for your donation train whistle for you I'm actually just going to take a short break to get some water since I think I'm going to go past noon I think now would be actually before I do this coding example um let me take a short break and hope that um some donations come in oh well let me answer this other last question can I work for processing for free so you know work for I think we could we could have a bunch of different discussions about what that means but let me rephrase that question can I volunteer for the procing foundation absolutely it's very it's complicated with these kinds of projects because there is a volunteer Spirit to them and there is a lot of people who contribute um through uh through online uh tools like a GitHub through the processing Forum by answering people's questions by teaching workshops in their communities those are all contributions to the processing Foundation a lot of people do that work volunteer that work and and don't get a lot of credit for it so number one is we we would like to do from the processing Foundation I think I can say that we would like to make sure people are getting credit for those kinds of contributions so please reach out if you are doing things in your community with processing and p5js and other related tools um Foundation processing.org is the email you can write to and processing org on Twitter and various other social media platforms um Marcus Whitley 20 pounds UK pounds um thank you for your donation and so of course the idea of raising money to hire people to work on processing MP5 is not to the exclusion of people who have the ability and privilege to donate and volunteer their time and that it's all part of the ecosystem of an open source project like processing and p5js but somebody needs to be for a pro for a project the scale of P5 to continue uh there needs to be somebody in a leadership position who has given the time and space and funding to be able to make decisions and help manage um and answer questions to all the people who are volunteering and contributing in other ways and that's what we're really raising money for um in addition to smaller uh projects that are funded through like the fellowships and by the way I I think the deadline passed oh the deadline's today uh to apply for the processing uh the fellowship right open call for 2020 oh no the deadline was yesterday you know maybe you can ask if we'll accept a late application but this this also is funded through we we've been lucky enough to have grants for programs like the fellowship um Google summer of code uh is a program that supports processing and P5 development quite a bit but that needs even Google summer of code where students are paid a quite a good stipend I think to work on an open source contribution over the summer and mentors are paid a stipend all funded through Google it still needs the administration of the processing Foundation somebody who's the lead maintainer of the project to really uh to help um you know set people up for Success so people can volunteer for an open source project but if nobody's there to hear their volunteering and to answer their questions and to Mentor them the things things can go and and I've and we've made this mistake and I've made this mistake personally to not be there for somebody who is uh wants to contribute and for have them for them not to feel good about it and so that's really what um we need to um allocate time resources and funding to okay I'm going to take a short break um and just to get some water and then I'm going to do this uh coding example for for e all right sorry everybody I had a little a little bit of technical difficulties there I had to refocus the camera U but I'm back thank you for break we're are now I know I eventually I'll get another one that says like intermission or back soon but we're now ready for part two time for the my kids were very like you better bring those hats home don't leave those at work they want to wear these all weekend these are my kids Fanta hats okay how we doing donations wise everybody Timothy thank you Timothy thank you for your donation I love processing in tools like P5 J they are so fun to use and create stuff with your donation is very much appreciate oh we've got some more donations coming in a Al 2.0 Brockman who also joined as a member of the coding trade thank you thank you for that uh and thank you for your donation to the uh processing Foundation um okay now let us take a moment to uh check on our style Gan model oo okay you can see we're up to 796 steps there's this thing called FID score which is uh kind of a score the lower it gets I forgot what it stands for FID um fliche Inception distance measures the visual similarity between the generate images from the model and images from the original data set so let's go and move along here and see what are we getting to O there's starting to look more like snowflakes yeah there we go so we're at 810 steps and look what our style can model has generated fascinating okay we've got something that's like closer to snowflakes we're going to get all the way to 1500 steps maybe we'll let it go even further we shall see um okay I wonder if a larger training because the one thing about how generating the data data set generating the training images from processing it would have been just as easy me for for me to generate 10,000 as it was 2,000 at a certain point I'd run out of hard drive space or it would take long to run or but I wonder how much that um plays a role here um okay I wonder also it what you know if I had left them all one color I wonder if that would have uh kind of helped but we'll see we'll see okay I'm going to minimize this um I never know like how much I should go with the singing versus the coding I mean I should really generally go with the coding but today is the one day out of the year that I will just completely allow myself to well well I guess I do this all the time um now Al 2.0 Brockman donated more 20 thank you very much um so I think I should try to make this coding example now um right yes okay yes right I will just mention that if you would like to submit lyrics to any of these songs feliss Navidad that would be a great easy one to come up with some P5 processing or coding train related lyrics um that would be a good one to do um Silver Bell silent night we did let it snow already last Christmas any of these um uh goodbye I'm going to sleep says Samar uh um any of these I would love some lyrics for I've got the chords thank you to Cynthia Lynn YouTube ukulele teacher we're going to do some more uh music in a little bit all right uh let's go to um uh okay we're going to do the snowflake uh Kaleidoscope effect and uh here we go so I have no issue I have ads on things that I do and I have no problem with there being ads on this site but I sort of feel like I would prefer to well um we'll figure this out later to not have ads show up when I if I produce this as a separate video um especially for the foundation but anyway I'm going to worry about that later all right okay Zachary MacArthur donated $10 thank you Zachary MacArthur for your donation to the processing Foundation all right so I'm going to do the weird thing now where I act like I'm just starting fresh in a new video because this will be my holiday video which will also be a a um um a a fundraiser for the processing foundation so let's actually start with this okay oh let me close this here there we go this looks good maybe I'll make it a little bit oh there we go get more people's faces in and here we go okay hello and welcome to a holiday coding challenge this coding challenge is a fundraiser for support P5 this giving season the processing Foundation is the uh Foundation that maintains the open source software projects processing p5js python mode for processing processing for the Raspberry Pi and processing for Android and if you use any of those tools in your professional life as a student as a teacher um and you have the means that can donate please do there's a link in this video's description for how to donate there's also you can donate directly on YouTube right here over somewhere over there I think is where you can donate on YouTube uh all the information about support P5 is on this post there are wonderful artworks that you can get as giveaways from Maya man from uh Kate hollenbach uh from the coding train itself that's me and Sai the coding train Community manager designed as Zen uh SAS frka and more so please donate if you the giveaways are available through this web page and of course we'll gladly accept your donation through the Donate link right here on this page itself all right and thank you to Violet who suggested this idea as the holiday coding challenge this is a kaleidoscope painter that I found online on this website perm.com incidentally this website has a lot of wonderful tutorials and other uh information go check it out but I we were thinking could this be used to create a snowflake could I make something like this where you could paint in P5 and make a snowflake pattern with sixfold symmetry because we all know that snowflakes have sixfold symmetry so this should be hopefully pretty beginner friendly if you're new to coding I'm going to do this right here in the P5 web editor and if you're using the P5 web Eder that's because the processing Foundation maintains the P5 web Eder it's a project created by Cassie tasian and your donations are helping to support the web editor the P5 library and more uh throughout the uh 2020 as we go into this new year new decade uh all right so so first let's begin by just creating a program where when I click the mouse I draw something and this is actually quite easy to do um because in the draw Loop itself um P5 has set up which will create a canvas you can see it right there that's 400x 400 pixels the draw function Loops over and over again and is always drawing a black background black because of the number zero in the background function so if I say l if I say stroke which sets a stroke color and I say line between Mouse X Mouse y those are the coordinates where your mouse is actually in the sketch and I want to draw a line from there to where I previously was where the mouse previously was so I could use some kind of variable to keep track of the previous Mouse and know the current Mouse and update it but guess what P5 has that built in for you and I can say p Mouse X for previous Mouse X and P Mouse y for previous Mouse y so if I run this again no what have I done wrong I'm losing my mind shouldn't I see a line oh I know what I I've like I forgotten everything that I ever learned in the last like 20 years I started I really only started coding in like 2001 if I'm I mean I did some before that but it's there everybody look there's the little line do you see it there it is I'm drawing the background over and over again in draw classic so I'm going to move this into setup because I only want to draw the background once so that now the line always appears so there I am drawing so some things I can do I can say if mouse mouse is pressed I only want to draw that line if I am pressing the mouse that's going to allow me to do things like this and then we can start to think about the thickness of the line so I could also um there's a lot of different ways I could I maybe I'll have that be pearing noise or something but I I'm just going to make it a little thicker right now stroke weight uh four whoops oh let me do auto refresh here so that's thicker ah let's do this let's do this let's the speed of how I move the mouse is how thick the line will be so slower will be thicker faster will be thinner I think that makes sense I think that's probably what that collidoscope Pat I show does so I can say what is um I can find the distance between the current Mouse and the previous Mouse that's you know a basically a value that indicates to me the speed how far have I gone on each cycle through draw and then I can say the stroke weight is map the distance which could be anywhere from zero right if I'm not moving at all all the way up to I mean it could let's just give it sort of think about a maximum range of something like 20 and I'm going to invert that uh 20 down I'm always going to have a stroke weight of at least one so um let's see what happens happens there so as I move oh well of course then I'm making all these kind of crazy mistakes then I also need to actually use the stroke weight variable in the stroke weight function so if I move really fast it's really thick oh I kind of want to interpolate that so that it's a little smoother but this will do this will do just fine all right so here's the thing I want the this this was like the easy part right this is the easy part I just want to draw using the mouse now I need to figure out how to get that symmetry maybe we want to use the Whiteboard for this for a second oh no signal let me see if I can get this whiteboard camera back on oh my snowflakes fell I have these nice snowflakes see if I can get this one back whiteboard camera is back my snowflakes are back okay where's a I need a marker what did I just step on nothing we're good we're good everybody okay okay so we have a canvas that's 400 by 400 we can see here this idea of a snowflake with sixfold symmetry one two 3 four five six so the angle that's important here is this particular angle right which is 60 Dees I believe uh and that will give me little little whoa no no no no no no no no no no no no no no 60 yeah 60 60 60 yes 180 degrees I just my drawing is terrible okay so let's say for the sake of argument what I'm I'm using the mouse to draw over here so Mouse X Mouse Y is happening over here what I want to do is draw the same thing here and here and here and here kind of rotating along but I also I think I want to flip it each time um in this case I think that's going to create right you can see that these two are kind of like pointing at each other so I think there's also going to be some aspect of like flipping it this is harder you know I think this is exactly what I did with the Brownie and motion snowflake I have the code for that already I'm GNA just be sitting here figuring out again aren't I oh oh no wonder this by the way there's a big mistake here no wonder this was going wonky uh code bulletin pointed this out um and also uh maybe other people in the chat uh pouse why that's why it was kind of doing some weird stuff yeah this is much more like what I expected okay so let's take whatever I draw and also I'm gonna let's try this so just as the simplest way of thinking about it for a second let's go I goes from zero to six right I want to repeat what I'm doing six times I think all this is also going to be easier if I translate to the center so I'm going to need to use translate and rotate um translate and rotate translate takes as its arguments an X and A Y and rotate takes as its argument an angle and what this allows me to do is reposition wherever the origin is so I want the origin to be in the center and I'm going to draw relative to that but then I can also rot rotate what I'm drawing to also duplicate it here rotate to duplicate here rotate to duplicate here and I I kind of glossed over that very quickly but I will refer you to my p5js Transformations video tutorial which goes through translate and rotate in much more detail so I'm also going to now create a variable called MX which is mouse x minus width divided 2 and my Y and PMX and pmy ultimately what I want is to you have I want the mouse position relative to the center so the easiest way for me to do that is just store it in separate variables so I've got the same code here same thing's happening it's just everything's now being drawn relative to the center and I am also drawing it six times but I'm drawing it six times in the same place could I I'm gonna add some Alpha here so we see what's going on could I now say rotate by I times 60° because what I want to do is first draw it here then here then here and I'm I want to rotate one 2 3 four five six times oh and let's set angle mode to degrees because I'm thinking in terms of degrees like 60° which I could think in terms of radians and that would be Pi / 3 there we go now this isn't exactly doing what I would expect it's the right idea interesting getting kind of a little bit of a kaleidoscopic feel to it but I think what I want to do now I'm remembering something from the last time I did this I think what I actually want is to have BCT each one of these and basically take whatever I'm drawing here and uh invert it uh how can I draw this I'm so bad at drawing int invert it there right I I need to actually to create something that feels much more like a snowflake pattern what I'm drawing essentially is like this this element here that's on this side of the snowflake so I need to flip it over draw it here flip it draw it here so I actually want to rotate not six times but 12 times and each time I want to flip what I'm drawing okay so I want to rotate 12 times and this by the way should be I should have the angle be okay so I'm going to uh the angle should be 360 divided by 12 and of course I should be using um I mean this is kind of crazy that I'm having these like hardcoded values there so this is what I want this is much more close to what I want but what I want to see now is also I want to invert every other one and Simon is making a good suggestion in the chat to draw a line so I think it actually would be quite useful for me to do that so I'm going to say um I'm also going to do this in setup once I'm going to draw more than just the background just so we sort of see um ah the snowflake fell I want to just draw these lines woo something weird is going on oh something weird is going on I've done something wrong and let's just make them uh red or green um what am I doing here this should be uh 30° oh I've done something ridiculous I've made a pretty serious error I forgot I mean I should know this I should know all of this stuff but even I've done this so many times I just forget it Transformations and the word transformation applies to any translation rotation or scale I'm going to use scale in a minute they're cumulative so if I say rotate by 30° I'm going to do this so rotate I * 30 rotate 30° now rotate well rotate zero then I is 1 rotate 1 time 30 is 30 then I is two rotate 2 * 30 is 60 I just want to rotate 30 each time I was thinking about how far from the beginning I want to rotate But ultimately of course I just want to rotate that that amount let's create a variable um we'll call it Symmetry and we're going to have 12fold symmetry here which is really I really want sixfold symmetry but each each sixfold symmetry segment will be symmetrical so I'm going to say angle equals 360 / symmetry I goes from Zer to Symmetry and and then I'm just going to rotate by the angle there we go that's what I'm looking to do and then the same thing and this I think can just be a global variable for right now that way I can just do the same exact thing here and we see this is what I was looking to see something more like this now this is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we should count we should get 12 so let me see if I can do that extra flipping another transformation function that I can use besides translate and rotate is a function called scale now typically we think of scale as scaling something bigger or smaller so for example if I were to use the ellipse function to draw a circle and right before that I were to say scale is two that means double the size or 200% so it would look I'm I'm not going to it's and in this case it's double the radius so I would have something like an ellipse that looks like this but scale first of all you can scale on different axes so I could say 2 comma 1 and if I did that it would just scale the horiz Al axis but not the vertical would still be the same scale so my ellipse would look like this it would be stretched horizontally incidentally I can also apply a negative number to scale if I apply a negative number to scale then it's going to draw it in the opposite direction it's going to invert it which in the case of a circle doesn't matter because it's symmetrical along the axis but if I were drawing something like a triangle then if I had 2 I would see the triangle Le suddenly be drawn like this and um Augustine dor in the chat is saying can't you just do sixfold Symmetry and draw two lines one with original coordinates and one with negated x coordinates yes I think that would work so that maybe I should try it that way I was already thinking about using scale so let me do it my way first and maybe we can revisit that or one of you watching can submit this as your version of it with that uh with that way of doing it sorry I'm thinking and reading the chat at the same time but what I thought would make sense is for me to for any odd I mean it doesn't really matter I don't know if I want odd or even for every other one if I modulus 2 is zero or one not sure which one to invert the scale horizontally so in that say say scale 11 but once again this is happening cumulatively so in this case maybe what I want to do just to like allow myself to be less confused is to add push and pop so that any rotations or translations or scales that happen within each and not outside the loop right inside the loop for each section are handled are um are contained and so in this case I would want to go back to rotating I times the angle so now they're not cumulative because I'm saving the transformation state in its original way scaling by inverting it drawing uh sorry rotating do I want to scale before rotate rotate SC I think I'm want to rotate and then flip it we're going to find out okay so this is kind of the what I was expecting except I'm not actually seeing where I'm drawing because I think this should be one yeah there we go this is more like what I was expecting there is this a way to draw a snowflake I I definitely have accomplished what I was hoping to do but I'm not seeing too much of a snowflake like pattern I await your feedback and ideas let's check on our style again oh it went all the way no five minutes remaining this is what we got by the way this this is now what the styan model that I train on the other snowflakes are uh showing back to P5 I want to see those uh lines a bit uh thicker just so I understand what's going on more clearly so as I do this right this ah okay so this is sixfold symmetry If I Stay within here so what I should do is constrain where I'm drawing right how would I that would be more snowflake like um I suppose right so it's really but if I draw in here so I really do have it really is 12fold so how how would I constrain this to be snowflake like try a thinner line yeah so first of all the line is so thick right I mean it is I guess it's more about like being artistic I suppose really it's the onuses on the person drawing this is more snowflake like now what happens if I take out this thing at the beginning to with my guides and I just draw yeah I feel like these are snowflake like one two three but in really getting 12 if I just change this now to six am I did I overthink this Symmetry and actually this is now going to give me sixfold symmetry yeah okay I overthought the Symmetry I guess oh wait wa wait wait this has to be ah symmetry right because now yeah I overthought the symmetry now this is I'm is going to give me sixfold all right I think we've made Kaleidoscope snowflakes all right what else can I all right now I have a weird idea draw with rectangle instead of ellipse that's an interesting idea oh sorry I'm leing the chat thank you Eric Paul Eric pson wrote that they shared this on Facebook and started another fundraiser for processing Foundation um thank you for doing that so now what I think would be interesting actually would be instead of using Mouse X to let's see what happens if I use pein noise just for a second um and I'm using the pein noise implementation in p5js which always comes up whether that's really pein noise or not so let's do um n let's let's do X offset okay I'm just going to um get give myself an XY value um and I'm going to say uh this so I want to make let me make these Global um I'm going to make these Global variables because uh that way because I'm going to have to do the the the previous point I'm going to have to do manually so if MX equals noise of X offset times the width now if you're wondering what pein noise is it's a function that will give you random numbers but the random numbers are sequenced in a way where they're smooth so you get numbers that are near the previous ones there's a lot more to say about that I have a whole playlist about pear noise and open Simplex noise and the different kinds of noise but here I'm just replacing the mouse with uh the noise algorithm in P5 so I need X offset which are the inputs to the noise function which are essentially like moving a long time I need to increment those by some amount um and then when I'm done PMX would equal that and pmy would equal that so I'm just taking the previous ones before I get the new ones and now it was already declared sketch line 7even oh is this a builtin variable to like in JavaScript that's so weird no I'm losing my mind why is oh CZ ah because I have MX and MX there should be a y there all right so I don't want if Mouse is pressed anymore interesting oh I need it to be um offset so I'm drawing everything relative to the center there we go so this is not sixfold symmetry it's threefold symmetry but is this snowflake I have two threefolds rather than six folds so what is wrong first of all I have some error here line was expecting four arguments oh yeah so the first frame so I should just say um I should start with uh PMX equal to MX just so I don't have like an error on the first frame okay so this is kind of the right idea but my symmetry is not right I do like the pattern though who's got ideas for me let's check to see if we have any donations we're at $580 people $580 time for a donation maybe in a song we'll take a break from this spin the thing while it draws that's kind of a fun idea I want this section to be this drawn duplicated and then I want to see that here here here and here so I kind of have an idea of how to do this and I'm realizing I'm basically recreating what I did with the Brownie and snowflake but just doing it in a different way oops I forgot that I have the music playing um so let's go back to 12fold symmetry for a second and what I think that I can do is just limit I have an idea sort of a crazy idea I'm going to limit the Y to be oh no no no the Y value you hold on there this is what I was trying to do so I was going to limit the Y value sorry like because what I want is the Y value to what I'm thinking this is very silly because ultimately I should go back to the drawing thing because it's really about designing it yourself but ultimately what I want to do is if this is what I'm drawing I want to see um I only want to see oh I'm losing my mind here a little bit if this is my little slice I want to see some variation around that's spanning out across the X around this line then I want to see that inverted and then that tiled six times right so that's kind of what I am doing what I thought I was doing now I still have 12 I can't figure this out why can't I figure this out let's go back and look at my Brownie and Motion One what did I do there six times rotate Pi ID 3 which is 60° and then scale oh oh I could just keep flipping it oh I'm flipping it along the Y not the X oh whoa more likely to move away from the center than towards the center this is what I did in the last year I cannot remember what I did last let's just do it the same way so sixfold symmetry don't have push and pop because I want to flip it each time and just rotate by the angle and I only want to draw positive numbers X is going from no negative oh I have the modulus in there ah the modulus has to go out that's symmetry is six the angle is 60° what have I done there's no push pop anymore right you know I really should use polar coordinates if I'm going to do it this way if I'm going to do it this way I should really use polar coordinates I broke it I know I'm confused why though so this is the sixfold Symmetry but the scaling is not inverting because I also want it to be closer to more likely to be closer to zero someone's telling me I times angle but I don't want it as I times angle anymore right because now oh because it's yeah it's going it's rotating back and forth how come I didn't run into this issue in processing because I rotate oh I Ed oh oh oh oh interesting oh I did the thing I drew it twice I drew it twice within each one oh that makes sense basically I see like look at this rotate by the angle push pop and draw the line twice and the second time with it flipped here we go this is what I was looking to do so this is this is now exactly what I was looking to do the difference being um where do I want it to be more likely to draw closer to the center so the way that I could do that would be have go back to draw getting a value relative to the center but then take the absolute value of it because pear and noise will natively cluster around the mean and so this should uh stick much more closely to the center more often there we go here's my perin noish snowflake now what would happen if I go back to letting people draw with the mouse so if I were to do this um I don't think this actually should let's let's try not let's go back to um using the mouse oh yeah let's go back to using the mouse it was so the whole point of this was to draw it I was just curious about pear and noise so I'm going to put if Mouse is pressed we could have the color be pear and noise if Mouse is pressed now I'm drawing now I'm making a snowflake there we go ah finally tada yeah the I think the pear noise algorithm is not really conducive to getting the kind of patterns and I think the mouse works much better so let's um and I think yeah so let's take that off let's get rid of all this just to so I'm going to remove the pear and nois stuff just to finish up this example that was a a bit of a digression okay what we have now now uh Zachary is suggesting yeah like I think this would make a lot more sense to give a lot more space now and um and here we go so what I would like to do is then the next thing I want to do is add a button to save the image and then uh I'm going to say button Mouse pressed and um uh save save Snowflake and I'm gonna write a little function save snowflake that is just going let's make a clear button also so we're going to have a save button and a clear button and with two callbacks save Snowflake and clear canvas so when I want to save I just want to save snowflake. PNG this will take whatever's in the canvas and send it to the downloads directory when I want to clear I just want to draw the background reclear the background at zero so now I feel like there maybe what I should do is uh so people are suggesting I have a pair of unnecessary push and Pop um yeah so you're right that this push and pop is unnecessary so let's take that out it's sort of like having it in there but you're right that it's unnecessary um what I want to do is let's think about color and let's think about line thickness so right now the line thick is determined by the speed of the mouse I guess that kind of makes sense feel like um I should allow myself more thickness but I wonder if it would actually be better to have the line thickness be controlled by a slider um and we'll have color be automated so we're going to do uh we're going to create a slider that has a range between one pixel and 32 and we'll start it at four and we'll give it uh increments of 0.1 and then what I'm going to do is say the stroke weight is not the anymore but is actually the value from the slider so I want to actually uh be able to see this more full screen so I'm going to go to uh share and I'm going to look at this full screen URL and just open that up here so now I should if I'm drawing that's the line thickness if I were to make this larger oh look at this so I need the uh the mouse is pressed to be only if the mouse is within the canvas but that's not not not a huge deal but if I make it thicker right I could do something thicker here and then I could really be much more intricate about my design this is kind of awkward to have to like go down to the slider I don't love this interaction but this is better so um and then color I could have color change the Hue change according to pearlin noise perhaps I kind of like it just being white on black though what is it like 1240 are people still donating I forgot that this is a fundraiser here um what what else could I add here yeah so I'm just going to fix that bug to only do stuff if Mouse X is greater than zero uh less than the width I want to make sure the mouse is in the window so that should fix um that should fix this issue and I'm going to just refresh over here where if I'm operating the slider we don't see any drawing happen Kaleidoscope snowflake maker um scroll wheel oh no I can get the scroll Wheel by going up and down that's a great idea buying the slider to the mouse wheel does P5 have something built in for me to do that I don't know if it does oops so since I had um since I let's use noise for the color so I'm going to have an ex an offset start at zero um I'm going to set the color mode to HSB 255 255 255 and then um what I will do is I will get the Hue value to be the noise function of X off off set times 255 and we'll set Hue uh and we'll have a saturation and brightness all the way up so it's you can see it's always green right now but now if I were to have X offset change over time that Hue is going to change um as it so this is my rainbow multicolored uh uh snowflake so I think this is done I'm going to attempt to design a snowflake now we're going to see like how good is my snowflake design tool and if anybody could manage to paste this link into the chat um what's a quick way that people could ah I guess I could use a Dropbox I don't really actively have a DropBox account oh P5 element Mouse wheel uh Violet was pointing out Mouse wheel all right we're going to do the mouse wheel maybe as the line thickness um uh that's a good thing to try but what I want to try is I want to figure out a way for people to make their snowflakes right like so right now if I design the snowflake a little thicker and in the center and then make it a little like thinner for like over here a lot of green and blue I think the noise algorithm doesn't it sort of like stays around one area um but if I do this and then I hit save now I have my snowflake so I want people to I want a way of collecting all of these into a nice collection of snowflakes how do I do that all right Mouse wheel fine we're going to look up the mouse wheel event how we doing donation wise I got to start soliciting donations we're only at $580 Mouse wheel a P5 Mouse wheel event. Delta move the square according to the vertical scroll who that's kind of crazy because the page is scrolling and I just like adjust the this is such a weird effect it's like it's staying in place try using sign instead of noise ah yes this is a nice idea to have a smoothly oscillating let's try that thank you an an for that suggestion I'm Gonna Leave the doing the mouse wheel as somebody for somebody in the audience to try and submit as a A variation and what let's try using uh let's have the Hue uh move with the sign function I could just I could oscillate r g and B on different periods also that could be kind of interesting um I'm going to use the map function I think it wants between Zer and 360 even though I thought I changed the defaults all right let's see how this goes I'm expecting the color to change more oh there we're not oh I see yeah all right we're getting we're getting the full range now I mean do I want I don't know if I want the full range needs to stay grayscale so people are really advocating for grayscale I'm I'm I'm good with that let's try that why s of X off oh just curious here for a second here if we say between negative and one go between 0o and two 55 yeah it's going to go up to White and oscillate back down it's getting brighter over time it should go back it's just going really slow oh because I'm in angle mode degrees I'm wondering why this number I mean I'm in angle mode degrees so I'm going up by 0.1 degrees I was like why is it being so incredibly slow yeah this is interesting now I'm making a kind of like black and white snowflake pattern and okay so let's save this and let's try to make our snowflake so I'm going to start out with a sort of a thick line towards the center and I'm going to use a thinner line to do some nice detail there this is my snowflake that I made goth snowflakes people prefer the color okay I give up this is the end of this coding challenge here is a kaleidoscope snowflake drawing generator um I'm sure you can make your own version of this and think about color and the interface and all sorts of different and creative ways and I hope that you will do that I suppose I was hoping to collect all the snowflakes and make uh some kind of thing out of them but oh right Simon's pointing out the clear should also be gray I forgot that well let's see what it looks like if it's black because it's kind of G oh you know the nice thing about that is it's actually becomes an eraser so when it gets down to really dark it's like I can kind of erase what was there so I kind of like that actually okay Style again is done yes spin the canvas oh boy yeah make it so after you draw it you can spin it kind of like that idea too but I'd have to save it and then spin it spin button let's go check the Style again I'm let's stop let's pause for a second cuz I have to remind us here that we are in the middle of a fundraiser and it's also I'm going for three hours now so I'm not sure how much more uh energy I'm going to be able to maintain change the background it is pretty hard to see the snowflake everybody's got an opinion so you can go and make your own version of this right now I the the code on GitHub might take a little bit but if you go to this URL um which someone will hopefully post into the chat all you need to do is uh then click this little button and it will take you to the code um but I'm going to go back to the full view okay um how we doing here look at this we have got I don't know what I forget what this number was at the beginning of today um but we now have let's check some some new donations to thank some people okay Marcos himis I learned to program with processing and now I work teaching others to program using processing and p5js I owe you my professional training and my training as an artist thank you for all the excellent and committed work and Russell thank you for all this amazing work and community outreach you're changing people's lives that's terrific uh you can donate here um to support processing and p5js and the processing Foundation all the community and education initiatives um there are a whole bunch of giveaways and Gifts here that you can read about from artist our Brewer is in the chat that's that's you Russell um and you can also donate you know even just a dollar helps um right here through the fundraiser that's on YouTube itself YouTube is covering all of the fees um if you are a YouTuber with a YouTube channel and want to add this fundraiser to videos on your channel you can do that so reach out to me if you want and this uh while I figure out what next song I'm gonna play this song is now dedicated to I can't remember where I stopped everybody everybody but recent donations from Marcos and Russell and if you want to have this song dedicated to you you could make a quick donation here um through the YouTube U interface so let me check and find a song to do I need to eat some lunch uh let's see what do we got here anything new come in song idea let's take a look at this to the tune of Jingle Bells in it that in it this no more null references I like that uh um let's see what is what are some that were done recently that were modified recently you were missing this dot what is that one hour ago two hours ago did refactoring all the way oh coding train that came in just recently and I didn't um adjust let it code did we do Let It code all I want is for code to run oh this is another all I want for chis for Christmas year oh coding train I like this this I should be able to do your to felis Navid do thank you I really wanted something to the tune of Fel Nai D let's do that I'm going to do all of these it's time for some cheer I have this printed out somewhere I mean fle naav da is just like three cords I'm pretty sure Jingle Bells all I want Santa Claus is coming to town of course Rudolph the rednose reindeer I have them all printed in a pile over over here and of course I can't seem to find the one that I'm looking for there it is all right Miss oh no okay I think I got it you oh Mason this is your song Mason in the chat awesome you're missing this dot you're missing this dot you're missing this dot you better correct it or your code won't run I want to wish you a happy coding i w to wish you all happy coding this is right wait wait I can do this I can memorize the lyrics here just look at the I can memorize these chords too I should have practiced this one more I just thought oh this one's so easy we're gonna we're gonna start over we're gonna bring it down a notch everybody bring it down a notch you're missing this dot you're missing this Dot you're missing this dot you better correct it or code won't run you're missing this dot you're missing this dot you're missing this dot you better correct it or your code won't run I want to wish you a happy coding I want to wish you a happy coding want to wish you a happy coding from the bottom of my heart oh yeah or an easy refactoring and easy refactoring I want to wish you all happy coding I want to wish you all happy coding I want to wish you all happy coding and easy refactoring oh I cannot sing this tune it's like in the wrong key or something for me I can't sing at all so it's really sad I want to wish you all happy cing oh no oh no oh no falling apart good I have a cup of water it's okay everybody 2019 was the year that the holiday fundraiser ton killed the coding train deep breath I W to wish I want to wish you a happy coding I want to wish you a happy coding from the bottom of my heart I want to wish you a happy coding I want to wish you a happy coding I want to wish you a happy coding and easy refactoring you missing the do you're missing the do you're missing the do you're better corrected or your code won't run I want to wish you verying I want to wish you a happy coding oh cing I want to wish you a happy cing from the bottom of my heart I want to wish you a happy cing I want to wish you a happy coding I want to wish you a happy coding and easy reor you realize that I'm making a total complete fool out of myself so please donate to the process Foundation would really help oh wait there's more songs so let's see did we get some more donations am I going to sing another song although I don't know maybe I should like sing more song maybe if you donate I'll stop sing I'm not sure which one where's my all right no wait this is where we were before no wait I'm oh here yes there's no more donations we need another donation for me to continue this live stream if the donations are not coming in I cannot continue this live stream I will go on with my day oh wait I'm not checking my messages because Dorothy was maybe going to call in 10 oh 1030 or 11 but that's Pacific Coast time what time is that 130 or two I think okay okay um please program a game all right so do we have another donation I will do another song when we have another donation let's go back I might need some more water again ah Mason sickler donated $5 thank you Mason sickler $5 for the Pro conation did you know that I'm going to match every donation that comes in up to $1,000 on YouTube today and we are up to $610 let's get to 1,000 people there are 208 of you watching right now if everybody donated $5 ah you donated 20 but forgot to mark it public so here's another $5 thank you Mason all right what other songs do we have here oh coding train this one I can manage I might need to go pull go into my book here so where would I find this oh holy night oh Christmas tree page 82 whoops ah there's a keyboard here this is a problem jingle Java to pull requests okay I missed a new member so I thank you to the new so Simon's asking me about Runway I will get to that we will get to Runway um uh Violet is pointing out that I missed a new member I'm I'm very grateful for the members I would encourage you that if you're thinking about joining the coding train um instead of doing that donate to the processing foundation for today you can always join another time uming train o coding o coding train coding train it's very hard to do this with the lyrics here and the chords over here and my really not being any good at playing the ukulele how lovely are your challenges there's pearlin noise and proessing P whoops G minor 7 is quite hard p5js and machine learning oh oh coding train oh this is okay oh coding train oh coding train how okay I think I got it me me me me oh oh here comes the processing Foundation rocket oh coding train oh coding train how lovely are your challenges there's pearing noise and processing p5js and machine learning your fun whoops your your function setup is lovely and function draw loops with me oh coding train o coding train how lovely are your challenges oh processing oh processing I I can't get this G myself love you oh so much o processing wasn't there an O processing one too this is from last year oh I like I I love the O coding train but I I this is a fundraiser for processing here okay oh processing oh processing how lovely are thy functions oh processing shoot I'm gonna get this oh processing oh processing how lovely are thy challenges no no no no functions functions you don't have challenges oh processing oh processing how lovely are thy challenges no functions functions oh p5js no processing works better oh processing oh processing how lovely are thy functions oh processing oh processing how lovely are thy functions where set up draw set up size or Draw in squares and no how's this Goa set up size or Draw you know Philips oh processing oh oh processing how lovely are thy functions okay thank you thank you thank you thank you very much thank you thank you thank you very much thank you head is very itchy in this hat going back to the other hat going back to the other hat all right did we get any new donations ah Bart reman five to the processing Foundation thank you very much I guess I have to do another song and then we can also check on the actual donation page support P5 here we go everybody are we going to hear another song today I wonder I wonder oh you so disappoint me but we did get this donation from Bart reman thank you very much so we will sing another song which is I think not making Simon very happy because Simon wants me to go back and look at the r look at Runway but if people are submitting songs all I want is for code to run all I want for Christmas is you okay all right we're going to do this song again this one's really hard I don't have the chords here I'm going to do my best I don't need I don't need a lot I don't need a lot for coding there is just one thing I need in and doubles can keep floating underneath the binary trees I like that I just want my code to work just waiting for you to be done make oh wait I'm in a different part of the song here I just want my code to work waiting for you to be done make my code a error free no that's not E7 make my code sorry I was so I was so close there make my code error free oh all I want is for code to run I don't need need a lot for coding there is just one thing I need I don't care about these pixels underneath the computer screen that is awesome underneath the computer screen that is fantastic okay I think I don't know if I can get through this whole one this one is really hard I had a pick last year I think my strumming is not very good I think you're actually supposed to just use with a ukulele you're supposed to just shum like this I need the chords within here I'm just completely lost thank you okay Zachary writes if I close my eyes I can't tell if you're Mariah Cary or Dan schiffman I have a feeling you can tell I think it's I think you can tell it is very warm in here I really need some more water but um I'm GNA sing another song If there's another donation otherwise I'll go and got to finish off things that I'm doing here okay it's 115 I'm gonna have to go soon there's only so much I can do here has anybody made a beautiful snowflake with this uh example that we made um let's see where am I here we go okay okay folks folks let's see if we can oh you know what I should be doing I should be training a mo machine learning model to generate lyrics for me next year what what what what what what thank you to Jeremy Wentworth Nathaniel look count and yining she thank you for your donations for your donations you will hear a completely incompetent ukulele player who cannot sing wearing a hat attempt to sing a Christmas song all right let's see see what else we got here what have I not done that's come in recently we've done these let's see what's what's been updated recently 10 minutes ago jingle Java Jingle Bells a lot of Jingle Bells people I'm hoping for a Jingle Bell Rock I would like a jingle bell rock but I will do this jingle bells jingle jar jingle jar I love that Java all the way oh this is good Jingle Bells right oh didn't we I don't have the cords for Jingle Bells why is Jingle Bells not in this book of a hundred Christmas carols all right we're gonna find this I'm just going to find it on this other computer Jingle Bells yuku cords I mean there's got to be just like three chords right oh there's a lot more to it a minor A7 C D7 G all right all right all right everybody this looks hard yeah and I don't have the I need the chords people I need the chords with the text dashing dashing through the code and in an open source ID or the classes we go this is not right or the classes we go debugging all the way oh boy AR on dash I think I'm in a weird like key dashing through dashing dash dash dashing through the code if I sing up really high then I can find it dashing through the C in s all the classes we go deug all the way on Bob tail ring making bright what fun it is to what F fun it is to deep hug and sing cing song tonight jingle jar jingle jar jingle Jaa all the way oh what fun oh what fun is e open source hey jingle jar jingle jar Jaba all the way no wait Java all the yeah yeah it's all it's just G the whole time jingle jar jingle jar Java all the way oh what oh what a lot of fun what a well what a lot of fun what it's just so much fun fun and fun to lot of fun to debug and Co and open source and all that stuff in a one horse open SL thank you thank you thank you very much thank you thank you very much thank you thank you thank you thank you okay are we going back to coding or are we singing another song people are you donating are you donating this is a It's A Hard song to sing especially for someone who cannot sing this is going to just be on the internet forever hope I don't have to apply for any jobs anytime soon I'm a very serious person I do serious work no not at all all right let's see thank you for your donations we're checking it out here donor wall I will keep singing songs as long as donations come in you won't be able to get me to stop you can donate right here on YouTube itself no fees will be taken out the money goes straight to the processing Foundation of course you can donate here on our donor wall if you're interested in the giveaways and having your name here don't make me cry I cry when there are no donations I cry the tears they flow I guess I have to put my ukulele away so sad I just have to go back to coating wasn't there something else I was going to do with this Kaleidoscope example let's check Runway so now what we can do this is weird why is the FID score so high because it looks pretty good is it not updating no it's such a high FID score which is weird oh no no no it just wasn't updating it's 116 now um hold on sorry so um so we could now do what is called a latent space walk through but let's hit next I mean I could train this for more steps but oh and I can create a progress video so let's do this let's create the progress video that'll be fun to see and let's take a look at that so one of the things that Runway will do it will create a progress video which shows the model training which I started from flowers all the way right now to these snowflakes it's pretty nice to see then I can click next here and uh I can save this to my models um I can make this model public and I can edit the info and I can say this is support hash support P5 um and um brownan motion snowflakes created in processing so we'll do save so now this model is available in Runway I can add it to my workspace let's create a new workspace coding train ton and now so once you've trained a model most of the time when using Runway there's a pretrain model but I can go here and switch this to a vector input put and oh I've got to run I've got to run the model run remotely this is going to use I'm you there's there's a lot more to say about all the things in Runway and I have some videos that cover that and check out the runway ml website but what I'm doing now is the model is being run on a g Cloud GPU and it's starting up it'll take a little bit once it starts up I'm going to see a grid of images generated from the model and then I can in make a P5 sketch to uh get one of those W look at there there we go here is my style Gan generated uh snowflakes what I really like to do is generate a latent Space Walk and by that means I want to create an animation that essentially goes from one to the other that just sort of like walks through the latent space um and I have some code that does this um where where where where and I and I think I'm kind of running out of parts like 130 I mean four this is if I I'm going to be done at two because that's going to be four hours I can't go more than four hours I got some stuff to do folks of course if you keep donating I might stay a little longer sing some more songs but let's at least let's let's try to make this um lat and Space Walk how do I want to do this can't I don't remember so I think what I'm going to do just to sort of speed things along here is I'm going to go to my course that i t this semester which is on uh github.com ml5.js so ml5 is a project not from the processing Foundation but is a library for p5js and it wouldn't be able to exist without the processing foundation in p5js so if you want ml5 to continue you should donate to P5 and support P5 um so ah here's my syllabus and somewhere in here Runway ml um got a lot of materials sing don't think this is the one do I did I make an example for style Gan I can't remember uh yes wandering latent space style Gan code examples so what do I have there oh look at this how lucky am I okay well this was nice I had this example let me just talk you through it a little bit I'm going to come I'm going to do some proper tutorials about generative machine learning models and lat and space and how to do a walk random walk through late in space but I you know three and a half hours in I I just do not have I cannot I can summon the energy to sing another holiday song but I don't know that I could summon energy to code all this from scratch um so let's see so what I'm going to explain to you is that um any image that you generate uh let's go back to Runway that's generated through a uh style Gan and this applies to lots of other kind of generative models as well the input is a vector often called a z Vector it's just a list of numbers and this has to do with how um if I were to like really go back and explain this I might start with looking at what an autoencoder does and how an autoencoder takes an image as an input and compresses it down to a vector of numbers and then reconstructs the image and that Vector of numbers is essentially like a fingerprint or a signature for that image and that's actually What's Happening Here in Runway and I could even just go I think if I click on this oh that's gonna what's that going to do what do these buttons do the download oh this yeah I think this saves the vector so for example look at this look at this snowflake right here I am going to to the desktop oh uh whoa what's going on I'm losing my mind here refresh no download not download the image this usually downloads a file with the vector doesn't it did I break Runway but the point is oh oh we got another donation Fatima KH thank you thank you Fatima KH a song will shortly be dedicated to you after I get this going but I can so what I can do is if I go to this network tab I can send an array of 512 numbers and it's going to send me back a base 64 encoded image which is the image that is generated so my example code here it's um I probably should start from a more basic one where was I there let go back here I'm not going to do the walk first generate style Gan image this is perf this is what I wanted to do if I just generate 512 random numbers between negative 1 and one make that the Z Vector that I post that I post to Runway Runway is actually running a web server there's a lot going on Runway is deployed the style game model to the cloud but it's also running a local web server that I can talk to and then it talks to the cloud justs the image get it back all that sort of stuff so this should when I run it now if I click generate I see the style Gan generated Snowflake and I'm just every time I click generate I'm getting a random one here in P5 and you could do this in processing too with that processing Library I mentioned but what I want to show you is if what I do is instead of creating a z vector or new random complete set of random numbers every single time if I take those random numbers and adjust them ever so slightly I get a similar looking snowflake that's near it in this multidimensional latent space I got to come back and do a proper tutorial explaining all the details of this stuff but this is the basic idea and so now if I go back to this one what you'll see is this is a demonstration where I can I have it sort of commented out but I can do three different kinds of random walks so I could just randomly adjust the numbers I could use pearlin noise to move about the space or I could even make a sort of velocity Vector of 512 numbers and move in a continuous Direction so I've left this commented out with this one so now I think you can see um you can see it's like changing ever so slightly and if what I do generate image image generates the image I want to every time I generate the image save it so what if instead of having draw What If instead of having draw whenever I get the image is this going to work I just draw it I think this is not going to work ah because I need a call back this is very frustrating but I think this um I'm going to create I I want to just save them one at a time there we go perfect and then I don't want to call generate image here I want to then say save um snowflake uh. PNG G and then then call generate image again so now what I wanted this is going to be a little bit nuts cuz I'm just going to save it all to my downloads directory but let's go ahead so you can see all of these snowflake files are just saving saving saving saving saving saving saving saving saving to my downloads directory let's let this go for a little while um and we'll let this go for a little while and then I will um dedicate a song to Fatima Khan and maybe there are some other donations that have come in on the donor wall yeah yeah yeah I don't know why that just popped up oh yeah sure I I don't know why no stop ah help okay I guess I can't leave this window what is going on stop pop up I've killed the browser do I have two multiple things running no all right let's check this it's still going didn't I stop it there we go okay refresh the page no no let's all right I'm just going to go to the donor wall I'm going to kill the browser go away browser downloads in progress quit come back to me browser restore and we shall see okay well we're on the same donate but we do have a do no donation so Fatima will get a song we did jingle jar we did you're missing this dot oh coding train all I want for code to run I think I tried that but I sort of failed do we have any new songs there's some issues that have come in processing Rock All Right processing Rock we've got two of them okay all right well we can do both of these because they're short two different verses I'm very hungry I need to eat some lunch people but if you donate I will stay here I'm about to go on vacation so I can handle an extra little bit extra time am I in tune I've got to be in tune tune for this processing processing n p52 he's writing some code to entertain you Daniel we love you don't stop what you do and a processing we love to you to processing processing and p52 I oh shoot I oh yeah sorry processing processing and p52 I don't know how I'd code without you you inspire all my coding blocks that's the oh yeah okay that's the processing that's the processing that's the processing Rock what a what a bright what a what a bright time is the right time to code the night away processing time is a swell time to go debugging in uh the processing ID processing processing and p52 processing Around the Clock I don't know how I'd code without you that's the processing I got it that's the processing that's the processing r all right let's go to this one oh whoa this one's got like a lot of lyrics okay now that I practiced thank you aramam Tim I don't know do you like this this background behind me I feel like it kind of it's nice to sort of just have this generic background so there's a swing strum which is down down down up down down up down down up down down up down down up down down up down down up down then there's the shuffle Island strum which is down down up processing processing processing Rock code all the things with a MH with I forgot okay I really had a pick CU I but I don't know that a pick is really that helpful all right here we go everyone oh a two one 2 3 4 processing processing processing Rock cat all the things with machine learning coding debugging it's so much fun now the coding hop has begun processing processing ing processing processing Rock the stakes are fine it's not a crime working code can be awfully rare debug without a care what a right time it's the right time to code the night away processing time is a coding time to try debugging in an to try debugging in an d e hurry up ID e and my PC debug Around the Clock wait who E7 ah clock mix code and a debug in the i e that's the processing that's the processing that's the pro processing rock thank you thank you thank you very much thank you okay now now we can make our Laten space animation wait whoops oh I like this one I I feel like I'm my strumming is off you know next year next year I'm going to be so much better okay um I now what I think if I go to my downloads directory there are zillions of these snowflake images so let me make another folder called snowflakes and let me put all of them in there o what is going on oh weird something weird happened because I was like downloading them in a different way let's just go to here I don't know something might be in a weird order but let's put them all in there now one of the things you might not know processing itself has under Tools something called Movie Maker so if I take any folder on my computer like this one and drag it in here and I'm just going to click same size as Originals uh with no compression I can processing has a tool which will take a whole directory of pgs or images and Stitch them together into a movie I'm going to say 30 frames per second I'm going to say create movie and I'm going to call this snowflakes let's just put it on the desktop and is it going I see it there did it make it already usually I see a nice little interface that shows it's uh running weird hold on let me try this I think something's weird the way these images got numbered which is a little frustrating to me because usually I number them manually and then um um then Al so what usually I number them manually which maybe I'll I'll switch into do um Wallace F Mori donate isn't available to Brazilians so if you can't donate through the YouTube interface you are welcome to give a donation uh the donorbox link it's donorbox.org /s support pf29 fundraising D campaign we are up to um on uh donor box we are up to $1 14,713 which really should be possible there are a lot of people who use these tools a lot of Institutions there's no reason why we can't reach that goal spread the word help I realize that um people do not have the means necessarily to donate a lot and maybe or donate all all which is totally fine but you can help by spreading the word um and there we go so let me try running this again let me do something different here can I name the images myself and have them whoa this is the wrong sketch oh boy oh because I hadn't saved it oh I made those changes then I crashed the browser Chris Spurgeon donated $50 we will be doing another song thank you Chris Spurgeon here is a snowflake pattern that I will make for you this snowflake pattern is dedicated to Yes it please it's sixfold symmetry it looks like it might be 12 but it's not look six six um and I can save this snowflake uh Chris Pon snowflake for you okay and song coming up in a second um right I want to show you this movie maker so give me a second here I don't know what happened why this didn't work so let's go to downloads snowflakes I think these file names are a little wonky and I could write a program to like resave them all I have a crazy idea I shouldn't I shouldn't do what I'm about to do uh all right I'm going to where do I have I'm going to find hold on I'm just gonna find some code I wrote um so I gotta like go into the deep recesses of my computer so I'm just going to uh leave this here for a second I'm going to find something else that I've written um just I have to find it on my computer documents documents okay here for okay should be good now okay so I have another processing sketch that I have written here no no no no no no no no it's not what I meant to do let's open up this so this is another processing sketch which is based on examples by George pereno who's the creator of the the runway processing Library which is actually imported here oh let's see Dennis king4 donated $5 thank you um Mason has to sign off thank you for watching and for writing some nice songs for me Mason sickler thank you um I gotta go soon too but i' I've determined to get through a few more things um yeah I don't know if I want to install this update but fine um so one thing I need is do sketch import Library I don't know if Runway has been published has the runway Library been published yes great so I need to install this library because it's going to use it so the runway library is now installed and this is using this doing the same exact thing it's a little weird message from OBS Studio that it disconnected so I don't know if the stream just went down but I'm think I might disc I think it might have disconnected from the stream deck thing it might have been that okay let's see if this works so hold on let me close out it uh Visual Studio code does not need to be open so the model is running again me open this up again we'll wait for the model to be running oh it's running so now on quit I really want I think processing needs to be I think it's it's freaked out people there we go okay the model is running by the way this is what I oh yeah okay that's the Z Vector that was sent you open up processing so one thing I want to check is that the model is running on Local Host 8000 at the endpoint query so now I should be able to just double check that the runway library is initialized correctly um I guess it depicts all the default ports and everything there we go okay oh thank goodness so now this is uh working and let me see do I have save image Set uh save frame output coding TR great so great so there we go so here's all of the snowflake images that it's generating and I wanted to do it um I'll just let it go for a while and I'll dedicate a song to the recent donors um Dennis and Chris Spurgeon all right let's let this run for a little bit we're gonna make our Laton space animation before the end of this live stream I wonder if I should have it go through the space more quickly ah it's fine it's fine okay so let's let's let that go and then I need to go to holiday songs any new holiday songs we got processing Rock processing Rock uh well it might be time for the 12 days of coding okay it's 81 and a half degrees in here 12 days under T do we think there's a hundred songs in this book this is the book I'm looking at I do not see 12 days I'm sure I could find the chord somewhere else no well I've got no well the 12 days of there it is the it's under theth uh no it's not it's under 12 spelled out I just was looking in the wrong place 126 on the first day of coding on the first day of coding my oh B flat what my true love gave to me 12 oh no no no a no pointing binary Tri got it I think I got to transpose this no no pointing binary tree on the second day of coding my true love gave to me P5 gave to me two two P requests 12 Nur 11 where's the golden rings thing all right these are hard chords this is a hard one how's my how's my processing sketch going I'm gonna try to do it I'm gonna try to do it where's my processing sketch there we go how many images do we think we have so far output oh we don't it doesn't matter I don't need any I'm just making an animation that's plenty of images it's so warm in here oh my goodness oh thank you for sticking with me everybody we could use some more donations oh maybe Dorothy's ready to say hi did I have different cords for 12 days with Christmas like in a different key like the like if I transposed it to C so it would be C then it would be a uh d f to D Minor would be C to a minor and then F2 I think I'm gonna I don't know okay we're we're up at around four hours people we're up at four hours hours people it's been four hours is it time for me to solve my 5x5 Rubik's Cube yet okay um I GNA need to open the door it's like so hot in here it's ridiculous um all right so what I'm gonna do is stop this now and we're going to go to the movie maker and I am going to this time grab this folder and oops um whoops uh what why is this open oh go away uh I'm GNA go back to the movie maker sorry about that and I'm going to grab this folder bring it in here same size as Originals let's do PNG compression 24 frames per second create a movie snowflakes three there we go this is what I wanted to see so now it is creating the movie and um I'm solve my Rubik's Cube it brings me it soothes me the Rubik's Cube It's a littleit I hope this like overhead I'm really gonna do this I think I can do this in like five or 10 minutes and I've already been doing this for four hours somebody donates if you donate and you T your donation Rubik's Cube instead of playing a song I'll solve this 5x5 Rubik's Cube which is a little bit of a scary promise to make okay but we and we we will We I will attempt this 12 Days of Christmas I mean Cod miss or coding oh wait did it make it okay here we go all right now we've got this open it up no wait why is it not it's not compatible with QuickTime Player give me a break people do I have VLC this is weird this never had these issues before everything always goes wrong when you're live streaming that should be the title of a song everything always goes wrong when you're live streaming um VC media player let's try this if not if not oh here we go Le is asking about the secret message challenge not so well if I'm being honest unconfirmed ah here we go we must find out the mystery of why this video is not playing probably was that PNG format or something it's probably because I'm running a Catalina or whatever I'm running Mountain sailboat I don't know what what these names are like my brain is completely shut off right now it's a miracle that I'm standing come on what what is everything is like grinding to a halt here we can stop this Runway let's close Runway All right yeah I'm sure I'm sure no thanks okay oh look at this well that's nice uh desktop there we go o oh there there's my latent space snowflake animation boy was that worth it or what so this just to just a recap a processing sketch used brownie in motion to generate 2,000 snowflakes that were then uploaded to Runway to train a style Gan model to generate snowflakes in the style of the brownie motion snowflakes that then processing requested from Runway and got a whole bunch of new ones and generated this animation thank you thank you happy holidays everybody all right have you donated has anybody donated yeah you can open in my system preferences no go away I don't want I don't want to I don't want to talk to you right now in my system preferences breathe people breathe okay close by the way this live stream is winding down four hours was my stretch goal I really was planning to only do two and then I thought well three is reasonable four hours is really insane um but uh I would like to recap a couple things and thank a few people and also perhaps we have gotten some new donations have we gotten new donations let me remind you that I will match wait oh I'm going to match all donations that come in today up to $1,000 for processing foundation and um I'm just going to the we're up to wow we're up to $711 through just the YouTube interface itself that is great we need more people if you want to use processing and P5 and all those things in 2020 donate or I know a lot of you can't donate there's plenty of other ways you could contribute um I've talked about all that stuff go back to the beginning of this live stream when I was much more articulate and eloquent about talking about the processing Foundation all that stuff but here we go okay we're going to see if any new donations have come in here I know that some have come in recently through the YouTube intern face I cry the tear it rolls silently down my cheek dripping into the beard coloring a few more hairs gray and then they fall out in my sadness for no more donations there were some recent ones that came in through YouTube that I believe I thanked and I was trying to you do the 12 days of uh coding let's check our song songs here um okay I'm waiting people I'm waiting I will I will attempt this 12 days of coding even though but what um these two there's two of them I will attempt these even with these difficult chords even without the chords in the lyrics which which would makes things much easier that's a way you could contribute you could transpose this for me into much friendlier cords that don't include a B flat got to practice that one I need like extra fingers this is not something it's not so bad actually okay but I'm waiting for a donation I'll wait I'll wait all day you won't you won't hear me sing not till there's a donation some fresh air don't worry everybody I'm still here I just went to get some water and some fresh air how' we do how' we do are we doing 12 days did I miss a donation oh I really wanted to get to a thousand people I me I think we did actually if I if I add up what's here if I add up what's here and what came in through YouTube I did make my goal but I wanted to see that thousand dollar on YouTube all right let's look for some um 12 days of uh chords see if there's a um simple chart that I could use oh yeah in C this is better I'm going to use these that are in C okay I have it on this laptop remember this laptop people look at this we are just laptop crazy here on the coding train all right on the first day of co co coding I think I know all these chords yeah yeah I don't think I need the chart okay oh Violet Violet Dono 74 50 pounds5 thank you suab Sayed oh look at this we got more donations everybody's donating oh Sebastian $10 s Chile to I am so sorry that I do not speak uh Spanish and uh that um that was my poor attempt thank you so much for your message um I hope um and and and your your donation um thanks to all these donations you now boy this page is like scrolling automatically we will now have stop scrolling why is this page scrolling no stop auto scroll great okay okay here we go ready everyone sing it with me this is this is by the way this is the finale I I only can do so much I I got to get get home to the family I actually have some work to finish up before before I leave today uh I need to eat something I would love to be here all day someday I'll figure out translation greetings from Chile very motivated everything what you do thank you hope all is well in Chile uh a country I've never been to but I really would like to visit um okay we are going to switch to this on the first day of coding P5 gave to gave to me a no pointing binary whoa okay hold on I need some practice here on the first day of coding P5 gave to me p gave to me a no pointing binary oh no no a no pointing bin whoa this is part in a tree this is not what these chords are crazy what is this a no pointing by finary tree why can't I just do c g c it's G me all this extra stuff no pointing binary tree on the second day of coding my P5 gave to me two pull requests and a no pointing no pointing binary no pointing B no pointing binary no pointing binary tree this is weird hold on a second everybody I don't trust this web page I just found yeah I'm just yeah hold on transpose uh um F to C is down uh oh down five half steps probably right yeah this is a simpler one we're GNA go with this one on the first day on on the first day of coding my P5 gave to me a no a no boing binary tree on the second day of coding my P5 gave to me two P request and a no why the f is the f is not right a no so sad what are all of these websites with their incorrect chords I had a good one I had that that book last year that I didn't keep I'm gonna get this people PDF can't go wrong with the PDF ah there we go this is a really this is a nice simple one okay Here We Go Again everybody a one a two a one two three on the first day on the first day of coding my P5 gave to me a n n pointing binary tree on the second day of coding my P5 gave to me two pull request and a no pointing binary tree on the third day of C shoot on the third day of coding my true my V5 gave to me three this dots two P request and a no pointing binary tree on the fourth day of right I'm on four now right on the fourth day of coding my P5 gave to me for derping boyss what's a derping boy flocking can we say flocking I think flocking would be better four flocking boyss three this dos two P request and a no pointing binary tree people want to see the lyrics here you go I don't know what's more interesting on the fifth day of Co fifth day of coo I can use an A Minor there on add an A Minor on the fifth day of coding my true love my P5 gave to me five Quick Draw ring for oh for boyss three three this dos tole request and another pointing binary tree on the sixth day of coding my P5 gave to me six camera switching five Quick Draw ring four flocking boys three this starts two P request and a no pointing binary tree oh on the seventh day of Co coding my P5 gave to me seven Thor sorting six camera switching five quick drawing ring looking in so many different places I should really be able to memorize this by now for flock in boyss three this dos two pull requests and a no pointing binary tree on the eighth day of coding my P5 gave to me this one I really like eight fractal forming seven sorter sorting six camera switching five Quick Draw Four der for hacking boyss three this dos two poqu and a all pointing binary tree on the what are we nine on the ninth day of coding the ninth day of coding my P5 gave to me nine four Loops looping eight fractals forming seven Sor sorting six cameras switching five golden rings for fing boids three of this dos two p a quest and a no pointing binary tree what are we on 10 10 on the 10th day of coding my P5 gave to me 10 people posing nine four Loops looping eight fractal forming seven sort of sorting six camera switching five Quick Draw Rings four flocking boyss three French hens no no no French head three this dots two P request and a partridge in aary tree Zachary MacArthur hello to Isabelle the 11th day of Co 11th day of coding my P5 gave to me 11 index errors 10 people posing nine for Loops looping eight fractals forming seven sorter sorting nine camera switching five quick draw four flocking boid three this thoughts to turpo request and a all pointing binary tree thank you for your donation Rasha oh this is it here we go on the 12th day of coding my P5 gave to me 12 neural network 11 index errors 10 people posing nine for Loops looping eight fractal foring seven sort of sorting six camera switching five gold ah five golden rings four dripping four focking void three of this starts a twole request and a no pointing binary tree happy holidays everyone happy New Year thank you for 2019 it's been fun to bring the coding train to you which would not be possible not even close to possible without the processing Foundation all the contributors of the different open source projects people who can contribute it in a myriad of different ways from writing code to documentation to teaching to tutorials to creating artworks to bringing it to people in their local communities all over the world please continue to do so in 2020 if you have the means support the processing Foundation talk to your institution about supporting the processing Foundation uh you go to a school and they spend lots of money on software like Adobe Creative Suite and other types of 3D rendering stuff that I don't know how to use maybe just maybe they might also like to uh spend some money on process and p5js and we can actually generate an invoice for you so please get in touch at foundation processing.org on social media all that stuff do we have another donation coming do we have another donation coming because I believe I believe there might be another 12 Days lyrics and you know far be it for me to oh that's was from last year though so you know there is another one we could do this one more time we could do this one more time one more time and then that would really really be it I sound like this is how I talk to my children I'm very I must pushover I just give into everything you you donate I will give in to doing this one more time one more time may I remind you that we made this beautiful fral snowflake thing which I thought was going to be uh something Simon is sending me all sorts of numbers got some kind of crazy numbers math formulas about the 12 days of coding presence what's happening on support P5 okay oh we're going to see we're going to see are we going to get any more donations could we possibly get one more donation could we get up to in YouTube we're up to $796 I don't see any more donations Isabelle's going to be sad she's three years old watching this live stream right now saying hi to me and I can't even hear her maybe she wants to hear another song I don't know why because I'm terrible at singing these songs but you know maybe to a threeyearold I'm sure she has very sophisticated ears but maybe I'm just like a a nice person attempting to sing and it's it's encouraging other people who are not so good at this kind of stuff to attempt as well we're gonna see I wish I had something shorter to do no Don no nothing nothing I'm not going to do it without any donations I can just say goodbye right now and I'll pull this car over right now and say goodbye there not that many of you watching anymore I think maybe nobody could stick around for 4 hours I don't know I expected at least one more to come in this is kind of anticlimactic let's go look at the code that I made wasn't there something else I was going to do with this I don't know if I'm going to be able to make this into a coding challenge video because I don't remember I don't remember where I left off or what I was saying I want to make a nice little snowflake I hope people make pretty snowflakes and share them with me every year we make a snowflake we're going to run out of ways to make snowflakes Simon tell me there are YouTube donations but I don't see them I don't see them I've been looking I've been keeping my eye there were there some earlier do they come in while I was singing that doesn't count doesn't count not what I'm looking for people by golly I just gonna have to donate myself okay here we go everyone it's come to this people it's come to this oh we got a donation yay we got a donation we will do our last song to thank the coding train okay everyone here we go are we really doing 12 days of debugging is that really what it's come down to okay here we go where are my chords I lost them okay I don't think I need I think I've got this memorized now okay ready everyone here we go on the first try at debugging I thought I fixed the bug and now I think I should give up on the second try at debugging I thought I'd fix the bug two Miss do this dots and now I think that I should give up on my third try at debugging I thought I fixed the bug three digits off two missed this dots and I think that I should give up on my fourth try at De bug fourth try at debuging I thought I'd fix the bug four times the call back's called three digits off two missed this dots and now I think that I should give up got move faster here on the fifth try at debuging i' thought I'd fix the bug five conso four times the call back's been called I got to know this part yeah yeah four times the call back's been called three digits off two miss this dots and I now I think that I should give up on the six try debuging I thought I'd fix the bug six bars don't exist five cons LS four times the call back's been called three digits off to miss this dos now I think that I should give up on my seventh try at debugging I thought I'd fix the bug seven wrong algorithms six bars don't exist five console logs four times the call

give up I will not give up the code it runs it works happy holidays to everyone thank you for watching the coding train all this time all this year I will be back in 2020 I will be back in 2020 please donate and support the processing Foundation this is really the end I think four and a half hours I might be a record um thank you everybody um if I just quickly look here and go onto uh youtube.com coding Trin I will find that we raised uh on uh oh there I am um $1,796 oh you can't see this um no ah there we go $1,796 to the processing Foundation just on YouTube alone and I I um here we are uh on the donor wall all of these oh we had matura donated $50 Enrique $10 all these donations came in uh during the live stream today they're not timestamped so I don't know which was the first one but clearly quite a few came in um which I really really appreciate um I would love to repeat all the things I said about the processing foundation and why you should donate but I will just leave you with this the link is in the video description go here read the medium post here read um read uh also take a minute to read uh making the space for the future p5js by um Lauren McCarthy all of you are saying you would donate but you can't this is why the processing Foundation exists to make this stuff for everyone um we're just asking people who can if you can't don't worry of course that's your you're just the use of the tools and the enthusiasm and being a part of this um everything is um everything you do is a contribution um I wish I could speak more eloquently but it's been four and a half hours um uh you can still this donation um link on YouTube will be live even after today in the with the archive of this live stream um I will keep an eye on it I don't think I get a notification or anything but I will tweet at me or write a comment if you donate um and um also if you have a way of reaching out audience and encouraging them to donate whether through the donor box or if you make YouTube videos you can attach this fundraiser to your YouTube videos please um please uh uh please reach out I would be glad to help you get this fundraiser as part of your YouTube videos all right I'm going to go have some lunch I'm going to take a break I'm going to have a nice weekend I'm going to have a little bit of a holiday break I will be back making more tutorials sometime in 2020 there's a couple little trailing things that might appear on the channel uh between now and then that I haven't um been able to uh publish yet and thank you all so uh there you go for for oh my microphone is still on muting myself now I'm going to check if there's any donations though I will say it quick thank you sorry for everyone I only have one animation so I should get more animations like that don't say starting soon like thank that one should say thank you for watching so coming in 2020 more animations that actually say what's going on but this is the end it's over let me just make sure there isn't another donation I know the microphone is still active I'm just here checking to see if there's any more donations because I have I will say a thank you no more donations goodbye everybody for for
