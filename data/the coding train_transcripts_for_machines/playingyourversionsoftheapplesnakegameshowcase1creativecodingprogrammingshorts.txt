enter to begin today I am going to feature the passenger Showcase from coding challenge basic snake game let's take a look at Jason ruddock's version rather than just displaying text it's using the graphics mode it's added a maze a scoreboard welcome and game over screens and multiple levels with increasing difficulties I really love the way that Jason has organized all the code into a set of subroutines and used remarks so that you can easily parse what's going on Sebastian lagg has such a talent for making beautiful images with code and it's kind of amazing to see what he did with such a simple low resolution environment take a look at this beautiful animation for when the player needs a little time to contemplate defeat Gregory kaisman made a version for the Commodore 64 and Donovan adapted the game with a very clever twist the food only appears from time to time so the player has to remember where to find it next time I'm going to feature the wave function collapse showcase so take a look at the video and add yours
