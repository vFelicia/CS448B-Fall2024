hello here we are in this video I'm going to attempt to take this threedimensional toy train and put it into my computer somehow not really and the topic here is that I want to this is in my WebGL 3d p5.js serious I want to look at load model so what if I had a file on my computer that had all the geometry for a train in it or anything else so you might know about 3d modeling maybe you use some type of 3d authoring environment to create your own 3d miles models this little piece just fell off um maybe you you go to a website and you found somebody else's 3d model to download but what there are lots of different file formats so that's sort of the question but the file format that you want to look for to import a 3d model into p5 is obj let's go over the computer and see what happens alright so on this computer I already have a file called Train obj thank you Bram for helping me find this file Bram in the patron group I'm gonna I'm actually just look at this file look at this so this was originally made in Rhino that's like a comment and look at all this stuff that's actually what's in a 3d model it's just V all of these vertices these are all the XYZ coordinates so you can make your own geometry algorithmically with primitive 3d shapes or begin shape vertex and shape but here's a file format that has a lot of vertices in it already that's I love looking at that so how do I get that into p5 well I still have a kitten in this let's leave the kitten here just maybe we'll see what happens with that I'm going to make a variable called train and in preload I'm going to say train equals load model so the load model function is just like load image loads image data load JSON loads JSON data load mile model loads a threedimensional model and there's no reason why I couldn't replace now box with drawing that model which is with the function model train let's see what happens oh shoot all right I failed here what went wrong uncaught maximum cost I render GL flatten mmhmm okay so I have figured out why this broke and unfortunately it broke because that model that I'm loading the train model is actually quite a complex one there's no reason why it can't work and it could it should at some point work there's actually at the time of this recording there is a github issue on the p5.js repo so if you're watching this in the future go and check this maybe it's been resolved but the way that I fixed it right now is I just reverted to an earlier version of p5 the version that I'm now running is 0.5 point one four so let's now have this ready and I'm going to hit refresh there's the train spinning there's my 3d miles right now interesting enough why is it spinning like a crazy thing let's go and put the box back in let's add the box as well now you can sort of see what's going on the so one thing that's important when you're importing a model is well what is it the models own internal coordinate system and in this case this model that I happen to import it is not centered itself around 0 0 and this is gonna make it much harder for me to use I could do like some kind of offset I'm like manually like maybe I could figure it out I could say something like right before I draw the model let me translate like maybe negative 200 or like 100 along the xaxis that went that's closer let me try like negative 200 so that got that got further away so maybe it's not that so I could stir I could try to debug and figure this out but what instead what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna revise or perhaps Alka Alka has already done this for me Alka in the chat has revised the model to sent around 0 so hold on for a second I'll be right back with a magical new model ok I'm back and I'm going to change I now have a new obj file train corrected we can look at it actually it might be worth just taking a peek at it because we can see look at these numbers now they look more like they're smaller some negative ones so maybe is actually centered around zero zero so let's try this model let's go back and load it we can see okay well that box is still there so the train is now stuck inside the box let's actually let's get rid of the box and let's there we go so there's the Train so what should I do now hopefully this is like an open source model often like the source but I'm gonna post this code hopefully now everyone watching can make some goofy like 3d animations with smoke coming out of the train or that sort of thing but let's let's try to just experiment with this a little more so for example what if I just have the ambient light have some color so you can see that this model was going to respond to the light what if I were to give it a different material it's like what if I try specular material that's white right can you see does that look different I can't really tell so did that material apply I don't know let's see normal material let's give it a normal material which is that debug rainbow color yeah so the material normal material is certainly applying it's unclear to me whether the specular one did or it's just hard to see so you can see that that's working and I don't see any reason why I couldn't texture the train let's try that oh my goodness it's the kitty cat train all aboard the kitty cat train sorry you know I have to try it some attempt to make these videos more interesting it's mostly failed attempts but so you can see this actually like the P 5 somehow decided it would texture this in some arbitrary way so wonderful so I I could do more with this I would love to you know figure out how to make the Train move and then have some smoke come out of it maybe the smoke could be Sears with cloudy textures or something like that but I'm gonna leave that to you as an exercise now you can see that in addition to making geometry with your own primitive shapes you can also load a model from an obj file and something I still haven't shown you which I do intend to do is how to make a custom piece of geometry using begin shape and end shape thanks very much you
