so this is the last video about particle systems and I just want to kind of tack on one little additional thing which is you know it's probably very clear to you from looking at all these examples and seeing everything that I've put up here in processing is that visual design and it's not really part of this video series you know all the examples we have these gray circles with black outlines white background whatever but one thing we should mention is you know if you look at how particle systems are traditionally used and I'm not it says just thing you use them in a traditional way but they're used to create smoke effects fire effects starry glowy wonderful kinds of things and typically this is not done by just drawing grey circles with black backgrounds typically this is started by drawing each particle as a texture as an image as some bitmaps set of pixels that you've designed in a particular way so I just want to briefly talk about this and show a few things in a couple examples so this is example 4.8 which is just showing you it's kind of reworked the particle system a little bit put it on the bottom instead of the top instead of gravity pulling things down things are pushing up and the particles are fading out more quickly and they're all just drawn as white circles and you know there's a wind force here that I can move the mouse around if I stand out of the way and it affects which way this is blowing and it kind of has a little bit of a smoky perhaps fiery effect if I were more clever I would add some oranges and reds and maybe I could get it to be fire so one thing that we could do is something like this to make it kind of even more of a small clock Walla T is instead of drawing circles we could draw images so if I go to this processing sketch and look at the data folder there are a few different PNG files here and I'm sorry these those it's not very big you can see I've got these PMG files which were made in Photoshop this one I borrowed from a flight for a for example colorful and this one I just made in Photoshop and if I open it up and zoom back out here we can see here that what is this PNG sorry what is this PNG but it is a bright Center with get darker and darker towards the outside and more transparent so instead of a circle where the white color is uniform all the way throughout it fades away as we get out towards the edges so if I go back to the code and instead of drawing an ellipse with a fill I draw that image with a tint right remember this is what it looks like with the ellipse now if I hit save and run again we can see this is what it looks like with that P&G so I don't know how much you can tell here the difference but you can see this kind of smokey like quality to it with the PNG allows it to be more I don't know blend it in somehow anyway so this is kind of part one of this the other thing I just wanted to mention so that's drawing an image now how do you do that where do you put the image in our examples there's really very little here we just see now that the particle itself has a P image variable but one thing I want to point out about this is you might have thousands of particles you don't want each particle to load the image in its constructor you don't want to load the image here you would not want to put particle load image texture right or whatever it is whatever the name of that file name is you want to load the image just once for all of the particles and that's done in this particular example in setup load image is called and setup it's passed that image you can't really see because I can't scroll up boy watching this one it's passed to the particle system the particle system knows about the image for all the particles and the particle system itself when it makes new particles gives the particle that image so that's just another structural thing that I wanted to mention this is just like what we did I've totally screwed this up just like what we did with forces we the force was passed in the particle system which is passed to all the particles we want to do the same thing with the image we want to make sure we load that image only once in setup so I'm going to change something I'm gonna change this to colorful and I'm gonna run this with a PNG that was taken from a flight for a for example and if we go and look at well what does that PNG look like it looks like this you can see it's got a couple rings of color and it fades away towards the outside so this is looking kind of insane here but let's let's let's why do I want to use this image so one thing is it's very big and so I'm just going to mental note prepare for these videos I'm just gonna draw it a little bit smaller you can see okay well I kind of have this red thing maybe it looks more like fire maybe that's too small I'm gonna make it a lot bigger I'm messing around but what did I want to emphasize here I want to emphasize something this first of all it's running very slow and when we start to use image textures this is a time where it might make sense to go to Processing's P to D or P 3d render the P 2d renderer for example it uses OpenGL hardware acceleration which is very very fast at drawing images many many images to the screen and you can see here now we have our kind of colorful particles it looks like there's maybe a glowy Center but something about this isn't quite right it's not the effect that I was going for if you've looked at any flight 404 examples of particle systems from years ago and processing or the work that's like that that's in cinder these days you'll see there's something else going on and that trick is called additive blending try to get through this video before I sneeze the trick is called additive blending additive blending is available in P 2 D and P 3d it is a blend mode what does it mean when colors are blended instead of averaging them together or other types of blending you could do they're added together as colors are layered those RGB values are added on top of each other meaning the color gets brighter and brighter so if I just change this to blend mode add and run this again you can see now I have this kind of glowy fiery thing and I would like to tweak this more and allow the particles to live longer and play with the size and the color but this additive blending is a real way that you can make textures and it works really well to get this kind of glow effect or a fire effect the blend mode that you choose of how you blend the particle textures on top of each other can be really important so let me do this video later but we will leave it for now and so here's your exercise for yourself one thing I would say that these examples don't do if all the particles have the same texture how would you make a particle system where you pick randomly from an array of possible P images that's something in might and how and you might just try like give yourself a goal like I want to make it look like fire I want to make it look like snow I want to make it look like rain what does it goal pick a goal and try to design particle textures that really create that feeling or that quality of that that and when you make something I don't know share it with the world email it tweet it I don't know write a note and put it in the mail and I'll get the note and I don't know if I have an address but whatever so okay so that's just what I wanted to mention you can look at these examples fourpointeight there's an additive blending example 4.9 that you can look at for this as well and I'm going to press a button here and whatever stuff is mess
