hello I am here today in this video to talk to you about something called database as service so I want to put it in the context of kind of web web programming in general and you know this video is kind of sandwiched in the middle it's you know you could just be here just to learn about databases and JavaScript and all that sort of stuff but it's in the middle of this programming from a toz playlist and so I'm going to sort of set this topic in that context so I've been using a variety of different tools and libraries and Frameworks in making web applications around text in this video series one is called uh p5js which is a client Side Library for JavaScript and it has lots of nice things in it like drawing to the canvas and some Dom manipulation and it lives on a client like which I will draw as like a little laptop here you know and happens in the browser now another aspect that I have explored is something called uh node.js also a framework for writing code in JavaScript for server side programming so and the the code that we've run runs on a server now if you've watched some of my previous videos you would have noticed that I'm running both the client in the server on one computer just to like mess around and try stuff and learn stuff and because I'm just you know coding um but if you were deploying making a big thing and putting it out into the world you would actually put it on some server somewhere whether you have like an Amazon account or your own account or whatever and then you might have lots and lots of clients all connecting to that server now one of the things I explored is that on the server you could store data uh one of the examples I made just writes data to a like a local text file a Json a JavaScript object notation text file that sits here so you can think of the simplest scenario here is like you made a game that people are playing in p5js and whenever they finish the game it sends the score to the server if it's a high score it gets saved into the file and then if somebody else comes to play later they can request and see the current high scores and their score can get saved into a file so this is one something I've done and I've demonstrated and if you can go backwards in video time you could see the pieces of this you could get more sophisticated than just a local text file you could actually have you know a proper so to speak database and you would need that if you have large amounts of data or if uh you needed you know you know encrypted passwords and all sorts of things and you want additional functionality a database and you could learn mongod DB or couchdb and you can install that and get a node package and all that what I'm here today in this video to show you the beginning steps of how to work with something called database as service so what if there something else existed oh I I I made it a cloud nothing is a cloud there is no there are clouds it rains but there's no there's no clouds in the internet so this other let's let me erase that I don't know where my Eraser went uh here it is um okay so uh there's another what if there were another server somewhere so this is a server that's you know you have some ownership or account over this is your client but what if there was a server that wasn't yours and that you could actually eliminate this and you could just say hey save this data for me could I get this data back and you wouldn't have to write the server the node program set up the database it would just exist and it would have an API and interface for you to make calls to it so this is what's known as database as service exclamation point database as service so this is incredibly useful because you don't have to have you don't have to like set up configure this is like easy just like you know hey can you say you know hey databases service could you save this for me and I might ask you for it later so now there are lots of examples of this a particular product that I'm going to show you in this video and the next and the next one is something called Firebase which is uh it wasn't originally uh created by Google but I believe Google Google acquired it so it's a it's a Google service um there is um there's something that I really like also called sheet Sue uh for um turning a Google sheet into an API that you can save data to and request data from um I'm going to sheet shetu doesn't have a lot of great free options as far as I can tell maybe somebody can correct me in the comments and I'll come back and do a video about it but as far as I can tell you can only have one Google sheet and 300 calls per month so I'm going to focus on Firebase which is has quite a lot that you can do with it without a paid account um you know there's limits to that of course um and then there are probably other examples that you can add in the comments if there are things that you use that I should explore in a future video or that sort of thing so this is uh oh but I should mention the last thing I want to mention here in this kind of introductory explanation is you also don't have to cut this out so you could still have your node program and your node program could also connect to databases service so there's you know it just sort of depends if you only need client side code and you just want to save some data and you don't you know security isn't too much of an issue for you um this is going to be just fine uh if you have some other server side components but you don't want to deal with setting up your own database you could still use the databa service and the server and your client everything is possible so um this is my sort of introduction to why this matters and in the next video I'm going to just get started with a how to set up a Firebase account and how to send data to it from p5js or any JavaScript program really and how to request data from any JavaScript program and I'll see you in the next video if you're interested
