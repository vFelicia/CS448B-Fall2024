okay so we're moving along here we're gonna look at a bunch of different boxes the examples a bunch of different topics bunch of things different things you can do and each video hopefully will be somewhat short just touch on a key concept in box2d look at the code example move on to the next one so one of the things we missed if you recall from our first box of these scenario is we figured out how we could add make our objects move around and respond to box 2d physics what if we want an object that doesn't move what if we want a fixed object we could see two scenarios of that here one is look at these platforms these are actually shapes bodies that don't move static bodies and the second one is actually this thing called to change shape which is allowing us to make this kind of terrain like thing so I want in this video we're just gonna look at both of these talk them through and kind of quickly look at the code so the good news is this one incredibly simple so if you remember we had these steps right well we need to define a body create a body create a shape create a fixture baloise all those steps we worked it out for the fixed shape that doesn't move for that platform we only need to change one thing in step one we need to have a static body instead of a dynamic body we just need to make it static so let's look and see how that's done in this particular code example so I'm gonna try to pull it up now here it is so if we look at it so okay so remember what things I want to point out about this by the way is this example also has a box and I'm just pointing out a small little detail which is that all of that code for all those five steps which we do in the constructor sometimes a little useful just to make a little function that kind of takes care of all that so this this this example actually has a make body function and if I scroll down into the make body function you'll see highlighted here this key line of code the type of this body is dynamic and that's for all these squares that are moving around the screen but what about for these platforms if we go into the boundary class the boundary class is very similar the only difference is the body type is static so you can make objects with a dynamic body type or a static body type the static ones won't move so if you're making pinball and all the bumpers are static and they don't move those would all be static body types so that's really easy this one is a bit more complex so for this type of scenario where you want to make a terrain are a chain an edge a some type of surface that has an edge that cannot be penetrated this is a scenario where we we have we are making it's a static body but the the way that this is defined is with a shape a particular kind of shape and that kind of shape is called the change shape so and we're in the right place here if we look through all these steps this is the only step in the in the scenario that we're modifying so we're making a body we're defining the body creating the body we've got to make the fixture all those parameters and attach the shape to that fit to the body but create shape is what we're going to change and the kind of shape we're gonna make is a change shape so our first line of code for that section would just look something like this creating a change shape object that's what we're gonna do instead of a polygon shape change shape got it okay so how do we make so polygon shape well remember we did set as box and we gave it a width and a height a change shape is kind of an interesting thing so let's just look at this scenario where we have this is much like that game I don't know if you ever play the game tiny wings where you have this nice terrain that the birds kind of like scoot along and jump up and fly right what if you wanted to create a terrain like this well in order to do that you would want to know what are all the points along this path what are all of these vertices and it turns out to make a change shape what you need is an array of vector objects that define all of those vertices along the path so if I were to make a vector object and I can call this vertices and I would say it's going to have I'm gonna have three vertices in my array of vector objects all I would need to do is say hey let me give vertex zero something vertex one something vertex two something so we make a change shape we make an array of vertices and then overhead out of room we're gonna stick those vertices into the changing so that's the process now one thing that's very important here is remember something important there from that one thing that's important something important one thing that we cannot forget is what type of coordinates do we need to put here world coordinates so we might know the pixels of our terrain we need to convert those from pixels to world before we stick them in the array and before they go into the chain shape so let's go take a look at that example and see exactly how this is implemented so here's the code for the actual example that's running this particular sketch and you'll notice something a little strange about this I'm using an ArrayList of ektu objects and I'm putting the pixel locations of all those vertices into that ArrayList so what gives right over here we said hey we need to make an array of vector objects and we need to make sure we convert those and put those into the gene chain shape well I've done something a little bit strange in this example and there's certainly alternate ways that you could organize your code but one of the things that we're gonna need to do later is draw that that that terrain that chain shape on the screen so what I'm doing is I have this ArrayList where I'm gonna stick all of the vertices in pixel coordinates in that ArrayList to save it for later when it comes time to draw it but when I create the shape the chain that's actually gonna be in the box to the world to the box so you can compute the physics that's when you'll see here if I scroll down a little bit here what we're doing is we're saying hey let's make an array the same size of our ArrayList and let's take every vertex from the ArrayList convert it to world coordinates and put it in that array and that's what will make the chain with so this is kind of redundant we have two arrays one for the pixel versions one for the world versions but I find that useful that you don't have to then later at you know can be converting back and forth if we just keep track of both and two separate arrays the change shape knows the world coordinates the ArrayList knows the pixel coordinates and makes things sort of simple so you can see here we're making the change shape where we're making me array and then here's the function create chain with that array and this is a little bit redundant but we're also telling it hey we want to use the entire array so in theory you have to give it the array of vertices for that change shape as well as how much of the array you want to loot use in this case the entire length of the array and you can see that all the rest of it is making the body definition creating the fixture all of that so and then when it comes down to drawing it and the display function we're doing something very simple begin shape and shape and drawing of vertex for every single one of those a vertex for every single one of those spots in the chain shape okay so these are two ways that you can create static objects in box2d one is with a with bodies that are fixed that are static and the other is with the change shape so two exercises you can think of doing one is hey try to make one where those platforms aren't flat but at an angle how do you set the initial angle of a body and make sure you draw it at the right angle give that a try and another exercise you could do is this is just hardcoded values for the vertex vertices but what if you used a sine wave how would you create a shoot and I'm gonna if I was faster on the draw here I would have had this ready but how would you do something like this where and this is a very tiny window I apologize for that where the edge is actually a sine wave or could you use Perlin noise to create a mountainous like terrain or how would you even do something where you create this nice you know perla noise to create something like this like the the train and something like tiny wings so give those things to try there's there's answers that you'll find in the github repository if there's not simply an email already to comment and the next video we're going to look at I think we're to look at making more complex more complex forms either custom polygons or bodies that are made up of multiple shapes
