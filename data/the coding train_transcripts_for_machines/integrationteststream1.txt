do so do do do do do do me test one two oh my god rushing around getting all the cables set up are you hearing me i hope you are i hope you are you're about to see me in three two one hello good morning happy friday on the coding train without fail as soon as i begin speaking gloria pickle my wonderful uh corgi beagle mix sleeping quietly right on the floor in front of me i start to talk loud she gets up goes downstairs runs away that's probably the appropriate reaction to me beginning to speak uh hopefully you are not all just getting up and running away though i would understand where i am in brooklyn new york it is absolutely a beautiful day outside um a little bit hard to motivate myself to get this stream started this morning but i'm here i'm doing it i'm gonna be here for about two hours and then i'm going to enjoy the rest of the beautiful day and hopefully the weekend um this marks a um really for me we're approaching the beginning of summer which is um my favorite season mostly because my uh day job work commitments are quite light and i can focus on um coding and other things too um let's see i am uh i finally i think you know it's been weeks and months of this live poll application which i think i finally have it down you hopefully are seeing above me you can scan this qr code to go and vote you can also go to um i posted this link into the chat let me do it again live dash poll dash coding dash train dot glitch dot me slash vote dash now how's that for url i'll put it right here into the chat if you go to that url you can vote and your vote will be registered immediately on this overlay in open broadcast studio this is a web application project that i began um i don't actually recall when although i could look at the github history uh let's see i've got it open here which i'm not bothering to show you this does it show me when the first commit was let's see there's been 103 commits and if i scroll all the way down older there's got to be a better way of doing this oh wait wait i can go to the i really should show you what i'm looking at okay hold on everybody let me show you what i'm looking at uh insights um and i think if we go to commits you can see that looks like i began this project in september of uh what year is it now 2021 i think it's right so a little less than a year ago probably september 2020 um and uh if i go here and look at contributors you can see that a bunch of people have added and various things um but um in particular uh foxy over here has been doing an incredible amount of work to build this live poll application um and here it is so and just in time just in time for me to finally have it my act together and have it up and running and the poll going before i begin to live stream just when i just when i'm there finally when i'm there youtube no no fanfare no announcement no no no no no just you couldn't let me know drop a little note in there in the email hey dan you're like a youtuber you have this channel it has like a million people subscribed to it even though not so many of those people even watch the videos but they seem to click that button we wanted to let you know about this new feature pulling embedded builtin polling in the live stream chat nope nope just noticed it this morning there's a new button i pressed it i made a poll and so i've got two polls going and if i look over here i can see the results of the builtin youtube poll maybe i can show that to you um which i'm feeling very sad about those results so i'm gonna have to put my finger on the scale here my thumb on the scale i believe is the expression um i'm opening my live stream page uh and here it is you're seeing you know yeah you know dan ception over here uh coding transception um this is the builtin poll which has 247 votes is that more than uh it is more than the 92 votes that i'm getting with my live poll application and uh well you know i don't know if this is really good use of polling or bad use of polling is the question i have to ask for you if anybody gets that reference but um um basically what i am looking at here is um that oh yeah so uh you know the people who are vote voting in this poll probably like the embedded poll so they're more likely to vote for the builtin youtube poll but folks if you're watching this right now and you have not yet voted in the embedded youtube poll you should absolutely um vote for the coding training live poll app because look look how beautiful it is look how much work went into it it even has does youtube have a qr code for their embedded poll i don't think so they just happen to have it in the page itself making it very convenient to vote enoch says please shader tutorial that is kind of coming and i'm thinking also an interesting discussion about d3 and p5 which i do want to address i have a very specific point of view about this um i forgot what i was talking about uh hi cat king hi eamon hi lokesh a high shadow cow whenever i forgot what i'm talking about what i'm gonna say i could just say hello to people in chat all right let's start with what is going on in coding train news there's no breaking news here but um well actually i should i should begin news to you this sunday father's day um and um i have a sponsor for today's live stream today's live stream is sponsored by curiosity stream the reason why i was thinking about father's day and curiosity stream is i am a father i love to watch documentaries i already have a curiosity stream account so i'm not asking anyone to get one for me but if you were looking for a gift for the father in your life or any family loved one you know father schmother kind of day you know this should just be like loved ones day friends day somebody you want to say you care about them day um and boy i've got some really serious uh video feedback stuff going on here um if you're looking for a gift i would really suggest curiositystream.com codingtrain the thing about it is it comes first of all it comes with nebula watch nebula which is a streaming service that i am a part of with a bunch of other youtubers and um they're running for father's day a 41 uh exclusive discount on the curiosity stream and nebula bundle so nebula by the way is like i forget three or four dollars a month something like that you're getting it for free for less um so with the discount it's 11.79 i'm reading off my notes here for the entire year and i'm gonna um come back later and show you some documentaries and curiosity stream that i would recommend and uh please i um get it for yourself or get it for the the loved one in your life as a gift and i've got to turn on my do not disturb notifications while live streaming is a really bad idea do not disturb is on all right so um wash your hat yeah oh you can really see how gross it is that's terrible i need a new hat you know i wear this hat all the time um and it's um it got i guess i was out in the rain i think that's really just like i don't know what that is like why there's that sort of orange well anyway let's fix that yeah is there some sort of ai machine learning model that i can use to fix my hat what just happened did we just break the live poll app oh no let's go back to here should refresh hmm oh boy this is not good okay hold on a sec everybody let's examine this what just happened here um i'm going to go up it's back ask and ye shall receive all right um so i um you know uh uh am well known for wasting a ton of time on live streams and not actually doing anything and i think i need to rectify that a little bit i mean there's there's a time for sort of goofing off and my rambling voice and reading random numbers and saying hello to people in the chat um but um yeah this is a great comment um what comes and legendary i'm just gonna call you legendary uh in the uh supporter uh discord here channel what comes between d3 and p5 n4 so somebody would create the n4 library um is that mug made to look upside down i don't know what's going on here i was trying to say something it's a very apt point because here i was just getting distracted and who knows what talking about but i would like to have two coding segments each live stream break in the middle as well as some regular segments like showing community contributions and i have a new regular segment which i will just begin with right now don't have a theme song for it let's try this one my new segment on the coding train live stream is reading your comments that's right i'm going to go through my recent videos from the coding train and take a look at some of the comments you the viewers have posted answer your questions comment on them enjoy them feel warm glow inside because of how happy you may be or who knows what we shall see and in the five minutes i spent preparing for today's live stream i went and found a few comments already that i wanted to take a look at um so um thanks again curiosity stream today's sponsor it's really good just like i when i'm like on i i guess i i really should be like do my sponsor segments when i'm supposed to be doing my sponsor segments but i just want to say like i subscribe to a lot of streaming services i always go right to the documentary section typically that's what i'm interested often and watching first curiosity stream this is all all documentaries i don't have to go to the documentary section it's subsections because of different kinds of documentaries um all right now all right so uh let's see let's look at today's a first comment first comment is on my recent um 5.2 seeking a target so first of all i wanted to say something about this a video so if you haven't watched it yet it's still time you could yeah you could probably watch it now and come back in 13 minutes and seven seconds and i'll still just be here like talking about like how there's a dot between views in june or something you won't have missed anything and to be honest who's who's watching my videos on 1x speed right you're at least on 1.5 it's intolerable to me to watch myself at 1x the recommended speed is 2x um that said um i there were several comments along the lines of wow this is exactly the same video as this one you released or you've covered this topic in at least four other videos all of that is true uh you know i am burdened with glorious purpose i'm traveling through time and space different variants of me you guys watching the loki show oh so good what is the path by the way from coding train to marvel i gotta figure that out i don't think i'm gonna it's gonna be a while before i get there probably never of course but i don't know does anybody have any ideas for me um some people are saying they watch it on uh 1x that's surprising to me anyway i was saying uh this is a variant i am a kind of going in a time loop redoing videos i don't know if this is so great i mean i do have my sort of like i have my material and that's kind of ran out of it and a lot of it's like old and the lower quality or i did in a different language um so um i um i i i wanted to redo this um specifically um and and really like have a recent welldone sequence tutorials from the nature of code so um you know most if you're watching the live stream uh it's possible that you're brand new but you're probably pretty familiar with my stuff but this is what i'm talking about so um i am just working through a lot of this is re content that i've covered before but i'm kind of covering it anew with whatever the latest version of the p5 library is today uh new thumbnail design a little bit higher production value additional examples a little more thoughtfulness in terms of the way the material is presented interestingly enough i have also gotten some comments it's generally skewed um the other way but i also get the comment of i miss uh or like this i don't like this style of video anymore i don't know how else to put it um i me you know my older videos have no editing not such great audio um and um no extra overlays or references or flying in examples or diagrams to illustrate a point so um i would like to be able to keep a balance of different kinds of styles of content i do think that authentic no editing just build a whole project from start to finish is very valuable but i do think for these tutorials i think they're improved with the new production style that said i'm not 100 sure about that it certainly is more takes longer to make it's more expensive to make and more involved to make but i would be certainly curious anecdotally to um here marcus says i would like if you would also hide the older videos so i'm i'm really loath to delete a video off of youtube i suppose i could make some older videos that this these have now replaced unlisted but generally speaking my approach is to leave everything as is where it is but kind of delink to it from playlists and other websites and material that i'm publishing because i always have like a syllabus or a book or a webpage or a blog post so then i will i will link an unnamed username who uh thank you thanks has helped me title the integration test uh stream um old ones was the one locus says that got me into your channel month on says love the new videos old ones are gold there's a lot of different comments here um so um but what was i saying ah so i just um deprecate essentially the older ones the the the canonical place if you're looking for the coding train cannon um the coding train cannon is here on the coding train website now there is a top secret not even close to tops here because i talk about it every stream uh project that is going on right now to completely redesign and rebuild the coding train website that will be launching probably sometime in the fall it will always be a kind of continuous incremental a project but a major facelift is happening and i'll talk more about that at some point soon um but this is where if you're looking for okay what are the sort of most recent uptodate recommended learning lists nature of code ml5 this is if i'm looking for like where do i begin like what could i watch where i need no experience whatsoever these three so um this is also where you know if i go i don't uh go to the coding challenge video i can find all of the code that goes along with every video uh running in the web editor i can see oh we have one we have an arnov arnov are you watching are you in the audience right now because we've now switched from going through your youtube comments which i haven't even gotten to the first comment yet to community contributions no record scratch stop i was doing my segment back to the segment i was doing 5.3 will be coming out soon i also want to thank this really shocked me because the um selfavoiding walk video the coding challenge videos tend to do fairly well youtube gives me lots of like gold stars and little confetti things like oh more viewers are watching your video than usual and then usually when i release one of my like tutorials that's in the middle of the sequence like oh no no viewers seem less interested maybe you should think about doing different content like youtube i i've got a thing i'm doing here you don't i mean just please be nice um but this one 5.2 i don't know it's not even 5.1 it seems to uh people are clicking on it and watching it so i'm quite um quite glad for that um right so diacron i want to address this comment diacron says i like the older style there's great value in seeing how the connections are made so even with so maybe i'm wrong about this maybe i'm i'm deluding myself but with the editing and added extra sort of visual information my goal is never to remove the interesting parts where i am struggling through or sorting through or figuring something out the only thing what i remove and and those of you who watch my recording sessions you can join as a coding trained member and i brought live stream the recording sessions um and if you join uh you can also go back and watch all the back catalog of them so i'd be curious here from those of you who watch those what your perspective is between watching those and what gets edited is you know um if i'm stuck on something for a long time it's not useful to have the video be an hour and 15 minutes so i try to like show the being stuck show the resolution if possible indicate the passage of time to get a sense of that relatable that relatable feeling but i think i could do still do more with that but um and the coding challenges i really it's really the intention the they're not like the tutorials in that i kind of know what the example is and i'm just kind of building and talking through it really more figuring it out anyway i don't need to go on and on about this we are at a segment my segment is reading your comments and i said about 10 minutes ago it was time for that segment and i opened the webpage was the first comment i was going to read and never even got to it so it's time for me to do that now and this first comment comes in from thomas shocker thank you for commenting on the coding train video so uh you know this is part of this is i want to do the point of the live streams is to have more kind of community interaction uh um with the viewers um and to sort of follow up on things that are in the video tutorials that are being published i also just maybe this will encourage people to comment because i do read all the comments and scan through them and i'm going to be trying to pick some out to highlight um on the stream so thomas asks our writes hi just watched your video thank you for all them thank you for saying thank you very nice and quick question why mag and i think that means set mag so the function is set the magnitude of the desired velocity to the maximum speed and not desired dot limit maximum speed well and there's a reply here i wondered the same thing if the target is close it doesn't need to go maximum speed towards it thank you rick for this it will still overshoot the target and oscillate back and forth the logic of arrive is needed to start allowing only have to avoid that but it will damp the oscillation so eventually stop on the target i think it is an improvement right so this is exactly the discussion to have a quick question why set mag and not limit there's no answer to that question the point of steering behaviors and autonomous agents as the coder as the designer of the system is to ask those questions what are the rules of the world that i'm building what are the desires of the characters in that world how is it that i expect and want them to behave and the definition if the definition of seeking a target is reach that target as fast as humanly or what's not human as fast as autonomously agentedly possible no matter how far or close you are the target could be right in front of my face and i just want to get there as fast as possible or it could be really far away and i just want to get there as fast as possible that is how i chose to define seeking a target in this particular video and it's not really how i chose because i'm basing all this work off of craig reynolds you know seminal paper steering behaviors for autonomous characters so with that definition set mag set the magnitude to maximum speed is always correct but you're right to point that out that the logic is sort of flawed because in a lot of cases maybe if you're getting close to something you don't want to be going so if you don't want to crash into it i mean it's very reasonable you want to be slowing down so the magnitude of your desired velocity shrinks the closer you get maybe after a certain point it's in the opposite direction maybe it's too perpendicular 90 degrees uh clockwise it's up to us to define how it is what the rules are for how these uh characters behave so in this case that's why i chose to use set setmag it's only on me if that was not clear although i i think this discussion is useful to have no matter how clear i might make it whether making it clear now um and um but you're absolutely right to wonder about this because in in i don't have these uh available for you to see yet but in 5.3 which will hopefully be released next week pursue evade are the behaviors i look at and in 5.4 i look at the arrival behavior arrive behavior and that really is um that's where limit but it's even it's even different than limit it's about um uh uh you know shrinking it according to distance um in a different way um does he know a python not really um i do not really know python but i would like to know it more um all right so that was that comment any other questions or comments about that how'd that go this is good i like this segment now we have another comment i think there's a point where i'm over using my theme music which isn't even my music by the way if you are a composer musician you do have somebody that i'm already working with need to reach out but i'm i'm looking to expand my musical selection next comment is from x nick this is also on 5.2 seeking a target x nick writes as always i love your content well x nick that is so nice to say i mean am i picking the ones that start with a nice compliment to myself no i really was looking for the ones with interesting things that i noted or highlighted but i do appreciate when they start with a nice compliment i'm just a human being who enjoys being complimented like anybody else the critical ones are actually uh constructive critical ones are very useful as well um um so thank you for those there's sometimes there's some mean meanish comments i'm very lucky and privileged to have an easy time on the internet relative to so many people who are much sort of worse targets for harassment i got no complaints here but you know be nice people one small nitpick detail for the character to be able to perceive its own velocity it has to be aware of its own coordinates in an absolute reference frame the canvas it would be more realistic for the character to use a relative reference frame when it perceives the relative motion where it perceives the relative motion of the target itself it would be more difficult to code yes but probably not that much difficult but perhaps more realistic so admittedly i'm not so sure i completely understand this comment i i i believe in this comment and i really appreciate it and i think if i were to rephrase it and and uh x nick i i i doubt that you're watching this right now but um if you are please chime into the chat or certainly be looking for um other oh x nick is there xnick i mean it's got to be the same it's gotta be the same x nick because you can only have one x nick on youtube you know there's no verified check mark speaking of which come on twitter i mean what's up what's a simple boy from baltimore maryland to do you gotta do to get verified on twitter i like going i'm gonna be 50 in a couple years how can i just be verified on twitter so i thought that's long i'm old tired why do i care about these things i don't know okay wait i was reading x6 comments so let me try to understand this i think um if i were to rephrase it what the vehicle is truly experiencing is not its own movement throughout this 2d world but everything in the 2d world movement relative to wherever it is so is it about thinking about the ways that i calculate the relative vectors always thinking of the vehicle's kind of core location as the origin point and its velocity essentially a zero and other velocities just being relative to its movement so i understand that conceptually but i feel like wouldn't the math ultimately end up being the same um i don't know um so to tell me wrong let's look at another oh i wrote the reply like oh there's a reply to this one good i think i wrote oh this is such an interesting point thank you um yeah because i i'm thinking about it um let's let's give this comment a heart um and there's some other lovely comments here uh from from uh monsieur alexander gulbu and vatula 64. uh so right now i'm just reading random comments that's not the point prepared comments um so i don't know i'm i'm looking to see if there's any further elaboration in the chat but i need to think about this one more but i really appreciate that comment and i i think that in the end uh for me this would be like a thought experiment exercise as part of my tutorials and material because i do think it adds a layer of complexity um it's not that it's unnecessary but that goes beyond where the way that i want to present the content um uh okay um sorry i'm reading the chat and sometimes interesting discussions are coming up but not discussions that make sense for me to refer to okay um moving on i have one more comment this is from the coding challenge 162 which will be a nice segue into looking at arnov's community contribution this year alexandra goldberg is here all right hold on i'm gonna address your comment therefore i think if i go back to here will i find it come on come on internet did the internet i mean the internet didn't break because you are hearing me if you are hearing me the internet is still working i love nothing makes me happier by the way than interacting with comments or community contributions or various things that people have contributed to the coding train and then seeing that person appear in the chat and i don't know why i'm not able to get this page to load i'm going to just take out the highlighted comment from the url seriously wow did youtube go down and uh did i just go through some kind of um time door for the time keepers on to me are they shutting me down are they pruning am i being pruned oh no which variant am i am i the sacred one i don't know youtube what happened to you okay i'm not gonna oh there we go i don't know what's going on um as you were for a second here i seem to be back 5.2 um all right let's take a look at monsieur alexander gulbu's comment since uh uh monsieur alexander gulbu is in the chat i'm very upset that your latest videos do not gain the deserved number of views likes comments ah again thank you thank you i think they do i think they get the deserved number of views likes comments either youtube algorithms are choking you it's a kind of a harsh way to put it or something else i think actually now i'm realizing i kind of addressed this earlier um so i really struggle with uh having a youtube channel with i think you know the term for this is evergreen content i mean it's not so evergreen because technology changes so rapidly but this video 5.2 isn't something that somebody urgently needs to watch or is about the events of the day or like a hot take on the new apple product that came out or whatever again no criticism that's what those are basically like the videos i like watching hot takes on new apple products um but i do think it's true the the youtube algorithm is not kind to people who want to release sequential tutorials and i have often thought about uh separating out into different channels but and kind of focusing on like a sort of like monthly or biweekly coding challenge project video that would sort of you know drive a particular chat but i don't honestly i don't have time to deal with that i'm just making the stuff that i make and enjoying the word but i suppose um i shouldn't be going on and on about this but i do appreciate that thought and i do think about it a lot and look at my analytics a lot i probably should just shut all that stuff off and not worry about it but you know i think if you for those of you when you share something with somebody else or that you made or you recommend watch this beginner playlist to learn to code that's a way that you can contribute and give back if you do enjoy the content and feel like uh more people should find it um but there's also you know there's lots of other people in this world making amazing tutorials and projects and coding so recommend those other people too please all right um what was the comment i was on selfavoiding walk oh this one is super interesting so one of the things i really struggled with in the selfavoiding walk was um thinking about um what is sort of the big o notation what is the algorithmic complexity the run time of an algorithm to find through brute force randomness and brute force brute force uh a self of i'm looking for um you know what does a selfavoiding walk look like a selfavoiding walk that spill that fills an entire uh twodimensional or could be threedimensional any dimensional space and um i sort of said informally it was sort of like a quick thought in the video uh it was n squared because it's n by n so there's n squared um you know spots in the twodimensional space and then at every spot it's got some number of neighbors so it has to try all these others and then each one of those i was like n squared factorial or something which i don't think and then i was like looking at some papers it was like there's no known way to quantify it but this is a pretty interesting comment that i will try to that i will read now there is an easy upper boundary of number of boy there's variance with this too variants for backtracking any valid walk is a starting point plus sequence of letters up down left right of length w times h or that's n squared minus one where w h is within height thus straight ahead you can say that backtracking will do less than w times h times 4 to the power of w times h minus 1 which is much less than n squared factorial that kind that's making sense to me right it's the maximum number from any place that you are of backtracking steps that you would have to take totally makes sense right there are only four possible ways so four to the power of how many backtracking steps which is much less next it's an easy to notice that after each letter there's exactly one forbidden letter after up you can't have down after l you can't r so for any place for fixed letters there are only three options okay therefore upper bound is w times h times four times three to the power of w times h minus two similarly in the end there's exactly one spot missing and the last two steps exactly two spots missing so upper bound but i think sometimes with the big o notation we're talking about a kind of average run time or worst case run time so i'm not sure how relevant that is but this is interesting w times h times 4 times 3 to the power of okay so in my do macintosh computers have calculators on them apparently they do uh can i make this like a science you funny you think i would know this uh scientific let's look at this okay so w times h uh let's oh i want to get this comment up uh here we go okay w times h times four is 64 times four um three like hold on three to the power of how do i do this three to the power of 62 here's a big number times what did we say 64 times 4. okay still a pretty big number but a lot less than the factorial yeah i xnick says i use the google search bar instead of the calculator i usually do too i don't know why i just decided not to this moment all right thank you for these comments um i really appreciate them um i hope to make this a regular part of live streams uh picking out and looking at a select group of comments on recent videos to address them answer questions i also would now if you have a thought about this i would definitely encourage you to come right onto the youtube page for the video and reply right there i've kind of got these noted so i'm i'm kind of interested to follow along the discussion and of course i always have to plug the discord which i should have a button here uh which will post a link to the coding trade discord in the chat all right it's 11 30. remember how i said i was gonna have i want to have two coding segments yeah i think i'll probably um do community contributions uh talk about the sponsor curiosity stream and then take a short break and come back and explore um what looks most likely to be p5 with d3 and i will address the comment which is that um i've seen something um so d3 and you know i'm going to come back to this i'll come back to this later i want to talk about why i want to use p5 and d3 together which again i'm not suggesting is the most appropriate or efficient or ultimate uh uh meaningful path for you the viewer to follow but it is of great interest to me for a few particular reasons which i will come to okay now it's time for the moment on the coding train where i share community contributions things that you have made um and um today what i would like to do is look at two the two recent videos that i published since the last live stream or within the last couple weeks so let's go to the coding train website um and let's go to selfavoiding walk all right so um this is the first community contribution thank you arnov to the selfavoiding random walk i'm really expecting there to be more i mean especially that 3d one with the rainbow colors so many possible visual variations that i think you the creative people of the internet could make make your little gift loop make your little video etc um but there's only one so far so um i encourage you please submit um you know you don't don't be shy you change just even a little something it will bring me so much joy to see what it is that you thought to apply um if you just got it running on your own computer and you want to document that share a link to your documentation of that ah it will make me happy there is no threshold for what you need to do to submit your community contribution all right so random walk with random colors random alpha and random size whoops so just as a reminder um let me look at oops sorry everybody oh sometimes and here i am about to sneeze about why did the internet break for me today what's going on on my computer like seriously okay to the challenge um i wanted to show just this as a reminder this is the example that uh i build in the coding challenge video so you can see it is a random walk i know i know i'm repeating myself but i always like to set context sort of assume that not everybody has like watched every video or every live stream and what is going on here is a entity is making random decisions to move left right up or down in this grid pattern every frame of animation and if it has been somewhere before it can't go there again and if it gets stuck where it has no options where to go it backtracks and tries a different direction and you can see here how it is getting sort of stuck in the corner fairly quickly which is a pretty typical result i thought actually in the version that i released that i changed it to um starting in the middle which i definitely prefer because it kind of has more room to sort of find its way around uh various parts without getting stuck as quickly so anyway i prefer that okay so um i um oh look this is a great question in the chat okay so so people are asking about the community contributions wonderful okay could you first of all exnick says could use d3 to display info about youtube videos exactly this is what i'm looking to do got a plan i will talk about it um where's the coding terrain community contribution tab again okay i will come to that hey da how you best hey dan if i use a lot of your videos to build something cool where should i contribute it that's a great question i don't actually i don't know so um what i would suggest um and maybe some of the mods moderators and folks who help manage the website will run away in here um i would pick one of the videos and just submit it to that one maybe like whichever one's the most recent one um and then just in your documentation you know whether it's you're linking to a uh whether it's just in the code comments or a blog post or a video or whatever just include more context and information uh about the different videos you drew from because that's interesting for me at least personally to know i wouldn't get too hung up on about it just submit it um we'll help you figure it out if it's in the wrong place um you could submit it in multiple places but i think i would prefer not to have that because i think that new systems we're trying to build hopefully will it wouldn't make sense to do that um and uh hamiltonian cycle i keep keep hearing about that i do want to do that um but um let me just address the question and chris is asking if any plans for react angular view no no plans kind of not really a frontend web development channel person thing i mean i'd love to do all this stuff but i i want to stay in my lane of kind of creative exploration of algorithms and graphics and interactivity you know i do serverside stuff and databases and apis but that's in many ways uh uh tools to further explore the sort of creative and nothing you can't be creative with reactiveview i mean it's just um quick prototyping maybe that's more what i'm trying to say i don't know i don't know how to answer that question so if you're looking to contribute basically on every page um there should be a link here uh add your own version it just takes you to and i don't know why it's asking me to sign into github and twofactor it's going to take you to uh an editing a file that you uh if you add your your metadata for your project into that file following the format um which isn't really selfexplanatory but if you go here under see how i have a little video that walks you through it and some extra information here most of the time it is so it'll show up here under coding train website uh pull work website and then if i go to pull requests um you know if i go to closed we can see um did i just get a new member or something i'm getting some flashing lights um um if you go here game of life community contribution like we can look at this one um you'll see this is how it works um and if we look here and see like files changed um you can see this is what um adiads added with the url and their url and source and it's um and thank you luis for your very generous and kind super chat hello to you in brazil um yes and there's coding garden for angular react view stuff so um anyway don't be alarmed if after you submit it you get a big red x of like it failed we have tests to check that the syntax is right we will swoop in i say we myself or uh grueselhouse is uh really takes a lot of thank you so much to nico does a ton of work uh managing these emerging these pull requests we'll swoop in to help you sort that out um but let's take a look i know i know i want to go to r knobs but since i'm here this also i really really appreciate this when in addition to submitting it to the website just in the comment on github you put a link to it because i like to review them sometimes before they get merged um and um and and so on and so forth and and thank you stig for your comment about me looking at comments agreed and i only want to do more of that okay so let's take a look at aditya's game of life coding um uh variation so okay so a couple things i like about this one is i believe uh well let me do it again so there's some uh additional thoughtfulness in terms of the visual design so um and i want to get the name correct um aditya has made some efforts to think about color um i like this soft blue one thing that you do want to consider i think is in sort of thinking about accessibility when you build stuff for the web is color contrast so i might be concerned that the contrast of these characters to the background is a little bit too light and contrast checker you can find these uh web content accessibility guidelines contrast checkers um to sort of see if um your the contrast ratio of your background and foreground meet certain minimum requirements for everybody to be able to read so that's one just a comment that i would have otherwise i find this color scheme to be quite beautiful i like the fact that okay well this is pretty awesome that i'm able to draw in my own cells and then hit run oh my god oh my god none of you heard that did you it was incredibly loud in my ear uh i'm gonna let you hear that but i'm gonna warn you to turn down your headphones i'm gonna turn the sound on and then i'm going to um let's set it to 50 so this is software i use called loopback to route the audio to the stream uh i don't have a physical mixer which would be nice to have uh maybe they'll upgrade someday so um let's see so when as soon as i hit this play button which i'm about to do now i'll count you down it started to play some sound three two one go okay so whatever the pattern i had before had a much more louder static so i think it's like somehow interpreting the changing state of the cells to tones so like adjusting the frequency i don't know whether it's using like envelope sound envelopes and changing the sort of attack or the decay that i was not aware was about to happen um this is called um oh no it just doesn't just yeah so one thing by the way is i would love more explanation so i this is amazing that there's a whole like interface here i can actually change the color for myself so there we go i can adjust the contrast perhaps that way i can have a delay i can mute the audio it shows me like the sort of population of how much um is and there's pause and what's this a library oh my god can i oh i thought maybe i could like drag these on so this is cool it's showing me the library of like things that happen in the game of life that is why i love all these interface elements i don't know what this does but for me what i would love to have here as somebody totally new is and i don't think you need to necessarily pollute this page like if you want the sort of design of this page to be minimal so certainly like a button that brings up a modal overlay that has an explanation or a separate documentation post where then you could sort of click about this sketch or something but i would really want i really want to understand more about one how is it i'm expected to interact and that could be you could say i don't want to tell you how it works i want you to experience this page without knowing and explore and discover on your own but i would at least like to know that that's your point of view um so um but this is really wonderful work and i'm actually thrilled that this is um um being shown um shown i wanna um see if i can pull something up something really interesting happens periodically with my videos and i'm just going into my analytics right now and i want to show you something just give me a second um no i don't want the real time shoot sorry i'm gonna get there i think this is interesting little inside baseball about how weird stuff that happens on youtube this is a video from 2017 and i'm just going to show you its views i'll see more and i'm going to do last 365 days so uh i don't think i am giving away uh giving away any proprietary information here i'm just looking before i show it to you let's see here talk amongst yourselves for a second i'm having trouble controlling my computer come on there we go there we go okay this is exactly what i want to show you here comes three two one so this is interesting because this is the uh these are the views a graph of the views for the last year of the game of life video so like what happened so it's like pretty normal like it gets like a few hundred views per day it's an old video you know there's some variation on one day there's like a little peak here where like 600 people watched it or whatever but then look at this all of a sudden recently the only thing i can think of is that veritasium which is quite a huge um youtube channel um recently released a video which made heavy references to the game of life and i was trying to think like oh maybe but but i looked through and like referrals and that kind of thing i couldn't find any other evidence to that but i do think this kind of this happens um periodically that certain older videos just start getting recommended and they kind of take off and um yes sadly john conway who invented the game of life um uh passed away last year due to covid um um but anyway i'm fascinated by this if anybody uh understands why and how this happens it usually comes and then it just like leaves like it'll be back within a week it'll be back to just this like little trickling a few hundred views per day um i think uh just to show you the full um lifetime since uploaded you can see here it's still a piddling like this is a huge sudden bump right here in this particular video right now but it still is relative to when it was first released right where you can see um you know where it was first released it had something like you know 11 000 views in one day but um it was de and chris is saying it was definitely derek's video that caused it okay um so that's good i should do it a little deeper dive and see but that's kind of interesting to note and and yeah um but um anyway if you haven't watched this one i think this is a pretty interesting example lots of stuff you could do with it and please contribute your community contribution now um let me close that out and go back to uh where i really was which was uh i was about to look at arnov's uh random walk with random colors random alpha and random size so you know basically you want your community contribution to be featured submit it to the most recent video because uh there's not a lot coming in and i get to look at them every week and i'll get back to looking at random ones already okay uh let me let's take a look at this i haven't actually looked at this one yet oh i love this i love this so random colors and random alpha so we're seeing i can't to me i don't think so this i don't think this is there's nothing i'm not saying this that there's something wrong with this but just to be clear i don't believe this is a selfavoiding walk i believe this is a based off of like this for the first example in that video where i start to just look at how i might visualize the history of how many times uh the walker has landed in a given spot i just do that through alpha here we're seeing sort of color and size um it does does feel to me like i wonder part of me wonders if we there might be some more um compelling or meaningful um results if instead of using randomness for how you draw the circles in the colors that's actually tied to some data of the system so for me one of the things i like about the thinking about the random walk is the thing that's random is the step it chooses to take but what if that you had a constraint that was the only thing you were allowed to have randa and every other way you choose to draw whether it's shape color size speed etc um has to come from some other logic and that that i think is actually you know today's session being something about data visualization i think is really important to consider we as human beings are looking for patterns and to describe meaning so i'm really just here trying to understand this and thinking green means something or pink means something so i think as an exerciser just constrain to yourself how could you you know is there's an irony here i suppose of me talking about this as a person who you know favorite book is a book of random numbers and reads from it regularly but randomness can be used as a crutch i think in design so uh it's a it's a tool and it can be used with great uh to achieve great wonder and beauty but also it can be overused or maybe maybe there's some sweet spot in the middle of him kind of controlled randomness or thinking about probability that also um and i i think a good example of this is like stochastic fractals or fractals that have this very highly regular order but some amount of randomness sprinkled into them okay so um but thank you for this arnov it's quite beautiful um i could really imagine this just being like a beautiful print um there's a lot of um you know nice background a large scale public projection lots of possibilities there thank you so much for sharing this okay guess what everybody um so um i want to take a moment before i take a a break and come back with the uh looking at some data visualization code in today's live stream and thank today's sponsor curiosity stream i'm going to play a quick ad for you from curiositystream from the founder of discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service so i i've talked about this before um many times a curiosity stream is a regular sponsor of the coding train it's one of my uh favorite sponsors they're all my favorite sponsors but boy actually well i really do love curious dream especially because um i happen to be part of a group of educational youtubers who are building something called nebula and you can find that at watchnebula.com which i'm just going to pull up here this is a streaming service service that has and i'm just going to go here under videos um it has a why oh boy i really gotta check this one from mike boyd um this week i learned to spin a baseball bat oh i'm so i know what i'm doing this afternoon um you can see uh probably some of your hopefully some of your favorites here um you know if you're looking for a way to like a subset of videos you might be interested in that are all you know a lot of this content is on youtube and nebula there's lots of nebula plus content um i would highly recommend you go check out watch network.com why am i talking about this curiosity stream which is a streaming service um for um uh documentaries nebula is a partnering with curiosity stream um nebula has adfree content experiments with all different kinds of content that actually has nebula originals tom scott's money is a really wonderful one so curiosity stream loves educational creators and supporting more educational content so uh nebula we worked out a deal with if you sign up at that coding train link curiositystream.com codingtrain not only do you get access for the entire year to curiositystream but you get nebula for free not a trial you will always have nebula as long as you're a curiosity stream member so my script here says for a limited time curiosity stream is offering a 26 discount but that's what my script says that's not actually the discount the discount is higher than that it's 41 special father's day again i can't think don't buy it for me i already have it um but if i wanted my kids to get me they're too young they can't buy stuff themselves but they could tell their mom or friend's parent or grandparent to buy it for me to get a father's day gift i would want this gift and so you can get it for 41 off that's 11.79 that's less than 12 for the whole year it's like you know if you want to subscribe to the coding train membership thing that's way more than that so i hope you will consider um it helps me uh helps me out a little bit uh if you do choose to sign up it supports my channel um and so go to the link in the description um yeah oh but let me let's just i do want to um just take a minute here i have um a little text file where i was like keeping track of a bunch of my recommended documentaries that i think some of them are just things that i love like the secret lives of big cats and um there's actually a new one new curacao stream original it's about you know i'm kind of like a pet rescue person or my family is we have a lot of we have a foster cat we foster dogs but it's things called doug saves the world i'm going to get the name wrong but there's a new uh crusty stream original about um uh a drone pilot who rescues um animals but really i think probably escher's infinite perspective uh the magic numbers and uh and the joy of data these are there's a lot of documentary content that i think you would find inspirational for um that would be of interest to you but i just wanna let's just click on um uh uh i think you know if you're interested if you like the history of computing which is definitely a thing that i'm interested in also like um and you can see calculating ada the countess of computing and of course here's uh dr um hannah fry who is a host of a lot of the videos who's a really incredible science communicator nature's mathematics all about fractals let's look at um escher's infinite perspective um you know i can kind of like scroll through a little bit of this that you can see like the escher stuff is really amazing uh pleasure that mystified everyone for generations are you hearing that audio drawing with a hidden meaning yeah oh my accessible only so anyway this is like a library i mean the library of content here is incredible so i i gotta watch myself go on for too long about this uh i went way off script this time but uh hopefully you'll consider it uh again it's a 41 discount it's this weekend only for father's day um by the way you you're not seeing it on the banner here but um it says on the website it says 40 off if you go to my coding train link it's 41 off one percent better uh and also uh help support the coding train channel okay so i'm gonna take a break you got nothing else to do go to curiositystream.com codingtrain uh sign up i'll be back in about five minutes to explore uh visualizing data with p with d3 in particular i wanna look at their uh forcedirected force uh the the features of the api that allow you to do force directed graph so i'll talk about what that is and i'll be back in less than five minutes so do so do do and i am back okay so um it's time to actually do some coding thank you all for your patience um so one of the things that i'm interested in doing um in the future is building a map of all of my youtube videos and let me switch over here and thanks again to curiositystream for sponsoring today's coding train episode um i'm going to look for d3 force directed graph it's going to take me to an observable notebook page and this is the example that i'm looking at so this is using a particular data set from the les miserables story um and it's visualizing connections between different characters i will probably today i might even just use that data set just to have something um that i can you know pair it i would like to basically make this exact example but i want to change the drawing mechanism um and use p5.js to do the drawing and i'll talk about why for a second so a couple things um one is um i have um some examples of forcedirected graphs um using um different physics libraries i think i've tried it with matter.js and with toxiclips.js um but um i find that one of the things that i really struggle with is keeping any sense of kind of stability within the system and i've been looking at some of the d3 examples in particular i'm actually a little bit more interested in this disconnected graph so maybe this is actually the one that i should start with um i've been really sort of impressed with the sort of stability and physics of these systems and i would like to be able to play around with them however um i'm not i'm you know i certainly uh these examples are both using svg and d3 has a particular module built into it and i think simon pointed this out that d3 has a lot of hooks into drawing already you can create an svg and there's some advantages using svgs rather than canvas and you can um build and design the svg um um and you can sort of see things that might look familiar to you like line and stroke and stroke opacity very sort of p5 drawing like so that's great nothing wrong with that approach i'm interested in learning that approach too but i think a way for me to understand more about how d3 works is to pair it with something that i know really well like p5 and i do know that d3 also uh renders to canvas um these are you know probably these are probably pretty old articles like 2017 actually not that um so d3 also works with canvas and we can see things like you can create a container and then you can say canvas d3 select that container and append a canvas and then you can uh call various uh canvas drawing functions to bind the data um so this all you don't need p5 at all but i would like to explore this um in just to experiment to learn a little bit about d3 there's also a wonderful resource um p5d3 cookbook um which um um i don't know i forgot who created this but i definitely refer to it on multiple occasions which kind of looks at um pairing p5 and d3 and i would say that when i look at the when i've looked at d3 canvas examples with canvas ultimately what i want to do with p5 is nothing different than what they're already doing they're just using native canvas functions and tying them to d3 i just want to use the p5 canvas functions and tie them to d3 and see what happens okay change the stream title i probably should not the best seo but you know i can't can't help but like go with a meme all right let's figure out here how i want to do this i think actually interestingly enough let me try to just recreate this exact example with p5 drawing in canvas instead of but use d3 for the data parsing and the force layout and i'm going to look at this is going to be a very important page for me to look at um the various documentation for all the force stuff um so first thing i need to do oh boy one of these days i'll learn about all this like fancy new javascript way of doing things but let's just get d3 how to um d3 cdn i'll look for um is this what i want d37 oh boy oh boy it's been a while since i looked at d3 so the first thing i need to do is i already have the most recent version of p5 referenced in my index.html and i'm working outside of any online web code editor right now just to sort of manage things and now i am referring to d3 and i think if i just say console log d3 console log p5 i should see that both libraries have been loaded and p5 is loaded and d3 is loaded okay great so step one i've got about 45 minutes here to make this happen step one i have both p5 and d3 loaded now one thing that i almost just want to do before i even get to canvas is just unobservable this is maybe a terrible thing that i'm doing and my deepest and sincerest apologies to mike postock right now but uh observable notebooks which is this sort of like web editor webbased framework for writing javascript and in particular used for a lot of d3 examples um i find uh is i'm not used to it and it has some of its own sort of ways that it works so i want to unobservable this to just make it a regular uh sketch so i'm going to first grab all of this code and then i'm going to un take out all of the um what am i saying i'm going to take out all of the svg stuff after that okay all right so i've got all this code here uh but what i don't have is the data so the data is oh interesting file attachment graph.json oh there's a file here how do i get that file or do i just copy this oh can i download this run cell oh boy can i oh look at this can i get this data somehow add embed download json oh perfect okay i've got the data let's bring it in here hit save hey how come my formatting isn't working is did i turn off format on save oh never one of these days ah format on save all right what happened to all my beautification stuff i'm not gonna worry about that right now let's use preload data.json and then start simulation i'm going to create a function just call it start simulation put all this stuff in that and then i'm gonna say start simulation here and i'm actually gonna say no canvas right now like i'm not using p5 for anything other than just like loading the json and calling this initial um like set of code that's all d3 stuff that i got from this observable page um i guess i need this drag function as well let's let's grab that and let's just um just to make this more i mean i like using the arrow stuff but just for right now let's just do this okay so i think maybe i've gotten everything [Laughter] yeah and stig is asking wouldn't you be able to make a forcedirected graph armed with your knowledge from your physics videos springs attraction yeah so i've done that um and i do want to do that and i did actually include that even i should have maybe i should have done from scratch or sort of like um in my sort of poll from today i did address this earlier um but i i'm just really i kind of wanted to explore i just really love this particular example and want to see um if i can integrate how it works integrate it but yes um there's you know the other library i'm really interested in looking at is um this particular library which also has a lot of network graph kind of stuff world cup network so i'm just kind of interested in seeing what's out there okay uh uncaught invalidation is not defined all right what is this i don't think i need this right now i don't need to stop this simulation anytime um okay color was expecting color okay so it's calling some color function which i probably forgot to get from the observable notebook yeah there's also a color function this is confusing to me and i'm messing up the p5 color i think this should actually be this right so i'm just turning this into a generic function for color which it's really not going to like because that's a p5 function uh p5 and problems creating okay p5 colors where where uh this is just a bunch of like hold on sometimes these warnings cause me more trouble than they help me so i think i'm just going to go to the p5 minified version which takes those out okay so let's see here um so what i want to do now is look at let's make sure the data is there okay i've got the data links and nodes so that's promising create the simulation create the svg oh you know what i bet you width and height are not set all right let's look at is did the svg get created this is strange um so created this svg why do i not see it 600 600 create a attribute oh does it do i have to like add it to the dom somehow just wondering if the simulation is even running so this is like a update function like the draw loop so the simulation is running that's promising um four simulation nodes oh you know what i think i lost no no no data link hold on let's make sure this worked the way it was supposed to okay so i'm getting all of the nodes oh they have a location and a velocity so they're there how come i don't see them oh i bet you i've messed up the color stuff let me take out this color thing for a second is that not called drag that's the only place okay all right why do i not see the svg is that something i need to do no oh i'm so confused the funny thing is i don't even care about using the svg so maybe i should just quit that because i'm about to be i was going to do all this with canva cam document.body append child but where's the svg how do you add uh d3 add svg to dom d3 select body append svg is that in did i just miss that and it's actually in this d3 select body append svg okay i see an svg can i append this svg uh i'm so confused so now i have an svg the function you copied returns the svg for adding to the dom i know so why can't i add it hold on return svg.oh return svg.node oh like that select append this is so funny that i'm stuck on this like tiny little thing here uh there we go boom okay that was rough okay i got it so what i did was i selected the body and appended the svg there then made that svg the thing that i'm adding all the stuff to i'm not really sure what i did but the point of this is i just wanted to get it up on the screen i'm going to undo all the svg stuff but i wanted to make sure i had it and i want to get rid of some of my console log stuff because i actually think i'm going to simplify it greatly and by the way let me just put this color thing back just curious if um i think i want to probably not use this i'll call it color d3 let's call this uh color d3 let's see if that works uh why am i not getting color okay i'm not going to worry about the color thing that's not my concern simplify okay so now now here we go so what i would like to do and i'm also just gonna like comment out this drag thing i'm gonna definitely need to deal with that at some point but i'm going to look at this so basically what's happening is i'm taking all of the data this data is a whole lot of nodes and links the nodes are the circles the links are the connections and basically i'm creating a force simulation out of all those node objects the force is a link between them based on linking their ids to ids there is a charge force which is the um i'm assuming is kind of like the overall many body well let's just see that must be what's sort of like keeping them from not overlapping oh yeah drag is not defined okay let's put the drag back just for right now let's look at these different forces right so that is like a repulsion force like they've got the force linking them that springy force but they don't have um they don't have the charge force which would be now they're all spread out and then um this is interesting this is like basically a force i think keeping keeping it all like clustered like if i take this out everything's just gonna like fly away because they're pushing each other away and nothing like holding it to the center right you can see everything's flying away um so i think you know this is really just like zero zero i think it's the equivalent of that no what did i do okay so what is oh oh no no this is a force x the d that's this is a function that's having every x be pulled to the center right so that's you'll you'll see like if i do like negative 100 watch this whole graph is going to shift over see because that's the like this is setting that like center force so that's kind of important um and then the link right if i just take this link out now none of them are linked so it's just uh like perfectly oh i really kind of love this like everything is like the charge force is spreading everything out but everything is also being kept within the sort of constraints of the svg shape so i want the link back because eventually i want to do this with my own data that's sort of the point but just going to keep this data um okay so we're good so uh everybody um well hold on let's do um whoops um how do i do that thing where i do get branch uh fine let's do this no not on github well fine i know how to do this just okay oops no there we go so i'm gonna just do um we'll make like just like a little change here uh how do you set a tag working working d3 uh port of d3 observable notebook okay so now at least whenever i put this anywhere in the git history you will be able to find this version of it with all the svg stuff i want to now and i have a width and height of 600 let's just just see will it like work whoa what the i think i did something wrong about the size i shouldn't really be too can i do this i don't okay i'm not gonna worry about i'm gonna create the canvas so uh let me do create canvas with height and actually those are now going to be global p5 variables set by create canvas background zero okay so now i've got a canvas and i've got the svg below it what i want to do is reproduce this exact drawing in the canvas and then i'll delete all the svg stuff so function draw um basically the nodes have let's look at the nodes oh okay so these i'm going to need these to be global variables thank you very much how do how to make good code worse okay so the nodes each one has an x and y great so i should be able to now just say 4 let node of nodes circle node.x node.y 10. okay that's promising background zero now ah so the center is on a p5 canvas at the top left so i guess i will just say translate oh boy all of my vs code settings seem to have disappeared great okay so this is promising now i just need to do the same thing with all the links let link of links stroke 255 line oh yeah i don't know what the links look like how do i find the two nodes that they're connected to the links are all index oh a source and a target so it looks like the source is the source node and the target is the target node okay that should work uh link dot can i do this can i destructure this object and then say source.x source.y target.x target.y okay there we go all right this is very promising oh i like this okay guess what now guess what i get to do now oh it makes so much simpler um i don't need any of this svg stuff all i'm doing is to start the simulation is load the data and this is very silly like the data is just in a thing that has links and nodes and this is just pulling the data out to be in separate links and nodes so this could maybe be rethought a little bit like when i put my own data in there i might do something different set up all the forces and then now this is interesting i do think oh i do need this tick because what it's doing is for every update of the animation this doesn't is this something forever how does it know what link and node are here for every update of the animation what is link and node this is so weird this must be some magic that happens in the background node is not defined what the okay oh wait a sec was this something oh was oh this was because oh this was because this is the svg stuff okay i don't need this yeah this is just i guess i could say uh i could call this render and i could use d3s you know forget about um p5's draw loop i could just call on tick for the animation call render no oh but you know what that messes up the translate uh draw knows to reset the transformation matrix in p5 so i'd have to explicitly say reset no it's weird there we go so i don't know whether it makes sense now the only thing is i can't drag any of this stuff so how do i get this drag stuff back hmm okay this is going to be challenging drag simulation drag event do i i mean could it be as simple as saying drag simulation just call that function pass the simulation in and attach all this stuff to it it doesn't that's not that's not gonna do it hold on uh hmm all right so this i got to think about um let's look at what was it doing here so this uh call dr oh call drag simulation oh that's weird interesting what if all right hold on let's look at this canvas d3 drag drag and zoom blocks this is an old example before observable there was blocks but this is using canvas right so this is this is exactly what i was talking about i'm using p5 instead of like context move to and arc and all of that and oops so i think hold on hold on hold on i think i might have a clue here where is the drag canvas call d3 drag subject drag subject on drag drag okay hold on this is a clue here got it got it got it got it so this is my canvas canvas equals create canvas canvas.call d3 direct but it's not canvas dot call because i'm d3 wants me probably to call it on the name this is the p5 canvas the native html canvas is in a property called elt um hold on let's get rid of the zoom could you please why i want you to do the thing where you oh hold on okay um what is the like uh there's that property that's like i wanted to wrap um hold on i'm like i'm having a major crisis in that my i don't know how to use vs code line length my line length property line length uh javascript is this going to do it no that's html form oh my god i don't know how to do this wait i'll just have to survive so d3 dra canvas is i'll call d3 dot drag subject drag subject on drag dragged alt z no i don't want to rat i don't want it to wrap i want it to just be so long that it needs to like put them on different lines um my my audit format is gone but i okay what's drag's subject here oh what can i just say on that's weird drag subject this is weird well let's try something well this is going to get wonky okay i'm going to get rid of this got it got it got it got it got it got it got it got it i see i think i understand what to do here i basically when i create the canvas oh i need to do this let's make this a global variable and in start simulation i'm also going to do this here and then this is where did i get that well i got this from from here oh i got it from the end of this i see i see hold on this i did not expect to have to deal with i could i could skip this dragging stuff but i want to figure it out oh yeah here here that's what i'm looking for how am i doing on time oh this is going to take a while let's uh oh i have it here i'm figuring this out i'm using my canvas ah there we go got it got it got it got it got it got it got it i think i know what to do canvas call d3 drag on on canvas.elt oh i just had like some wonky syntax stuff no yeah extra i'm gonna get this why won't it autoformat is this not right what's the chance this is right drag started dragged drag ended so let me just try drag started and see what happens here sketch line 56. oh whoops that's the problem there we go okay people sorry i'm really working very intensely on this and i'm not really able to explain while i'm going i've kind of lost i just want to see let's see canvas.elt.col is not a function that's the canvas elt is the default canvas oh because it's a oh oh oh oh i know what i need to do ah i need to make a d3 canvas d3 select canvas of course of course this is all d3 stuff okay so select the canvas hopefully it's the right canvas this is the problem okay yay okay this is good i mean i'm get it's registering my clicks so um simulation it needs to be a global variable because of the way that i've done this obviously i could put these these could be like enclosed in that function which would probably be the correct way to do this but i'm just going to lazily use global variables okay cannot read property x of undefined sketch.js line 12. so hold on let me just look at what doesn't know what d is where is it supposed to get d so the event is subject target there's definitely a subject here x y oh you know what i need to do okay so i've got an event i think this d is like no longer relevant here must have been so and let's look at this one um right it needs a subject how does it find the sub the subject is doing some kind of transform thing i don't want isn't there like um i think there's drag subject this is what i'm looking for which circle to drag drag subject choose the circle that is closest to the pointer for dragging i thought there was an automated way to do this in d3 that i've seen but let's look at this subject drag subject okay that's what i'm missing okay subject is null distance is constant n of nodes this is looking at the distance between the nodes x and y in the event if it's less than distance subject is that node so now so that's where the d goes the d gets filled in by the subject and so um let me just do these take these out for a second and so now if i were to say drag subject drag subject there we go it got long enough finally is this right call d3.drag subject drag subject okay let's see if this works this is so weird how d3 works max distance is not defined in drag subject let's make that infinity right that's the longest distance okay oh subject there's the subject okay so now i don't know what this is is it event what this fx is d is not defined so confused yeah where why is there a d in here and how come i don't have it and look at this one drag oh i guess i could do it this way okay like this oh wait a sec i'm getting something but i'm off by that weird offset so um where's the offset because i translated event dot x m plus width divided by two plus height divided by two is that no minus oh there we go sort of got this working but it's like it's losing it um i almost want to you start using the p5 uh functions like um like if i have a active node and then i just do um okay well maybe i'm not going to get hung up on this so much maybe i won't get hung up on this so much because ultimately i just wanted to do this but it's losing it i kind of want to just put i want to put my own data in in it i'm looking at the i'm looking at the um chat see if i'm missing something obvious drag subject finds it return subject it should keep the subject all along until we say there's no no the event oh it's got all this stuff built into it hold on this one let me just look at this example again it's staying okay come skims call drag circles on interesting simon is saying i think you have messed up math the the this drag i guess i should think about this for real this is for all the nodes the event.x is the untranslated mousex mouse y so i need to subtract yeah no this is right this seems right to me yeah this is right i think you're i think simon is behind because that is where i messed it up um maybe something with the event active yeah when does drag ended get called let's take a look at this started dragging drag ended i don't see end it's so weird like what is going on right um so are you changing the drag subject when your cursor gets too close to another node but when is drag subject called let's let's that's actually a really great question i don't know when any of these things are called i'm sure it's all in the document documentation so let's just see here let's see when all these events happen it's 36. whoops this is what i was doing here okay so i'm going to click finding subject started so it's just finding the subject once i have a weird kind of idea which is i want to um just out of curiosity take this out for a second and what i want to do is call um i want to do this myself uh find subject so i'm going to say function mouse pressed um mouse x mouse y subject is dragged true uh acted dragged node i'm just doing this myself with p5 functions just for a second drag note find the subject set is dragged equal to true and i probably should do uh if dragged node i don't know what this does but let's let's put that in there take this out i probably should have done a commit so i could back up to this but and then i'm going to do a function mouse released dragged node is dragged false drag node is nothing and then what if i were to say uh in render here just if dragged node dragged node equals mouse x drag node equals mouse y dot x this is probably a terrible terrible idea and i didn't realize how much i was gonna end up undoing to do this um and okay this is promising i'm not finding the right subject because oh oh i see this has to be minus i have to have that offset there we go well this is better huh p5 for the win here okay so um i don't love that i just did this because i've basically disabled whatever automated d3 functionality like finding a node to drag oh it always finds the closest one but you know what i should do find the subject so it should also have to be okay hold on hold on uh let radius equal 10. so where am i drawing these things uh radius times two now this is finding the closest one but i should say if d is less than distance and d is less than the radius so now if i click here okay cannot set property is dragged of null i don't think i need that is dragged because i'm just finding it it's either null or setting it to null so clicking here it doesn't pick anything up but if i click here it does there we go so i'm finding the closest one that i clicked on and dragging it what does this oh wait a sec and i missed one thing which is um where's the dragging stuff here i don't know what this alpha target is this should be zero what is alpha target under simulation let's look at this alpha target restarts the simulation internal timer and returns the simulation combination with alpha target reheat the simulation during interaction such as when dragging a node or to resume the simulation after temporarily pausing it oh i see okay so um what what if i just took that out i'm just curious what if i didn't bother doing that if i find a node ah i see i think i need that okay so now i've got it where i'm dragging stuff around uh let me change the radius to four and and now the great thing is i can really start to um play with color to my heart's delight uh for example let me just grab a couple coding train colors and obviously there's a lot that i could do to make these nodes object oriented if i do this there we go oh my camera went off oh weird not sure what happened there okay so i'm i'm at one o'clock so i'm at my um i'm at my um and end here for today's live stream but i've made some pretty good progress here in understanding uh d3 uh this force thing and uh but i i wanna um i wanna use my own data so the idea and i'm gonna have to like this will have to be for another time how do i uh configure prettier sure yay okay so oh it has a radius in it and okay so this is using some data set um and i am going to delete basically almost the entire data set here oh hold on let's do before let's do uh youtube uh data so eventually i'm going to need to um oh my god this is so hard to figure out okay then links i just want two of these oh my goodness i want two nodes okay so i'm gonna make a node that's like um selfavoiding random walk i'm not going to worry about the groupings the radius um but it could be i could do something like views i suppose and then let's do one more let's do a couple more uh you know fractal tree uh and uh what's something else that i've done game of life okay then links are game of life to fractal tree uh has a a link with a strength of 10 and then fractal tree is linked to selfavoiding random walk with a value of five okay so now if i go into sketch and change this to ytdata right these are just my three data points but i want to do a little bit more now i want to draw them with node views divided by 10. they're way too big divided by 100 right so now oh in the ah i see so then the class clicking on it the find subject has to also oh so yes the node should have a radius i guess i could put that in the data oh but i could do that object.create um this is silly what i'm doing but could i make the radius what did i divide it by like could i give every node a radius this way and then i'm just drawing the radius based on its radius times two and then this would be n dot radius that didn't work game of life target radius nan oh does this is this not coming in as a number oh value i'm in the links ah i'm in the links i want to be in the nodes i think there's like a lot of extra unnecessary stuff here but it's fine um can i read prop oh return return return okay so now each circle is representing the number of views and um i could have the stroke thickness be the link's value let's just make it the links value so if i go into my data like five two right so you can see and then this is really pretty wonky the way i'm doing this but i want to draw the nodes second for sure and then i want to say no stroke here and so we can see the thickness represents kind of the strength of its connection but i actually would like to there must be some properties for this force link thing i'm going to stop this in a second uh there was a documentation page i was on here force link force link source target index recomputes distance and strength distance ah return 30. so can i do something like distance 100 uh wait where does this distance go yikes hold on what did i do i messed this up i chair creaks yes uh force i i have to stop but i must dot id dot distance 30. yes okay 130. there we go okay so that's like controlling the distance so that could also be related to um potentially the value times 10. oh d uh return value times 10 right so but maybe so okay so i'm just figuring out how to control the distance and then i could also do like strength um also tied to that like value whoa so this is interesting anyway i don't have an idea for what i want this to look like yet but uh now um let me add just a little bit more data um hold on um what's another video um you know pi day and then let's say pi day pi day like fractal tree and then my day game of life selfavoiding walk fractal i just want to do two just going to separate these just out of curiosity okay so we can see here uh i'm not sure what i'm doing but i'm visualizing this data uh and then i think this is pretty much where i i mean obviously i need to get some real data in here to like play around with it but there was something that i wanted to try ah yes i know what i want last thing i want to try is just um okay so hover equals find subject nodes if hover then text hover dot id hover dot x plus plus hover dot radius plus 10 hover dot y text align left center uh fill 255 no str what i'm trying to do is just see if can i reuse my fine subject um this is the last thing i'm going to do oh mousex mouse y is what i need to pass it to do a rollover basically and i don't think i need to call this i don't need to console.log finding subject anymore nope mouse is not defined oops mousex there we go um text size 60 32 there we go see now again i have no thoughtfulness in terms of the design but now i can hover and see what it is they have a relationship a state analog says you sound burned out yeah this basically happens to me after once i get i'm way over my time so this is great i'm going to i mean if i don't say so myself i'm going to wrap up now of course uh uh starting with some dummy data plus canvas p5 oh i don't have um so let me put this on github for anybody who wants to play around with it before i go i'm gonna start playing this outro music no i won't sign in okay so now if anybody wants to take a look at this um i will put this into um discord i forgot to set up discord have i done video youtube api videos before no but that's what i'm interested in pursuing a little bit this summer um i'm just trying to open up discord here coding train that okay so um this is the coding train discord um i just posted a link to it in the chat um this is where during the live streams i will um post things links to things i'm working on which is just this so now you have seen my um exploration of working with d3 p5 and trying to create a force directed graph with the um d3 force module i got very i mean i felt like actually i got very far because i really understand a lot more about how this kind of works with e3 with my alarm's going off because i really have to go so um i hope everyone enjoyed this stream um play with this code join jump in the discord say hi there um you know i just want to uh thank once again as the timer is running out curiosity stream if you go to curiositystream codingtrain father's day is this weekend it's a nice gift um you'll get 41 off it's 11.79 for the entire year for both the curiosity stream uh streaming service and nebula bundle um thank you everybody see you ooh i didn't even cover all of my news and schedule it's going to be a bit before there's a next live stream next live stream is coming in july sign up onto the discord and um if you want to get notifications about live stream scheduling um just go into once you're in discord um use the bot command and let me move this over here use the bot command exclamation subscribe this will give you the notifications role which you will see will give you um here under schedule whenever i'm live streaming or have updates about my schedule this is where i post at notification so i do not use the at everyone except for in emergencies um so um please join the discord stay tuned there i will see you all in a future live stream coming in july uh new videos on a bezier curve videos on time displacement split scanning those things are coming out on the channel in the next couple weeks okay see y'all as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop i just stopped this dot this stock this this dot this dot song never forget this dot there's somebody composed that song for me i'm going to say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens and kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's going to be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens oh the camera went off bye everybody i don't know why the camera keeps going off i'll see you next time have a wonderful day
