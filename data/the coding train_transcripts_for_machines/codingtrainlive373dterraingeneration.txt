hopefully this is working I had a little lunch break and I have returned to do a coding Challenge and I'm waiting to sort of see out of the corner of my eye if the YouTube stream starts to pop up I see it popping up which makes it appear to me that this is working so I am uh G to take a minute to get set up here perhaps introduce myself although I did that this morning um I'll let people sort of trickle on in uh if you are watching this video as an archive on YouTube I would encourage you to check the description there will be links to various time codes of things happening in this video as opposed to this rambling introduction and there also hopefully out of this video uh will be an edited version of it that will also appear a little bit later U my name is Dan schiffman I am here in the afternoon I did some tutorials this morning on git and GitHub and now I am back to do a coding challenge uh and I'm seeing that people are here I'm going to not run updates on my computer I'm going to just check and see if twitch appears to be working and looks like it is and U so let me just Dive Right In okay not a lot of exposition I def I have a a little less than an hour so we'll sort of see so I was poking through my somebody had mentioned a couple things were have been requested for a coding challenge um one this idea of procedural textures okay so that's topic number one topic number two uh procedural terrain and both of these ideas can be implemented in the same way one being rendered as a twodimensional image that gets textured on something another as an actual uh twodimensional plane in a 3D World with perhaps some depth to it so um I was digging around and I found this uh example this is actually not the example this is I had an example from the nature of code book uh associated with pearlin noise and in a few minutes I kind of quickly adapted the example to do a few different things and created this so what I would like to do is re program this from scratch um and I don't I'm not 100% sure I want to do it entirely from scratch I might make a video tutorial where I start with a little bit of a foundation I'm also thinking about if it makes sense um just checking the chat and sound I'm also thinking about if it makes sense to do two versions two videos one would be basically doing the piece that you need from this which is a twodimensional pearlin noise on its own and then taking that code and bringing it into 3D to create this kind of terrain at the same time I kind of want this all to be one video now I was looking at my code for this and I want to like explore something before I make the video I was noticing that the way that I render this terrain is with quads so in other words it is each um it is just a whole lot of rectangles not rectangles quads placed next to each other and the vertices are if you imagine them all flat the vertices are all moving up and down uh to create this kind of bumpy texture so um what I wanted to look at is I think that I might be able to make the code a bit more efficient if I used a quad strip and when I make it from scratch so what I want to and maybe some of you who are watching might have some tips for me so I just want to look at the processing reference really quickly uh and I'm going to go to reference and I'm going to go to begin shape and I'm going to look here and I'm going to look at a quad strip so because quads what I need to do with a quad is set all four vertices and with a quad strip is it setting it across 30 comma 20 that's X is 30 Y is 20 then X is 30 75 Wait no that's down at the bottom then 50 comma 20 then 5075 so it's doing it like this let's see if I can modify my example to use quad strip ah al so great question uh Christopher akiki asks what does procedural refer to exactly so what I mean by that is the the terrain the texture or the terrain where um how is generated through an algorithm as opposed to you could hand draw or hand design I generally so you could you could hand design a Terrain saying like oh it's going to be like this you know you could sort of sculpt it or manually set all the points or use an image some sort of image to like generate what the terrain should be but this is through an algorithm that algorithm being curling noise um I generally use triangles for this kind of that makes total sense to use triangles so in that case triangle fan or triangle STP I think is what I want because I want to go across so um let me try it with triangle strip so let me see here so I want to simplify this for a second so I'm going to work this out and then I'm G to I'm doing this sort of backwards so I run this you can see what this is this is just static version of what I'm making and I can actually even take the rotation out um and you can see it looks like this with no rotation and in fact let me uh also just to be really specific about this uh um boy what have I done here uh let me take this out okay so what I'm doing is making this and let me uh um sorry I'm just trying to simplify this to understand how triangle strip works um let's run this one more time so you can see this is a I'm basically want to turn this thing and this is what I'm starting with and I'm turning this on its side and then I'm raising various points to make it a bumpy thing and this would work but it was suggested to me in the chat to use triangles which I think makes sense and um oh I have uh I have not start um the coding challenge by the way is going to be terrain generation and I'm sort of I haven't started doing it yet I'm figuring something out before I start doing it so you know um so what I want to turn this into now is I just don't I don't know how the triangle strip stuff works so uh I'm kind of hacking through an example I made before and I'm going to say uh triangle strip so if I just did this by the way what am I going to get kind of a crazy mess of stuff so that's not correct and what I'm going to do also is um just do like a one by one so this this is what I okay so hold on okay I'm figuring this out so what I think that I want to do is do and I'm going to take out the Z is what I meant to do so what if I just do um the top row than the next row uh oops and I'm going to do the top row in two y's uh all right hold on I'm figuring this out uh oh yeah okay z z translate does that work oh maybe it doesn't work oh I I don't want the begin shape the begin shape is around the whole thing right because the the triangle strip is one giant shape now okay there I got something uh I just want to let's try this again and uh so okay hold on a sec everybody I don't like I want this to be at X get rid of this and X plus this should be at Y and this should be at y uh do I have a scale here or something um x times scale soor I'm just figuring this out here how does the triangle strip work I should really just look this up instead of trying to do it haphazardly there we go okay now I'm getting something so that is not right uh why okay so can I go across two triangles instead of a rectangle so you have four points P1 P2 P3 P4 for a square you have a triangle you have three I need to make multiple triangle strips you can't make the whole Trin from just one okay good thank you so each row is a triangle strip so those of you who had done this before let me ask this question to you guys in the chat who are helping me with this what I'm assuming I need to do so this is what I have points go across like this and points go across like this and then this is a triangle strip right should get this right so what order is the vertices I was thinking I could go like this one two three four five six one two three four five six like that or maybe I have to go one two three four five six seven eight n like something like that can I go boom boom boom boom boom boom boom I don't know what the order to do the vertices somebody tell me in the chat uh uh you need one a triangle strip is like a line yeah okay so we're going to do one row just one row and we're going to say begin shape for every X and if I do it like this what do I get I get everything going across now let me just check these vertices ah this should be at zero no no not zero this should be at y times scale and this should be at y like this I'm going I'm going across oh oh I'm in the wrong place I'm gonna be figuring this out the whole time up and down up and down uh Gregor SN says up down up down so uh this is oh plus there we go there we go thank you up down up down up down up down perfect okay I got it that makes sense so now if uh if I say I forgot what this was uh do I have uh the number of rows this should be is this are these in a variable what's the chance oh excellent okay so that's working up down up down up down uh and then um okay perfect uh I'm just curious if I put in this now this is going to be better whoa okay interesting I didn't get everything in the right place oh because this needs to go up by two each time then right because if I do top bottom then I got to go up by two let's see right oh but I'm in the wrong so the center okay this is harder than I it's funny I had this totally working um okay uh okay so so let me think about this again uh up down up down up down up down up down okay uh so I do the first row and then I skip and I do the next row oh no the next row has the bottom one connected to the to the next one so it should be no skipping I should go to the next one and I wonder if the Z is off somehow so right of course so this is okay so first of all I'm in the wrong place I translate width divided by height um get rid of this for a second okay so what did I get wrong that's not matching because why um so the hip bone is ah thank you thank you y + one the second one is the bottom row and this should be not to the very bottom thank you brilliant brilliant brilliant there we go we're back with triangle strips now uh and uh um let me just put this back in and excellent so why what am I width divided by two oh minus the um so I need to translate based on the size of the landscape uh which I'll deal with later um because I'm going to program this from scratch anyway I mean I'm want to fix let me fix this one to get this working and then I'm going to build it up for doing it from scratch but um because I'm not going to do it in an object but uh let me just see um minus um land W / 2 uh minus land H divided by two and the landscape oh it does have a w and an H already that's brilliant uh divided by two okay so let's see here this should do it yeah okay so now it's in the middle and uh if I go back to adding this rotation in we should see it looks like a landscape like that um and I probably want it to be a little further down like something like this you know and then there we go and then uh make it much bigger a the triangle strip is much slower it worked with my quads I guess I better do the quads can it really not render that or did it just go off screen doesn't see make it wider what did I I must have typed something weird in what happens when oh is the Y uh so anyway I'm going to start this is this is a part I can figure out later I don't I i' like because I'm off but I'll I'll figure I'll do it correctly when I build it up again from scratch I just wanted to know how the triangle strip worked okay um upper lower vertices be from the okay so here we go I'm going to um I'm going to uh I guess I should fix no you know what I should make this one work cuz it's a visual reference so okay let me figure this out um where are these going these are going from x * scale y * scale plus scale uh x x is columns rows columns w h z is new floats Z gets calculated uh through this mechanism that makes sense uh okay and then what am I losing when I start making it super wide uh this should be the center minus its width and height and then zoom out right like oh whoops I don't want this to start okay that makes sense uh I want to get this totally working and then I'm going to then I'm going to explain it and build it up from scratch so uh what happened when I made Y super big did it just okay so that's fine and then it's the rotation that's the issue so let's make an angle uh that is a map to Mouse X Mouse X goes from zero to Wi to 0 to 2 pi uh so let's see what happens here and then let's rotate X by that angle why did it go out of view uh so that it's oh it has to do with like my point of view here so let me Zoom way further out so you can see it is oh of course of course of course it's rotating around the I want to rotate around the um Center so I really want to okay I got it how annoying okay so I want to leave this here so this needs to stay here and it's right but I need to draw everything this is what I wanted because I want to see it looking like this but I just need to move it over and shift it down a little bit which shouldn't be too hard like this I should be able to just shift the whole thing down like this right that's what it's going to look like and now in here uh the location of the vertices is really minus W / two minus W / two minus minus h / two minus H divided two so this should then reenter it back there we go that's what I wanted it to look like uh so now I can go back and just hardcode in that angle uh hard code in that angle and there we go and now I can add back in the thing where I uh adjust the the the terrain so that it looks like I'm flying over it there we go oh triangle strip is faster okay so this is ultimately what I want it to look like let's um let me make it a little bit further back oh it's at four it's yeah and a little bit wider what happens if I do this just curious to see what sort of speed I'm going to get from this thing there we go so that's pretty good okay now I'm ready hopefully to build this thing and explain it uh this is what I want to make to make it look like you're flying over this infinite terrain scene okay everybody I got 32 people watching I'm going to check twitch uh there are two people watching on Twitch and 2 people watching on YouTube I need to get some water I just realized um so enjoy this uh terrain for a minute I'm going to go get some water you're going to go with me to get water even though you can't see me I'm talking to myself as I walk to get some water so I'm going to have to explain a few different concepts um in this particular video um one of which is pearing noise um but I do have a pein noise Standalone video which I can link to so I've got to explain pear in noise I got to explain a little bit about 3D and triangle strips um I have to uh and that's really it actually that's sort of like the main thing um and what I so and um you know I was going to try to do it as a um I think I'm going to try to do this in one video and then what I can do is if there are oops if there are certain aspects of the video that are confusing like more I could make a separate video that goes through some of the uh pear and noise um stuff in more detail so I'm definitely going to need to draw some diagrams for this because it's going to be anytime I do anything in 3D it's going to be confusing um and so I'm doing I'm going to do this one in processing but I would I'm going to try to make um there's been a lot of updates to P5 js's webgl recently so I'm going to see if I can uh redo it um also using p5js and see how that goes okay so if you've got any questions I'm just about ready to start um please ask them in the chat it is 326 I'm hoping um I'm hoping to be done with this by uh 4 because I've got to go then so we're going to see if in 35 this is going to be a 35 minute challenge if I can do this in 35 minutes um I do have this example to refer to just in case um okay let me just check the chat uh qu um by the way my oh the nature of code just got activated on Caden um uh Andrew Kim asks are you going to be actively grading or in the forums so the grading all happens through their system they have an automatic way of doing it it's really not um and there's peer assessment for uh as well um but I am definitely going to be actively in the forums as much as I can so I will be there tweet at me if there's stuff that I should be taking a look at I want to try to be involved with it as much as possible um um okay uh here we go so I'm gonna I need a let me get a new sketch up and um oh I don't want to close that sorry hold on I'm just getting set up here I need setup I me draw uh three uh pein noise terrain and I'm going to save that on the desktop under coding rainbow pearlin noise terrain and size 600 600 p3d uh background uh zero and let's see what we've got so far this is looking good this will be our start okay um yeah I think I'm ready uh oh can you also make the terrain Cube based like in Minecraft oh nothing would be um nothing would be more thrilling to me than to do some Minecraft stuff I really got to get to that at some point I need a week off to just only like work on figuring out um that but anyway um yes I would love to do a cube based one not today though this is this will be a start okay so let me get this back up and uh kind of love I love how they just like appear in the back like that it's kind of a cool effect okay so here we go uh drink a little water right oh I wanted to put I just want to put a timer on so I can um you to bear with me for a second um this is not so that I can um let me see if I can do this in a brief moment uh uh play the Jeopardy music sing to yourself uh sources I'm I'm adding this timer thing I probably shouldn't do this um because this is going to take too long right now if this okay uh that should be good and then if I um add it to uh uh okay and then if I add I'm going to try this really briefly and if it doesn't you know what this is not going to work oh there it is uh oops I'm going do this really really briefly uh stick this up here and then I'm going to uh I'm almost done here I guess got to crop it oops leave that there bottom crop it there and come back a little bit that should do it okay uh there we go okay so I have a little T timer now where am I how come I'm not here anymore I've disappeared oh why do I try to change this stuff what happened to me oh I messed up I messed up everything's going to be fine and oh I did I really really really screw up um sorry everyone I really I think I really screwed up um uh uh delete this I'm coming back to life there I am by the way this is the raw view now okay I don't know if you can see this by the way this is what hey look at me this is my raw view of this is me with the green screen I screwed up and I trying to add this timer I deleted the green screen by accident so I'm going to key this back out it'll just take a second um I'm gonna do this I'm going to go to here use Chrome key okay that's good uh now I'm going to uh shrink myself I don't think you can see me doing this live uh and crop myself a little bit on the right um so now this should be I'm kind of small but I think maybe that'll be good I'm a smaller now am I here do you see me I'm smaller is that okay is everything looking fine uh oh my YouTube froze ah oh no no no no it didn't freeze it's just behind Okay I gotta get okay everyone here we go we're gonna do this coding challenge look you can almost see my pants now in this shot I don't know how I got lower I am wearing pants in case you were wondering I do have legs ah there's water here everything's a disaster all of a sudden okay hold on here we go we're going to start where's oh I need a I have a little water spill on the table over here hold on you got to fix one thing here uh and everything's going to be be fine in one moment there we go okay and now I'm back okay here we go laptop is visible it is not visible anymore troll is not in sight um okay so I'm GNA start that timer and then I'm going to go hello welcome to another coding challenge with me Dan I don't know maybe you know my name maybe you don't I'm here to program this particular simulation from scratch so what this is is kind of like an infinite procedurally generated terrain it looks like you're flying over it so I'm going to use the processing programming environment it's a Java based environment you can get it at processing.org check the links for various things you might need in the description of this video but without further ado I'm going to get right I'm going to get started okay so I'm going to close this out so what do I need um so first of all I have a sketch setup I've got setup and I've got draw size and background that's the only thing so I've got this blank canvas right now and notice in setup I'm also using p3d because I need a 3D environment so what I need before I can really do anything is I need to make the terrain itself as just like a flat grid so how does that work basically um I could draw a giant rectangle and that would be my terrain but instead of drawing a giant rectangle what I want to draw is a lot of tiny rectangles next to each other and I'm saying rectangle and I guess I really mean square like this because I want my terrain to be lots and lots of shapes all attached to each other and next to each other and in fact a good way to do this in 3D is to use something called a triangle strip triangle strip you know what this means is I can say vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex over and over again and what the computer is going to do is connect all these vertices with triangles triangular polygons and all connected together you'll see this appearance of a mesh and then what I'm going to do is once I have this mesh is I'm going to take each point as this is where my screen right this flat whiteboard is my screen I'm going to extrude some them pull them out some of them are going to get pulled higher some of them are going to get pulled lower so it's has a mountainous like quality so before I can get that part though I just need this triangular mesh to appear in the window so let's first make that happen so the way to make that happen is I need to have a nested Loop right for every single point on this grid so I'm going to start with x equals z x x is less than and I'm going to need to have know how many columns and how many rows so I'm going to say x is less than columns and then I'm I'm going to say y equal 0 Y is less than rows okay so now columns and rows don't exist as variables so I'm going to add them columns rows and what I'm going to do is also I need to figure out a good variable that I'm going to need is how big is each of these squares how many pixels wide how many pixels high and it'll be the same number let's make that 20 so I'm going to add another variable I've got this timer going I've doing this for two I see how long this takes so hopefully not more than 30 minutes I'm going to make a variable called kind of standing for scale and uh I'm going to set that equal to 20 and I'm really keeping an eye on my audio to make sure the audio doesn't cut out okay uh okay so now what am I doing okay so first just to make sure things are working uh what I'm going to do is I'm going to uh have some sort of arbitrary width and height uh and I'm going to make those the same as the window just for now it's going to change later I'm just sort of being simple about things and then I'm going to the the number of columns is the width of the width of my grid divided by that scale and the number of rows is the height of my grid divided by that scale and just to make sure things are working let's just draw a rectangle a rectangle at where x times scale y times scale and at that size and I'm going to say stroke 255 and no fill so what I should have so far if things are working right is a the a perfect grid so this is a good sign I now have this grid but I can't draw it as rectangles to yeah I could but to manipulate it to make it a Terrain to make it all bumpy I want these to be triangles a triangle strip so I'm going to change what I'm doing and I'm going to say now let's think about this H my triangle strip now I could have my triangles go down but mentally it's just easier for me to think of everything as rows so I want to do the top row next row next row next row next row next row of triangles so I need the outer loop to be y because first start with Y do all the X's go to the next y do all the X's so I I realized I want to take this y row and and put this as the outer loop and then what I need to do is for every each row will be its own triangle strip so by the way where is this coming from I'm going to go to uh processing.org under uh reference and and under um begin shape I know I'm going to zoom in here see so what I'm doing is I'm using begin shape and end shape which allows you to set a bunch of vertices and you get a shape but if I scroll down this is really what I want I want this triangle strip so I want to send a set a whole bunch of vertices and have it all connected magically with triangles okay so now I should be able to if I go back to the code uh say for every single row begin shape and then end shape shape and ah of course I don't want to just say generic begin shape I want to say begin shape and what I'm intending to make is a triangle strip and then instead of making rectangles what I need what I what I what I want to do is just set and I'm going to uh set this up here the stroke and fill outside just to instead of drawing rectangles what I want to do is set vertices so the first vert vertex is going to be at x * scale y * scale and it's going across so if I were to just run this right now I should I'm just getting these lines across because I didn't actually make the triangles what I need to do is create the vertices like this what I just did was set vertices like this vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex vertex I need to do vert up down up down up down up down up down so I need to do Y and Y + one for each Loop uh so how do I do that uh I just all I need to do is add another vertex y + 1 time scale there we go this should work please work there we go so now you can see I have this beautiful mesh of triangles so this is the building block from which I can that I can manipulate now it doesn't look very 3D I've done everything in 2D right now so let's at least take a moment to rotate it on an axis so so if I if I right now you're seeing where's a prop you're this is my Kleenex you're seeing this and it's just flat facing you I want to rotate it like this so it looks like you're flying over it so to do that we want to rotate along what axis this is the x axis I want to rotate along this x axis so I'm going to say right here rotate X and like Pi ided 3 which is like 180 60° so if I run this where did it go so we've got some problems here the issue is I've drawn everything relative to the top left so if everything's drawn relative to the top left everything is rotating around the top left and I've just rotated it completely out of view so what I need to do is have everything drawn relative to the center of the window so I should translate to the center ah look there it is and I can see it now I can see this plane that I might be traveling over but it's shifted often to the right it's because 0 0 is in the center which is what I want but the triangles start at 0 0 so remember I have this variable and this should I'm going to make these Global variables uh W and H I I want every single triangle to be like offset back by that width divided by two so if I go back to here I can I wonder if I I could probably actually just do a whole another translation let's just do another translation of negative width after I rotate width divided by two negative height divided two I think that will do the trick and there we go so this is what I want I now have this almost infinite it's not infinite but I have this terrain of triangles that is on an angle map look at this I'm only at 8 minutes this could possibly be done in 12 I should never say how long this is going to take because it's only going to take longer but we're doing really well now what is what do I need to do here well I've really gotten super far the only thing I need to do is take each one of those and like pull some of the vertic ver vertices up so let's just do something goofy like let's make all of them random so how do I pull them up well each vertex only has an X and A Y right remember this is this is the mesh that I'm drawing it's exactly this but just turns on its side but if I want to take this point and pull it up a little bit so when it's turn on its side it looks like it's going up along the Y AIS it's really changing the Z the Z value the Z value for all of those vertices has been zero all along so let's go now and say what if I were to do like random negative 100 100 for all the Z values what's going to happen here let's run this and see look at that okay one you see it's kind of going crazy let's 100 I guess was too much let's make it rant between 10 and 10 let's run it again there you can see that I now have this mesh and you know maybe I'll make the frame rate rate one so you can kind of like just sort of catch it for a second is it running yeah oops that didn't happen hey is frame rate broken in uh look at that I wonder if frame rate is broken in um p3d that's really weird I don't know why that's not working I'm GNA have to investigate that and might maybe file a bug report um so but anyway that's neither here nor there the point of what you're seeing is this now has this quality of a Terrain because each point is higher or lower now the issue is I need to have some consistent way of doing so I think what would be useful is for me to have a data structure that stores all the Z values right the um the X and Y values the X and Y values light is I knocked over a light the X and Y values and I'm probably G to have everything messed up now the X and Y Val physical comedy or that's not really comedy just physical mishaps the X and Y values are fixed they're never going to change the zv values however might change there's some sort of variable calculated procedure or some algorithm has to generate those Z values so I need another data structure to keep track of all those Z values and what I think I would like to do is use a twodimensional array a twodimensional array would allow me to store for every single uh spot here some zv value calculated According to some to some algorithm so let's go back and I'm going to come back to here and I'm going to say uh and I'm going to make these floating Point values so this is a two diim this is how I in in Java in processing how I Define a twodimensional array and I'm going to call it I don't know what to call it uh landscape terrain I'll call it terrain is a new uh and you know what I I need the twodimensional array to have the have the number of spots as the number of column and rows so I want to actually initialize it after I calculate the columns and rows and so a twodimensional array with this many columns and this many rows now what can I do but I can actually in setup right now I could just say I equals I'll use x again X and you know I just need this exact sorry same nested Loop and instead of drawing anything what I'm doing here is I'm saying uh terrain index X index y equals some random value there we go so now I'm picking a random set of values in setup and then here instead of drawing them as random I'm going to say get those Z values I want the zv value at XY and then what do I want here I want the zv value at x y + one remember I'm doing vertex vertex vertex vertex so I need those zv values at Y and Y + one so now if I run this we should see uh whoops I got an error array out of bounds exception oh okay so of course I got an array out of bounds exception because I'm doing every single row and the row below it and when I get to the bottom there's no row below it so I need to say rows minus one for this loop I can only go to the second to last row so now if I run this again we should have there we go so now you can see I've got the terrain and it doesn't you can see that it's not like a Terrain that's filling my view but that's sort of an easy problem to solve because you know I have that's why I have these variables here I can say well let's just make it much wider and much longer and now I have my ter filling my view so how do I make it look though like I'm flying over it and have it appear infinite tricky question well here's a way to do it there's a bunch of different strategies and maybe I'll make another video that picks up right from here to do different ways but I'm going to use something you can see this random terrain is not so great like it doesn't really look very much like a mountainous like quality what I want is something that's more organic fractallike nature like so to speak and what I could do is use something called pein noise so let's I have a separate video which I think I go over pein noise that I'll link to but I'm going to just briefly discuss what how pein noise would work in this context and I am I don't know what time I'm at but I'm going to keep going okay so pearlin noise pearlin noise is a way of getting smooth random numbers meaning random numbers if I think of random numbers in one dimension random numbers that I might ask for over time that are similar to the one I picked before it so if I want to get kind of a whole if I wanted to move something around the screen kind of fluidly I could use pear and noise to pick its location but what I want to do is actually use twodimensional Pearl and noise meaning think of a space of numbers in two Dimensions so if I have a checkerboard and I were just to pick a random number number between 0 and 10 or between negative and 10 for every spot on the checker board I would get exactly this every single spot on this board is a random terrain value but that's not what I want what I want is to pick a zv value for here and then I want all the values around it to be somewhat similar to it and then for this one I want all the values around it to be somewhat similar to it so as things move up and down they move up and down smoothly so I think this probably merits a longer discussion about cing noise I'll refer you to my other video and ask questions in the comments and maybe I'll make one that demonstrates this more specifically uh uh maybe video sort of just about this idea but I'm going to kind of move on from that that being the sort of conceptual idea now how does it work if I call the noise function in processing there is a noise function in processing noise the word noise really means Randomness like audio noise but uh random in processing means Randomness noise means pearlin noise named for Ken pein who invented this particular algorithm now noise if I give it two noise whenever I call the no by behind the scenes when you start processing it's almost as if this infinite plane of numbers was created in two Dimensions with noise values available to you um and you can give it any particular XY value and get a particular noise value and this function will always give you a value between zero and one so actually something that I can just do right now now it's going to look a little bit weird is I could just go in here and I can say uh here instead of using random what I want to do is use the noise function and just give me a noise value for every X and Y and then I also want to map the noise value which goes between zero and one to some value between like negative 100 and 100 so let's run this now and see what I get so this is starting to look a little bit better and you know I could I'm going to just make it a little less tall this is starting to look a little bit better maybe there is a slight more consistency to this but it's still pretty random and the reason why it's still pretty random is that the numbers that I picked right I'm asking for noise at Z 0 and then I'm asking for noise at 1 comma 0 then noise at 2 comma 0 you know down here I'm asking for noise at 2 comma 1 I'm I'm making a big leap into the noise space with with these whole integer numbers and actually the noise algorithm wants you to use small gradation so the actual pixel XY values doesn't really work very well for to to act to be the values that are passed into the noise function so the way I'm going to do that instead is by creating my own variable I'm going to say x offset as a float starting at zero and that should actually go in here and I'm going to say y offset as a float starting at zero X offset y offset and then I'm going to use those values for the noise function as the things I going to pass through and then I don't have to live with the X 0 plus one plus plus plus one I can increment those separately so here I can say something like X offset equals 0 point 0.01 and uh that's what I want to do inside this Loop and then after that Loop for every y I want to increase that by 0.01 so we can see now that my value is whoa so whoops uh camera went off um you can see now that my noise is much too smooth I move I'm moving so slowly my gradations within the noise noise space are so small that the actual terrain is very very flat so let's change that to like 0.1 and point1 and see how that does much better you can start to see I have this sort of smooth smooth mountainous region now oh we're really getting something this is much better um and maybe I can increase this now to sort of make some of the mountains a little bit higher you can see ooo that's pretty good too and I could also even go through it faster and maybe shrink this down to 100 you know I I I have a a problem where I tend to play with like values forever but you can start you can see now that we're getting something much more like actual terrain because I have these smooth random values so now I've got this terrain that appears somewhat infinite like I'm flying over it but I'm not moving over it well here's the kind of amazing thing so I could start going down the road of like camera work and translation and then like adding to the end of it as I'm flying over it but with pearl and noise there's a really really quick trick that I can do let's think about how this might work right remember this is my flat terrain and I have the noise values so the noise values are getting picked based on um based on uh X off which are the values along the x axis and yof which are the values along the x axis what if my X offset values never change I want to fly this way right I want to fly over it I want to fly along the Y AIS y off always starts at zero what if where Y starts just changed a little bit each time so that the top the what I'm seeing far off in the distance start to appear as if it's moving closer so nothing's actually moving I'm just adjusting the noise I'm moving the noise space along where I'm starting in the that that twodimensional plane of noise so if if I come back here now I've got to recalculate this in draw so I've got to take this whole Loop in draw I'll just put it at the beginning and I'm going to run it so it looks the same now all I need to do is say okay this value needs to change not start at zero every single time so I need another uh I'm going to create a variable called Flying and it's going to be zero and I'm going to have y offset start at flying and in every cycle through draw flying is going to increase a little bit oh I'm flying backwards so let's have flying decrease a little bit and now I'm flying forwards although it almost doesn't look like I'm flying it looks just like it's undulating but I I would I'm pretty sure if I make this a lot faster it's going to appear much more like I'm flying so you can see there's some goofiness happening in the back background has kind of a nice effect I probably if I extended how much I'm drawing further out uh for example if I made this like 1600 and uh you know I could also think about uh translating a little bit down so that it's a little bit lower I think plus 50 would do that um you know now I need to make it wider if I'm extending it further out I gotta stop tinkering with this I'll let you Tinker this with tinker tinker tinker with this yourself but um changing the the you can sort of see now that it's almost as if there's a curved world and the mountains are like pump appearing over so I think if you play with the values to play play with the positioning play with the rotation you can and also of course play with the color you don't have to draw this as a mesh you can do a variative things with this so I'm hoping this helped you understand a little bit a about how 3D works and 3D shapes Works a little bit more about pear and noise and also just sort of some creative exploration for what you might be able to do with this and what types of projects you might be to make so thanks for I was just checking to see if the audio was still working and I had a panic moment where it wasn't but thank you for watching this was about 22 minutes and I think I made this example in 22 minutes which I'm very pleased about okay and I'll see you soon uh talk to you later bye bye okay that was the end of that it is 356 which is perfect timing I need to get going in about five or 10 minutes so I'll stick around for a little bit if anyone has any questions that they want to ask um oh yeah um getting a Langston's a ant requested uh I feel ple I feel like this morning with the GitHub tutorials was kind of a bit of a mess like this was a little bit more smooth so uh and I think this worked well for me to have an example that I kind of like had made before so I and figure a few things out so I know how it's going to work but not actually really like have done I I still had to figure it out while I was doing it because I didn't have exactly in my head um okay oh I'm I'm so pleased that people seem to like this one uh uh in in Twitch in the twitch chat Galva Bart asks what course is this from so this is not from any course this is just me making arbitrary YouTube tutorials for things you can make with processing in p5js however I will mention that I think I that just went live this really goes along with um this course uh which uh is now an online course that you can sign up for that is supposedly open you should have gotten a welcome message you should be able to watch the videos of it now can I watch a video of it if I go here uh no um would I like to enroll I I don't want to like sign in on my account here because who knows what will happen but um this kind of goes along with this particular uh course if you're interested uh on cad.com all right uh any other questions in the chat so um oh does the order of the nested Loops okay sorry Andrew Kim asks does the order of the nest Loops matter I noticed you initially started the sketch with columns then rows within it but later switched it it doesn't actually um I mean you could do this exact program with going up or down um I just chose because I had a I what does matter is that I kind of know what I'm doing so that I'm consistent with how I'm doing various calculations so um because if I were going down I would need to do the vertices up down over over up down probably or up over down over so I I you know because I was doing the triangle strip up down up down up down I want to go across all the way across the row and then down so in that case y needs to be the outer loop but I could invert it and just change other things in my code and it would probably work just fine but I needed a mental model and I need to be consistent with that mental model um okay um oh I'm excited to see that everybody's already enrolled so um so uh uh this is I'm signing off for today I kind of just want to stay like this was this felt good when I do a tutorial that like works and I kind of like went through consistently it feels so good um but um uh I'm going to sign off for today because I'm going to go to a uh sevenyearold tennis class to watch some tennis um and um then uh but I will be back on Thursday morning probably around 11 Eastern um that seems to be a time that's working for me and it also seems to be good like west coast East Coast Europe seems to fit into that time frame somewhat reasonably but I would love to hear what times are most convenient for people and uh so Thursday I don't I might um maybe I'll consider doing another coding Challenge and some more git GitHub tutorials I kind of want to get back to the connect sound everyone's been asking for sound maybe I'll try to do sound on Thursday but tweet me your suggestions and votes maybe I'll do a Twitter poll uh that that sort of thing and I'll see you guys soon um um Matthew vanen huel ask can I self advertise my channel you absolutely can if you have a Channel with processing tutorials paste it in and I'll give it a shout out um uh terrain generation tutorials yeah I would be happy to do more 3D trees I would be happy to do caves so many good suggestions um um these are great suggestions from everybody so I got to keep a list of all this stuff and I look forward I I look forward to seeing you on the next live stream Thursday uh send me your tweets with questions and I can respond there um if you have complex you can also ask questions in the YouTube comments another good way to get in touch with a question is to post it to the processing forum and then tweet me the link to your Forum post um that's the easiest way if I'm going to get into a discussion where other people can chime in and with post pting code and that sort of thing um um and and that sort of thing okay um and I'll see you guys soon I I hate to shut this off but it's 400 and I've done this a total of three and a half hours today so I guess I should feel good about that
