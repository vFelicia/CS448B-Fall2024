I'm very excited about this video I don't know if this is gonna be helpful or make any sense maybe you're watching it maybe you're not I mean you are watching it well here's what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna try to have a new series to put that's in a playlist don't know series about finding bugs and open source projects and contributing and helping to fix those bugs like how do we do that and this is going to be a heart this is a high degree of difficulty one so I'm not starting with something simple and this will probably fail but I'm gonna do my best so I just did a whole set of tutorials about WebGL and one of the thin p5 one of the things I noticed with help from the viewing audience is that if I put two point lights in the scene here's a point light that's red that's on the right side of the canvas here's a point light that's blue that's on the left side RGB X Y Z and then I have a sphere with ambient material that will reflect that light what do I actually see I only see a blue light on the left now this is using p5 version zero point five point one six so let's just let's just be sure about this so I'm going to take this point light and put it second now you can see only the red point light what I want to see and I'm going to show you this really quickly I'm gonna go to my index of HTML file and I'm gonna switch I'm gonna talk about how I'm doing this i'ma switch versions of the library this isn't working this isn't working with version zero point five point seven so somewhere in between zero point five point seven and zero point five point one six this feature broke this is I feel like I want some like cool Oh didn't didn't didn't paying pants the hurts themes fun music to play because we're gonna do some detective work now how can we find this so first of all how did I switch between the libraries so quickly so one thing you might notice about this particular bit of code you can ignore this kittens folder but I actually have the p5.js library here locally and that is the current though the current as of the time of recording this video version of the library and in this and you can see here in my HTML file I'm referencing that particular local p5.js file now it's now commented out I could commented back in what I decided to do it's really eat much easier is that I could use something called CDN which is stands for content delivery network and if I search for CDN p5.js what I'll get is this particular website C D and J Escom and it has hosted versions of the library that I can reference in from my HTML file and I can get the links for any old version now one of the ways I'm going to do this right now is I'm just gonna go here I'm gonna put 16 in here and I could just we could do this all day right I'm gonna go back sorry to the sketch hit refresh it's broken so I could say 0.15 still broke it point 1 4 still up it's working in 0.5 point one four so for some reason I went all the way back to zero point five point seven when I was doing my session but now I can see it actually works in 0.5 0.5 0.14 so what does this mean time for me to go to github so the p5.js project is an open source project on github it's a complex open source project with many files and many developer tool like workflow like crazy things or some documentation that's pretty good there's some documentation that could be better that we're working on that people are contributing to but let's just go right now to the github repository so one of the things this is the URL github.com slash processing p5.js one thing you should do is you should go click on contributors and just meditate for a minute and thank all these wonderful people who are putting in all these work and and I could say Karen just to highlight some people Karen paying to the in terms of WebGL Karen Peng indefinite and I think if we come down and and find also kate Hollenbach right here and I don't know it's Stahl Jia's Oh mind if Matthew did a lot of work in yeah here's a me I am Samia coding trained viewer so there's a lot of people on here I'm thang I'm just referencing some of the people who have done a lot of that WebGL work so something I can do now next is I could just go back here to commits now here's the thing I can sit here and look and look and look and look and look and look and try to find it look at look at dates and commits but I kind of there's got to be a way I can search for where this particular commit habit so let's go to to try to search what happened with zero point five point one five let's go to releases so we can see here zero point five point one six zero point five point one four hey where's point one five that's weird I don't know what I'm missing here so normally you would think there'd be a one five and oh yeah anyway I don't know maybe in my mind the math of my mind is just so we can see these are all the commits 628 commits since this release so we would think that in these commits one of these one of these would have broken that point light now something that I could do first of all is I think an easier path towards finding us though might be where is the source code for point light itself okay that was a weird edit point if this video ever exists but I went down many different rabbit holes to try to find the bug and you might have seen some of that happening and what you watched up until now but this was pretty much a case where I my skill level I cannot fix this bug there's a couple of reasons one I don't have all day yeah I gotta go have some dinner too is I don't really know how the WebGL system works I wasn't one of the ones who designed it and I won't be able to investigate that fully right now and and three like this is a case where it wasn't like a small bit of code change that broke that I could look at reverting over the summer between version zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six all a lot of WebGL was kind of rewritten and structurally so so much changed and I think it's less a case of like if this thing broke and more of WebGL was rewritten in a new way and some things aren't working anymore so let's let the next step could be filing a github issue that's as helpful as possible so let's do that together here in this video so I'm going to go back to the p5.js repository and I'm going to go to issues and I'm going to first thing you should always do is I should look to see if there's already an issue so I'm going to search for point light point light not working that's October 9th that's interesting issue with positioning point lights so this could actually be this could actually be our issue let's take a look so this seems to be describing something different and look we should aspire to have such a wellwritten issue I asked Point Luke should you use realworld could rather than a normalized direction like directional light so this seems to be something different this seems to be an issue with and also this is using a previous version of p5 so I'm going to not worry about that so this I don't think is our issue although it might be related and positioning point lights so this I think is also a similar issue and so this way is probably worth referencing these two issues and then I just want to look at so let me save this here let me save these two issues and let me look what else could I look for lights yeah issues so I don't think there's anything else related to the light so I to this issue so I think we can file an issue so I'm gonna write a new issue now what I'm gonna say multiple point lights or directional lights not working I know maybe that's I don't love this title maybe somebody can think of something better now this is helpful I'm going to this can be this what so this is like a helpful guide so what I'm gonna do is instead of this I'm going to say I'm gonna leave some of this in here I'm gonna say found a bug and the most appropriate area is WebGL and which platform so this is using desktop and p5 just version we are using zero point five point one six web browser is a chrome and I'm gonna say about Chrome and I'm gonna put this in there be really diligent about this and I'm going to say operating system Mac Mac OS X and my operating system is ten point eleven point six ten point eleven point six and now I'm going to take out these comments and I'm now I want to describe how do i reproduce this bug so the following code in the following simple example which positions two point lights one on the left one on on the right only the last point light is illuminated is active is seen is I selected mobile sorry thank you is the platform is wrong I got it I got it though is one on the left one on the right only that is activated is active so one now I want to add some code so one thing you can do is well you want to add a block of code you add it in between these backticks and you can actually say the language and I can now go to the sketch which is my code here and I could and I can get rid of this and just this so I'm gonna add this here so now I'm going to put this here the other thing I could do to be really kind of crazy is I could add some screenshots so I'm just say this is with the red light second so now I'm going to go to I'm over doing it just for effect here which you know that some of this may be unnecessary so so I'm going to take a little screen shot of this and then I'm gonna say and now I'm going to do the blue light second and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna say back to my issue follow it with the red light second ie and I'm gonna take these two here and then I'm going to upload that image that screenshot which should be on the desktop of this one and that's the red light second with the blue light second and I'm going to take this screenshot and I'm gonna put the code in there the the this bug appeared somewhere between zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six using zero point five point one for the you both lights are active so now I'm going to go back to my code and I'm going to switch to zero point five point one four which I think that's what I'm doing here I'm going to run the sketch again I have too many things open and I'm going to screenshot this and I'm going to add that to this issue and then I'm gonna grab this one and put this here I'm also going to write the same bug exists for directional light this may be related to and then so I'm writing here this may be related to and so remember had these issues two two five one so I want to reference those other issues by their number two two five one that's an issue that I think might be related and what's the other one one six two two then I'm gonna say this issue was filed by the viewers of the coding train live okay so now the next thing I can do is I can check my work so I can go over here to preview and we can see here whoops so I've got some weird mistakes here which is it got like some spaces here so I found a bug WebGL p5 GS version web browser operating system in the following simple example which positions to point lights one on the left one on the right only the last point light is active I don't like the way that sounds only the the the the second call to point light the second call to point light overrides the first rather than adding a new light that makes more sense I think so the second call to point light overrides the first rather than adding a new light so here's the code with the red lights I know these are huge these images that's fine though I guess and then with the blue second light this bug appeared using 0.5 on both lights are active the same bug exists for directional light and this may be related this okay calling all viewers I think this issue is done does anybody have any suggestions anything that I missed or anything that would be helpful here adding a point light overwrites the previous one yeah ii call it a point light and let's call that let's make this a function and you can use a single backtick overwrites the first rather than adding a new light so Austin is saying that I should have checked if the issue was closed and reported in a previous version too I should I'm tired now so please if somebody finds something else that's relevant that it was open and closed please add that as a comment to this issue only the final light source is rendered okay I like that only final light source point light directional light is rendered do we like this better I think this might be better let's let's use the camel case for these since they're the function names to someone saying there's a 2 2 5 7 issue is that what I said already one thing that I should mention that I should have also done a search for is that there have been 382 commits since October 11th and 0.5 point 1 6 is from October 11th so one of these could have actually fixed it and I'm not going to see that fix so I should search through also the closed issues I couldn't find anything and a very kind viewer has actually checked that the current version of p5 even from github that's not that's newer than 0.5 point one six isn't working so I think this issue is ready to be filed now I should do a followup video somebody remind me of this to show you how do you really check that how do you build and use p5 GS from they'll get hub repository how do you have the most recent version that includes includes fixes following the most recent release that would be worth looking at at some point in this new series I have about how to work with open source projects on github hopefully better than I can do because I'm apparently not very good at this but I'm trying my best so let's go back to that issue and I want sort of me to close all my tabs I definitely should so are final title is only the final light source point light directional light is rendered and this is all the code these are the different screenshots I think is ready to go I don't know about the title I'm still not so sure about the title but this is gonna have to be yeah there isn't there could be Knightly build oh there's too much too much gray we'll talk about this up in another video okay Matthew if you could salvage this you are a genius I'm gonna submit this issue this is very exciting oh now I don't think you have the permissions to do this but because I am an owner of this repository I can actually tag it with WebGL so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna do submit yeah alright thank you everybody good night good night good night thank you thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you thank you oh it's so well just as I had imagined
