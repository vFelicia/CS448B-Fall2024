all right hello I'm back in this video I'm to another video about the recomment in the previous video what I did was visualize it and you can see here this is me vision this is not me but this is the p5 code I wrote to visualize the recommend number sequence as a continuous series of arcs looks like they're circles but they're actually connected arcs you can watch the previous video where I go and build this whole code but one of the things that people that you can do also with number sequences besides visualize them is create an audio version of them and in fact if you go back to mine your favorite website entirely in the entire world the online encyclopedia of integer sequences you know if I'm here on the recommendation and it will give me a MIDI file MIDI being a system for encoding music as numbers so if I can encode music as numbers and I have a number sequence then I can make that number sequence MIDI and then I can play it as music so this is what I want to try to do and I'm going to attempt to do it with the p5.js sound library making use probably and this I don't really know that well so we're doing a lot of looking up in the reference while I do this learn to do it with it oscillator to generate a sound and the envelope an envelope to kind of craft that sound essentially creating my own synthesizer should also mention that um this video was pointed out to me from Dale Gert Amon which is also visualizing the sequence and a completely different wedding with colors and also making it into audio so I hope after watching both of these we will see a world full of I mean I don't know do we want this world I think why not let's see a world full of visualizations and audio versions of numeric sequences okay so let's start coding again I'm gonna close these windows I'm gonna go here and let's think about this so do I want to I'm gonna keep the visualization going and basically so I could start from scrimmage us keep this code I'm gonna add to it and what I want to do is I want to play a note so let's see if I how to best to do this so the first thing that I know that I need to do is I need to create an oscillator an oscillator is an object that will generate a tone and there are different kinds of oscillators right I it's basically a pure sound wave and I can have a sine wave or a triangle wave and I believe I have a video about p5 oscillators that will go into that perhaps a bit more but I thought what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take this code exactly as is and I'm gonna paste it in to set up your coding challenge copy paste from examples and then I'm going to create make that a global variable and I'm going to discover what interesting error I will have now so p5 oscillator is not a constructor why do I have why did this come up why do I have this because I don't actually use the sound library that often and I didn't include it here I should use it more often so I'm going to go and add reference in my HTML file to the p5 sound library so hopefully that's going to clear that error up great it's going do I hear anything mmhmm so let's go to the sketch and why do I not hear anything because I set the amplitudes to zero let's set the amplitude to 1 and which is 100% volume I'm hit refresh so now you hear the sinewave now so what's what do I want to do here so I have this I don't really click back here to stop the sound for a second I have this number sequence that's going up we can look at those numbers there 0 1 3 6 2 7 13 20 so what if I just took each number and assigned it and took the number in the sequence and made it a frequency so for example as I'm stepping through I could say oscillator frequency index right index is actually the number of that that's currently part of the sequence so if I do this and go back to here and click on this I don't hear anything do you hear something you might have to have headphones have it turned up eventually I think I'm gonna start hearing something so here's the thing there is a range of frequencies frequency as being a measurement of how many cycles of a wave per second we can start to hear it like that okay so for a while we didn't hear any notes and then also we started to hear something so here's I think it's much too arbitrary to just setting the number from zero to whatever as the frequency there is a specific audible range or frequencies that we can hear and so and there also are formulas for converting from MIDI notes to frequency and back and forth I'm sorry about this applause there's nothing to do with me clearly there's nothing going on in the hallway there's nothing I could do about it right now so it's gonna be in this video forever but umm and so I pretty sure that p5 has a like MIDI frequency or note or something function somewhere but I'm actually I'm not gonna use that I'm gonna go to this Wikipedia page which I have loaded up here called piano key frequencies and if you look at this this formula here I want to use this basically if we number all the keys on the piano from the very bottom key to the top key I can't remember how many keys are on a piano 88 keys standard 108 key extended we can actually find the frequency of any key N through this formula sure we could think about this in interesting ways but I'm just gonna go and use this formula so look at this I'm going to say if the if the recommen knows all these numbers and I'm just gonna do from zero to 88 like I'm not gonna let it go forever if I consider each one needs to be a key on the piano then we should be able to play the music so really this is very distracting all right okay so I want to say the the frequency is and go back to this formula two to the N minus 49 okay so power and of what n which is index 49 divided by divided by 12 times and I believe it was 440 it's for 440 I wonder for 40 is like middle C or the note a I think it's the tune to a 440 so a is like the 440 is a Hertz is the is the note a so so now if I were to say this and let's console.log index and the frequency just to hear it and I also want to just go to set up and I'm gonna if I already had set the frame rate down to five and anticipation of this but I'm actually set it to one make it even slower all right let's take a listen do you guys hear those very low notes use index mod 88 that makes sense all right so I can't seem to get those really low notes to play let's increase the frame rate so first of all I would need to add an envelope to this the whole point of this I wanted to sound somewhat nice so what is an envelope so in addition to the oscillator there is this thing called an envelope and envelope has four elements to it they're actually described right here and I have a video all about this which is attack decay sustain release so you think about playing a note like when you hit a note on the piano there's the sort of attack there's the notes for fading out there's the sustain there's the release all those those four things various parameters I'm just gonna kind of use a default setting and I'm gonna go to this example P v dot envelope and this sort of look so let's let's grab thank you well that's crab putting because I have fake applause sound effect and then there's people applauding answer so I'm gonna grab all of this stuff these settings for that envelope I am going to create an envelope right here and then I'm going to make the envelope sorry before I make the oscillator so I basically want to use the envelope in cents as a wrapper around the oscillator the oscillator is going to give me the quality of the sound and the frequency is what kind of wave it is and the envelope is gonna allow me to make it feel like I'm almost playing a key on a synthesizer and so now if we go and look here we can see envelope play so now so the amplitude gets tied to the envelope so instead of saying amplitude of one I'm gonna say awesome amplitude envelope and then I'm just going to say envelope dot play let's try this and I need to start any frequency on envelope top play okay so then I want to then I want to also comment this out right now and just we should just hear one note you hear that so what I'm going to do now is I should be able to then say I should be able to set the frequency and play the envelope again so here I'm gonna set the frequency and I'm going to play the envelope again I am going to not set the frequency here or play the envelope here and let's see what we get these okay that is loud I don't know if I just totally destroyed your ears one thing that I can do here that would be kind of nice would be to make this actually index mod 88 so that if the index goes higher than the last key on the keyboard it will then wrap back down to the bottom one and I almost feel like what I want to do is use a smaller range but let's try this I'm gonna turn the volume down a little bit how's the volume I'm terrible at doing stepid music and sounds hold on this video is not over yet getting a suggestion from the chat from K week mom saying you will get more musical results by restricting the range of it I'd say 2 octaves top so what I should be doing here is basically two octaves right would be how many notes total 24 C C sharp D d sharp e F fsharp G gsharp a a sharp B that's 12 then I have C so that's 12 notes total so if I so I want like range of two octaves would be 24 notes and maybe I would allow the last note so I would have 25 notes so I would maybe I want to say something like the the N is index + I don't know I should start up somewhere like plus 48 modulus 25 is that like crazy Oh 14 + 49 that's interesting okay so is this does this make any sense at all let's try a little bit higher like 24 48 96 what because I'm I'm module no no no no I have to modulus the 25 plus 48 this better so anyway now you see that I a have no in addition having no visual talent I also have no musical talent I don't know that much about music I know but I played the violin and I attempt to play a very out of tune ukulele alright so this is the end of my video I've said that so many times share with me your musical compositions based off of this number sequence or other number sequences and ways that you discover and I look forward to seeing you in future coding challenges ok goodbye
