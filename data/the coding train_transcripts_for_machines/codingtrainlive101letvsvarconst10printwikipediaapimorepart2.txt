okay I'm back I I don't know what to blame this on other than my own incompetence probably but I was having trouble in getting these Blackmagic devices to be detected by the computer again OBS really has been very kind to me and has had no problems so hopefully this isn't gonna be and I forgot what I was talking about it anybody remember the last thing that I said Oh No crashed oh my god look nobody back whoa okay that was like a momentary hiccup whoa OBS is now like showing me a video of myself from a moment ago it's like behind how can I fix that wonderful just cuz that's so weird alright as long as the people can hear and see me I'm gonna just keep going can you hear and see me is the is everything like out of sync in a weird way does anybody know what I was last saying oh I don't have the live chat up let me go to here see if this is actually working okay I now have a live chat I don't see anybody saying that they're seeing me and it's working it is back hi Dan and chat can somebody in the slack Channel tell me if things are okay I don't want to go unless I know things are working I think you guys are seeing me it is working okay great I think I think you might be way behind real time like a minute behind cuz that took a really long time for people to say it's working but it is working okay all right all right I this is driving me crazy that what I'm seeing on my monitor is like behind the realtime but I'm gonna have to just live with that Oh 545 okay we're gonna do simple harmonic motion Oh audio is out of sync very out of sync hold on let me see if I can fix that okay okay I think I fixed the out of sync problem I hope let's see how bad the thinking is I need something to clap along too how Bad's the audio sync now fixed okay I'm gonna drink some water I really need another coffee but it's not gonna happen or like something real like sugar snack I hope it doesn't freeze again yeah I know about the audio offset I've already actually set the offset is that is the thing coke is it it's pretty much okay though now right now it's fine okay great let's do this let's keep going I don't know which I'm gonna just play all these hello welcome to a coding challenge this is gonna be a pretty simple one and I'm curious to see what types of beautiful experiments people who watch this video will create after this video and if you've been wondering about the sine function and the cosine function how to use those functions for a motion in code then you're in the right place so this video is inspired by this tutorials inspired by the artist memo Acton who created a series of works about simple harmonic motion you can see here this this and these are actually all sound pieces so I encourage you to actually check them out and check check them out and actually listen to the sound but you can see each one of these circles is moving back and forth evenly but they're all offset from each other and this is kind of what I want to do in this video is in a really simple way just to have one of these moving back and forth and what can you create from that and if I scroll you can see some of these other examples simple harmonic motion number two you can see this is the same idea but with a more thoughtful and sophisticated visual design here's another one that's moved into 3d simple harmonic motion so things you might try to create as a guitar string plucking how would you create the simulation of a guitar string that's plucked or how could you create a simulation of a pendulum swinging what what about a fish swimming on Ã®le moving through the water here's a number five so I would love to show you all of these but I'm going to let you I'm going to put a link to this page in this video's description and hopefully you'll create something I just burped at the middle my video also something is driving me crazy the way I have I got a hit this lock button sorry look notebooks this is gonna have to be an edit point here okay sorry there's gonna be a terrible edit for a port that's yet hopefully you'll create something creative you look at these you'll be inspired and use the sine function in your code with simple harmonic motion okay let's keep let's write some code please edit this part up too while I'm trying to find the editor today was going so well it was a day where there were no weird crashing and that's all gone now I think I don't want us to start this whole video over I'm gonna start this whole thing over it's going to torture those of you watching this live but it's gonna be good for the long run for the world flatten the green paper on the second laptop that's probably better right okay let's try this again hello welcome to a coding challenge where I'm gonna make something very simple for the beginner just a simulation of simple harmonic motion and this coding challenge is inspired by the artist memo Acton who has a series of works about simple harmonic motion you can see here their musical works this idea of a simple oscillation back and forth so think of a guitar string plucking and/or a pendulum swinging and I encourage you to check out all of these beautiful this is one of my favorite ones which is sort of a mockup for a live performance of just this idea of a simple oscillation up and down and what happens when there are many of these next to each other what types of patterns can you create and so just even going down further through these I encourage you to check out all of these but here's where we can see really really simply just this idea of easing and easing out easing in easing out a wave so to speak a sine wave so you might have seen in p5 or in processing or other things that there's a sine function in a cosine function what are those functions do and how can you apply those functions to motion or color or any other parameters that might be in your system that's what I'm gonna do in this particular video okay so now there's gonna be a little edit point because I'm rethinking I'm gonna drink some water I think that was better cuz it was shorter and I just realized that what I need to do unfortunately is oops my keyboard shortcuts stopped working hold on settings hotkeys switch to scene 1 whiteboard switch to scene where do I have to click for those to work ok so I need to erase the this whiteboard so you guys don't mind bearing with me here oh I know what I was gonna do I forgot I wanted to do a draggable shape coding challenge because that's actually a really tricky thing to do and then I was gonna when I teach classes in es6 I was gonna turn it into an object but make many of them but I don't know if I have time for that that was another thing on my list on the Wikipedia API there's so many things to get to ah need more time in the day and in the live stream whatever okay alright so let's talk about what it is I'm going to use so in p5 or in processing and of course actually in JavaScript I'm in the math package there are functions called sine si n cosine cos these are trigonometric functions they perform a trigonometry functions they relate to triangles a triangle a right they were we try that again I I really shouldn't be allowed to start over so many times so before I start coding let's talk about the functions that are available in p5 also in processing they're just actually part of most programming environments called sine si n for short cosine cos for short these are trigonometry functions trigonometry being the study of the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the angles of a right triangle so there's an angle here there's a there's an opposite side here there's an adjacent to that angle side here and there's a hypotenuse so I have some videos from my nature of code series that go through the math behind this in more detail and look at actually a whole bunch of different scenarios for simulating pendulums and various things so I'll link to those in this video but I'm actually not even going to worry about trigonometry in this video the reason why I want to use the sine function is if I pass a number if we think of this number like as the axis any number I pass to the sign function as an argument to the sign function will give me a value between plus one and negative one and if that number if I increase that number over time you almost think of it as time or along the x axis that number will the output of that function will oscillate smoothly between 1 and negative 1 and it will move most quickly in the middle and it will slow down as they get to the bottom and so ease in and ease out the sine function has a natural easing in and using out if I were to graph that it's gonna look like this incidentally if you look at my videos about synthesizing sound with the p5 just libraries you'll also use a sine wave to generate a tone and there's different kinds of waves and there's a lot to this but this is the basic idea cosine is exactly the same the only thing that's different is cosine of 0 is 1 cosine of 0 is 0 so it's just starting in a different place a slight offset but we just want the wave quality so for what I'm doing you I could use sine or cosine interchangeably obviously those mathematical functions have you know that scenarios where it's important which one you're picking in this case this is not one of them ok so let's see what happens when we add this into our code right I'm just looking at the chat sohcahtoa yeah that's a good ok we can do that again alright so I have a simple sketch with nothing in it I'm gonna say create canvas to give myself a canvas 400 400 I'm gonna add a draw function so that I can have a nice animation again this is all how the p5 library works the other there's other ways to code in the universe and I'm going to say background 0 and I'm just gonna say fill 255 and I'm gonna draw a circle in the middle of the window just to get something on the screen that I can take a look at and now I'm gonna come over here I can close this I'm hit refresh there we go I have my beautiful this is Challenge complete the circle but I'm gonna keep going so what do I want to do I want to have a variable and I'm now using let's to declare my variables oh just a murder video about why I'm going to say let and actually I'm I'm gonna do this I'm actually gonna make it a local variable to draw on to say let X equal 200 I'm gonna put X in here instead and I should still have the same result excellent okay so I'm just little steps here now what do I want to do what I actually want to do is instead of having X be a hardcoded value I want to have it be the result of the sine function so what do I put inside that sine function well if we think about this what I want is a smoothly oscillating number so I need to pass something to the sine function that moves along through time through the x axis a different value so let me come back over here so I won I need to introduce something I'm gonna call it an angle so I'm gonna say at the top let angle equals zero and I'm gonna say sine of angle so let X equal sine of angle and now I'm gonna look at this sketch and look at this now the circle is over there at the zero pixel because sine of zero is zero what happens if I were to now increase that angle so I want to say angle equals angle plus one because if any value that goes into sine is going to give me something between negative one and one if I increase that value over time I'm gonna get that smooth oscillation so let's look at this now look there's that smooth oscillation here's the thing why is it over there well if you remember the sine function just gives me a value between negative 1 and 1 and now here's the essential question you are going to do something creative with this I've actually given you everything you need to know the question now is what's the context what am i drawing what's my animation what's my idea and what are the ranges of values that I want so I'm gonna keep this very simple and I am going to just say I want this to oscillate left and right so what I need to do is take that range negative 1 to 1 and map it and I do have a video about the math function the map function and let's let's do let's let's do this in two steps so I'm gonna say let's s be the result of sine of angle and I'm gonna say let X equal map that value which has a range between negative 1 and 1 and give it a range between 0 and 400 and I'm gonna say with here instead of 400 psi change the sign of the canvas now this math that map is doing isn't that hard it's just taking that s the value which has that range and giving it a different range I could do this myself if you're curious right I could say let x equals s times 200 plus 200 right because if s is negative 1/2 negative 200 plus 200 is 0 if X is 1 if s is 100 plus joyner is 400 so this would be the math of mapping that range but in case things get more complicated later and the map folks are just so convenient to do this for us ok here we go oh yeah there we go oh look at that so look at it it's just like it's doing that oscillation but it's so fast so this is really well I have to think about how fast am i moving through that oscillation and this is relates to the idea of frequency or period and again a good checks on my nature of code tutorials where I go through that a bit more detail but right now we can just understand it as if I increase angle faster I'm gonna get a faster oscillation but I increase it more slowly I'm gonna get a slower oscillation so now what I'm gonna do and let's make that circle a little bit bigger let's make it 48 let's increase the I said angle is angle plus 1 which sort of makes sense if I were thinking in terms of degrees like zero degrees one degree is degrees but actually the native unit of measurement is something called radians which has a 0 to 360 degrees is there two pi radians which I've talked about in many videos probably so I'm going to say zero point one and now we have look at that it's almost as if it's a swinging pendulum now it's moving along a straight line so it's not moving up and down as it's swinging but you can see this is that nice easing in easing in using out easing out using out easing in easing out easing in using out easing it's very hard to say that what's going by audios I just think this is going to be a disaster so what more can I do with this so now I have to think what should I do with this now this is the idea of simple harmonic motion and so I could add two of these drawed and different like what I might like to do is like make it the middle point of like a curve looking for ideas because maybe I should take this as the end of the challenge in some ways make more with different frequencies that's a good idea pendulum I don't want to do the full pendulum because that's kind of involved yeah the speed and range that's a good idea camera went out so I know what I'm gonna do and I make it feel like a spring draw a line and draw a wave yeah I like I kind of like that idea I want to be able to see the history put a color put it on a curve oh you guys have so many make it rotate in this circle at a ycomponent to me good that's the whole point the point of this is to have you guys do all of these things make it size change oh and like that okay okay everybody hold on so there are so many next steps I could take with this I could put a whole bunch of them here I can have them all kind of moving back and forth it's slightly different rates I could have its color oscillate I could have its size oscillate to make it feel like it's breathing there's so many possibility that people are just writing ideas writing ideas in the live chat right now so I encourage you in some ways just to pause this video right now and go try some of these ideas out what I'm gonna let me try to do a few things a little one thing I think would be interesting to try is can I make this feel like a spring so that it's kind of Lading but it oscillates all right am i back what's the chance that I'm back I think I think I should be back this first person who sees that I'm back please let me know in the chat it did this slow chat is it awesome different see so many chat messages my life okay yes I'm back okay what was the last thing that I did I mean I was recording two discs so hopefully the recording two discs still has it gosh I really thought that OBS was gonna be I kind of feel like the thing that I need to do is wipe the computer and re just rebuild the computer update everything I'm looking they just asked a viewer to pause okay alright so I went on for quite a while after that unfortunately so let me let me undo my code oops nope okay so I'm gonna move forward and try to just do one or two more things and ultimately I might even do another video because what I'd really like to do is store the history of the oscillation you can almost see like this wavy line thing but I need an array probably for that and I want this video to be simple with no array to start so anyway let's see what I'm gonna do so what once for a couple things one is that's gonna make things easier there's no reason for me to have such a tall canvas and also I think things are gonna be simpler if I use translate to put the origin in the center of the canvas so that I can think of everything relative to the center so you can see now how it's actually oscillating off to the right because now what I could do is I can actually just say X is the value of sine times 200 right because I just want to and I can even more simply say X equals sine of the angle times 200 right because I just want to oscillate between negative 200 and 200 so this is gonna allow for more possibilities so let's try this let's see first of all let's see if I can make this kind of like oscillate and slowly end up in the center kind of like a spring night so how would I do that well I can't this could be a variable this is known as the amplitude right this value 200 oops sorry this this value 200 is really like the top of the amplitude the height of this curve I mean it's really 400 cuz it goes up to 200 and negative 200 but that aside that's what that value is doing so that could be something variable so I'm going to call that amplitude and I'm going to say let amplitude equal 200 now what I'm going to do is have that amplitude shrink down to zero and I'm going to use the lerp function now you might have to stop and go watch my lerp video if you haven't don't know what that is but that's for linear interpolation meaning it's a way for me to like move towards another value interpolate towards another value by a percentage so let's try having amplitude I don't know what I'm just really making up stuff to interpolate to it to zero between itself and zero by ten percent boy that was way too fast one percent but that's not really what a spring would do right I kind of want the speed of the oscillation to speed up slow down I hope I like this idea did I use var no no I used let I'm yelling did you notice that I'm yelling that's terrible hold on I got to think about what I'm doing here stop for a second it's kind of interesting all I could have the amplitude oscillate yeah that's probably what I should do to get some more interesting I I should just add the Y and yeah let me go back let me forget about that ant so yeah yeah this is better actually like just decrease the amplitude I'm just curious now the amplitude minus equal to that's interesting then it goes up okay I don't like that direction that I went well the thing that I should do is add a Y probably to get some interesting use exponent 2k all these great suggestions that's a really good idea the leader triple a she wasn't really right because I I I'm not really doing I could do it like a spring simulation that's not really what this is I like alka suggestion of Ouranos p5 dojo suggestion of using X X & Y which is rich in crease the speed of the sine wave in time yeah yeah so let's this is actually interesting okay so I don't know where this goes back to okay I know I know so now Mattia this is gonna be challenging but I think you can find it so now I have amplitude but you know there's another variable in this system that variable is this right here point one that's actually relates to the frequency or the period half M is the wave oscillating really really quickly or is it oscillating really really slowly so if I can make that a variable I'm also gonna have more things that I can play with so what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to make that a variable I'm gonna call it let's just call it speed just to be nontechnical for a second let's be equals zero so if I do this it is not oscillating now if I were to say something like speed equals map that Mouse exposition which goes between zero and width to between like you know zero and point five right we can see that is a fast oscillation a faster oscillation a slower so I could slow down that oscillation and speed so this is pretty interesting just in of itself like to be able to control that so what kinds of things can you do to if you control the amplitude and you control the speed let's try adding a Y and I'm going to say let y equals cosine of the angle times amplitude this is going to be an interesting result here I'm going to take out this speed thing and just let it be a constant point one and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to 400 by 400 I'm going to draw this at Y so let's look at what this does now look at this it's moving in a circle because if I oscillate along the x axis and I oscillate along the y axis at the same rate offset by sine and cosine I get exactly circular motion now one thing I might like to do is give this a little alpha and not draw the background so I see the trail and now what happens if I play with the angle here so this the X actually oscillates twice as fast as the Y now we get this nice figure 8 pattern and I think there's a specific pattern I'm gonna look this up called Lisa jus pattern and I'm in a Google image search which looks like this that's what I think of it as this hold on timeout let's look at this Lisa do curve let's go Wikipedia yes all right hold on and should I be able is there like exact math this is a Lisa Juke challenge I just realized there's a good suggestion multiply sign by a value that increases over time and then map it again double helix wait I want to I mean I could just sort of like estimate this right top input signal output signal so there's over so much here so wow you're about is this right oh yeah it's just kind of generically the okay okay let me come back now by playing with the amplitudes and speed of this oscillation in various ways I can get a variety of different patterns and this is essentially what I'm essentially doing is the Lisa jus curve which somehow appeared is another tab that if you were made an edit point there which is really the graph of these equations x equals sign of overtime plus some offset y with some amplitude y equals sine of some value by some other amplitude without the offset so and we can pick lots of different values for these constants oh let's actually let's put these let's click let's make these variables so what do I have I have an amplitude along the a the the xaxis and an amplitude along the y axis we're gonna do this this this is now the Lisa Zhu curve challenge so I'm gonna say amplitude I'm gonna say a equals 200 let B equals 200 now I probably shouldn't be using capital letters I kind of don't like that a amplitude a and then I'm gonna say amplitude B okay so I'm gonna have two different amplitudes x equals amplitude a times sine of the angle and I'm gonna I'm gonna follow the and y equals amplitude B times and I'm going to keep with sine sine of the angle okay okay so now we're starting to let's see what we have here now if we look at this we can see now I'm just perfectly oscillating back and forth along the axis now let's go back to this formula and one of them should have an offset by offset Delta that's a delta correct so I'm gonna say let Delta and I'm gonna call it offset equal I'm going to say offset equal and since we're in Radian let's let's let's actually have angle mode I'm gonna go to angle I'm gonna change angle mode of degrees so I can just think in terms of degrees and I'm gonna have that offset be 90 degrees and I'm gonna have plus Delta Y is plus the offset does technically the X has the offset it shouldn't really matter but I'm going to add that Delta in here and then I'm also going to change the speed now that I'm in degrees to 1 well let's take a look at this an uncaught reference Delta is not defined oh I calls it el offset angle plus offset and now look we have that circle we have it moving and you know if there's a stroke on it which is why you're seeing this almost like my weight I can't say that word moi Rae pattern so what I'm going to do is just turn say no stroke so we can see this nice fuzzy path okay so now with that offset now what do I need I also need something to multiply a is time that's my angle so alpha and beta being constand that's really you can think of those as like frequencies or periods so I'm gonna say I'm going to call it a speed a equals 1 speed B equal 1 I'm gonna make the circle a little bit smaller 2424 and I'm gonna say speed speed a times angle and speed B times angle okay now let's run this and sorry in the wrong place I still just have my thing moving in a circle time out for a second I'm looking at that all right yes don't worry everybody I see what you're asking me now still moving in a circle so now is the time that we can start to be a little bit crazy so first of all I could just try different values like okay let's let me go up here and try an amplitude V of just 100 and its BB of 9 of a 4.3 what pattern do I get now well this is kind of interesting and I'd have to it looks actually like a sine wave but now it's coming back and it's oscillating so what kind of patterns can I get try lots of different values maybe I could make a whole interface where I could change the values over time I could also have color and size oscillating or that sort of thing so oh and a kaiju kaiju minee in the chat is making a good suggestion which is that I could also consider having a background with a little bit of transparency so like over time I'm actually seeing the full and and maybe then now this is a little bit of an aside here but I can give the fill no train you know that and I'm gonna I want to make it like very very little transparency so that it's kind of like an I should say background zero and set up so that I can see kind of over time that path but it's got also kind of fade out over time so I see the current stuff more bright so there's a lot of number one there's a lot of visual stuff that I could add to this a bug change speed to speed a and speed B where did I do that oh look at this oh my goodness no no it's as fine so this speed whoa why is this working that's crazy oh no there's still a speed up here so this is different now I probably I've did some sort of terrible variable naming so these probably shouldn't be called I just didn't want to say alpha because that's the name of a I mean that's not the name of anything alpha and beta it's not syntax highlighting so but maybe that's not a function I was worried about overriding something else called alpha so anyway I probably should have better variable hates but alright so I'm taking suggestions now timeout for a second for things I could add to this can you change the color of the ball depending on its speed yeah change speed to raped thank you so a great suggestion just came into the chat that why don't I change this to I'm just gonna change this to rate so that's kind of the global rate of everything and these are these are altering the the rate of each individual angle so like if I wanted the whole thing just to be able move a lot faster I'm going to change this rate to five and let's run this again of course there's more space in between and then you know so there's a lot to sort of work on here in terms of how it's working visually but and this is probably good enough so okay so I could add sliders to adjust it in real time that's a great suggestion I hope that some of you will do that suggestion I could add I could start playing with color one thing that I think would be interesting though is to think about these parameters as variables that change so even crazily absurdly what if I kind of almost recursively oscillate one of those so what if I say the speed is the result of sine of the angle which goes between negative 1 and 1 and map that speed to between 1 and 5 so now you know that is also that speed itself is oscillating and you can see wow it's kind of kind of spinning out of control and maybe I want to kind of say something like more like between point 1 and 2 and then I could say speed B is between you know 2 and point 1 in the opposite direction and now I don't know what kind of crazy pattern I'm going to I could never expect what it is but you can see those things can themselves be variables and this kind of motion that it's doing is almost insane and I got an unpredictable but I assume that most of you can come up with more clever ways to think about this and the fact that I have the the amplitude of one of those being between 100 is a little bit silly I might as well fill the full screen the full window and I can make this one cosine let's just try this surprised that it started going so crazy let's try some other values and what I wanted to do I want to change that amplitude to 200 all right let's take a look at this this is my this is my Frankenstein crazy Lisa jus curve so I've gone on for too long you see the idea here Alka is making one really good suggestion to chat which I'm gonna try I don't know I don't like the way this is turned I should really plan these why is this so I wouldn't expect it to go so maybe that's what yeah so this is better all right hold on so let me actually change I think it's the speed is almost getting is is being allowed to be too much trying to change this to go to 0 to 1 and actually I could make this rate 1 and that's what I meant to do and have this go between point 1 and 2 and now let's see what this pattern looks like and now I'm going to add some color so let's try to oscillate color and say something like filled a red value of green value and you know let's do a red value 50 and a green value and I'm gonna say let R equal and again I could have values for all of these so I'm just gonna tie it to I'm gonna let me use Mac so if you know I could use math I could use multiply I'm gonna math sine of the angle between negative 1 and 1 to between 0 and 255 and I'm gonna take B here which is for the blue value and do cosign and now we can see I'm gonna get some nice oscillating color as it oscillates and none of these things are synched but this is these are all the possibilities I could change the size so I encourage you if you watch this if you learned anything from this try to make your own version of this maybe you could come up with some actual concept or design idea that informs what it is you're creating with this type of motion okay thank you very much for watching this coding challenge this is where I ended up it's pretty ugly and weird and I hope that after you watch this you will come up with something quite beautiful why does it keep speeding up over time what am i doing that it's doing that this is not the end first of all h HS be like right what am i doing that it's speeding up over time did I do something to the amplitude which I didn't realize right this you're just multiplied by the angle a different amount the angle is going up at a constant rate oh I should really I should start using cons what times it's like 630 this has not been my finest livestream I think CDs saying that a lot right I have to fix this speed equals to somebody help me out here why let's try to understand this why is it moving nice and slow and then over time it's just faster and faster and faster because shouldn't this multiplying by the angle there map cosine check the variables in the console thank you why a console is like I really useful so let me log these let me log let's fix this let's let's come back and make this better right this should go up to two then it should come back down I think the issue to to come all the way back down is it gonna go all the way to point one yeah okay so the values are doing what I expect but the behavior is not and we could just make sure that there's no reason to think that speed B would be doing anything wrong whoops that's fine too all right so I think the issue is that what I probably want to make this better to like kind of do what I'm imagining is actually have let me try it but this is gonna be the most crazy weird an editing job ever so I'm not really happy with how this turned out and I think there's an issue here which you know even though what I'm doing makes sense in terms of those formulas that I ported from Wikipedia I think what I really want to get the behavior that I'm imagining in my head just bear with me for a second that what I actually want is let me try having two separate angle variables oops so let me try having angle one and this is kind of terrible angle a and angle B and let me actually have rate a and rate B and let me instead of this multiplying let me actually treat those separately and I'm gonna say rate a and rate B are some value like this so let's take a look at this now okay what did I miss up Oh an angle a rate a angle B R Appian by the way I guess I could be calling these things X&Y because they're for the X and Y axis and what did I mess up do I have an error angle one is not defined where did I say angle so this should say angle a and angle B angle a angle B angle is not defined line 31 and go hey angle B well I'm losing my mind here so this is doing more what I expect because it's gonna like really really slow down and then it should pick itself back up and so if I were to change these now between like one and ten yeah this is kind of I don't know that this is any better Wow and it's really like it's really consistently making the exact same shape really interesting weird like curvy shape here yeah and there do I have the offset there yeah uh yeah so what's going on here I'm actually this is so I'm actually just back to where I was at the beginning but I'm changing the speed of the circle it's fascinating you're not interested in this at all let's take this whole but I when this coding challenge gets uploaded that whole section will also be gone I should have had a plan I need to temper it it's gonna be great yeah it's a good point in saying like I why am i mapping though I think was a bad idea to try to change the rate mappings sign because ultimately and forget about that digression then I can have this be a UH all these like weird little shapes okay let's let me let me uh forget about that digression that won't make it into the video either I got to stop this one I should just end it where it was I'm going back oh do I have to undo why I really did a lot of wearable stuff to this I could also just try to correct it oh yeah okay this is back to what I had before your it could be from sine adding together over time your rate is not changing at a speed that's perfectly consistent yeah so anyway look if anyone's gonna end where it ended before Chris Rea said Joseph says I agree with you Chris Rea but what did Chris you should work on organizing here what did Chris race that you need get yeah no kidding I can't believe you guys are watching this so horrible I'm gonna do ten print this is just gonna have to be so I'm gonna finish this video again just in case we need a new ending for it so I've really done a horrible job with this like ugly monstrosity that's kind of now spinning out of control but hopefully watching this video you see the pieces of harmonic motion and what you might be able to create I'm gonna come back actually I think I would like to do you know we should do actually let's stop let's do one more thing with this video okay I'm gonna change this let's try to make it a guitar string that flexing that was one of my ideas let's do that so I'm gonna I'm gonna chain I'm gonna get rid of all this oh no no I'm not gonna do that the colors are so ugly to matrix math I was gonna wrap this up this is a terrible idea okay so I'm not very happy with this end result you can see that this I've got this sort of strange behavior with some very ugly colors but hopefully you've gotten the basic idea here of simple harmonic motion the idea of sine and cosine how you can tie that to a value you know you might just think of something a breathing shape of guitar string plucking I'm gonna come back and try to do maybe a different coding challenge that has a bit more direction to it with this and I would look for your suggestions of what might be useful but hopefully you can make something beautiful out of this take a look at that Lisa jus Wikipedia page and think about oscillating motion and make a beautiful design I think about sound size color and something much less ugly and weird than what I made here okay thanks very much for watching yeah this was such a disaster that's one of my worst coding challenges ever I hope that's never sees the light of day alright let's quickly try to salvage things here ten print I'm gonna do ten print and let's run a little server it's already in use why is it already in use I have another window open everybody should unsubscribe to my patreon right now Bernardo says this is my first time watching what's happening it's all meltdown so what's happening you know I get Ning was tutorial about the brick beggar game was so well thought out and paced and everything I'm gonna I'm gonna come back next week and things will be good okay and come back terminal open up this folder sketch okay here we go let's see here getting ready for tender I have the book I have two copies of this book and I really should have it here to hold up but it's downstairs so I feel bad about that but let me see what do I want a reference this looks pretty good let me yeah okay okay I am ready for this coding challenge has a plan it has a purpose it's going to be really short it's gonna inspire lots of creative ideas and it's gonna redeem us good this is my Redemption story I can feel it already let me come over here and erase the whiteboard case I need to use it and match if you're still it when you're watching this later and deciding what to do I don't mind if that simple harmonic motion coding challenge just gets scrapped I could come back and do it again something better people got it's here on the livestream if there's nothing redeemable about it alright I got to do the custom shapes video okay alright okay here we go the cameras are probably gonna shut off in the middle of this I'm kind of I'm sometimes I think if I press the button in the middle it gives it a half an hour all right I'm very excited about this coding challenge this coding challenge is inspired by the book called ten prints which is all about this line of code ten print chr dollar sign 200 5.5 of code for the commodore 64 and this book which is written by by a collaboration of many authors i'll put a link to information about this book the book is available for free as a PDF online I'm looking at the website right now and it's a beautiful book I have two copies of it downstairs I wish I had my one copy to hold up here right now but it really looks at the history of creative computing sort of through the lens of this one line of code for an old Commodore 64 computer so what does this line of code do so here's a nice youtube video I'll link to this as well I'm gonna make this full screen here where you can see it emulator now typing out this line of code and let's see what we get run run it oh there we go look at this we get this interesting maze pattern so let me pause this for a second and let's try to figure out why is this happening so this is the basic programming language I think that's right that's actually one of the first programming languages I ever used when I was probably when I was in I think about third grade on an apple to see I think remember um back with basic programming language lines of code had a line number like the line 10 print says print something out to the screen to the is really just only a text console and then this is print the character either and I'm assuming here that the character 205 in ASCII code is a forward slash and the character 206 in ASCII code is a backward slash so randomly pick up but make this math problem between 2 or 5 point 5 plus 1 I'm either gonna get 206 or 205 so print out either forward slash or back slash slash and then go to 10 so I to recreate this and I'm not the there's examples already been made in processing I'm really just redoing what's already been done from the the publication of this book but I want to do it as a coding challenge and see what kind of creative possibilities emerge because you could this system which has a shape to shapes and probability think of what you could do if you change the way the probability works if you allow it to be controlled if you think about the shapes creatively now that we have canvas and the browser there's a lot of possibilities here so let me and again if I say anything wrong about the Commodore 64 basic and ASCII code I'm sure somebody will correct me in the chat and then I'll come back at the end of this video and correct that okay so let's look let's I need to write a setup function and I'm gonna make a canvas that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to say background 0 just so we can see it easily and I'm gonna go to the browser and I'm gonna unfold screen this and I'm gonna go here and now i have my canvas there we go so what do I want to do first let's figure out how do I draw a forward slash or a backward slash so I could draw it as a line line 0 0 10 10 this is I know that's like a backward slash like that right now I could say line now what do I want if I want to go from the bottom to the top like a forward slash I'm gonna go from 0 10 to 10 zero right forward slash now I've drawn them both there so now what I want to do is I want to say ah maybe how do i do probability so i've done this in a lot of videos and i'm just typing it out and i probably i so let's think about just type this out here this is a way of applying a probabilistic function i don't know that's a good way to say it this is probability in my code because i'm gonna pick on random number between 0 and 1 half the time it's going to be greater than 0.5 half the time it's gonna be less than 0.5 so half the time you learn to draw a backward slash half the time i'm going to draw a forward slash now of course it's doing this over and over again in the same space on top of each other so what I want to do is move forward as if I were a console printing out forward slash backward slash so what I need is some global variables like let X equal 0 let y equal 0 so I'm gonna draw up these at X Y X + 10 y plus 10 I could use a translate or something but let me just do it with offsets at y plus 10 sorry and X plus 10 and Y so just to make sure it's still sort of the same thing but now what could I what do I need to do what if I increase X x equals x plus 10 so every frame I'm going to move to the next spot there we go one line now it's hard to see that all the way across one line all the way across and I lost my train of thought oh you know what's important here I should think of the 10 as some sort of like spate I'm gonna call that spacing so because we might want to change that so I should really use a variable for that and then if X gets to the end if it's greater than width I should reset X back to 0 and have Y increased by spacing so let's look at that there we go I now have 10 print in p5.js now Casey Risa actually has a artwork all about ten print and with a lot of varieties of changing I hold on let me say that again let me pause edit point here Casey Reese 10 print when I saw Casey's show here in New York there was a screen but I guess that's really just from the book yeah this is his website here with stuff about the book all right never mind let me restate that hopefully let this get a little further I still have an X plus ten I think do I have an error oh yeah thank you in the chat I just was told I left the ten here by accident so let me fix that so now here's the thing what's kind of amazing is that simple code created this suddenly quite elaborate beautiful maze pattern and I've you know thank you to the authors of the ten print book for inspiring me when the book came out to like really try this and use this in my teaching I often give this as an assignment to look at the book and try to like invent your own ten print design so how would you invent your own ten print design well what are the parameters of the system one thing is just the spacing so you know I can make space thing equal 50 and that's gonna change things quite a bit let me put it back at 20 just so we can sort of see it a little bit bigger and moves a little bit more quickly but one thing I could do is change the probability so what if I say you know what there's a 90% chance of drawing a backward slash or a forward slash I don't know which ones which a 10% of the other one now we get a pattern that has a certain quality to it because almost all the slashes are back slashes except for every once in a while there's a forward slash that probability could be adjusted with a slider over time I could also think about color you know the other thing here is like what if I just did something like draw a rectangle or not you know even just this idea of each cell on this grid either placing a rectangle there or not I've already got some type of generative constant this is really what I guess what this is is this is an example of computational design or procedural design I have an algorithm that specifies the design you have Salda width wall drawings I'll try to put some linked links to information about the artist Sol LeWitt and his wall drawings is a nice example of this the rules are generating the design and that design could be the same every time but with probability it could be different every time so I hope I don't want to go much further with this and change to much more because I would like to see what you do and you could also think by the way you could other thing you could change the way that I'm drawing this is I'm animating it one line at a time without changing the background but you could think about displaying it all at once or animating it in a different way from the center so there's a lot of possibilities there too so I hope that you will create your own 10 print design you will share it with me on Twitter or in the comments and then you can also submit it as a pull request to the readme file that's associated with this sketches code and I'll include a link to that also in this video's description so hold on one second did I mess anything up about my Commodore 64 and explaining the basic programming language I'm looking in the chat so why is it that so I'm so I'm noticing in the chat first of all people are complaining that I'm not using contest you're never gonna you're never going to get me to use Const here but let's look at the ASCII table so did the ASCII table change wears forward slash 47 and backward slash is 92 so why what did I miss why is it 205.50 someone's gonna explain this to me in a second because I want to get this is important I think and then I could see this like K week bun is typing me I am so Mia's typing I see this is typing in that patron slack root cause I'm also looking at that YouTube chat here but special Commodore 64 only car set okay so maybe that's what it is commerce 64 do not use ASCII okay great so what where's the good place for me important important correction it turns out that the Commodore 64 did not use the ASCII table as we know it today it has its own character set that's why cuz the ASCII code for a backslash is like 42 or 92 or 97 that's not that yeah I could look it up at an ASCII table but it doesn't match 205 and 206 so I did get that wrong in my earlier explanation I'm singing the chants the extended ASCII table so I didn't see any other Corrections I think I mostly got everything else right in this video and so please share with me your 10 print designs check out the book ten print thank the authors of the book for the great work that they did to talk about the history of this line of code and how it relates to creative component computing composing goodbye I'll see you in another coding challenge thanks well that's a great idea Iran and the chat says make a ten print out of a given image so that's kind of a cool idea all right it is six fifty let me check my phone see if there are any emergency things going on that I don't know about I paid my AT&T bill that's good I have eight maybe I should switch spoiler alert that's my that's not a spoiler alert I kind of want to really want to redeem myself here let's look at my original list from today okay wow the API stuff shoot so what am I willing to try to do before I leave this was a disaster come back to that another time I did ten print I don't know that I want to do the wind data I definitely don't wanna do the matrix math this was a suggestion by Simon that I will I've got to think about some more and this is stuff for later do I have it in me could definitely do the custom shapes not the wiki API what's wrong with that what could be I don't have a video tutorial about using it and it could be quite useful I do have an example let me go look at the example just see github.com this is for one of my classes I was gonna try to make a Wikipedia like crawler where it would you type in a word it goes to that article and then it finds a link to another article and link to another article so it's almost like an exquisite corpse like random sequence that's what I was thinking to make that's what I was thinking to make I want to look at my Wikipedia code one of the things why I like using the Wikipedia API is that you don't have to authenticate to it so this is search for a particular article and then I do something where I get the data from that article hmm alright everybody use arcs please what was on the straw poll all right let's try HSB that harmonic motion thing has got to just get tossed when we try to do some more stuff so let's strawpoll this I might try to do both of these which which one first customshape tutorial that actually really do cuz it's relevant to the clouds thing you kind of need it for the clouds things vertex curve vertex and Wikipedia crawler I kinda want a different name for that Wikipedia I guess it's a crawler I would like to try to do both of these this has been a very long livestream but I feel like I'm gonna need a quick break to use the bathroom so Q learning oh yeah that's definitely gonna happen right now so this is the new straw poll w1e 8xk ax just in case i can only do one and curious what people think so I'm going to I'm gonna cause you all to crit maybe some of you didn't see that see the the try play the trailer again for those of you can get to see it earlier why take a quick pee break good idea bad idea I do a straw poll for that it's writing straw poll if you're gonna pick what you want later it's a very very valid criticism and I apologize that I didn't actually do what was on the straw poll but I was a little so maybe I shouldn't trailer okay so I'm gonna play this trailer a while and see it's 1 minute long I'm gonna mute the microphone when I play it because otherwise it'll be embarrassing and I'm gonna see if I can make it back within one minute otherwise it's just going oh it's just gonna go to black at the end there's gonna be some black nothingness until I get back but I think I could pee within one minute we're gonna see it says this is the pee challenge my son loves this joke which I won't tell right now okay I'm gonna tell it there's a student in the class who's learning about the alphabet and the teacher says student please recite the alphabet and the soon I really really really have to go to the bathroom well recite the alphabet first a a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q I ruined the joke ABCD efg hijk LMNOP QRS TUV wxy and z now i know my abc is one time won't you sing with me and the teacher says what happened to the p and the student says it's halfway down my leg I don't have the padam Chun terrible that's the old joke o people know that joke okay here we go ready for the trailer that's a here we go 1 2 3 I can make it I'm also I got to mute the microphone hit the trailer and be back pick you up at the station we'll make our own creation you you I'm back okay did I hopefully I'm moving my microphone correctly I'm noticing that this mic is actually in like a horrible position on my shirt surprised that people could actually hear me it was like pointed down so hopefully the audio is fine maybe the audio is a little bit quiet can we fix that all right almost in time the cringe is real I should just release that video now but I'm gonna release that after it okay so let's look at the results here well only it no way look at this coding trim history 66 well 166 people voted on this which is kind of amazing and I got exactly 50 50 did you guys play is this like a trolling me sort of thing let's refresh the results oh we got one more wait that's weak one more for the Wikipedia crawler fascinating oh so you know what this means you know what this means everybody it's time for the spinning wheel Schiffman and I could use a lot of contributions to make this better github io / randomizer custom shapes customer shapes custom shapes Wikipedia alright here we go we are going to spin this wheel we're gonna figure out which one to do I must by the way I can do the straw poll and then not listen to the straw poll but I cannot do the spinning wheel and not listen to the spinning wheel I have to obey the spinning wheel so I'm just gonna keep pressing this button and then at some point I will stop here we go Wikipedia custom shape apparently you can't blow air and wind onto a simulated arrow thing that's not even on a screen because this is a green wall but I just try no oh my goodness oh my god guess what everybody I apologize if you're in the patron chat I am it wasn't scrolling so I missed I missed all these messages creative composing composting etc etc six degrees of Kevin Bacon fluids haha force Isis I'm just checking trolling successful they have no wheel ok the 200 the 2000 the bitrate yeah I should try it let me try changing the bitrate cuz why not let me just try that right now since I'm like three hours into this stream output output streaming I'm gonna try changing the bitrate to 5000 I don't know if it'll really do that in realtime but let's try like I just changed look at the straw poll again I just changed the bitrate a custom shape is but by one vote you know we got to go with the wheel look that's amazing alright well I'm gonna do both let's do though Wikipedia first cuz it'll take forever and then I'll be it'll be a disaster and I'll be motivated to do the custom shapes thing again ok so let's try to create let's I'm so hungry I need to eat some dinner I need more coffee and I should not be doing this right now it's 7 o'clock I have to leave at 730 745 desktop p5 generate be Wikipedia crawler then what I want to do is CD Wikipedia crawler atom then what I need to do is go to the go to the desktop I'm already in this and I need to quit my old terminal thing that I had open because I can never seem to and run a serverside in my history yep okay then what I need to do is look at the Wikipedia API documentation which is here I think oh boy oh boy oh boy oh I don't like this at all oh wait I don't like this documentation okay getting text messages that I can't respond to right now no canvas okay I might just have two equals and search equals there's a mistake in my code let's look at this search equals rainbow okay great so this gives me a search for all the articles that have rainbow and then it looks at gives me the content for the mean oh no it gives me like a gives me like a one sentence about each of these so now if I want to look at an actual article I'm just gonna I I've waded through this documentation before and I don't want to have to do that again so I want to do this content action equals query profit equals revision this is weird this is the callback for the article content but how do I know which article it is oh and titles equals the article got it got it got it got it got it got it got it so now I also need to say and titles I think I can do multiple ones but so yeah this gives me all the content on the rainbow page title rainbow and if I did like rainbow trout right rainbow trout and then this is like finding other titles right okay this good night Simon you've been very very very very quick makeup bot to play the game that wicked game oh my god it's 1 a.m. it's what we're excitement is thank you for watching Simon I'm sorry that this has gone on so late I hope this has been helpful and useful and interesting for you ok alright where are we let's see ok so I think I'm good I just want to have these in I'm just gonna put these in my code already because there's no way I'm gonna be able to remember them and that is fine okay all right here we go everybody we're gonna do a Wikipedia thing there's a South Korean band called rainbow cool alright so this is the documentation oh this is the documentation this is better yeah this is what I want to look at this is actually what I meant to look at titles equals main page pro right okay so alright so let me close all this close this and localhost this open this alright here we go everybody ready for this I'm just trying to make crazy amount of content quantity over quality is the name of the game here at the coding train I'm probably not the smartest idea but I can't sometimes I get into this mode where I can't stop can we go hello I am going to do a coding challenge with the Wikipedia API um I don't think I've done this before I'm not exactly entirely sure what I'm going to build in a way it might be better for me to just do a tutorial about the Wikipedia API but let's make this a challenge so this is what I'm thinking there's a lot of interesting things you could do if you can get access to the content of Wikipedia you can make poetry machines and all sorts of experimental text things but one thing I know that people have done effectively is make games that you can play by sort of crawling and moving around Wikipedia and there are lots of interesting examples about that hopefully to get the chat so what I'm going to attempt to do I think is create a sketch where I'm going to say user input I'm going to create a little user input box and I'm gonna say user input equals I'm going to use the p5 function create input so now we should if I go to the code we should have a nice little input box and I'm gonna say and you know what I'm actually gonna do let me do this differently instead of using the create function let me get rid of the styling stuff let me actually put it in the HTML so Wikipedia coding challenge thing I'm hoping that I'll make something kind of onion not interesting sorry I'm hoping that I'm gonna make something not so interesting and that you the viewer will learn and see how I did it but have a more creative and mind to make something more interesting and exciting so I'm gonna say word and then I'm gonna say input ID equals user input input so I just I prefer to like put the the elements that I want on the web page in HTML so now we can see and I so now what I can do instead of this I can say select well time out I'm getting some text messages I have to respond to these if I'm gonna stream past 7 o'clock on a Friday I have to respond to my text messages whether before I shouldn't look at them okay oh great let's see I'll be done soon okay so I'd rather just select it and now we have access to what's written in it in and so what did i do did I do something wrong input is this something wrong with my HTML here oh yeah this should be h1 thank you so there we go so and actually let me make it h2 because it's so large there we go so I want to enter in a word here hello and hit like enter or something so when I hit enter I can handle that event saying user input changed go Wiki so what I want to do is have a function when the user hits enter or tab that that will signal that there's been a change in the text field I could also add a button or something but I'm not worrying about interface design here you could worry about that when you redo what I do and now I'm just going to write a function and I'm gonna call it go wiki and the first thing I want to do is just get what is in that what is in it so first I want to I'm gonna say let word or term or something term equal user input value console dot log term I don't know what I just did there but okay okay so again this is my sort of friendly style of writing JavaScript you could do this in 15 different other ways that's what i'ma do the other thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add rainbow in here so it's that's not right I guess I say value equals rainbow so it's in there and then changed of null so the idea here is user input and then in here I said select Oh user input so it'd be nice if I put an ad in there so there we go okay so now if I hit enter tab oh it hasn't changed actually yeah so rainbows so the funny thing is is it started with the rainbow when I hit enter it did I surprise you is a button must submit whatever I'm actually gonna skip bypass all of that and I'm just going to when the window code starts I'm just gonna immediately call go wiki so I'm using this just like I want to setup an interface to make this dynamic with different words but I just want every time i refresh the page for it to run to test what's going working so I should see every time I run it I get a console log of what's in there I could change a different word so now the first thing I want to do is look for a list of articles with that term in it so I you know I've already done the research about the Wikipedia API and how it works normally in these coding challenges I like to kind of like figure that out but I have to admit the Wikipedia document API documentation is a bit difficult is to read but here it is and I can see this this is basically what I'm using here I think is that this is looking for this URL tells to send you the content of a page but there's also like a URL to get us to do a search so you can look through and read all about how to do this but I'm actually just gonna I already have a URL right here this is for a search so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna say VAR URL equals and actually let's um let me use these let me make these and I'm gonna I have to use let not bar I'm gonna say put this put this back up at the top there I'm gonna say let search URL equal and this is the full URL I'm gonna go all the way to the end and close the quotes but I'm gonna take that out because what I want to do is have an end and then I want the search term to form dynamically so I'm gonna say let URL equal search URL plus term so let's just console.log that URL to see that that's working there we go so now you can see that's the full URL if searching for rainbow and that's dynamic because if I were to put in here you know unicorn and hit enter now I'm gonna get unicorn so the first thing that I want to do is just sort of see what's in that I'm I want to I just want to copy this URL and I want to look at it I didn't get it I could just click on it instead of copying it but I'm gonna put it in here and look this is the JSON JavaScript object notation formatted data that's coming from the Wikipedia API and it's giving me a list of all the possible pages with the term rainbow in it so let me just pick the first one so how do I even get that so it's coming in as in so first of all I have to request it from my code I'm looking at in the browser so I want to say load JSON URL and then I'm gonna say got data so let's make sure this comes through and I'm gonna write a function called got data and that's the callback for when the data comes through and I'm kind of entering into a dangerous territory of having all these nested callbacks first there's a callback for the input box then there's a callback for the data then I'm gonna do something else with a callback so someday I might want to refactor this using a sort of more thoughtful approach of how to sequence all these callbacks but I'm just gonna kind of do it willynilly right now console dot log data so let's see what happens here ah so look at this this is like the bane of everybody's existence on the Internet access control allow origin header not present I can I use it course to say ba ba ba ba ba ba so this is a really unfortunate it's the Wikipedia API doesn't seem to have something called cores which is crossorigin resources or something like that enabled allowing us to fetch data from another server from a server which is where our code is running some api's will let you do this some won't I'm pretty sure since I've used this before in code that there's a way around this it's called JSON PE I sort of made a video about this somewhere else it's JSON with padding and p5 has a nice option so often what I do and I've said this before is it didn't work I got cores let me just add another argument here JSON P so if I last add this third argument let me try it with JSON P and let me run it again and there we go it came through so we could say a lot more about that but in this case were just lucky we tried it first without JSON P now we try it with JSON P so what I'm looking for is it comes in as an array I want the first element the first element of the first element of the array so I'm going to try to see if I could say console log data 00 let's see what I get and I could pick a random one that might be more interesting but let me just pick the first one I got are mmm did I get the o 0 no one zero sorry I want data 1 the second element the first element of the second element there we go rainbow so let's just see rainbow let's try putting other things in here like unicorn and let's just try like a few characters like ar e there's a I guess there's a Wikipedia page for our e P P you why okay what's going on here let's look at the full data 0tu I know there is a Wikipedia page for Pui which is the French burning the point is if I pan turd in a search term that was just part of a page I wouldn't get it back but you'll think of something so now what I want to do okay so once I have the what I'm gonna pause for a second and think of something okay I've got to I've got to think of some whatever what's a sequence of characters that that wouldn't be its own thing in the Wikipedia TL TL TL C EXC someone is saying in the chat there is a Wikipedia page for exe right he X C but I'm basically getting yeah look at this okay I can't think of anything it doesn't matter what I'm gonna do we're gonna check so let's change it to random so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna say let's length equal data index one length it's probably it's I think it's gonna just give me sort of 10 by default and then I'm gonna say let index equal floor random length so I want to pick a random index into that array and I'm going to say data index 1 data 1 index so this should give me a random article that'll be better let me go back to my thing here so now I got rainbow the South Korean band if I type in what it was I PU why I got py but there are other ones it won't oh it's I didn't I gotta have the submit button unicorn I got unicorn bubble so you can see I'm getting a random one each time let's do rainbow again I got Rainbow Brite let's do a unicorn again and I got unicorns the cricket team okay so we're getting a random article each time that's good I forgot what I'm doing here exactly but now let's at least get the article data so the next thing that I want to do once I have that title so really what I'm saying is VAR title equals this now one thing about Wikipedia titles is let's say I try to actually look for unicorns cricket team on Wikipedia so I'm gonna go to with unicorns cricket team Wikipedia see if I can get that page here it is look at the URL the title the way Wikipedia works is it actually uses underscores wherever there are spaces so I'm gonna need to account for that so one thing I'm gonna do is I'm now gonna say title equals replace oh sorry title this is a JavaScript function that allows me to use a regular expression which you can watch my regular expression tutorials match any white space I could have just done this any like space but let's do I'm gonna be smart about this any one or more white space in a row with an underscore now let me console.log that title and let's see what this looks like you can see I got rainbow flag now oh you know what I forgot it only replaced the first space so I need to have the global flag here so it replaces all the spaces and I know you can see it replaced all the spaces rainbow trout etc rainbow rainbow bright etc okay so here we go now what am I gonna do now I need to ask Wikipedia and here's the next this is I'm gonna call this the content URL this is the URL for asking for the content and I think you can ask the fact that it's it you can see at the end here it's titled equals I think you can ask for content of multiple articles but I'm just gonna do one so what I'm going to do now if back into my code I'm gonna go down here to see what I mean by this sort of nested callback thing that I've done is kind of a bit of a problem I'm going to say load JSON okay Leslie the bar here letletlet URL equal the content URL plus the title and then I call it content URL with lowercase RL content URL plus the title and then lo JSON URL and then got now I need another you know most people when writing JavaScript I don't most people we put an anonymous function right in there that's the callback or use some type of other technique to have nested callbacks like async our promises I'm gonna be pretty terrible about it and I'm gonna say I'm gonna call this got search and I'm gonna call this got content and just write another function called this data and I'm gonna say console whoops and I'm gonna say console dot log data okay so now I want to see I want to look at the say console dot log querying and title oh there's that new like backtick fancy way in es6 of you doing strings got to do that at some point okay okay so let's do this uh so I went for Rainbow Brite but it didn't get the content of Rainbow Brite so what I'm going to do is say why because I forgot about json p so i have to do json p i had that cross origin error again and does this look like I got stuff this looks weird hmm all right let's see rainbow flag with stress again rainbow flag some so what did I miss here back tick template strings okay hold on what did I miss timeout edit point so this didn't work content URL plus title let's look at that let's log that URL so this is the URL copy link address oh oh we need to come in Oh apologies so actually this is working I just find this to be totally confusing to look at but the content is in there I should have thought like I have to go and investigate how the JSON is format at first so I could say I can I can copy this link and look at it and by the way I have a Chrome extension installed it's called like JSON format err let me look at the stuff this way so really what this is I got to look under query pages huh I have to know the ideal hold on a second here so pages page idea revisions oh my god goodness three items content format star this is what I want which is oh this is the Wikipedia API is organized strangely and maybe there's another way to do this but I actually need to I think I might I have to think about how do I if I don't if the page ID is gonna be different how do I know what to look up because revisions is under this page ID did I get the page ID in the previous query so hold on I have to look at the previous query is there a page ID in here there's no page ID here alright I'm out again the first one can you just do the first I can do index for the first object is that what I need to do object keys data query okay okay look I could look up the keys that's a good point that Alka is making there's a little interesting discussion in the chat going on about Const I got a look at my text messages when I'm taking this break okay okay all right hold on let me think about this okay so while I see the content here under star there's something pretty tricky about this which is I don't know what this is going to be it's the page ID so I've got to pull that dynamically somehow let's see if we can figure that out so I know I want to go to query pages and then something so let me look at this right here console.log data I can get rid of this console log let me say data pages query so let's look at that undefined undefined what did I miss let's data pages undefined okay so I messed that up oh it's just hold on query is sorry looks like query is the first object I want data query yep now pages sorry let me start over query pages I did for me let me pour not yet so looking at this I have query pages and then some number which is the page ID which is something that's going to be different for every article so I have to somehow pull that dynamically in order to get down here to this stuff which is the content which is what I want so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say let me look here and I can change this console.log data dot query dot pages let's see what I get oops I'm in the wrong place and hit refresh so I got it so how do I know what this number is can I just use like an index I could get the key I could say object keys but what if I just say index zero will that work for the first object no undefined so I could say object keys to give me all the keys that are in this and then look I've got that so the page ID this is pretty weird that what I'm doing I know if there's a better way to do this page ID equals object keys data query pages index 0 index 0 so let's see if that gives me the page ID whoops I have too many brackets what if I messed up here too many parentheses and okay here we go lots of errors here here we go let's try to get this right this this deserves a drumroll am I gonna see the page ID yes and I'm gonna see different page IDs look at that so I'm able to get the page IDs whatever so now what I want is the content to be equal to so so let me just call it page equal data query pages and now I want to say page page ID right because I want to go and look at I want to look at page pages or pages page ID revisions star dot revisions star now here's the thing you can say dot the name of the thing if it's a valid variable name like revisions but I can't say dot star because star is not a valid character for a variable so I've got to use these brackets boy I'm really off my rocker here with this crazy convoluted using Wikipedia low okay here we go let's see what's the chance that I got something here Oh let's look console dot log content undefined mmm let's look at revisions okay got something there revisions zero oh it's an array so zero star oh my goodness zero stars these are really this is like detective work it's not even programming just to figure out how this thing works they are there look there's the content of the Wikipedia page I finally got the content of the Wikipedia page now what do I do with that Oh No so let's do this let's first do a couple things let's say let me at least say right about right before I asked for the content let me say create P title so I got that and now I got the content if I type unicorn in here I and I get the content so now the question is what do I want to do well I could search for a word and then I could so I could pick a random word and then search for articles with that random word in it why not right I could look for links like I could look for special links to other Wikipedia pages but let's be really simple about this and let's just actually let's use another regular expression I got to move they're gonna make this challenge I got to finish this up and I wrap this challenge up somehow so let's use a regular expression let's say I want to say were word regex equals any valid sequence of word characters one or more and let's actually let's say it has to be at least four or more so I have to be at least be like a fourletter word and then and I could put word boundaries right word boundaries I guess and then make it global and then I could say what how do I do this again I say word regex exec or match where do I say Content match I can't even remember my own right right which content match the word regular expression by the way I'm kind of off my rocker here in the sense that I am now using all sorts of stuff like regular expressions you could compare expressions tutorials but what I'm trying to do here is create match a given word and that word is any sequence of characters for more I'm deciding and then I want to look at this so let's see I don't know if I did this right let's see if this gives me a bunch of words on the page it look it did it gave me two thousand four hundred seventy four words like vandal M vandalism expiry October so now what I'm going to do oh boy is I'm gonna pick one of those randomly and by the way the nice thing and it's in it's just an array that if the whole thing is an array p5 the random function I can give it an array and it'll pick me a random one from it and I'm gonna put that in now whoops sorry sorry I messed up what am I doing here you go back the nice thing about p5 is I can now say I'm going to save our words equals the result of this regular expression then var word equals pick a random one so the p5 random function you can actually give it a ran will pick a random one out and I'm gonna say console.log word and I'm going to run this and it gave me average so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go with you what I'm just gonna give this forget I would give this a go wiki word or turn so it starts with user input value but this go wiki term just does it with that thing so now I can say go wiki word now I'm gonna probably crash my browser because I'm gonna be doing this over and over again I should put something in that stops but it'll actually just go back and do this whole sequence again so let's see what happens yeah look at this hey a Wikipedia random article crawler I need to stop how do I stop it okay let's at least figure out oh good at least I got an error at some point that's how I stopped it look how far I got I got to the return of Saturn so somehow we got femme fatale madeinamerica each tear from rainbow south korean band so i should at least probably do some type of protection yeah I'm going to do something sort of silly whichever's gonna say let counter equals zero I should come up with a better way of doing this and I'm gonna say counter equals counter plus 1 and if counter is greater than 10 O's less than 10 so only do this 10 times and I'm just gonna say create div just so it's a little less of all that space and now let's try this one more time it did it 10 times and it stopped and in theory I should be able to know the counter should get reset anytime change now but you know what I'm gonna do forget it let's let's not have it dude it's only gonna be I'll do it once you got this will be easily fixable so now I'm gonna put something in here like unicorn and OH so what happened there oh whoops okay go wiki is the thing that starts it of course of course so I need another function start search so I'm going to create a function called function start search and that does go wiki user input dot value and also sets the counter equal to zero there we go perfect now everything is done so I can actually do this and I can change this to unicorn and it will give me crawl a bunch of random articles and then I could give it happy and it will crawl a bunch of random articles and end with music okay everybody thank you for watching this random Wikipedia article coding challenge thing it required a lot required regular expressions it requires of callbacks and low JSON and json p and ohio wiki API works Wikipedia I hope I hope you make something from this and actually be more thoughtful and have a an idea here of why you might want to crawl Wikipedia and make some kind of strange thing with it so I sure would be what you make and I look forward to seeing you in a future video yeah so me I am so be is rightly complaining that I put all my functions inside setup but you know I'm just not worrying about this right now they're all being hoisted because they're not using let don't worry about it is me all right let me look at my text messages let's see if I could do the custom shapes thing okay okay meet there great okay okay well okay let me just check one thing see if I can do this custom shapes thing cuz I and I'll be done by 800 cuz that's only gonna be 20 minutes for sure and I'm never gonna do this again where I go for hours and hours and hours but I'm just checking something here on my phone you can listen to this waiting music okay all right all is well and I should probably just do the custom shapes next week does anybody actually want to still keep watching this live stream if you do you're I feel like I have to make enough videos to rightfully not include the simple harmonic motion challenge okay people are gonna still watch all right I'm gonna try to do this kind of quick well I love that I got Newsies the musical in there that's pretty awesome let's see here p5 manager is like the greatest thing ever p5 generate be custom shapes did I oh did I put some bars in there oh yeah at least when I publish the code that will get fixed actually I kind of was happy with the way this like crazy example I feel like there's a lot of possibilities from there I'm thinking by the way if I start having like the stream crash I might come back to say goodbye but that'll be the last straw didn't I start this 3 hours and 40 minutes ago I did I don't know that I've done a live stream and it ruins still sake please dude neural networks it'll come why go watch Suraj was here he's got lots of videos on neural networks you can watch this great I watch them that's why I learned a lot of stuff ok you can close this close this close this I haven't read any random numbers I know anyone programming design system okay okay we c'mon points out that I have selling England by the pound which is one of my favourite albums I don't actually know that album so I'm gonna have to check it out so if you guys aren't familiar with this what I have here is rune Matson's programming design systems book which is excellent I also have to do my physical therapy exercises it's put a lot of times we've been here for four hours I forgot to add an email I was supposed to send I guess I might give myself a reminder shoot I have too much this is I'm overwhelmed it's tough to do this just sending myself a reminder by Genesis okay this is oh by the way this waiting music is awesome Lee long cuz I can't because I've been streaming for four hours I could say things like awesomely now the marathon next Friday by the way I'm gonna do an Alexa skill and classes in es6 so I kind of have that planned actually so that's coming next Friday alright this is kind of like showing up okay alright here we go everybody hello Ukraine what time is it isn't in the Ukraine everyone's saying I'm sorry for all the people who like I'm making you stay awake go to sleep sleep is important whoops and you will certainly wake up to be able to watch this why do you do so much p5 in so a little processing lately that's a very valid question yeah kind of like the fact that I can just share this stuff on the web really easily but I would like to do more stuff in processing so you know try to think about that okay alright here we go hello this is a video tutorial about custom shapes and I am showing you on this webpage a much better explanation of how custom shapes that I will give you this is actually rune Matson's online book called programming design systems I think I might have referenced this before it's got an excellent chapter on color at rune mattes and on twitter rune is amazing there's lots of really interesting stuff with graphic design and code for graphic design and so this this web page really will walk you through the this idea of how you can think about a shape as having different vertices again this is not my work this is room Madison's work but this is what I want to cover what does this kind of code mean and even better like what are some things you can do with that so I will let you I'm gonna link to this page you can just stop watching this video and click on it and read it but if you want to keep watching I'm gonna kind of give you my own take on this sort of stuff okay now there's a so what I'm talking about is custom shapes so whoops to click over here what I'm talking about is custom shapes so what do I mean by custom shapes so you might be familiar with a rectangle looks like this or perhaps a circle also known as an ellipse which looks like this there is a line which looks like this and a point which looks like this and a triangle which looks like this and I think this might be everything so there are a list of defined primitive shapes primitive geometry set kinds of polygons set kinds of shapes that you could call the function and drawn p5 but you might want to draw this shape because this is the most glorious shape ever drawn house is a terrible example time out it's gonna disappear in a second so this is gonna you can just do a magic edit point where this goes away and while I erase this Matt you gonna be working overtime I get I don't need to do a live stream next Friday cuz this is like five million hours long okay let's start with something simpler what if I wanted to do this shape so this shape is we can think of as a polygon a shape with many sides and a polygon can be defined by its vertices the vertices being each of these points that connects the sides and this is actually one two three four five so actually if you have a polygon with four arbitrary signs like this you can actually do this with the quad function the quad function 2p5 are processing both of all this codes for processing or p5 allows you to specify four points but what I want to do is make a custom shape so the only way for me to do this that I know of at least is to use a function called begin shape and use a function called n shape so if I use these functions begin shape and end shape what I can do is do in between begin and end I can set any number of arbitrary vertices so I can say vertex vertex over and over again now I could do this if fur and processing this will actually also work in 3d and there's a piece shape object and all sorts of fancy stuff you could do but I just want to look at it from the simple 2d lens that we were doing in p5 and so um so this is the basic idea begin shape and this indentation is unnecessary I'm putting it there just sort of for visual effect but this is the idea now so let's take a look at that and make sure it works so I'm gonna come over here and whoops sorry everybody that's the wrong window I'm gonna say begin shape and I'm gonna say vertex I'm just gonna make up some points 150 vertex 224 at X 200 100 uh vertex 50 I'm not very good at picking numbers I need my random number book vertex 25 50 I've no idea what I've just done let's say n shape and now I'm gonna hit refresh and look there it is so in theory that's my shape and I wasn't very thoughtful about the vertices and the order the order does really matter and we can see if I did something weird with the order because this shape can be filled or stroked in the same way that by that I mean setting the outline color or the fill color so I could say stroke 255 and fill no film just to sort of see no Phil Phil no Phil no Phil no Phil for you we can see I am so that's it so look at that so I maybe I didn't do anything too crazy those are all the points notice how you could with no fill you can actually think of this as a path so it could be a shape that's filled and enclosed or it could be a path and incidentally it if I wanted to close it right I could say oh let me put the first point again now it's closed but that's kind of silly right what actually I can do is just write the argument close in here and now you can see it closed it automatically but I'm going to take that out now one thing I should mention is there actually is other stuff that can go in here maybe I need to come back in a whole separate video to go through all those possibilities but I can specify the kind of shape like if I there's something called a triangle strip which likes if I give it a whole bunch of points it'll put a whole bunch of triangles in between all of those things and I have a feeling that if I go to I'm gonna go to the processing documentation because I know that'll come up begin shape processing we could see a lot of those possibilities here right lines triangles like now if I use those points it's not one shape but it's through every three vertices we'll make a separate triangle triangle strip we'll connect it with a bunch of triangles triangle fan you could use quads you can use and I think I use this in like the Perlin noise terrain challenge and a bunch of my different coding challenges but I'm gonna be in this video I just want to keep things simple and I just want to use vertex so there we go so that's the idea now there's two things that I want to mention here number one is what would be interesting for me to do is come up with an algorithm that sets all these vertices you know what's the point really of me manually setting these vertices more likely I might want to do something like I'm gonna do this really quickly like what if I were to say for let a equals zero and okay so incidentally I'm using a for loop so for some reason to watch this video before I used for loop you have to go back and watch the Lupus video I should probably just stop saying that I'm gonna say a is less than 360 a plus equals ten and then what I'm gonna do and this is I'm gonna use something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation this is a little bit of an aside but this is worth it I don't know if this is worth doing I'm gonna say let X equal just to demonstrate the idea 100 times sine of a let y equals 100 times cosine of a plus 200 plus 200 and then I'm gonna say vertex I have a reason why I'm doing this actually I'm gonna say vertex XY let's just see what happens yeah I got something crazy I said all these vertices all of the place so what I'm actually doing is something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation I link to a video that goes over into more detail but basically if I have this angle a what I want is to just keep changing that angle a to set a whole bunch of vertices around the circle and I can use cosine and sine trigonometry math to get all those points and I'll link to a video that goes through that in more detail but one of the reasons why this worked really weirdly is I didn't set the angle mode to degrees because I'm thinking about the full way around the circle is 360 degrees and it's using a radians which is a different by default different form of measurement so now we can see there it is and I want to say close so now I want it let me actually say let spacing equal 50 I'm gonna have this be spacing and we can see that's what I get now then what's interesting about this is I'm now going to put this into draw and I can have spacing be variable so I'm going to say spacing equals and I just did that's how I did this far Matic motion challenge it was a disaster I could have that value oscillate oh let's do this I'm off the beaten path this is really just a tutorial about custom shapes but I'm gonna use a sine wave in it might be a bad idea but I'm just gonna do it anyway so I'm gonna say I'm gonna I'm gonna have a variable called T and was set equal to zero Len Len Len Len let me be more simple about this okay let's spacing equal map mouse X which goes between zero and width two between what I want the spacing to be like at five degrees and 100 degrees so let's at least see this work whoa oh I forgot to draw the background in here so let me put the background in draw so you can see right I'm getting I'm changing that angle so I'm slowly increasing the resolution in the circle so the point that I wanted to show this to you is not because this is some beautiful pattern that you should use but the reason why you might use custom shapes and said vertices is actually gonna have an algorithm to find those vertices so what if you wanted to make a bubble a cloud so I actually have a coding trained community project about making a cloud which I'll also link to in here which this could form the basis I think I've done stuff with a curly noise blob coding challenge at one point that this also relates to so there's a lot of possibilities here what I was gonna do was use a sine wave to have this feel like it's breathing SPAC and forth back and forth so that's maybe at something that you should try as an exercise after this video so what I want to do I'm going to leave this here but I'm gonna comment this out again and I want to just talk about one other thing so here we go remember this weird shape that I created this shape is a polygon that has a set of vertices but in addition to vertex there's actually something called curve vertex that I can call now there's also something called bezzie a vertex and bezzie a vertex is a kind of curve vertex for a special a curve called a Bezier curve and actually the patrons custom shaped page goes through that in detail I'm gonna say Bezier curves for like another video because I don't know if I understand that at this moment so I have to go read runes excellent description and then come back to it but curve vertex what curve vertex does is it says instead of having like a hard edge here let's try to curve around that edge but here's the thing I should probably make this a separate video but I'm in this video so you have to be watching all the way the end of this video here's the thing that's tricky and I'm gonna there's gonna be some magic erasing in a second that's gonna happen here so much yeah you can edit out this erasing because one of these days I'm gonna figure out like a good way to erase that's not tissues this is horrible what I'm doing today okay back so one of the trickiest things about working with curves is that you're gonna suddenly discover when use curve vertex points just disappear why so let's imagine that I have these three points oh okay now I might say to myself like oh of course this is what I want the curve to be a time out this wall is kind of wet so I forgot that I sprayed water on it so it doesn't work to draw on it if it's wet let's say that I have these three points these three maybe this marker died we just wait is it the marker or is it the the marker kind of got wet too okay but if I use it it's better okay we're gonna wonder what those circles are doing over there let's say I have these three points now we could look at this and we could say to ourselves like I kind of know what I meant I want to draw this curve but if you think about it more there's actually no way for the computer to know how to draw this curve without more information because why couldn't it be like this or something that's that's a little bit weird let me try that again why couldn't it be like this this would be a valid curve and the difference is how do I enter the curve I've had it in a poor job of drawing this but I think the next thing I'm going to do is and make it more clear what if there was like a secret point right over here that said how to enter this curve or the secret point was over here that send out an edge of the curve and up here it would be over here right this is gonna look different if there's so curves require additional points that control the entry and exit of the curve do I should I need to curve and like come down here do we need to curve and like end up over here and so it can be really confusing and but you have to be aware of this so let's actually go and look at the code and see if we can make this work and let me simplify things actually let me actually make up some specific vertices so I'm gonna say vertex what what's the size of the window it's 200 200 so I'm going to say vertex 10 200 150 and then and let's actually make this 100 200 and then 300 200 oh and I don't know what I'm doing and putting it all in one line vertex I don't know can you see this bottom down here I want three vertices okay and now let's take a look at this oh do I have clothes I want to take out clothes and I messed up the middle one I want this to be at 200 so this is those are my three vertices so I want to make this a curve so a couple things one is let me just draw these points so we can see them separately also 300 200 I mean this is very redundant what I'm doing but strokeweight 4 and then stroke whoops then let's do stroke weight 1 ok so I can see points there so I'm gonna change this the curve vertex and you're gonna see what I need curve vertex and I don't see anything anymore now I should have done this with more than I should do this with 4 points so let's make this one 50 50 and 250 like 60 or something so you're gonna see oh boy let's and that's also my apologies let's also put these as the actual points were drawing and where where does this go whoops what would I say one fifty one fifty fifty and two fifty sixty so you can see these points are actually controlling how this curve looks and there could be many more points it's just controlling the entry of the curve so like what if I made this point Mouse X Mouse Y this is what I'm trying to demonstrate Mouse X took me a while to get to this but Mouse X Mouse Y and now I'm gonna make that first point Mouse X Mouse Y so you can see as I move this around it changes the zoom in a little bit more it changes the entry to the curve and actually this is an interesting way to make something interactive like imagine of this oscillated upanddown it's almost like this wiggling string or something so again as you're building these custom shapes this shape now is only those two points right if I were to say close you know Oh interestingly enough it's like I look it actually connected it all the way around to the first point so the first point is controlling wow this is kind of crazy this is kind of a nice so you can imagine creating some interesting animation by just wow clothes really made the interesting if you do close this whole problem kind of goes away I don't the problem but it doesn't enter it comes around to the end so that's kind of interesting I just discovered that now so you can see the difference if I use clothes because it adds the point another thing that you can do often which is sort of the same thing is I could duplicate the last point twice so that's sort of like I that last point is also the control point for yourself so you can see it's not changing but I am including the first point twice so I could do that also like I could include the first point twice instead of Mouse X Mouse Y and now I kind of have whoops whoops I that's not the first point I could sorry if there was a different first point which was originally one hundred two hundred right so if I'd have that twice and get rid of Mouse that's why this can also be a strategy so it's kind of like just duplicate the first point and duplicate the last point but you don't have as much control I would need yet another point right like this point the mouse to control that so you can see now I could control this with the mouse so there's so many possibilities I'm sorry that I kind of went off the deep end then with like messing around with this but the point is and also incidentally I can mix curve vertex and vertex now let's see if we can make this more obvious or maybe that doesn't work so I'm pretty sure you can do that in processing I'm going to investigate if that works in p5 or not but the idea being that I can mix summer curbs summer jagged so to recap custom shapes are shapes that you just are polygons or paths that you define by a set of vertices you can make you can you can have them be tiled by certain kinds of quad strips or triangle strips or that kind of thing you can have curved vertices or regular vertices curve if you have curved you need to have control points for the curve and the reason for doing that is quite possibly more likely because you want to have something more dynamic oh and look I connected these in this weird crazy way so here's the like ending Frankenstein thing of this like weird hardcoded and circle so I hope you make what if your engine if you don't know what to make from this take a look at the link to the cloud community cloud repository I mean you might be watching this a year in the future hopefully it'll still be there but this is a project that's happening in 2017 for processing day which is October 21st 2017 for the name tags in processing day so if you're interested in consuming to that and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial thanks for watching oh I forgot to mention that okay hold on this is somebody mentioned Catmull ROM splines so maybe this can be inserted in there somehow something I want to mention actually before I wrap up with the computer is that you might be asking yourself like well what's the math that calculates this curve well there are different kinds of mathematical functions to figure out how a curve goes between two different points I mentioned a Bezier curve there's a specific kind of bezzie a function and it works pretty differently than this but it it is something you could look at but this is actually known as a Catmull this this is using p5 and use the Catmull wrong spline spline being kind of another word for curve and it these are people's names who came up with this algorithm so I'll try to include a link to a historical information about the Catmull Rohm spline and I apologize if I I spell that or said that wrong Thanks okay all right all right everybody I met you maybe you can splice that little explanation in there or we could just leave it out it doesn't really matter but likes place it not at the very end but like after I was there and then I do that and then I came here and wrapped up all right everybody it is 805 this is for our live stream cat bowl is a name yes I I don't think I can do anything else today that Lisa Zhu curve thing I don't know if it could be made into a video I don't like it remind me later goodbye thank you for tuning in judo network's down very funny Allen and I hope you enjoyed this live stream I'm pretty exhausted I will be back next Friday even though now I feel like it did to live streams in one day and I could text Friday off and OH people want to see so I'm gonna release the trailer so if people want to watch the trailer should I just do that right now I'm gonna release it as soon as I turn off the live stream I'll release the trailer and then these will be edited and that sort of thing I'm sorry I really I just I just have to go that's for the son thank you everybody choo choo 273 that is a random number for you all my Jake I can't do any more I'm exhausted 8 o'clock it's like my bedtime in 15 minutes and I will release the trailer as soon as I shut off this livestream thank you everyone for watching and we'll see you next Friday on the coding train probably around the same time hopefully a little bit earlier because actually I have somewhere to be at 6 p.m. Eastern time next Friday so I'm hoping maybe I'll start at 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon okay and this was upstream livestream number 101 and I'm just I don't have a better way of ending this I guess I could play the trailer one more time at the end now nobody wants to see that I'll just release it you can watch it yourself okay here we go goodbye good night good morning wherever you are yes I'm going to continue with machine learning it's just going to be a while
