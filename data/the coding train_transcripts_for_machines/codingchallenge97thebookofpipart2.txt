I can't resist I'm gonna do one more coding challenge video first of all I forgot I had this idea of trying to do the different like polygons for each one of these cells I'll leave that as an exercise to the viewer anyway I talked about different things you could do but I just want to see I want to kind of see the numbers so I'm gonna try to do this in a just to see how that works I'm not gonna do I'm gonna keep everything just black and white just the pure text but I'm still gonna draw each character each number one character at a time because that would allow for a lot more possibilities obviously again if I just want to make a book of all the digits open up the text file print export to PDF etc but I'm gonna draw each digit one at a time so let me try to alter this to do that so couple things one is let me do save as and do Pi Day six this is like apparently the sixth thing I made I'm going to go back to book of Pi I'm gonna check one million texts I'm gonna and then I'm gonna load the 1 million Pi file and I'm gonna keep it at 100 I should really make oh it timeout let me make a smaller text file and I'll be right back ok I'm back I've made a smaller file with only 1000 digits of pi I think that'll be easier to work with let's make it just 10 by 10 so it'll still be a 10 page PDF I'm gonna get rid of colormode HSB I don't want to deal with that I'm still gonna have this idea of multiple pages I'm still gonna and now I'm not gonna draw rectangles anymore what I'm going to do is I'm going to say so first of all I need to I need to add a background so I'm gonna make a white back I'm gonna happen make the background white before I start drawing let's go down here and make the background white then I'm going to say here I don't I'm gonna just say fill 0 so every piece of text and then I'm going to draw the digit at a certain location I had this from an earlier coding challenge and I think that's it this should give me all the digits so this is weirdly gonna happen pretty fast but as we're gonna see I want me to need to do some clean up clean up here so it did all the pages and if I go to which one of this which book of Pi thousand texts we should see yeah there we go so we could see one for one fight so a couple things one is I would like to include the I'm not gonna worry about the threepoint so one thing is I didn't think about the size of the text uhhuh now actually I'm curious here I think what I want to do is try to separate thing I should use a fixed width if I was a file was to get more careful I would just use a fixed width font which was my plan but I'm actually kind of curious here because in theory I could change this for loop to be a while loop and I could say here float x equals zero while X is less than width and then at the end here I could say X plus equals text width of digit I think the text align Center is going to give me a little bit of an issue why is that not Oh not digit text width of that string and actually if I'm drawing the text let's just get rid of the idea of digit entirely so I believe this will actually let's see what happens we what we probably won't get we don't know how many pages we're gonna have so eventually we're just gonna so what I'm gonna do is say if in debt so I'm actually just gonna say break or I'm just gonna say how can I get out of both loops right here I mean I could say break cuz I'm in the wild like if I ever get to the end of what I have then I should get oh but I oh no no no let's use a fixedwidth font not the world I feel like the problem is now I don't know when to go to another page I'm have to test the why now that's fine though that's fine no no that's still going to work so gonna go to the next page when I get down so let's let's let's do something let's create a variable boolean finish this is an awkward way of doing it but I know it will work equal false and so here what I want to do is I want to say finished if I ever get to the end finish just true and then I think I could sort of say if finished right we'll continue get me out of a return I could return no because I could return but I need to I need to get to this exit and since I'm just in setup yeah return would be good so one I call this void render book this is work this is gonna be worth it I'm gonna say render book all that the loading stuff and this has to be a global variable now the loading stuff will happen in setups till then I'm going to take all of this and put it in render book exit' footprint lines finish and exit will not will be here then I'm gonna say render book and all I have to do is not have any of this finished nonsense and just say return and I don't need all this if finished stuff anymore the total pages is kind of wrong like I don't but I but I think it's fine like this will give me I think it's okay like I just need to actually I think this could be like a while true basically I can just keep doing new pages but let's just leave it for right now so I think what's going to an exit but I have like the wrong amount of brackets so render book do the double loop oh this and oh oh oh yeah this is a while loop right and I'm at the end of each of going based on the text with then index is going up if I get to the end I'm done otherwise I am not finished to page oh there's a missing this is a missing curly bracket right because the page is done at the end of the this is the X loop this is the Y loop so if I highlight this it should that's the X this is the Y that's the end of a page okay so let's see what happens here oh and now I need to call oh this should this and this should be here this can be here and set up and then I want to say let me just run this ok nothing now I'm going to call read under book so hopefully they don't it'll just go until it runs out of numbers finished how come I didn't see how come I didn't see multiple pages hmm well let's see what I got did I get anything in the PDF oh oh because it fit in one page I fit in one page okay so it fits in one page because the numbers are all just right next to each other okay easy easy alright so now let's think about how I'm calculating the width and height so the number of columns in wrote there the idea of columns is no longer relevant right and the idea of rows is honestly no longer really because what I have is I want a font size so I want a font size which would be the default font size is 12 but let's just set that so I'm gonna set right here I'm gonna say text size 12 and so I'm told somebody the chat said this to be earlier that 120% of a text size is the proper like line spacing so if it's 12point text 12 times 1.2 this would be about fourteen point four and sort of the line height so in theory I should be able to have H be so the width should be twelve the height should be fourteen point four maybe just round it to fourteen but I'll leave it as fourteen point four and then I know this total pages thing is nonsense now because I can basically just say I could just say while true like keep doing more pages until you're done so let's see if this makes sense let's see what happens here look oh but I do want to count the number of pages so I'm gonna say into page num equals zero and I'm going to say page num plus plus and it's gonna tell me when a page is completed okay Paige Paige none okay let's run this finished oh because it again does only need one page this is looking pretty good there's all my digits let's add the three point three point one there right oh it's kind of cut off at the end there so let me be let me make sure it doesn't get cut off at the end so Y if X is less than Oh with minus W with Mike because I want to I want to cut it off before it could say maybe W divided by two but let's yeah W divided by 2 would be okay so let's do that that should fix that finished and now I have a new right that fixed that over on this side okay and by the way why not make this more like it eight and a half by eleven piece of paper so let's have that be 850 1150 okay book of Pi let's go for 1 million and let's do PI 1 million book of PI million text ok you ready for this I don't know if it's gonna work to go on to a new page but doing some pages how many pages is it gonna be to have all 1 million digits I'll be back ok it completed at page 111 so now we should have this is the most insane way anybody has ever converted a text file to a PDF but there's a lot of wonder wonderful stuff what I'm doing here so let's look at this book a pie 1 million texts and we can see here oh why didn't I get that oh I have to do this again it's bothered me that it doesn't say 3.1 there but we can see here look here's my book of Pi I fries some margins should probably some margins but here it is it's a hundred eleven pages of all and let's see how big this file is it's a 112 megabyte file which probably doesn't need to be cuz it's just a hundred pages of text but probably in the way that it's rendering it is a little bit crazy so okay let's let's just do one more thing let's go for 10 million and let's add three point there so we're gonna add the three dot and we're gonna render 10 million all right I'll see you if one about a thousand pages we should be about a thousand pages okay here we go I'll see you in a bit alright I'm actually stopping rendering that dead file that was gonna have 10 million digits in it because I've noticed that they the spacing between the numbers the kerning is off and actually I've done this before we're moving by text with works perfectly with with doesn't work perfectly but I I don't have an issue with it but apparently the way this font is organized these the numbers are all that elbow all defined with the same width so I'm I kind of have done something wrong here I'm gonna switch to using amount of spaced font why not so I'm gonna add to the code I'm gonna just say right here under render book I'm going to say text I'm gonna say a P font F equals create font I'll just use courier I could use courier new but I think I'll just use courier and give it a size of 12 and then I'm gonna say text font F let me switch back to the 1000 1000 file just to test this let me run this it finished right one page let me look at this now 1000 whoops no wrong 110 million text whoops it could not open because it was empty what did I do wrong I messed something up oh I forgot exit exit needs to be in there okay let's try it again finished let's open that up and there now we can all breathe whoops a sigh of relief all these numbers are nicely spaced from each other perfectly in mono spaced lined up exactly in organized fashion actually this is kind of nice because maybe we'll find some interesting patterns almost like a some sort of word search number search puzzle let's look at the it looks like we're oh I took out in my investigation of this I took out the textaligncenter so let me put that back in run this one more time it's now finished let me come back over here whoa oh right I messed up some stuff I'd say with minus 2x plus with divided by 2 I took out some stuff I while I was fussing around with trying to figure out the spacing finished and now there we go so I should add some margins let's add some margins let's say we're gonna start with X at 100 and Y at 100 we're gonna go to width minus 100 minus W 2 and width and height minus 100 so okay so let's make this let's make this a variable int margin equals 100 margin margin margin margin and let's see what that does and finished and that's fine it looks like about an inch whatever so now we have our book of Pi now here we go it is time I'm gonna go back we're gonna make this book have ten million digits and I want to emphasize that the way that I program this you could render each number individually as anything you want because they're all rendered one at a time in processing with any drawing capabilities that you could imagine okay let's go back and say PI 10 million okay I'm really gonna run this and I'm really gonna be back when it finishes see in a minute go let's just make sure it's going okay I think I'm assuming it's gonna be like well over a thousand pages see ya in a bit we have now finished at 1761 pages I have made a book just for reference this book is 200 pages this book is 200 pages I have now made a book that does seven 1700 I mean 600 pages 661 pages which in theory has 10 million digits of pi and plus the 3.1 so it actually has 10 million in two characters now let's go to my folder it is a two gigabyte file let's try Acrobat Reader agree yeah I agree take my book of Pi this looks good here it is this is the book of Pi it is two gave us now the absurd thing is once again is I could have just taken that text file and done to print to PDF but if you wanted to you could render this and you could have I don't want to look close I don't want to see any mistakes you could I don't have the page numbers on it I should probably use CSS page media and the whole other way and expand tags oh I'll come back another time do it a different way so but again I could have done the same exact thing but had these to be little blocks of color or anything so I will just do to finish off this video oh I made it go upside down I will read to you from page what page am I on I will reach you some why is this facing off Oh cuz I have the center thing again I text the line center I need to text the line left I can't do it again oh I forgot to add page numbers chrome can open PDFs that's it I'm sorry that the spacing is off it really bothers me but we'll just have to go on I will read you a little bit of it and this video will fade away six eight eight five one one four five zero six four nine one three one five one eight six one five then there's some other digits for three in the mouse is really in an awkward place zero three one three one nine zero five six
