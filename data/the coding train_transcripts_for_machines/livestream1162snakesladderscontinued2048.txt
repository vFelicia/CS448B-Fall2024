oh hello I'm back I don't know if there's a pract I didn't like post anything and schedule this I just sort of like was livestreaming earlier then I had to go downstairs for a meeting and then I thought I got to finish this when I come back now it's like almost 700 in the evening it's been a very long day very long week I haven't seen anyone post anything in the chat yet so we'll see if if this is actually happening usually it takes weirdly I don't actually see that I am streaming oh no people are starting to say hi and that does say that I am live the Internet can totally see you is what it says now in my little like dashboard there and I do see myself as well okay so I'm back alright so what's going on here um it's been a very long week I said that already I'm saying it again I made this version of snakes and ladders earlier and now I'm trying to figure out if I can kind of like wrap this all up what do I need to do is the question here do I need to what's going to be the end what's this gets edited into something what will that be so let me think about this some one possibility yeah it looks like I'm coding checkers right one possibility is that I just pick up off from where I left off and that's a very long coding challenge another possibility is that it gets divided into three parts one for part one would be the part where I just program the system without any snakes and ladders sorry sometimes there's a delay there might be a little bit of an audio delay here I can see it based on what I see in the monitor then part two would be adding the snakes and ladders and then part three would be kind of like refactoring and fixing it up and kind of can animate a little bit so I can also go back and do the whole thing again which is I don't think I will and yes oops I'm not in the slack channel let me take a look at that okay so let me think about this and how do I get this computer not to go to sleep why does it go to sleep just give me a second here give me a second here this is a computer that I use on the side to monitor some stuff and it always goes to sleep and so many times I have told it not to just oh let's go to energy saver oh look at that 15 minutes how about never there we go no I've got that fixed okay yes I could do I kind of want to do 2048 it's probably a terrible idea because I'm tired it's late I'm not gonna be at my best but why not only 900 subscribers still 400k is that true that's crazy well maybe we could do something some kind of like get up to 400 K subscribers that would be exciting well let me finish this off let me undo whatever I did most recently let me get back to where I was is this where I was yeah this is where I was where I was testing some stuff out I like the fact that the player by the way by accident has a all right so I did this then I'm just trying to get it back to where I could like last left off we take out the framerate and so what does this look just happened what happened to my player where did my player go well look at this the light by the way my lighting is off because this light I just noticed you can see I don't know if you can see this I'm like over here how do I point to that right over there there's like a little bit of a this light it's not in the right position oh how do I fix this how do we tighten this this thing I think that's better now I think that's fixed all right let's see here what did I just do to make it that I can't see the player anymore oh something weird is happening hold on there we go oh I was like commenting something out that shouldn't have been commented out okay there we go alright so this by the way when I made it go just one thing I don't know why I didn't increase the framerate when I was trying to debug this before alright and let's go back to the player and go to here there we go okay why did it get undefined what did I mess up so sometimes okay so there's another bug I need to fix play or digest line 24 I'm sorry I probably shouldn't start it ya know why not why not let's let's enter current tiles at this set spot Oh so if this if it goes over so what I would like to know is it stopped can i let's look at what this dot spot is so two hires are too low too high went past the end so right now in sketch oh this doesn't need to oh I started doing this which I don't want to do yet okay shoot where did I end with maybe I can undo a little bit more here let's see let's get rid of this there we go there we go there we go and put the frame rate back here okay now I think I am legitimately back to the state that I was alright math.max oh that would have been that would have been smart the maximum alright if not current return I've no idea what that's referring to okay so it is now 700 p.m. on the East Coast I am somehow still live streaming on YouTube and I'm very lowenergy in terms of my inner soul but I'm gonna push through and cry as quoting the chat here keep on truckin so the first thing that I want to do is I actually want to animate the roll so some animate I don't want to do like a fullblown animation so let me come in and do it let me just as a thought experiment let me let me let me make some content for Mature to think about using to edit this stuff together so the first thing that I'm going to create is a little bit of a end to the the first for the first video ah let me let me just I'm gonna do record way too much stuff it doesn't have to all be used maybe we won't use any of it alright and although I should maybe maybe I should finish the whole thing first let me finish the whole thing first and then let me come back because what might be nice is to have the finished version so what I'm gonna do is the third part it's actually gonna be the third part I won't say part three just in case and I'm gonna add the animation stuff and here we go look I'm getting something like weird shadowing but that's fine hello I'm back to continue my exciting snakes and ladders game and what I'm realizing and what you've seen as I've been kind of putting this together in a very messy and overly complicated probably way is it's very hard to know what's going on and whether it's working or not I in between this last part that you might have seen in this I stopped and I'd like to check something so I'm pretty sure that it is working correctly logically but it would really help I could just sort of do some debugging by like console logging more stuff to see what it's doing but I would really like to just see an animation so I would like to see an animation where I kind of think of the game as having different states there's the state where I am somewhere then there's the state where I roll the die or the die if that's or maybe it's spin whatever it is roll the die and then I see where I'm going to move to then I move there then if that part is a snake or a ladder I see that I'm going to move to a new spot if not I'm just going to roll again so I want to think about different states so I'm gonna do this in a goofy way that is a limit for the first time in my life ever use Const because what I really want to do is make some constants that are like look that are talking about the state of the games I'm gonna say oh this is probably I'm gonna say roll state oh this is like so overly like talkie and too many characters but a minute I'm if it's afraid to call it roll because what if I something else called roll roll state where I'm rolling the die I'm gonna say preview state which actually is that the sames when I roll the die I see the preview of where I'm about to go so I'm gonna make that's gonna be the same then I'm going to have move state where I draw my next move and then I'm going to have a snake ladder what's a word there's got to be a word for snake and ladder Schnatter lake let's try Schnatter I like that Schnatter s'matter which is that the state of moving to the snake or ladder if that exists and then I'm gonna go back to the roll state so looking through the draw loop let's think about what happens so if so now I need a variable called state and States is going to start at roll state so I'm gonna start the game the game is gonna have the roll States so if then I'm going in to draw I'm always gonna draw all the tiles why not I'm always gonna draw all the Snider's that's my new word show Snyder's refactoring that's my word for snakes and ladders so if I go into the tile object show Snyder's and this should actually be I could probably do some global find and replace I might change that later from snake or ladder to s'matter okay so now back here player dot roll so definitely this is something that happens if state equals if state equals roll state I want to roll and I want to increase the number of rolls okay so that I want to do now then I want to maybe had to say player show preview so in the player what the player does in roll is have an actual so right now I do everything all at once I roll the die I move the spot I draw the tide I check if it's a snake or ladder I move it so I got to divide all this up into different parts this will make this better so I need more variables hope is the eboard variables the answer is more variables this dot roll maybe I can use the word die I don't know that because for I'm going to say roll equals yeah roll equals negative 1 so it doesn't have a roll at the beginning and this is gonna be rolled I gonna call this roll die actually rolling the die and then I'm gonna keep whatever this roll is so that's the only thing I'm gonna do in roll die so I don't know something this is something else I'll figure that out later all I want to do is pick that roll and so go back to the sketch I want to roll die and I don't need the tiles so back in the player I don't need the tiles I'm just picking that number now what I said that I want to do I think is show the preview so what I might like to do is just kind of like highlight all the ones up until the next spot so I need to like figure out what the next spot is but not actually move the player there yet so if I think about that actually what I do is I maybe I have next I have a next this dot next equals negative one is it nice by the way how all of these variables have the same number of characters they line up so nicely that makes me so happy so I'm going to say then this dot next equals this dot spot Plus this dot roll right so I keep track of the current spot and the next role and then I want to say player show preview and what the preview is going to do and I'm gonna need the tiles for this is it's going to highlight some of the tiles so I'm going to say for let I equal this dot spot is less than this dot next and the end is going to be if this dot next is that is past the end of the tiles so I have to say the end is the maximum of this dot next and tiles dot length right if this dot no no no the minimum whichever ones lower minimum are the maximum right I want to say like if if next is 12 then the number of tiles is 10 I want the end to be 10 so it's whichever one is the smaller than one so I think that's the minimum function I'll fine so I'm going to go all the way up to the end I plus plus and I'm going to say tile index I highlight so what that's going to do it should highlight all of the tiles that I'm about to move to and so if I go into tile and I create a highlight function I can just say let me highlight them with a nice little green and some alpha and draw that rectangle so what happens dare I dare I attempt to run this now and just see this so what I'm gonna do actually is comment out the rest of all of this and see if I can roll the die and see the highlighting show Schnatter x' it's not a function really really sketch as line 63 shows Natters is not a function shows Natters snakes and let Schnatter it's not a Schnatter it's a stair Schnatter show Schnatter show its Nadder never record coding challenges late in the evening on a Friday all right cannot read property length of undefined player is line 13 so let's figure this out tiles doesn't know what it is because I forgot to pass in the tiles when I call show preview probably you just use tiles of the global variable but cannot read highlight of undefined now I think I know why this is the problem so in the show preview function when the game starts the the players actually at spot negative one because it needs to a roll of one gets you to the first spot so I do have this other thing where I need to say start equals the maximum of zero in this dot spot so if it's negative one I gotta I think I can fix that right maximum means the highest is that right is that right oh no no I'm doing it backwards I'm doing it backwards if you want the maximum to be 10 you use minimum because I want the lower one I did that backwards all along silly me silly me silly silly me all right cannot read properly highlight of undefined so let's look at let's look at console dot log I right here just to sort of see whoops the e key on my computer barely works negative one it's still got negative one the minimum no no I did it backwards again okay here we go there we go okay so we can see here on getting that preview perfect perfect I'm getting that preview for state one now I'm not doing anything but doing that over and over again but that's great now what I need to do is say the state what happens now immediately equals move state what did I call it move state move state yep the state should equal move state now if the state equals move state then what I actually want to do is move the player so I'm gonna say player dot move so I'm gonna say player dot move and in the player I'm going to say move and I think it's really just a matter of saying this dot spot equals this dot next right just move it to the next spot and I could also like check if it's off the edge at the end but let's not worry about that right now then what I want to do all of these I want to call player dot show right I want to say player dot show right which just draws the player in the spot where is the show function and I need to give it the tiles this is really kind of convoluted about giving the touch all right so then I'm gonna give it the tiles cuz it needs to figure out what tile to show itself on so let's try this all right so why did this happen only once did I put a no loop in there zero one two what's what is what am i console logging anyway I want to I want to move and then I want it oh and then I want to set the sorry state equal to roll state so I'm gonna have to check the snakes soon but let me do this so let me do this oh yeah so let me set the frame rate down this is great now I've really got something I can kind of track a little bit let me put the frame rate back down oh look at that whoa wait a second something's wrong here I want to see a head and then I want to see it move I want to see it in its old spot what do I have wrong all right what do I have wrong oh boy this needs to be an elseif right because I just changed it to move State and then I do it immediately but no no no I only wanna be able to do one of these states yes switch statement would have done me well here so let's now run this again and I have an error cannot get center of undefined Claire J s line 44 let's enter equals current current equals tiles dot this dot spot so what is this dot spot there it is negative one because once again I can't draw the player at its negative spot so this is a case that as long as this dot spot is yeah I guess a nice way of doing this would be if if not current returned so just like get out of here this is one way that I could do it if there's no current thing I don't need to draw it get out of here it moves but it's moving one spot beyond where the role is right so why is that so that's a little bit of a mistake the role says I need to include the next less than or equal to next I need to go all the way up to that spot there we go moves through there I kind of want to keep the highlight in there but I could do it but at least I could see so this is really doing what I wanted to do now I can see it it's roll and then it moves there now now what I want to do is oh it's going to land on the ladder but it's not gonna go to snake it's not going to go down now or that's a ladder visually I've got some real serious graphic design issues there now what I need to do is at the end of the move State at the end of the move State I need to check if the player is on us if the player so if the player is honest matter I need to do something otherwise I can just go back to the roll state right if the player is on a Schnatter now how do I know that what do I have going on is that the something else that I hadn't figured out yet yes it sort of is right so this is I can call this is Snyder and I can say I can look at the tile at its spot and I can say if tile snake or ladder is not equal to 0 return true so this at least so as long as there as long as it's actually on a tile and that tile is a snake or a ladder return true otherwise return false let's just put this in there right now and if I know I could return the result of this let's do that but I might want to do some other stuff in here which maybe is a bad idea so let me just return the result of this just to like make this a little bit more elegant and I need more space to see my code as long as there is a tile and hey that tile is a snake or a ladder return true otherwise oh no yeah otherwise return false that's what I'm doing so now if I were to go out into the sketch I'm going to say no you know like no loop console dot log hello so I'm just want to see that right there it's stopped so if I can get lucky and have it land on one of these so now I can speed it up and it should stop at some point it'll land on one of these it didn't and it got to the end so if it gets to the end so let's fix it so it starts over again player dot j/s line 21 player digest line 21 if it gets to the end and the end is this is the last one now that have less than equals the length minus 1 that should fix that okay if you guess the end it didn't actually restart because I got rid of all that game logic what is this player digest line 20 oh I don't need this anymore thank you why come on land on one of these oh I know a way to fix that let's have it just move one spot every time the role is always one Oh interesting so it's not detecting that it's landing on a Schnatter why not if I mess something up let's let's look at this return tile this is the tile that it's on this dot spot right because it has moved its moved oh this is not a I didn't call the function so if I I didn't rename the funk is is Schnatter okay great there we go so we can see it stopped so that's good I'm detecting that correctly now what I want to do is go to another state I want to say state equals what did I call it s'matter state state equals Schnatter state okay so now otherwise go back to the role state so you can move and go back to the role state now I need to check else if state equals Schnatter state oh this is very exciting Oh everything is so much harder to program than you think if state equals Schnatter stake state creating a tonguetwister here now what I need to do is what I need to go back to here and where's my something else the stuff that I saved did I lose it well this is the time where I need to move Schnatter move Schnatter so what I want to do is I want to say this dot that's why I need I'm the player I need the reference to the tiles you know what this is ridiculous I should just have the player store an internal reference to the tiles or it uses this is getting a bit ridiculous I should really have the player just store an internal an internal variable that stores a reference to the like it could actually add this dot tiles here and it points to the tiles or just use as a global variable I think for expediency right now I'm trying to stay true to object oriented programming in some way there's really no point in me passing in the tiles everywhere because I can just use the fact that it is a global variable tiles Styles tiles is a global variable I need it everywhere let's not go nuts let's take that out of having to pass it through everywhere and just know that the player can go look up stuff in the tiles whenever it wants to because what I need to do right now in the player is move according to this matter so I need to get its current spot and it actually would make sense that the spot perhaps not to be an index but to store which pilots on but that aside then I could say this dot spot plus equal the tiles snake or ladder value so now let's go and just change this to Schnatter to be consistent so let's find everywhere I say this dot snake or ladder and change that to this dot Schnatter and replace all and that should be make our lives a little bit more consistent so now if state equals Schnatter state now what do I do I say player dot what did I call it move Schnatter move Snyder so there's a regular move and there's a Schnatter move and those happen separately and as soon as that's done the state goes back to the role state okay let's see if we let's see if this is if we're good here where did everything go this is a bad sign that there is nothing on the screen there what did I mess up let's look at the state it's zero it's in the role state let's look at the player the spot is not a number next it's not a number so something went wrong with the players next and spot almost immediately so let's take out this little bit here let's take out this else if to see if the move Snyder really just screwed stuff up spot zero roll one next zero but it's because mmm alright let's let's I'm gonna just back up for a second and I'll go back to move state roll state move state roll state okay so move state roll state works hey what happened to my Snyder's why don't I see them anymore I must be something to do with the show Snyder so these seem to not exist oh because I left this in there I left the tiles in one spot which is really a problem when I was like refactoring I left that in there so is there some other place I I have tiles and this is okay so let's see here what have I done to deserve this if this dots not or does not it probably also messed something up when I oh I know I think I might know what the problem is I think I know what the problem is I refactored oh this is I'm a terrible programmer and I change didn't change the property here that's why we don't have them anymore so let's put that back okay now we're back to where we were before my refactoring actually caused more problems than its solved so let me see now if I can put this back and even I don't know I'm just gonna go crazy and put this Schnatter snake back okay so ah okay good now I'm back I'm still debugging let's let's go back to alright so do we ever get to what's causing the problem we did we lose immediately okay hold on if I stare at the code for longer I'll know what's happening I need some better debugging strategies let's think about this I owe em can you roll a zero shouldn't start where you are already oh I'm getting some comments else if switch state equals okay yeah by the way this I really should this is a little nice little improvement I can make but let's figure out let's figure out where it's going wrong I'm gonna back out of my adding the Schnatter state let's go back and just see all right I said I still have a problem that's good so I have a problem where spot 0 Row 1 oh and I forgot this has to be in there that's where the problem is okay so this is fine this is fine now do I detect at least I can say is this detect correct if it lands on one it's gonna keep going whoops whoops I don't want that this is another I don't want this else here so so much mess but I just want to see if the detection oh it's detecting it all the time no my is Schnatter function is a big problem this function is not working properly so let me look at the player object if oh this I forgot oh boy this renaming of variables really really bad bad bad Schiffman alright so now we're not seeing it yep there we go we landed on a spot and there we go so we landed on two there were just two and we can see here when we land on one we got one another one another one okay so we're good now now we're good with the is is Schnatter okay we're good with it's matter now we can go back to once we are honest matter setting that state to the Snyder state otherwise go back to the rule state okay oops and I've got my brackets out of place there we go so basically what I'm doing here is I move the player if it's a snake or a ladder go to that state otherwise just roll again so now if it is a sink or a ladder let's try actually doing this and rolling oh it's working look did you see that now it happens really fast look what happen when it gets to there it goes back see we're in this nice loop and we're actually singing we're actually seeing it if I slowed it down a little more you know it might be nice to animate it going you sliding down that thing but as you can see you probably don't want to watch me try to Pat okay so we're we're in pretty good shape now a couple things I need to do number one is I need to figure out if the game is over so that should work fine this should be the same idea if the player spot is greater than equal to the end keep it at the end set game over equal to true this player show anymore if game is over reset the player all this stuff should really still work in terms of averaging and all of that so let's put all this stuff back and let's run this now the thing is I need to be able to roll more than just a one and I want to slow it down a tiny bit so I can really watch and see that it's running so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go by I'm gonna not make the framerate one frame per second but I make it five frames per second and then by golly I am going to really trying to like keep up the energy right it's like fading fast but I'm keeping it up I am going to be able to roll one through six so if I go back to here I want to roll one through six and now here we go so I'm seeing where I roll now remember white is a snake so I fell down I got past it here we go I got up the ladder and we made it to the end yes we are making snakes enough now you can see here that my talent well it barely lies in anything I tell it lies and maybe talking encoding at the same time although I kind of do that brother ridiculously employed my talent certainly doesn't lie in visual design in interaction design there's a lot of improvements here but at least I'm kind of showing you the pieces here how could you create these different states now that I have these different states I could actually have internal animations in those states as well so let me at least just to really like feel that this is working in an interesting way let me go back to the sketch just to finish off here let me make five five snakes five ladders let me make let me instead of making it ten by ten let's make it 20 by 20 for fun so I need to look for that resolution to make it 20 now and then let me let it run quickly so we're going to now watch a simulation of snakes and ladders on a 20 by 20 grid I'll make I'll make this bigger and see how this plays out whoa okay I forgot that my circle is much too big so we can see that on this 20 by 20 grid with these random snakes and ladders that we are averaging so far sixtyseven rolls let's let that this is a little bit of a bug here that when I'm drawing the player the player should be drawn according to the tile size so I I guess this where does that does that have a where can I access that I'm not gonna I don't know I'm just gonna make that sixteen right now so I could be five so now we can see here is it and I almost want to make this even more insane by just creating 15 of each and now let's watch this totally insane snakes and ladders game can it ever make it it's doesn't made oh it made it in 75 rolls I made it in like just a few rolls so we can now see we can see this is something if you try to create a math formula to compute the average amount of rolls that would take for it to make it from the beginning to the end I don't know that you could do that but now we can watch this little Monte Carlo simulation of just running it over and over again and kind of get that average ourselves so this is snakes and ladders so much you could do to animate this better to make it a game that you could play to try different ideas out to think about the space not as a grid but as some kind of like you know pathway you know Candyland like pathway so many possibilities and yes I should have used ctrl shift F to find a replace in all of the spots but next time I will do a better job of that so this is out really for sure definitely the end of this game which I am now told from the live chat that this is also called escalators and eels snakes and ladders chutes and ladders escalators and eels make your own thanks for watching Oh see you in a future coded challenge all right through 2048 oh you know before I do 2028 which I am considering doing which is a terrible idea but I am considering it I'm gonna give Matt you a little bit of help and I know I'm making this kind of awful but let me let me make a nicer looking version of this to just have in the background during the like clips that will kind of organize this all together and Matthew if you're watching this at some point I am happy to I can't on Monday but I I don't know how I'm going to de like releasing this but I could always come back on Tuesday and rerecord some intros so let me see here let's have fewer of these and let's set the I thought the frame rate of five was actually pretty effective and the real game is ten by ten so I don't know why it let's let's go back to that I know this board isn't a great one let's get a nice looking that's pretty good actually so I should make the probably should make the snakes red let's at least do that in this version of it because let's make it like a kind of reddish color otherwise a oh that's not red otherwise a kind of greenish color and we'll do the preview will do that preview thing as actually blue oh and now I need to get a nice I need to have a nice that's actually not so bad all right all right here we go rainbows snakes right okay hello you were about to watch a coding challenge where I attempt to make a game called snakes and ladders this is a bit of an intro that I'm recording after I've completed this is the finished version you could now decide if you want to keep watching but the reason why I'm recording this intro is that this challenge and ended up being in a few different parts because it took took a long time and so while I'm doing it I don't know that it's gonna be that but I'm letting you know that it's gonna kind of end abruptly but there'll be a second part in a third part look at this video's description if you're watching this video that means there will be a link in this video's description to the second part and in that video they'll be linked to the third part even if there does we'll be there okay thanks let me let me try to be more succinctly I'll give that to you a couple different takes now I'm not gonna use this cuz I use it um hello I went it quickly before the coding challenge starts this is the end result of the coding challenges my own kind of crazy version of snakes and ladders that could use a lot of improvement mind you but I wanted to come here let you know that the challenges in multiple parts I don't say this during the challenge because I didn't really realize it I just kept programming it but if you end a little bit abruptly this first part if you look at the video's description there will be a link to the next video in the series so the whole snakes and ladders challenges there but it's in three parts enjoy okay now I'm gonna be at the end I'm gonna say you might not need to use this but I'm gonna record all these possibilities okay so I'm stopping the challenge now in this part where all I did oh look I have a bug hold on time out let's find out what this bug is Wow interesting we have an edge condition player yes line 32 cannot read properties matter of undefined player dodge is line 32 look at this I didn't check if it's a legitimate tile huh but why would I get there if it's not where is it hold on everybody let's look at player dot spot now oh it's back at the beginning so somehow back at the beginning in my resetting everything probably this when it reset somehow it got to be negative one where did this spot well where could that have happened this dot reset sets everything back to negative one and then oh this state you know what I think what could happen is if the game over is true I better set the state back equal to roll state I think it it could be that the game ended but it wasn't move state or something and then this messed things up because the last tile has a Schnatter oh it does it shouldn't been allowed to though oh oh that's the mistake actually that's the mistake I mean it's nice to put this in here but the last tile what I've been like recording all these with a death scythe to redo all these good this is totally invalid all right I'm gonna redo these totally invalid example of the game uh I don't think 2048 is happening but you hold on where do I pick the status if we that I invented this word Schnatter I mean I didn't invent this has to be I thought this would work I guess I need a minus one here no no no wait this is for the index whoa oh no it's a snake it's a snake that ended up in the top so yeah I guess this has to be oh yeah can't be the last spot a minus one there a minus one there I don't think I need to that'll just battle B now I'm gonna go back and rerecord all these start over sorry I'm starting over okay the role State thing probably was fine but I added that in that's good alright let's find a nice one this looks pretty good right I don't I like this one this one is awesome okay great great okay here we go again you can't have a snake in the last tile because then you can never win the game but okay let's try this again now move the mouse thank you drink some water yeah I should make it move would be really nice to make it move one at a time through all those spots and then see it slide up the thing but I'm not gonna do that right now all right wait I see Alka is typing well you don't have to have a perfect role to win the game that's true okay anyway sorry to met yet hi you're about to watch a coding challenge this is the final result it's my version of the game snakes and ladders you can decide now if you want to keep watching or not but the reason why I'm recording a little intro to the intro is that this challenge is actually in multiple parts and so check the video wait this might end a little bit abruptly but check the video's description and there'll be a link to the next part and you'll those three parts to complete the full snakes and ladders game so here you go that kind of sucked one more time this is like it's you know who's watching me at 740 p.m. on Eastern Time on a Friday night I could do this a few more times animate instead of 2048 I gotta go home at some point it's like one was 8 o'clock it's like my bedtime was 2 hours ago let me just be to make the same stupid joke though is that okay with you I'm gonna make the same joke about how you can decide whether I'm just letting you know that I might be there just one more time with fielding I shouldn't be doing this game I mean I know I'm trying to do too fast hello you are about to watch a coding challenge that is in for beep arts and this is an intro to the intro so to speak it's my version of the game snakes and ladders this is what it is so you can now decide if you want to keep watching it you know there's a lot of room for improvement here but the reason why I'm recording this extra little bit is that while I'm doing the challenge I'm doing it on the fly I don't realize that I'm gonna end up ultimately having it be in three separate videos so I just want to let you know if it ends abruptly check the video's description and look for the link to the next part alright thanks and enjoy all right now now I'm gonna come back and say alright so that's ended now so far I this phone alright that wraps up the end of the first part of this challenge and the next part I'm going to start trying to add the snakes and ladders and boy do I run into a lot of trouble so enjoy I did my best and you'll see what happens all right okay okay this is the second part of my snakes and ladders coding challenge this is the final result but where I laughed last left off I only had the board and the player moving without any snakes and ladders on the board so in this video I attempt to add the snakes and ladders alright so that's the end of part 2 it kind of might have ended a little bit abruptly there but what I'm going to attempt to do in part 3 which you see right here is because it was so hard to see whether was working or what was going on what I'm now gonna do in part 3 is add this part which lets it happen in multiple stages so figure out how to animate it a little bit and there's plenty of room for improvement so enjoy and enjoy this third part these are the worst let me do some of these I actually think that and there's a little bit of an issue here where I think that the other ones it's fine for me to have the end result in the very first video but I think I'd almost rather just stand in front of this for the other one so I'm gonna redo all those I'm not breaking it I'm totally I should just be like turning off the livestream and doing this on my own I love how much people in the chat are enjoying this part let's try this again okay so that's the end of part 1 where I made just the board with no snakes and ladders if you check this video's description there should be a link to the next part where I start trying to add those snakes and ladders and it doesn't go as well as I might have hoped but you could just watch it if you want they saw a snake on the last tile again whatever okay does anybody else do this like livestream they're weird like takes and then edits up together I don't know yeah this okay alright welcome to part 2 of my snakes and ladders challenge in this part where I really struggle I try to add snakes and ladders but strangely yeah I try to add sakes and ladders to the board and figure out a good way to organize that and there'll be one more third part after this second part all right so that wraps up the second part I know it's kind of hard to see is it working what's going on so in the third part what I do is I attempt to think about the game as having multiple states so that I can organize so that I can hang on all right so that wraps up the second part there there's one more part you can check this video's description for a link to this last part so you might have noticed it's really hard to tell is this thing even working like what's going on so in the next part I try to think about the state of the game what's happening and what do I want to draw to indicate what's happening to give me a little bit of more of a debug view ultimately in the end you want to really animate for the user to understand and enjoy the game but I'm really just right now trying to get it to make sense for me so that's good what's gonna happen in the third part alright and then I think the third I think what I just did when I came back I kind of like said this is another part so I don't think I need another intro or int but just in case just in case just in case I don't think I need I don't I don't think I need this but I'll do it just in case the thing is though i want the challenges to be legitimate like trying to figure it out so if I really just like practice and figure this all out didn't do this weird extra thing like they wouldn't be they wouldn't be a spontaneous I think it's better that way alright you're watching this still somehow you're here you're watching the third part of my snakes and ladders challenges the last part where kind of add some animation stuff and at the end try to give you some ideas for how to improve on it and make your own version which I hope you do and I hope you share with me check this video's description for instructions on how to do that ok thanks and enjoy the last part alright so now everybody the YouTube chat is still screaming 2048 okay I'm excited about this we're totally someone's asking to present um the board shouldn't be a square all right all right all right oh yeah look at that why not why not I'm feeling good the night is young and I just splash some water on the green screen can you see it I don't think and see if there's actually by accident splash some water over here I don't know if that's doing anything to the background all right let's get out of here let's get out of here and get warm in this room I'm gonna open up processing my favorite thing to program in all of the all of you who complained earlier today let me just check my phone to make there's no like urgent messages and going to just send a quick little message that I'm a little bit later than I thought okay and now yeah people want me to do in JavaScript but that's I'm gonna be do this one in processing and I kind of have I feel like I have a good reason for that I will no matter what every single challenge gets ported and yeah all right so here we go all right um all right so here we're here let's see let me think about this I got to get 2048 Wikipedia and then 2048 the game okay alright alright in my most controversial twist yet I have chosen to attempt 2048 which is a lot of people were requesting and a lot of people are saying Oh 2048 really ah so I'm not gonna try to make my own creative spin on this I'm just gonna see if I can implement this game and I hopefully you will learn from it enjoy it make your own version come up with your own creative idea let's just be clear I did not invent this game this if you want to read more about the game this is a sliding block puzzle game by Gabrielle surreally it was written in JavaScript and CSS during a weekend in 2014 it's an open source software project so I can actually look at the code which I haven't that would actually probably help if I looked at the code this game is very similar to other games notably 3 so it you know as everything is built on everything else I encourage you to read about the history of the game and look at it as an open source project I actually barely know this game I mean I have played it so I think I in this version obviously there's like a virgin' metouch version that you can use your fingers on one of those glass a'mma your those television phone things that people have these days but that's the best they're called right television phones but I'm gonna use the keyboard so I can press to the right look at all those twos go to the right I can press down right now I can press to the left look at all those twos go to the left now watch what happens if i press to the right again those twos combine to be a four if I press down you're giving some text all right if I ignore that if I press down those two combined so basically if the camera goes off again and I'm not finished with this coding challenge we have a problem and those so basically if two numbers are equal they will combine and make a new number like 4 and 4 make 8 + 8 + 8 make 16 the idea being can you get to 2048 but if two numbers do not not equal or it reaches the edge it will stop moving so I could just play this for a little while I'm not really thinking about I'm sure there's like a smart strategy but you can kind of see how this is going so I'm gonna not oh my god oh my god oh my got him I got him not good I'm not gonna get myself insanely addicted to this game right now I'm just gonna go over and start to program it and I will say it will not look this nice and it will probably not have any animations I just want to look at the core basic structure and mechanic of the game and I'm gonna do this and I probably should said this at the beginning in processing which is a Java based programming development environment it simplifies a lot of the aspects of the Java programming language to make drawing stuff I will also release a JavaScript version of this using the p5 library links to those kind of stuff will be in the video's description so what do I need I want to do this in an objectoriented fashion all of you don't like that can complain now okay are you like to plating here we go so I need a cell object and actually you know what by golly I'm gonna do it an even the simpler way I just need an integer I need a twodimensional array of integers I probably use a 1 dimensional array and just look it up but let's use a twodimensional array of integers and so I'm gonna just say make a an array board is a new interest 4x4 right so there's a little sort of fixed thing going here I'm gonna make a window that's 400 by 400 and I am now going to say x equals 0 I is less than 4 I I plus plus I can hard code all these values because the game you know I would it would be interesting to make a flexible version the game that can work with multiple size is it 4 by 4 yes 4 by 4 but I might as well just think of I as my columns J as my rows and I'm going to draw a rectangle no fill a rectangle at I comma J also I need to figure out the X x equals I times was it going to be 100 each one is 100 y equals J times 100 and I'm gonna draw a rectangle at X Y 100 100 and I'm gonna say no fill and I'm going to say stroke zero and I'm gonna have a background of 255 and I'm gonna make the stroke weight for everything like four so now if I run this let's save this save this as 2048 and now run this okay oops I can't call a sketch a Java class cannot start with a number so it actually renamed it sketch 2048 okay let's run this there it is you can see my grid so so far I've got a grid now what I want to do is display the number now zero will mean it's empty but I'm actually going to display the zeros just for debugging purposes right now all right so what I also want to do is figure out a way to kind of make that so I'm gonna say textaligncenter then I'm gonna say text X plus 50 Y minus 20 and I'm gonna put the board I I'm going to display the number that's there in the board and I'm gonna say text size you know 48 let's just try that and I think Phil is what sets the text color and processing so there we go okay so I did something wrong naught Y minus 20 I want them so why is the top minus 20 moved it up even further so I actually want to say like Y plus something like eighty close enough now why did it take so long to start I don't know but I mean so that's about right now obviously it's not centered perfectly my design is horribly flawed but I now have the basis for the game okay now how does the game start whoops no I want to start over how do I start over a new game well it's using like local storage or something so it looks like it starts with two oh wait I guess it starts with a couple just I'm just gonna start out with two random twos so I'm gonna pick two random spots to put it to so in setup I'm gonna say int x equals int random 4 so I want a wise inch random 14 you know I really got to make sure I don't pick the same spot twice but and I'm gonna say board X y equals 2 then I'm gonna do so I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this while success so I'm gonna just do a counter Wow int starting spots equals zero while starting spots is less than to do this and starting spots and if board X y equals zero if it's already a zero then make it a two and say starting spots plus plus so it should do this this is pretty silly algorithm written but it's gonna pick something as long as it's a spot that's not area to it'll set it to and it'll do that twice so just for the sake of argument let me make that like 5 so you should see that no matter what every time I run it I should get five twos you know incidentally I could say what's the total number of spots 16 I mean it's gonna get there eventually right might take a while but it's eventually gonna get all twos but I just want to do it as two okay so now I have to choose 0 eventually don't wanna draw the zeros and actually maybe right now I shouldn't draw the zeros because that's just kind of confusing so if so I want to say if board IJ is greater than zero do this now all right my game has started now what do I do I need to listen for key events and I actually probably don't actually even need a draw loop here I need to listen for key events so down left right so there is a key pressed function key pressed and dare I use a switch statement that I barely know how to do I don't know why what's wrong with me I've been programming for so many years I can't get myself to use a switch state so I'm pretty sure let me just check I think in processing I can check the if the key code is up I think so I think it's a little bit goofy I'm gonna say print line up let's just see if this works so I'm looking down here into the console to see if I see the the key word up I could look this up but so I am seeing up all right so that's I think this is good I think some there might be some like so how do I do this somebody tell me switch key code Java switch statement I'm gonna do it here this this should get me this should this should work oh there we go okay so let me just so the switch statement is like a nice kind of if statement I what I want to do is say if it's this then do this otherwise if it's this switch just says which in these cases do this other thing so I think what I really want to do is just set a direction well actually I'm not sure what I want to do exactly but let's first get the switch statement so I want to say switch key code case up case down case right case left so let me just try something here int Direction equals negative one so this I'm gonna just say Direction equals zero Direction this is really silly like I already have the key code as a state and now I'm like making a new state but I at least want to like find out that my switch statement is working and so now I'm gonna get rid of all this other junk and now it's funny of the things that take a long time when your program aren't really big complicated things so we can see here this is in theory kind of nice because I could figure out what to do in all of these oh yeah interesting so I think what I want to do though is I want to like move the board so I need a function that moves the board I don't what to call it like swipe I'm gonna call it swipe I'm gonna write a function called swipe and even though I can only swipe in one direction I'm gonna just this is a little bit weird but I'm gonna say void swipe and I'm gonna pass in an x and a y direction because when I swipe up when I press up I want to swipe up which is 0 comma negative 1 right then I will swipe down I want to swipe 0 comma 1 to the right I want to swipe 1 comma 0 and to the left this is I think this is not what I want to do but I'm just gonna see swipe I'm realizing now this is a little bit silly but I'm gonna swipe negative 1 to 0 so how do I approach this time out for a second edit point I think I want to use the whiteboard so I need to erase it so I will bring you over here with me I'm so hungry all right okay so all right let me think about this here so a couple things that I know I need I think if I have this 4x4 grid it'll probably mess me up to start making changes to this grid itself so I need like kind of like a current state and I need a next so I probably need another 4x4 grid to write to so let's just do one case let's just say I could only ever swipe to the right I can only ever sleep right so if there's a two here and there's a two here so what do I need to do if I'm swiping to the right all I care about is the rows like I just need to say I just need to look is there anything here no is there something here oh great move it oh what's here if it's a number not equal to two or an edge it can't move otherwise take this value and put it here so that should be pretty easy to do actually and then keep going until what happens if it's let me ask a question what happens if it's two to four and I swipe does this become an eight at the end is that the game mechanic like it doesn't do a four there are the are just does the first thing and then it and I have to do another swipe to the right to become an eight I'm gonna pause for a second while I see if somebody can answer that question for me or maybe I can figure it out myself for for it becomes four four okay all right thank you to the chat for telling me that it and that this scenario ends with four four so the first time I find something that can be combined then this I'm done so I only do one combination so I just start is either empty or it's full you kind of move to the right or it can't its I keep going to the right until I can't anymore it then I move all right so let's just do the swipe right algorithm there's probably a nice way to always just rotate the board and just always do it in the same direction but I'm not sure my brain is gonna be able do that right now so I'm just going to pretend no matter what I'm doing I'm always moving to the right so what I need to do is I want to agree that's the next one right because I think that I don't know maybe I can overwrite the current grid actually because as I'm moving stuff I think I can want to write the current grid because there's nothing depends on something else really I'm going in one direction so I think it's fine I don't think I need that actually I think I lied when I said I needed that so what I want to do is I need to go from I equals zero I is less than 4 I plus plus so if I'm going to the right the outer loop is doing each row one at a time so I think of the rows is J so I'm actually going to put that in the outer loop oh I should really do the rotate them I should really do the rotate the board thing these should be in is correct it doesn't really matter but I should wrote I'm think I'm gonna rotate the board because that's gonna make them then I just have to always do it right if I rotate it I can just do the same algorithm in the same direction then rotate it back right it seems like that would be a good idea but let's do this to the right first for J plus plus okay so now what I need to do is I need to look at what's in oh this is actually no this is not a loop well it sort of is but I'm done I'm gonna break out of it so I'm gonna say if board I comma J is not equal to 0 now whatever I do here I'm gonna break right because this is basically me looking for the first instance of something that's not 0 and I don't like so this no matter what whatever happens here I'm going to be done with that inside Loup afterwards so now what I need to do if it's not equal to zero and actually to be honest with you there's no reason for me to go to the last spot because the last spot nothing's ever going to happen to it so I just want to go to zero one or two I don't need to check three then I just need to check I need I mean this is a little bit silly but I'm gonna do another loop in here Oh sort of like I could say while let me I could say like boolean finished equals false I'm not finished while not finished I want to MS I'm gonna actually say like okay hold on int index equals I I want to just keep that variable in a different and so while I'm and I'm gonna keep the finish I might be able to get rid of this but I'm gonna keep this and say I'm working out this algorithm in my head while I'm not finished I want to check next equals next equals index plus one okay so if next is the edge if next equals three finished equals true alright so I could also just say while true and then break here right so maybe that's a little bit simpler got a lot of breaks here okay so I'm going now if bored and I should get you know what I should do int num Ord IJ like I should put this this value I should put it in a variable it's gonna be helpful value now if if it's not equal to zero I'm gonna do this stuff otherwise I just keep going try to get the next one if it's not equal to zero I say I might not need this separate index variable but it's making it's helping you think about it I'm gonna get rid of this this one while true next equals index plus 1 if bored I really should probably just ask for the row can I do that can I say int row equals bored oh no cuz I didn't I didn't do it that way so I'm not gonna that would be interesting if I had thought been more thoughtful about it and people telling me it's spaghetti I know it's spaghetti I have to read 5 to think this through then I can refactor it later a release for right now next if bored if bored index net next I'm still in the same row so it's always J equals that value right so this is this is if I'm at the end we're done if it equals that value then what do I do so first actually there's a couple things it could be it could equal 0 if it equals 0 then it equals that value and the original spot index J equals 0 right so this is like swapping the value so this is like if it if it equals 0 so I'm gonna do that otherwise another case could be that it's the same value in which case it equals 0 same sort of thing but it equals value times 2 so it doubles the first thing I should check is if next equals 3 then break else if it equals 0 then pass it and I don't break I keep going because I keep moving right if I combine it I'm also done so I would say break and then what's the last possible scenario it could be it could be equal could be the value or it could be a higher value so if board then I also just break if next equals three or board next next J is greater than value is this right could this possibly be right let's think about this what I'm saying is the possibilities are I'm at the edge or an edge just like that I'm either at the edge because the next thing is three so next would actually be four right because three is a legitimate one for me to check so if next is four I can't go any further or if the next is a bigger value I can't go any further otherwise if it's zero I take that spot and what I have to keep going index equals next I have to keep going otherwise combine it and I'm done all right I think that's I think that's it so now there's a bunch of like this is very spaghetti so well let's think about this let's think about this I start with a value and if the value is not zero I'm gonna do some stuff and if I do anything at all then I'm done so this is yeah so let's this should probably go out into a function this this whole while loop this whole thing should go out into a function but let's let me just leave this in here and see what I've got going right now and I think oh boy I really could have messed some stuff up here because I don't even have the correct number of curly brackets so I've probably done something horrible all right so something really owned this is I don't know why I have a double equals there that may no sense ah all right how it's pretty good oh wow can I please get a different configuration of the board yeah all right so so far this algorithm actually shockingly worked so far now one thing that I believe 2048 does and if I look at the lookit here at the game play is that it lets see a player tile slide if the Chalobah score but somewhere I guess a new two appears every dozen new like new tiles appear where does it say how the new tiles appear every turn a new tile will randomly appear in ambu spot on the board with the value of either two or four oh so it could be a value of two or four so I might as well make the exact game so this can be if random so I can actually ha I should reuse this so this by the way add new spots a total number of new spots whoo this is nice and then while starting spots is less than num do this and I need starting spots to be zero and then here I should say if random is less than 0.5 make it a 2 otherwise make it a 4 and so at the beginning I'm going to add two new spots and then every time I press the key I'm also going to add a one new spot now again I can only move to the right yeah somebody tell me if this isn't working correctly at any point I mean I'm getting lucky oh I can only move to the right but I think there we go now I'm stuck obviously so that I to be more thoughtful about how I play this game but we could see this is the result I should get if I could only ever move to the right no matter what happens right am I not getting any new force you're right so why did that what did I miss there oh whoops there we go let's get some new force yeah so now we can see now I'm also getting new force and we can see I believe this game is working correctly now I really shouldn't but I kind of want to refactor this but I don't so this really does merit refactoring because this inner loop I really think this could be its own function just to do the sliding now here's the thing I need some advice you're watching this later in the final recorded version of this you won't be able to give me any advice other than complain that I didn't correctly at the comments but from the live chat I'm trying to think I could adapt this algorithm to go in different directions or I could rotate the numbers always move to the right and rotate back which should I do before I get before I get to that actually I'm being told from the chat that it's only supposed to generate new tiles if a tile successfully moves okay yeah so it only a new tile if if a tiles the only new tile fatales successfully moves so how do I know so here I should say moved I should assume that no tile moved and then if a tile moves this is this is a tile moving right moved equals true or moved equals true both these cases here a tile moves whether it's moving to an empty spot or combining and if a tile moves then at the end of all this insane and nonsense the swipe function I can say if moved so add new spot one so I want to take that out of here and I'm just gonna put it here add a new spot one so let's see if this fixed is that Alright a tile move so I get a new spot tile moves so I get new spot it's like right I'm done I can't I don't get new tiles because nothing can combine I mean obviously you can if I went down but that's not gonna work Oh interesting ah here's a bug if this is going down that too is gonna make a for but I the last thing has to combine first I can return a boolean for swipe suggesters is it fun that's a good point right tu204 will create oh four oh four instead of oh four four oh alright so what are my edge cases that are wrong they're not really edge cases but here let me think about two couple cases is there going to be a part two to this challenge there's gonna be a part true to this challenge I think the rotating of the board let's see we can finish this off okay so here's that here's a problem right what you're saying is if I have two and two does this go to four right and right now it will just go to four there but should it end up like this is that correct that's one thing that's not going to work another thing that's not going to work is if I have two to two this should go to four right and right now with my algorithm I'm gonna get four to both of those are problems correct I'm gonna check the chat yeah okay all right so as long as those things I need to go backwards I need to obviously go in the backwards way I have to start merging from right to left obviously yeah yeah okay all right so the the major problem that I've encountered here is I have to start merging from the other direction I kind of like we move this along but that's not gonna work I actually want to like almost like suck stuff in that's the way it really needs to work okay so I think I have to rewrite that code almost entirely right because what I need to do is I want to get the value of the oh my goodness boy this is hard I want to start from the last spot I'm just gonna do a save as here for a second I want to start from the last spot and go down to the first spot except I don't need to go to the first spot probably because if I'm sucking things in there's nothing from there to suck to the to the next one maybe I need a new metaphor here all right so the first thing I want to do if I look at that last spot if it's a zero then I want to go the other way so hold on this pause this for a second I'm gonna let this edit here well I think oh yeah I need to I for sure oh why did I make this so hard I mean just I'm just thinking for a second make a function that shifts all the numbers to the right then run another function that scans from right to left combining equal numbers Eduardo I love that so the first thing I should do is just shift everything so this is a this is read I would worry I don't know refactor oh I'm not in the wrong camera I think I should refactor because I really want to be able just pull out the row as an array and I think I can't do that the way that I created this as X Y right because sorry I know that I'm kind of like off in a edit point here if I say board 0 that doesn't give me the first row that gives me the first column correctly in the way that I've structured this right I'm just thinking here so because I think what I can do if I can just pull out the row and I can pass it to another function I can do all the combining there it'll make things much simpler anybody know if that's how it works in Java for the 2dimensional array right this will pull out the array okay good all right so okay I've gotten some great suggestions from the chat and one thing that I could actually do is one thing I could actually do is just shift all the numbers over first and then combine anything that's equal in the correct direction so starting from the back so one thing that I might actually what I really want to be able to do is I wouldn't be able to just pull out a row and pass it to a function so we just have like a simple little single array that I'm manipulating so this is gonna require some refactoring okay so what I want to do is I want to actually think of this now as this is the row this is the Y and this is the X so I've got to kind of change everything it's actually not that big of a deal because I just kind of sort of reverse my loops I mean it's still the Y is still J I just want to sort of think of that first it's a little bit silly but I thought I'm doing this okay but x and y here okay so I want to do that and then this is J and this is I because when I create the array I want to think of this as Y sorry X this is gonna make my life much easier although I guess I could have just had everything go down hold on time without I'm gonna have everything go down get it that all out because Y is I'm so used to this IJ stuff that I think it's gonna be fine because I can pull out the call already so if I was coming from here I was just talking about pulling this out the thing is I've written this in a way where this is the column and this is the row hmm so what I actually wanted to do I think what will be easier is forget about this everything going to the right let me redo this to have everything go down because what I can actually do is and let me come back over here what I want to do here is because first go through each column and the columns right I'm gonna go through all the columns I know I totally botched this but I'm really gonna like I'm kind of redoing this again and what I want to do is I want to say give me a row which is from the board index I and it's not a row it's a column I want to look at each column one at a time so this loop right there the new loop that I've written is just giving me each one of these things as a single array now I want to say combine or like shift the column okay so I'm gonna write a function I'm probably going to need a lot of this stuff but I'm just gonna comment it out right now so I'm gonna come up here I'm gonna write a function and I'm gonna call that function shift and the only thing I'm gonna do in that function first just to deal with all these scenarios is I'm just gonna take every number and just move everything down so it doesn't matter what the numbers are they just all move down to the end so what I'm going to do is I'm going to use almost the same so this is an array some array I'm gonna call it column it's a column and I'm gonna say for every spot in the common to go from the back column up int I equals and I should curse like just call it J but whatever int J equals 3 J is greater than or equal to 1 just say greater than zero because I don't need to stop the last one and J minus minus so this is now me performing that shifting at oh I got him in the wrong screen wrong screen camera thank you that's fine boy I was doing that for a long time wasn't I it's okay I kind of was like messing that up anyway let me just put it back to what it was okay yeah all right I'm seeing some good and we just come back all right so what I want to do is I actually want to and I know this isn't where anybody remember what this was actually a second ago wasn't it I had this here right but I didn't have it right I had it all like screwy so I don't really see it there's not an easy way for me to see these donations I do super appreciate it ah you okay what Troy gave a donation right so you need to create a function that can take and look at it in multiple ways and then search backwards through that direction merging tiles yes well I think Thank You Troy I know I already recorded this bit thank you for that okay so wow that's super Ella can i maybe go now and just come back to this next week I got to finish why did I say that I would do this all right I just want to get the code back to where I didn't change the camera correctly only that I can't read the chat anymore all right how about whatever you shift delete out all zero in this indices then combine all the adjacent numbers let me let me do thank you for all these suggestions let me let me go with what I'm trying to do here so I just I kind of screwed up the code I don't know what it was before there's gonna be a little bit of a continuity error that's fun okay so actually what I want to do is I want to think about shifting all these things down so the way I kind of got the code in a little bit of a mess here but let me put it back to something what I want to do is go through every sorry every single X so X is the outer loop or I in my case and I is less than four and I plus plus and now this whole inner loop I'm gonna just comment out I might come back to it later I'm going to comes in now because what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna pull out that column column equals board index I just want to pull out that column I've got the column and I can put it that's just a single array and I can just say shift it so I can write a function now just to deal with it I mean how hard can it be to shift elements in an array right I should be able to do that sometimes when you've been programming all day long easy to eat things that should be easy become kind of hard so I'm gonna pass in that array and I'm gonna operate on that array but I do want to start at the end so I'm gonna use a while loop actually weirdly enough I think this might help if I started index 3 and I say while true so I want to keep going basically until I say break what I want to do is I'm going to say if column at and let me just say it's actually let me say J for the index if column J is a 0 then column J should get whatever was next to it column J minus 1 and then column J minus 1 should equal 0 right then J should go to the next spot and if if J equals the end 0 then break because I can't shift anything into that now I might have missed something here but let's try doing this so that didn't work but hold on because it didn't go all the way I have to keep oh if it's 0 all right so so there's an issue it doesn't account for double zeros so if it's this worked but I need to if it's what look at this again what let's think about the algorithm here well that's gonna work try it one more time okay so this is gonna this will this will if I bring this over closer to me this is only going to go to here and the reason for that is that I start here and I bring this thing down then I move here and then I bring this thing down I got to start over each time I have to start over so if J equals 0 I'm not done I need to go back and set J equal J back equal to 3 I can just do this again now I'll be stuck in an infinite loop if every time we get to 0 I set J back goal of 3 but if when if when J goes to the end and back to the end and it is not a zero there then I should be able to break right that should fix that infinite loop achieved or maybe I just didn't click in the window no or or you say if I've shifted once just go back to say J plus plus that could also work but why didn't this work yeah so another way that I could do this actually is if I'm shifting then wait timeout bruteforce just save the index of the last available index relative the one you are checking now just iterate that first loop four times just add some debug logs matrix math I know I'm destined to only do man Jim look this is so great get a break you need it I know I can't I have to finish this I'm sure I'm reading the chat there's some really interesting good suggestions here and I see I also said when I see Alka is typing I like and then it goes away it goes away what's there let's think about this so why didn't my solution work here let's let me um filter out zeros oh right if I were in JavaScript I could use the array but I'm not if moved J is three goods oh right if I do this I got it I got here we go good idea thank you okay well hold on ding ding I think actually I was this this thinking was flawed and actually if I move if I'm ever at the end I'm done but if I move I just need to go back to where I was before and I probably don't have to go all the way back to three but let's just shut set J back to three otherwise move to the next one I think that'll work if it's zero otherwise go down by one if you move it okay it's giving me JavaScript code that's really torturing me that's really really torturing me all right if if it's a zero grab the one next to it and set then one next to it at zero then go back to the beginning it shouldn't be a zero so you should go down by one and every time you do that eventually it'll go down by one and we'll get to be zero this should work I feel like this is right I think I need to print what's going on so let me print print array so I'm gonna do a little debugging here I probably never get to the end print J 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 2 3 all right so I'm definitely my issue is that ok infinite loop thank you very much that I'm getting stuck at 3 column J equals 0 3 is the value of 2 and then 2 is the value of 0 and then go back to 3 so once you're back to 3 it shouldn't be 0 anymore and you should go down to 2 oh if the last one is 0 I'm still setting it to 3 so here actually if if J J minus 1 equals 0 I'm done otherwise go back to 3 right no you should it should only set it to 3 if column J minus 1 was not 0 oh right let's stop my infinite loops here go back for a second ah right so if all right if column Oh if column J equals zero so okay hold on hold on hold on combining your values before you shift things into empty slots Chris Ray is a good idea find all nonzero values in the column and append them to an array of zeros I just make a new array this is lunacy what I'm doing this is total lunacy there's an edit point that just happened you you've saved yourself hours this is ridiculous what I'm doing I could just find all the nonzero elements and put them at the end this is crazy this is crazy so for example what I'm doing is so much easier right thank you in the chat whoever said this new column is a new integer array with four spots in it they're all zeros now all I need to do is go through my existing column which I could ask for the length but I know it's four and I can just say I could go backwards even I could even go backwards and I could get myself an index which is three and I could go all the way through all the elements I could start at three go all the way down to zero I and I could just try to find something that's not a zero if column index and I should make this J column index J the shifting is so unnecessary if column index J equals does not equal zero I found something that's not equal zero where should I put it put it in the new column put it in the last spot of the new column and then just move the index down to the next spot otherwise don't do anything and then column equals new column now did I miss something there I might have missed something there but this will be so much easier you know this this might not end been the two dimensional array properly so I got to think about that but let's let's at least give me print array column and print array so if this doesn't end up in the the let's see and I don't need this else because I actually don't need to do anything right I just go I'm go through and every time I find one there we go okay so hold on this is messed up okay so all right boy there's so much simpler all right so let's look at this oh this is so hard to read I need a better way of printing the array so I'm actually just gonna I'm gonna make my own print array and I'm just gonna actually you know what I'm just gonna say this is silly I'm gonna join the array I'm going to yeah I'll make my own printer a just so I can see and I'm gonna say string s equals join array with commas and then print line s Oh will it can I say string s array equals string array well let me convert it to a string and then join it hope maybe this needs to be a double quotes there oh boy I got lost and writing my own printer a function can I just join it oh now I really miss JavaScript because it would make me so much happier to be doing this with John now I regret regret my not doing I thought I was gonna make my life easier because I kind of more comfortable here let's scratch that some problem with making a printer a budget all right let me let me write a little quick ridiculous print array function that's my own and I'm going to just create a string this is ridiculous but I'm going to do it anyway I'm going to concatenate a nice little string with the elements of the array and a comma and then I'm going to say print line s so now I'm gonna say just to debug this I'm going to print the original column and then at the end I'm going to print the new column and let's see how that works so let's see and I also want to do a print line because it's doing a lot of these so let me just put a little space in there so I can see alright so what this did is yeah all the zeros state 0 is the 4 move to there the to move to there let me add some more stuff but I think this is right so the issue is however unfortunately that I've created this new so but I think what I'm gonna do then this is very silly is I'm just going to copy the values back over so what I'm gonna do is I make the new array instead of saying column equals new array I'm gonna actually just really inefficiently and ridiculously go through the column and take the values from the new array and I'm going to say column index I equals new so I'm gonna actually copy the values over rather than point the memory because that will stay within the twodimensional alright and now I should have what about no it's not combining but I'm much closer and I'm doing much better now so now what I need to do is I need to add the new values let me so after I call this shift if moved so I'm gonna forget about this if moved thing for a second because I'm gonna assume stuff is moving just to see the things is working right so now this this works so nothing is combining but no matter what it shifts all the values now I just need to do the same thing again but combine the values together okay poof now what what time is this like nine is it like midnight already just like was the building shut down I'm gonna have to sleep here okay so now what do I want to do i want to i called shift now I'm gonna call combined so I probably could do this in one step I think my life is going to be easier if I fur ups I think my I think my life is going to be easier if I first shift the elements down and then combine them from the back right it should be kind of the same algorithm pretty much right so let's go now to combine because I could only combine one thing and I want to combine the last thing so oh I can combine and then shift again oh this is great so I can combine a column so I want to start from the back so I'm going to start with three I'm gonna go down to I'm gonna go down to zero but I don't need zero and now but right now it's if the last element to zero I'm done right if the last I'll if that element is zero nothing can be combined because everything has shifted over so if column so actually I can really even just say here if column index 3 equals zero return do nothing can I do that in Java just return to get out of the function so if it's a three there's nothing there to combine otherwise now what I want to do is I want to check if so a is column index I B is column index I minus one if a equals B then column I equals a times two right so that's combining it and column I minus one equals zero and brand return I'm done you can only combine one thing could only combine one thing now yeah if not just keep going check the next one to see if you combine it this should be good now that's combined now yeah and actually I don't I can operate on that array so I don't need to make a newer I'm actually operating on that array and making it a zero now I should be able to just shift again just to like get out any of the zeros so this should actually be good I think let's run this oh yeah what did I what's wrong here I got an array out of bound exception for wait wait wait let me run that again hold on it starts for I how could i before oh I plus plus minus minus thank you major error there two for two oh wait combined I think this is working correctly I mean obviously it's adding stuff too much but I think it's combining correctly see if anybody can tell you right now now I need to know if something has moved so what I need to figure out is when I call these functions I need to know if something if anything has moved by the way I don't need any of this anymore all of that that I wrote is total nonsense I'm just deleting it now this is all I need to do but I need to figure out if something has moved so one thing I could do is I kind of each of these functions return a value if it's if something has shifted or moved I could also just check to see if the board is exactly the same so let me think about that what's is it easy to detect in these if something's moved so let's have that let's let's do that boolean moved equals at the end of the function I'll return this so this right is something moving not necessarily it's something moving only if index is not equal to J right that's it changing if index is not equal to j then moved equals true alright that's if that's something moved in here and then oh actually actually there's an easier way to do this because right here I can say if column index I if anything has changed if they're not equal then set it then set equal and something has moved so that should tell me if something's moved and then in combined I can do the same thing this is nothing's moved so return false and oh and these have to have a be a boolean now boolean boolean and at the end return moved then here in combined return false if at the end as a 0 it's no good and here return true and I guess if I make it all the way to the end return false so this is now going to tell me if any of them sure I don't need to really check all of these but because this but let's just do this oh no no no no no no this is no good first of all if anything has moved anywhere so I don't want to set the value ever doctor false so if it shifted moved is true this is this is now kind of spaghetti again if it's combined moved is true and the last one doesn't need that because by definition this is only gonna do anything if it combines something and so it's already been set to move and now I should be able to UPS add a new spot so now I should have I think the behavior of 2048 know something moved how come I didn't get a new so let's let's look at this moved equals moved or shift that's yeah that's better so this I'll keep it so moved is Fault false so this is better moved equals moved or shift so it's going to stay true this is much cleaner to look at it this way moved equals moved or combined and then I can do the same thing here moved or shift so let's look at yeah there we go well stuffs not moving now okay wait hold on what's just happened now all right two fours go to the bottom oh boy why did this four not move what did I change go through each column oh this could be maybe this why what I thought I had this working return false return true is this now if it makes it to the end I guess actually I could return a new array and the reset board back to that new array as soon as moves becomes true the function one alright soon hold on let me go all the way back let's let me redo this completely I'm just gonna think about this for a second and just go all the way back to where it's always adding stuff and this is just returned this is just returned and this is not here whoops it's so much console so much unnecessary console could have so much more code yeah all right that's good now I need to figure out a way to to determine if something has moved and I think honestly I've been messing with this the best way to do this is just with a global variable which is a little bit awful but I'm gonna just start with this for right now I'm gonna say boolean moved and if there's a false so I just want to figure out if something has moved so every time I swipe I reset moved back equal to false and then what I can do is in these functions combine like if anything has changed here like for example if at any point column index I does not equal new column index I right there's a new value then I can say moved equals true and then if at any point here I can say moved equal true so these are just the two spots there's much simpler these are just the two spots something's moved it's a global variable so I probably should think of a more thoughtful way of returning a value or passing a value around but I'm gonna do that right now and then I can I can just say this if moved add a new spot so let's see if this works there we go there we go and add a new one would even combine them so eventually we should get stuck right we got stuck nothing can move let's run this one more time so the game is totally playable now the only thing is I can only ever swipe down so if you want to look at the next step where what I'm going to attempt to do is when I press to the right just rotate everything this way so that it swipes everything to her you know down again but it'll only take the right and move it this way so it swept down and then move it back right that's what I'm an attempt to do in the next video if you can even stand to keep watching any of this stuff alright thanks very much and there we go alright I would add a counter so that if one or is greater you know that they one or more of them have returned true in regards to the boolean yeah yeah okay that's a good suggestion oh no is that really true that two two two two should be zero zero four four and I've missed that and four four two two should be eight four oh I missed stuff but I'm still good in terms of my I'm I'm still good the only thing that in terms the combine has to keep going it shouldn't leave here if it can combine more stuff by the way I'm gonna come back and do the rotation next week I'm not going to do that now because it's 9 o'clock at night oh so but I could just call the combine function until it doesn't have anything left to combine right so for example if I can say while combined well while true well how do I do this maybe like a dowhile loop would work here or something like no while it combined column is true call it again this is really silly but right if I had it return true or false I mean it doesn't right now I could do it again it will never be more than two oh yeah you're right it can never be more than two so I can just say combine it twice I'll put that in the beginning of the next video whoops did that do something weird yeah why isn't the two making it all the way down there because that was a new right it's confusing just one the new things come I think they didn't move correctly two and four should be at the bottom four four all stay in the same place new two ends up next to the floor for end up next to the to a new four appear at the bottom so nothing new for appeared at the top the four should go bind to the bottom to be an eight a new four appeared a new four appeared eight I think it's working yeah it's just weird cuz the new stuff doesn't animate so it kind of looks like it's in the wrong place because like a new just appeared there alright two four zero goes to zero zero four four it did that wrong it did something wrong I'm just curious so two two four zero what my algorithm will do is change it to four two two zero four and then it should do this for zero zero and that's not correct so I lost the chat four zero four eight made it to 16 because I combined twice I can't just I can't just willynilly combine twice okay so willynilly combining twice is not correct because then I will get this will this will go do this will actually because I'm doing this twice this will actually end up zero zero zero eight which isn't correct it should end up with this so but the mistake that I have is that four four two two will end up with my algorithm 2 2 4 4 will end up in my algorithm as 8 well it'll at first it'll be 2 to 4 4 because it won't move anything then it'll be 2 2 oh it's only if there is a zero so I have to repeat if a zero pulls out so there's it so the algorithm is correct right because the first thing it did this is what it will end up as but I now have a case where I have to go again why because I have a zero somewhere in the middle anytime I have a zero somewhere in the middle I can run this again which is different than this case this case the zero is not there's no shifting down so that is actually what I'm missing here is the way it should be correct is I should shift let me look at that shift which does nothing combined oh and then shift again but I shouldn't actually oh whoa after I shift again I can run combined that was the problem oh I just need to run combine a second time down here right right that should Ono but not if not if shift doesn't only a shift changes something if shift changes something right this should really return right this should really return a boolean right if things if this second shift changes something then I can run combine again I think that's correct because if the second shift changes something I can return if moved is true based on the second shift so that I'm gonna have to correct this in the next video but if but is that correct does that seem right I mean I know I can write the code for this right only if it's shifted again can I can I combine again right so pseudocode wise what I was missing when I'm missing yours if it changed if it's changed here so this seems right right so I need to where I've ended so far is this so I'm gonna do save a version 3 because I just want to try this real quick shift can just as like a temp moved I'm just gonna changed its false changed its true and then return changed and this should be boolean just a curiosity now am I getting everything right here now so two to four should be four four yep now should go to eight both those should go to eight yeah four should go therefore should go there two should go there I think it's doing Oh something did something weird happened there no just a new two appeared and I'm stuck now I think now so I need to do this last piece whenever I come back to this I think it works right I mean it only goes down but I think it actually works I mean I have to think about a better way of doing this but okay alright everybody that's it I kind of really want to finish this but maybe I could just do it again I don't know you manually set a column and set up for testing the thing is I don't actually just I have to rotate it I just need to pull all point this would be so much better in JavaScript because I could just pull out the section that I want and redo it but anyway there should really be a better way for multidimensional arrays to be aware of their corresponding rows and columns simultaneously yeah 0 4 2 2 is still wrong alright let's let me see something okay so I'm gonna not let's let's try this I'm not gonna add any new spots anymore and I'm going to say board 0 1 is what's the issue is 0 4 2 2 0 whoops 0 1 2 3 so this is the situation this should end with 4 4 know isn't that correct 2 2 2 will be wrong try to break my algorithm people oh that's wrong that's wrong because why so let's think about that so what is my algorithm do 2 2 2 2 doesn't shift anything then it combines this shouldn't it be left with this and then it should move it to this which should trigger another combine so I should get this that's the algorithm in my mind that I've written step 1 is nothing then combine these two leaving the 0 then shift why didn't that happen yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna look at this so this is good to see that this isn't working so now I know this is a case where my algorithm is faulty so I'm gonna go and I will pick this back up I don't even know I'm like so confused here I'm gonna just turn this off so thank you all for watching this again I think I need to like just be a little bit more disciplined in the future I gotta go get home eat some dinner go to sleep and I will see you all next week I will definitely be back here next Friday I might pop back in and did I catch oh yeah i yeah i'm sure in Austin and Matt I'm getting some good comments I probably something really small here but I'm I'm gonna end of games wrong I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to it and fix it next time okay goodbye everybody sorry that I'm just ending so abruptly but that's what happens
