hello in this video where should I stand what do you think in this video I'm going to look at how to work on your p5 GS sketch or really any HTML Javascript CSS combo thingamabob outside of in any old text editor by running a local server on your laptop now what does that mean actually I'm going to use the whiteboard for a second so let's just think about the internet as the web and all that stuff for a second so you are making a web page and you have a laptop and to make your web page you're maybe editing an HTML file maybe you have a CSS file maybe you have a JavaScript file and you're editing all these files they're just plain text files and you're editing them in some text editor so the text editor I'm going to use happens to be one called sublime but you can use any text editor list of text editors I would say now if I could think of them but you put some in the comments and you can write some in the comments your favorite put your favorite text editor in the contents so what I'm going to use sublime text so you're editing these files now one of the things I'm going to show you is that you know another thing that you're going to run on your laptop is a thing called a browser and your browser actually has the ability just to open those files so you could ask your browser open the HTML file and you're going to see that the result of that file in the browser are going to fix the mic here mad magic edit so if you open those files from the browser you're going to see the result of those files in the browser now let's think of what's your ultimate goal here the ultimately the idea that probably is that you have a server server and you have your server hosting some website you know website.com and ultimately what you're going to do is you're going to take your files and put them on a server so that other people on their laptops and computers or phones or whatever it is can connect and look at your files so by opening the file by opening the HTML file from the browser you aren't actually doing what the web server itself will do which will ultimately serve up the files so that other people can request them so a better and in fact a lot of things won't work if you just open those files so yeah okay I used to keep going that get start over and erase all this so so ultimately what you want to do is run by the way like the you know the YouTube makes these charts you could look at these charts where you see people drop off and stop watching your video and just about everybody stops with a few of you are remaining but I keep going with this so what you ultimately want to do is run something which I'll call a local server so if you run a local web server on this machine you are more accurately simulating what will happen when you eventually upload your files to a server and everything will look and work and function correctly so this is what I want to show you in this video how do you edit your files with the text editor run a local server so that you can see the result in the file of those files in your browser and accurately simulate the environment that will eventually exist when you publish your stuff to the world and become the person who publishes their son for the world there we go okay so let's go back to the computer now and take a look at this so this is actually the p5 desktop editor which you may or may not have used actually does all this for you it's a text editor you hit this Run button and it spawns a local server it opens a little browser which shows your page but what I'm going to do actually is I'm going to just quit out of it and I'm going to show you that if I go to my computer's desktop I don't know if you can't really see this and I go here I was actually I made I there's a folder called test sketch and in this folder are the files associated with my sketch there's an HTML file a JavaScript file and a folder called libraries that libraries folder is where the p5.js library itself exists so what I want to do is now I have something I have a text editor called sublime text you can google it you can find it you can use any text editor you want and what I want to do is look at those files in sublime text one way I can do that is actually just take this and drag it in and now you can see here that that I have now have I'm now browsing and looking at those files and if I wanted to edit my code I could look at it right here and now I can edit the code I can actually make the font a little bit bigger and you can see here I'm editing my code now let me make the next point if I just go back here and click on this HTML file I have no idea what's going to happen it's going to open it in some default browser it might be Safari it might be Chrome if I open it it opened it in chrome and you can see it's working it's actually running but look what's happening up here it's opening it from the file path file users processing desktops test sketch so while this works there are a lot of things that won't work when you're opening it just from the file path itself that only work if you're using a local server running a local server certain things like loading an image file into your sketch for example won't work so while this is okay as a solution a quick and dirty test I personally would recommend never doing it this way instead you want to run a local server so there happens to be this wiki on github under the p5.js wiki which has a bunch of different instructions of different ways you can run a local server on different operating systems Windows Linux Mac Apache but about the thing that I'm going to use which I think is the simplest is you I'm since I'm on a Mac and a Mac's come with Python installed I can just run a Python local server from any directory I want so what I'm going to do the way I'm going to do this is by running terminal so if you don't know where terminal is it's in the you know applications utilities there's an application called terminal when you run it it looks something like this this is giving you console command line access to your computer and I can type various things like if I type PWD that stands for a print working directory and you can see I'm in user slash processing and if I just type CD that means change directory and if I type desktop I want to change to the desktop and now if I type P PWD I can see I've been users processing desktop other things I can do is I can hit the up arrow the up arrow goes to my most recent command see it again and now if I'm on the desktop I can run a local server from here and I can say Python em simple HTTP server so this just happens to be a command that I have memorized but I'm saying I want to run a Python program that's built into the Macintosh it's called simple HTTP server I forget what the M stands for somebody will tell me in the comments I hit enter and you can see uh serving HTTP on 0 0 0 port 8000 what this means is my this computer is now running a web server where is the web server running it's running on localhost and another way of saying local host is 0.0.0.0 so that's the IP address the Internet Protocol address the address the numeric address of a computer on the internet and those numbers can become rather important but for us right now we can just think of it as localhost port 8000 being the port that other people can connect to who are the other people there me so I am the other person and what I want to do now is go up here right and instead of accessing my sketch from file what I want to do is say HTTP localhost now you can see I've done this before on this computer so it's already like pre filling it in but I want to go to localhost colon port 8000 localhost colon port 8000 I hit enter now you don't actually see my sketch because actually I would I now see is a view of everything on the desktop so you can see I have a bunch of other things like I was doing this photo booth p5 demo which has this snap button which allows me to take so this is something I'm going to make a tutorial about in a minute another video to watch your video a few videos from now you'll find this one but you can see I'm sort of browsing this is the minimum miss spanning tree example so I have a bunch of folders with sketches I'm sort of serving up that hold on my whole desktop which I can choose to do or not to do but what I'm looking for is test sketch this is the one and they can make it bigger in chrome by shift command plus so now I see the sketch running and I could go back to the code and I could say hey let me change the background to 100 hit save tab over to Chrome hit refresh and you can see now I have the new sketch running so this is another way of working outside of some allinone editor environment text editor local server browser but missing piece let's say in draw the draw loop I want to debug the value of X so I'm going to say console dot log X now I could have said print line X print line is a p5 specific function that prints something to the console console dot log is the sort of native JavaScript version of that function basically the same thing but if I put that in there and I go back and hit refresh where is it I don't see it no log no console so in Chrome I can use something called the chrome developer tools are you excited you shouldn't be how maybe you are maybe you should be I don't know so where do you get those view up here under view developer developer tools but I want to go straight to the JavaScript console the developer tools are this massive thing and as all sorts of inspect this look at that HTML CSS style this magic this all I really care about is the JavaScript console right now I want to see things that are console dot log so I'm going to select JavaScript console and it's going to appear now it won't necessarily look like this on your computer you're probably going to see it at the bottom you're probably going to see it a lot smaller but what I've done you know you can you can there's various ways you can like move it around and change the font size you know I want it to be kind of rather big so I can for a tutorial you can see it so what's nice here is you can see there's the result and it's showing me these each one of these things is printing from sketch J's line number eight so if I go over here and see line number eight console dot log X so that's great now you can also comment this out and refresh the sketch one of the wonderful things about the Chrome JavaScript console is that it is interactive what do I mean by that I can actually type in the value X the variable X which is a variable in my program hit enter and it's going to show me the current value of X so I can kind of live debug as the program's running I can do other things like I could say x equals 50 it's getting to the other side of the screen hit enter it you can see that I actually changed on the fly the value of that variable and it moved I can do other things like what if I said no loop no loop is a function in p5 that turns off draw and suddenly it stops looping I can say loop I can do things like just call other functions like if I say create P hello create P is a p5 function that creates a paragraph Dom element and there you go hello is right there it's also showing me what's in that Dom element and there's so there's a lot more to this and all as I make other tutorials that use the chrome developer console you'll see more and more about it so this has been about 10 minutes hopefully this helped you make sense of the world it's a very hard world to make sense of these days and this probably doesn't help make sense of the world but it makes sense of a small part of the world the local server on your laptop of the chrome developer tools I'm sure you have questions and I will answer them somehow in a way I don't know how yet but in in the comments of this video or in another video and I look forward to seeing you in the next video maybe maybe maybe not ok thanks very much I'm gonna hit stop
