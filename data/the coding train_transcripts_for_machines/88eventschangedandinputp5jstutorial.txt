hello I'm back in making a video in this video I want to look at the JavaScript input event now you might be wondering why are you looking at the JavaScript input event well first of all it's a very useful event the name input doesn't exactly describe what it does so I feel like that's a nice thing to clear up in this discussion that but I feel like I'm having a discussion with you even though you're not actually there but you are there you're a real person and but well one of the reasons in particular why I want to make this video is I attempted to do exactly the same thing you can go back and find another video where it just like didn't work and I was trying to update stuff so one thing to make sure you're doing is that you have the most recent copy of the p5.js library now if you're watching this video like a year from now you'll be using the I don't know the lor Dutch library effort so this won't be relevant anymore but if you're actually here in 2015 make sure you're working with one of the most recent p5.js and people I've done library so that this particular event function will work okay so what do I want to happen here this is a web page it's got some text on it it's got a text input box and it's got a slider now nothing is going to happen right now I'm gonna type some text in here which that'll work and I can even move this slider the goal that I want for this example is for when I type text in there I want the paragraph above to update in real time with that text when I move the slider I want that paragraph up there the font size to change these are exciting moments that will happen when we get this to work so first I let so so first let's look at the code that's at least gotten this so far now again I'm doing the thing that I that I feel confused and torn about which is that I'm creating these Dom elements with the p5.js library they certainly could be written into the HTML file directly an access from p5 and that's a topic for a video I will make next using the Select and select all functions but for right now just to demonstrate the idea of the event it's easiest if I make the paragraph with some starting text I make the input the text input oh I don't okay so I made this mistake the other day and I'm going to correct it the event that I want to demonstrate is call input I actually probably would work fine but I think it's particularly confusing for me to name a variable input and then start demonstrating this other thing called input so let's change that to something like if only you are actual person there you would say shout out a good variable name and all I can think of is like porcupine but which makes no sense in this context but we could use it no no let's not use it that's too crazy let's just say a text text field text box let's call it text box that looks pretty good okay so I'm gonna call it text box text text mech like texmex no text box it's like spicy but not too spicy I don't know okay so I make the text box and the slider all those things in the page you can see I've made them with Coach now how do you attach an event to a particular Dom element now there are many ways to do this using all sorts of frameworks and libraries and native JavaScript I'm going to show you how to use the p5.js framework so certainly I could do something like the mousepressed event which I demonstrated in a previous video but let's start I'm going to start with the changed event I'm just gonna say something like text the input event sorry I'm gonna say textbox dot changed do something so with this lovely wonderful little line of code does is it says there's an event called changed when the content of the text box changes execute a function called do something now if I ran this code with this work it would not do I ask weird questions to myself while I'm standing here apparently yes but would this work it would not work why because do something is a function that I have to define myself so now I'm gonna say function do something and I could just say something like print line you know did like see a message in the console but really what do I want to do maybe what I want to do is update the paragraphs text with the text boxes text value so this is kind of like a bit of a tricky line of code right here but let's look at what it's doing the HTML function is a function that's part of the p5.js library changes the HTML content of a Dom element so the paragraphs content should change to what the text boxes value what's the text boxes value the thing that you typed into that text box so now if we run this I should see right when the text boxes update the paragraph with what's in the text box let's do that hello this should it's not updating why isn't it updating well it turns out that I've misled you and I've led to believe that the changed event the changed event is an event that is triggered any time the content changes it's actually not the changed event is an event that's triggered whenever the browser deems you to have finished your action so this is kind of like a vague strange concept that you know but somebody somewhere there's like borgov browser designers has decided what this should be and it happens to be hope this works when you hit the enter key is one up so if I hit enter hey we're Tobit so lucky when I hit enter in the text box that's when the changed event happens also by the way I could hit tab I'm writing my name and then watch this you can't see but here on this keyboard I'm gonna hit tab one two three tap it also updates so this is an event that fires when the user has changed their action but what I want is for that to continuously change any type you've any any time it changes for whatever reason you can type any single character and that my friends is the input event so this particular event this particular event the input event is an event that happens anytime the content of the text box changes do something is the callback right it's the function that gets triggered when the event occurs that function is we call back call call like a that's a bird call I know it up to would call back to the function that was gonna go somewhere interesting and it just didn't so I apologize for that okay so let's run this again look at this and then say hello look at that oh that is so nice this is constantly changing no matter what I could just do this all day long it's just fun realtime quick interaction is fun you know it's actually fun is like going outside and like playing a game of capture the flag with friends and socializing but you know if you're by yourself in a room with a camera and the node kid web browser then making the text box change in the real time is fine now let's add the slider so all I need to do and just do something I don't really like the name of that so I'm going to change that to like update text and then I'm going to make another event slider dot input update font size oh that's the worst whenever you know update let's just say update size so now I'm gonna write another function called update size and let's actually sorry about this let's actually put it up here so that we can see now so when the text box changes the paragraph element is updated with the contents of the text box when the slider changes what happens so in a previous video I looked at the style function the style function is a function that is a way to programmatically assign style information CSS tags essentially to a Dom element so I'm gonna say paragraph dot style and say anything about CSS I could never remember what things are called but I'm just gonna like look up to the ceiling of this room and think for a second and hope that the correct term is font size now you might think all I would need to do now is say slider dot value right because this sort of makes sense right I made this slider that and remember this is the minimum value of the slider the maximum value I like wanted to zoom over here so I can point to it this is me being ridiculous but this is the minimum value of the slider 64 is the maximum value slider and 16 is the starting value of the slider so in other words whatever value is here should be assigned to the font size each 16 I slide down it's Tanis line all the way up at 64 now you might think that work would work and it's I don't think it's going to it's not working so what's the issue what's the what's what's the problem the problem is that CSS expects you not just to give it a value for font size but a unit of measurement and there's different ways other all sorts of you could some typography genius person knowledgeable person please come and enter this internet world and add some information below and like a comment that explains about different types of Units but here's one that I think is a useful one point P T so what I actually can true enough what I actually need to add and I'm coming back here is plus PT so what this is doing again it's not like adding 10 plus the letter P the letter T the plus operator with text joins those things so the goal is really and I probably should have done this in two steps if I were to say something like 24 point and run this whenever I move the slider it's gonna change it to 24 point but that's not what I want I want to change it to the slider dot value followed by PT and I guess I got font size right and now when we do this I can write whatever any text I want and I can use the slider to change its size dynamically now this is kind of interesting how the note how the flow of a page works right as that paragraph gets bigger the other content gets pushed down which makes for a kind of strange goofy interaction which I kind of like in this moment but you know certainly if I wanted to fix that I don't know fixes the right word but alter that the behavior I could put the paragraph below and now if the paragraph was below I could type some text and it would seem maybe a little less weird and change its size dynamically so now hopefully you see how you can create these interface elements like a text box a slider there are other ones too and anytime anything about that element changes whether it's the text in the text box or the value of the slider you can trigger an event that alters something else that's happening on the page so I might say to you like how far can you take this how many sliders can you add how many can you control different paragraph elements could you as you're typing like each letter is like a new Dom element that's randomly absolute positions over on the page what kind of creative graphical experiments can you make with just this simple idea and that is this video about the input function callback and I'm going to stop this video and go on to the next one which I believe I'm gonna look at select and select all I look at my list anyway just look and you'll know okay
