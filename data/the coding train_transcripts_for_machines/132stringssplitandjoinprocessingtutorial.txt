okay so we've seen the basics of working with strings we've we've even drawn some text onto into our processing sketches on into the window so the the path that we're on we're trying to get to this place where we have there's this large body of text that we're loading from a file or there's all these numbers that are coming from some website or some URL someplace we're pulling data in from somewhere and we're almost there we're gonna where to start doing that in the next video but before we can get there I want to look at two key functions in processing that are going to allow us to take data and chop it up and put it back together we're going to need these bits of we're gonna need these bits of technical information to successfully implement some of these some of the ideas so the two the two functions I want to look at are split and join so let's think there's a couple different scenarios one we might have like a string that's like it was a dark you know and stormy night we might have a string that's 10 comma 32 comma 91 comma 73 comma negative for 345 so there's a lot of different scenarios where we're going to get a lot of data a lot of text all at once and we want to look at it as individual tokens so in this particular scenario it was a dark and stormy night the application will look at is word counting I want to know how many times has the word it appeared how many times does the word dark appeared and what can I discover by looking at the frequency of word usage in a particular piece of text and that's a huge open field of text analysis or you know we'll get we'll get into some of that but another scenario is okay well I have all these numbers these are our every single temperature the high temperature of every day in New York City for the last 10 days or the stock price of a certain well you can think of some less cliche examples of data that you might have but so in in both of these cases I want to take these data sources and I want to split them up now the truth of the matter is processing this particular scenario this is this these numbers separated by commas this is known as comma separated values CSV and this is much like how data is stored into spreadsheets if used Excel or Google Docs and you have this you know rows and columns and all these numbers you can export that spreadsheet that grid of information to comma separated values where each row is a separate line in a file each column is a separate number separated by commas are separated by tabs and processing have a clot a builtin class called table this object is designed to work with tabular data so in the end when we have data that looks like this the examples will we'll look at together we'll be using the table object but we're definitely gonna need for this scenario we're definitely gonna need split and in a lot of cases we're actually going to need join there's something we're gonna see about the way we're loading data is we're all gonna get data in as an array and we don't want it to be an array we we have this array we don't want to be array and then we do want it to be an array we have to move back and forth between like a big string and an array and a big string and an array of strings and a big string that kind of stuff over and over again okay I I'm rambling so um so it's I'm trying to make some kind of ridiculous argument as to why it's important to look at these functions so let's just say that let's let's look at let's look at both of these scenarios first let's consider the this this particular scenario okay so let's say this is my string the way that I can split this up into an array so notice I have a single string and now I want an array of strings so the function I can use is called split and what does split knee he'd split needs loose string I want to split which is this and then a delimiter I don't know if I spelled that right the delimiter is the character or sequence of characters that would that causes us to split that straight it's what separates each individual token and here it's very obvious it's a comma I want this my first element of the array this is my second this is my third and so the delimiter here is a comma in this case what's the delimiter a space now as we're gonna see when we start doing word counting and trying to take a large body of text and divide it into individual tokens each of which is a single word in that text that we might have multiple delimiter so there may be a comma a space a period an exclamation point a question mark any of those could be a delimiter or perhaps we might have some strange thing where I have numbers you know that each have a colon and a semicolon so there's a difference between saying I want a sequence of characters to be the delimiter which is split or any of these characters to be a delimiter and well since we're here at this moment I think it's worth mentioning this if I were to say split tokens comma semicolon exclamation point question mark with processing split tokens function this means any one of these individual characters could be a delimiter so this would now work I mean I don't know why I would have this but if my text looked like this if my numbers if mine if my string looked like this with split tokens I would I would get this is the first token this is the second this is the third and this is the fourth and this is the fifth so these are two functions that will come up again and again and again in different examples so even though we are we're going to see that the table object is a very convenient and powerful way to work with tabular data let's just make a quick little simple example together kind of like first very preliminary data visualization right this is my data it's these numbers 1090 32 787 and I want to visualize that data so let's look at splitting it first split s and comma is my delimited delimiter so now I should have all of these values in an array of strings and we might say like oh I'm going to loop through that array and the length of the array and next we'll go up by one and then I'm gonna draw an ellipse with at I times twenty or fifty and then at some yvalue and then the the size of each one of these circles is the data that's in in my original string so notice I have an error here so this is this is a key sort of piece of information I have a string I want to split it up into individual tokens each one of which is a number I do that now I have an array of strings I'm gonna loop through that array and use each one of those values as the diameter of a circle to draw of course this doesn't work the diameter of a circle cannot be a string the difference between this and these two things this is the sequence of characters 1 0 0 this is the number 100 this might be trivial and obvious to you but it's worth noting because this will be a mistake that will happen and come up in lots of different scenarios table is gonna do a lot of this conversion for us as will other scenarios that we'll look at in the future but this is worth noting and a really quick and easy way to convert an individual value or an array of an individual string or an array of strings into a value a number would be Jesus to Val's is using the int function so I can this is like casting I'm casting all these strings into integers but and it's a function that's converting that array into integers so now excuse me here we go and now as you can see I have my beautiful perfect I've never made such a wonderful data visualization ever so please so you know I can start to fiddle with this and and make it better and have it spaced out and maybe use some alpha and do different things but the point here is that now we see that if the data is coming in like this things separated by commas the value that we can use split to split it up so I'm gonna skip I'm just going it's really just a reverse and we'll look at that we'll look at that in the next video I would say if you if you're looking for something to try before we get to the next step which is loading in a file that has lots and lots of stuff in it and it's one thing to just have this like little string with just a quick sequence of values versus a file that has thousands of characters that has an entire novel or a play or has thousands of lines of comma separated values so that's what we're gonna look at next I would say if you're looking for an exercise see what you can do with having a string that twosentence see if you can split it up into individual words and maybe draw those words you know stacked or you know in some configuration or design on the in your processing window okay hopefully this was recording this whole time and if not then I'm just been talking to myself okay I'll talk to you later
