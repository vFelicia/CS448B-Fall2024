so do do check one two test one two uh checking my audio good afternoon evening morning to all of you uh hi let me know if you can hear me i'll be starting in just a few minutes do do do do hmm hello happy 3 34 pm on a saturday november 7th it is me dan schiffman from the coding train coming to you live from my attic do i look more beautiful today than i usually do i have some new lights and a new setup that i would like to experiment with a little bit here it's been a week to say the least i can't believe that the last time i was here live streaming was halloween one week ago today otherwise known as about 67 years eight months and 31 hours ago i'm very tired and typically i do try to live stream in the morning um but this morning i had a special socially distanced parents versus kids little league masked little league game to play um and so uh that's what i was doing and so but it's i'm actually in a very good mood i'm very tired my brain is barely functioning before i forget let me please thank today's sponsor of the coding train no wrong button there he is brilliant uh brilliant oh that is a website for when you have when you're well rested and feeling ready to learn you can go there and try a lot of interactive exercises they have all these courses in uh so many things related to the kinds of things that i love and try to write code examples around here in the coding train from geometry to maths to neural networks to computer science to algorithms all that kind of good stuff so i definitely encourage you to meow meow there's a new new design new look new set of illustrations on the website check out brilliant.org codingtrain you can sign up there for free um and let's if you go through that link it lets them know that you found it the coding train and then if you would like to unlock all of their content um you uh the first 200 people to do so will get a 20 discount off the premium subscription back to my camera here um let's see let i'm looking over here at my monitor and i think i am positively glowing there is a little bit of an issue with the uh key uh it just my green screen is like uh the camera's a little bit wonky but let's see let's do let's run a little test here i got these new uh lights um elgato not a sponsor but hey i'm very available um let's see done here i'm in my elgato control center on my phone and any moment now um the control panel for these lights should pop up they're connected to my wifi network i literally set this up within the last five minutes ah there we go so i should be able to i've got a key light over here i'm going to press a button it is now off i have a key light air over here i'm going to press a button it is now off look i'm in the dark full of noise my face it is not showing its true beauty now i will turn this light back on and this light back on and uh let's just i'm just curious here this is like an eye test i'm gonna make i'm gonna go all full brightness oh no that's the color temperature full brightness full brightness no that's the color temperature full brightness let's go to 55 000 lumens or k or whatever the stuff means i don't even know 5 000 how do i look too bright too oh too bright let's go back down so anyway i uh could use uh consultant here to help me figure out how to sort of optimally get these lights going but i think this is going to be a big improvement um you know i realized that the placement might not be ideal i am wearing a baseball cap because no one wants to see my hair right now it's bad one of the nice things about live streaming from home from your own attic nobody knows if you showered or not i might have showered sometime in the last week possibly more than once i don't know it's all a big blur i slept also there were some times when i slept there were many times where i'm just like refreshing various browser tabs i'm going to take a deep breath i hope everybody has been taking care of themselves and doing well this week um that you're having a nice weekend it is i'm i'm in brooklyn new york and boy is it a gorgeous day outside i spent the entire day outside until um just now i do have a fan running i think i might turn that off because it's a little noisy for the microphone oh that's turning it higher there's got to be a way to turn this off there we go the fan is now awesome there should be a little less noise microphone should be a little clearer i also am getting a new microphone so soon enough this will no longer be my microphone that's exciting stuff all right what do i have to do today i have to blow the train whistle i have to say thank you to the members through the youtube membership program thing of the coding train it's actually the fact that a lot of people have recently been joining at least in my relative scale um that i felt confident to acquire some new lights to try to make things uh look a little nicer so cheers to you i don't have a really strong plan for today um i do want to read some random numbers i know that unoriginal pun who woke up apparently at 5 30 on a sunday it's still saturday where i am you are coming to me from the future that's very exciting to me has not received their random number yet so i will have to provide an original pun with a random number uh and then i have a lot of news coding train breaking news from the coding trade news desk oh no no no no not that kind of news although that was a lot of news a lot of news my breaking news is there's a new version of ml5js kind of a little bit of a soft release i can't remember if the medium post went up yet or not but um 0.6.0 is there some new stuff in ml5.js i want to take a look at that today i have been working on a new set of video tutorials uh related to convolutional neural networks in ml5.js and maybe i'll look at some of the examples i've been working on for those everything's taking me a really long time these days so apologies for not a lot of new sequence tutorial content that's come out um but there are three how to make your own discord bot videos just waiting they're actually on the channel you can find them right now but i have to like flip a couple switches turn a couple keys press a few more buttons and they'll be available for you to watch they're right now sitting at members only i'm still finishing up the captions for one of them and a few minor details so those will be happening uh i don't know i might just release one of them right after i finish live streaming which will be at around 5 30 p.m today i'm trying to speak slowly and calmly today i was a little bit too crazy i think last week on halloween to be frank so maybe today i'll be a little a little more of the usual regular everyday coding train choo choo ah the other thing's on my mind i have been working with runway ml um and trying to uh and creating a new template on glitch for you to use hosted machine learning models with runway ml as well as hide your api keys in a emv file using glitch so much stuff that's something that i've been sort of putting together i would like to show you that i hope someone's keeping track of this list because i'm not just making it up as i go i think what i'm actually going to start with is i need to update the http requests library for processing that's gonna possibly be the most one of the more boring things i've ever done in the live stream uh you could turn it off now come back a few hours i won't still be here but i'll probably still be trying to figure out how ant works again an eclipse so that i've got to work on and so i started ml5 processing and community contributions by the last message in the discord is from bruno it just says the lights look great and every time i look over i see that message the lights look great and i think ah the lights look great i feel like maybe i turn them up too bright are they too bright do i need to make them warmer cooler i don't know i don't know i don't know all right um what is going on now let me move over to my fancy laptop computer machine thank you again to brilliant as the sponsor of today's live stream look look at the key i feel like with these new lights the green screen key is like well it's not flawless oh thank you simon the live poll that's actually very high primarily up on my list something i don't know if you can hear it when my children start to get loud can you hear them they're downstairs i can hear them very clearly but i don't think it makes its way into this microphone computec is asking about discord bot with discord.js let's just have a looksee here my computer's not working how do i open up a web browser there's a web browser uh let me move over here um we move this here so we see our nice masked sun i'm gonna go to thecodingtrain.com brand new on the coding train whoa ah well first of all no that's not brand new breaking news here on the coding train news desk i've got something i know there's nothing in my ear i i'm pressing there is there's this in my ear but no no i don't have a producer can't do math check the map producer talking to me news stuff just me just me here uh more no learning discord bot so the first two are actually right here and one of the things i'm excited to share with you is this new uh thumbnail design there is a new coding trained character choo choo the bot there's a little bit of a problem with the choo choo bot name which is there's actually on twitter there is a wonderful uh twitter bot called choo choo bot already uh which um tweets uh just little uh random uh emoji train themes i'm just the only thing that i'm sad about this because it's like the greatest thing ever is that i didn't make it myself so maybe i shouldn't be using the choo choo bot name but certainly on twitter this is choo choo bot but my discord bot is choo choo bot so again i will maybe flip the switch to these after the live stream today to make them public but um if you are a member they're available and they're coming and the third one should be you know tomorrow monday tuesday the third one we're actually start getting and writing code that will be available okay um now let's begin let's begin with our ceremonial reading of the random numbers find my book unoriginal pun it's time it's time to find you a random number oh this is a really interesting one it's where my eye was drawn to immediately it's on page 97 it is row 4815 column column seven and it is the random number three thousand four hundred all right that is unoriginal puns new random number now let me find where i last left off in our book story time here on the coding train um i believe it is here it was halloween oh it was last week exactly seven years ago on october 31 2020 row 12 column 15. that's right i'm just still here on the first page just on the first page of this book this whole book i don't know i'm not gonna am i ever gonna get to the second page obviously not if i keep talking like this row twelve column five seventy thousand seventy eight eighteen thousand four hundred and seventy five forty thousand six hundred and ten sixty eight thousand seven hundred and eleven seventy seven thousand eight hundred and seventeen eighty eight thousand six hundred and eighty five forty thousand two hundred eighty six thousand five hundred and seven fifty eight thousand four hundred and one thirty six thousand seven hundred and sixty six 67 951 90 364. 74 493 nine thousand six hundred and nine eleven thousand and sixty two ninety nine thousand five hundred and ninety four sixty seven thousand 348. just in case you thought that this was something that you might be watching with any actual useful content just wanted to make it clear this is the vibe okay it's a mood that's that's what that's what people say these days the kids that's they are called what was the last number i read 99 817 no no no no no wait where was i wrote 12 column five no i think i got to 67 348 so i think i'm on row 14 column two row 14 column 2. uh next random number row 14 column 2. so in case you're wondering what is this over here this is the coding train discord it is where the community comes together to chat with each other about all sorts of things um and i encourage you to join you can actually join by going to thecodingtrain.com discord or i just press the button and the uh a direct link to the uh discord invite should show up in the chat as well so please come on and join the water is warm and fuzzy there are random numbers to be had there is code to explore it is what it is all right now let's look at some community contributions one of the things that the coding train discord bot created by this stream chat to stream chatbot thing is i could say exclamation point wheel and it will take me to the uh community the wheel of community contributions which we will now do on the first segment of the coding train here live i will take a look through let me refresh this page uh i will take a look through this wheel of community contributions and i will spin that wheel like this and wherever it lands we'll take a look it's something that somebody made from the coding train it's usually by david snyder it has been submitted to the coding terrain website uh for every video and challenge and example there's a place where you can make your own version of it and submit it this one is called amplitude frequency phase and i shall uh click on it and view it and this one is uh ah based off the fourier series coding challenge and it is contributed by abdul halig abdul thank you for participating in this thing that we do where we like to try to be creative and make stuff with our code and share it with each other um and i'm so excited that yours was picked just now for me to get to look at experience so i am going to click on that and go over it looks like it was made in the whoa oh my goodness this is really cool this is awesome all right so this looks like it is the fourier a fourier series that is approximating a square wave um this is covered you know extensively in the particular video that i made on the subject but it looks like what abdul has added is an ability to alter the visualization based on a set of parameters and properties so i i'm gonna have to sort of speculate and wonder like what is this even let me minimize uh discord here it is kind of in the way um so this must be one of these must be period or frequency or offset or something like that i don't know what the zero is and then there's some like sliders here one thing that i can kind of make sense of is square versus soft tooth versus phased square so let's just look at that here's a approximation of a sawtooth wave uh which looks more like this diagonal pattern coming up and going down oh i loved how it just kind of like stopped there for a moment why why why must i get notifications on my wrist while i'm live streaming all right that's a sawtooth wave let's look at the phased square wave what's a phase square wave versus a square wave it looks like the top and bottom sort of peaks and valleys of the wave have its own kind of variable oscillation to them let's go back to square and see if we can understand what these sliders do so this is um ah this must be the number of sort of iterations uh that uh that are used to approximate the wave so we can see it is much more square let's move this back down to like a sort of middle point um now let me take a look at what this slider might do zooming in and out it looks like or no just increasing the amplitude it's not zooming it's uh it's i think it's just altering the amplitude i'm not sure why i'm yeah because as the amplitude grows the radius of this first what are these called epicycles circular loops rotational patterns whatever the word might be i need more camera space for my arms i'm really in this tiny little box here i want to be able to gesture further up but i can't someday i'll i'll figure that out uh my other setup where i record the tutorials i have so much more green screen space to work with than here in my attic um now so that's cool to see let's put this on let's see what this one is and this is the um well certainly the period or the frequency of the wave the period being i always get this wrong the period is the amount of time it takes for one full cycle of the wave and the frequency is the number of cycles of the wave through one unit of time so they're in there the frequency is the inverse of the period um this is wonderful thank you for this excellent work i love to this is what i really like to one of the things i really like to see with my coding challenges is i'm usually like sort of rushing to just get something working up on the screen and i'm hard coding in various parameters and variables and thinking about how you might thoughtfully create an interface to alter the different parameters of a system really allow other people to explore the algorithm the generative process more deeply and so i think this is a really excellent example of that i might suggest if i may be so bold here is the uh moment of critique the constructive positive the compliment sandwich if you will because i think this is wonderful and i'm just gonna say it's wonderful again in a moment and here's what i might suggest abdul is that for me looking at this um i need a little bit more hand holding so i would love some labels to know what these various sliders do uh something that could be an interesting thing to think about are there like are there some presets that i that are sort of known presets that would allow me to sort of quickly see how different parameters might uh lead to specific kinds of results um but this is uh wonderful i i really love it all right so thank you abdul a big ring the bell for you and we will move on to look at another community contribution we are spinning that wheel and we are landing on chin scratch emoji editable ah editable this whole time i'm looking at that thinking what does it mean for the game of life to be edible this is gonna take me a minute the animals don't need the game of life don't eat me game of life no no editable i think i have a sense of what that means let's take a look at the editable editable game of life by uh kobe uh kobe a frequent contributor uh and help maintainer manager person of the coding trained discord created this editable game of life and i'm also noting in the chat here that uh k weekman pointed out that it is nanowrimo that is relevant for coding terrain i knew that and i sort of forgot about that i would love to touch on that or talk about that um in a little bit okay yes yes yes by the way now you know what you have to do this weekend program your own edible game of life maybe oh you could wouldn't it be nice if i ever have another birthday which presumably i will i want a game of life cake it just has like a game of life pattern so if i don't really like cake maybe you could make me a nice like sort of vegan carrot cake not too much sugar high in you know you use some whole wheat flour maybe it's kind of my speed now back to the game of life again uh editable game of life let's take a look at this so i'm going to assume here that what the idea of it being editable it's kind of like when i have the metaballs coding challenge that i just couldn't stop seeing it as meatballs maybe i have like i ate a very large meal at like 2 30 which is one of the reasons why i had to push this back because i hadn't eaten all day so i'm not hungry i'm sleepy i'm very sleepy and i'm surprised how many words are able to come out of my mouth in sequence based on how sleepy i am um but let's click around and let's edit this game of life so now what i'm wondering is am i not seeing ah okay let's shrink it here so what i was looking for is when is it going to activate so i can create my own pattern by clicking on these and what does this slider do maybe that's like a speed once i play it but it's not actually going from generation to generation so maybe the game of life is unfamiliar to you first of all um the game of life was invented by john conway who passed away um this year um from complications with the coronavirus which is um very sad uh john conway i think he was i don't know if he it was had reached 90 years old but he was i believe in his 80s very well known mathematician who pioneered a lot of things famously hated maybe that's not the right words to use but famously sort of um was maybe frustrated with people's interpretations of the game of life might be the right way to characterize it uh maybe some of you could provide some resources or writings about uh his thoughts on the game of life in the chat i'm i'm uh um i don't wanna i don't wanna uh mischaracterize his actual opinion on it but it is a system that i really fell in love with as one of the first generative systems that i learned about it is a grid of cells every cell has a state on or off as visualized by black or white and the next state is a function of its neighboring states um so let's see what happens with this particular configuration i'm going to hit play and i'm guessing that this is the speed because if i ramp this up it's going to go faster now this does not look like the game of life to me this distinct i don't know if kobe or saint plays 82 simon said he died at the age of 82. um this does not at all look like what the game of life looks like to me it is i wonder if this is also a variation on the algorithm itself um so i would i don't uh kobe is often i know kobe is on a different time zone so i wouldn't be surprised i don't i don't know who any of you are who are watching this right now at 5 30 a.m or 3 a.m but please make sure you're taking selfcare getting some rest i will live stream with other times in the future mostly i'm just wasting time here reading random numbers so you're not missing anything but um if kobe does show up or if anybody knows uh further context this looks quite different which is one of the things to ring the bell about one of the reasons why i love systems like the game of life and teaching about those systems is not because well reproducing the game of life as its original rules is a moment of wonder and happiness that can be for you um but um what might might find even more thrilling is to invent your own game of life so to speak so what kind of rules can you develop uh create makeup um and i encourage you to do so and i'm getting uh some breaking news in my ear here uh this was a sketch created in a voice chat um yeah so i think this that's what simon was telling me there was a voice chat where this sketch was created okay how about one more it's four o'clock everybody feeling good about one more community contribution because i am here because of you the coding trade community you keep me going you and sanka is that still a thing can you get sanka i like to drink beverages with caffeine in them when i'm very tired and haven't slept all week because one week sometimes lasts a month or a year and that's how this week has been and how the last several months have been the last year has been the last several years have been we're doing another community contribution uh how do i get out of this close whoa and we're gonna spin this wheel by the way in this room is an actual drum kit my son plays the drums he's been playing on an electronic drum kit for the longest time and a friend was moving and giving away their drum kit so now we have a drum kit i do not play the drums but if i could get it set up over here i could try to do my own drum roll all right where do we land troll sweeper now i'm pretty sure that these have been vetted one of the reasons why i can use this wheel is because of the vetting process the community contributions they actually went through two processes one is they were merged as a pull request into the coding train so there was a process of checking them then and then actually these are separately being pulled from a spreadsheet although fun planet if that's the right uh viewer name created this api to all the challenges and so if you are interested in contributing and working on this it is a project that is a community driven and lead project to create this wheel of contributions but let's take a look at troll sweeper no trolls were harmed i assume in the creation of the troll sweeper this was made by klaus klaus class class if you're in the if you're watching today or if anybody happens to know class or know that name how to pronounce it correctly please let me know gil and the original challenge is minesweeper so minesweeper is a game much like the game of life that operates on a grid uh cells can have um i think i made it b sweeper because you know i'm a kind of nonviolent pacifist kind of person and i didn't want to sort of think about bombs blowing up on a grid so i called it b sweeper i think but the original game is about mines and you're trying to find the mines or avoid the mines etcetera etcetera let's take a look at troll sweeper and use shift plus mouse click to flag a troll r to restart okay let's see if i can play and win this game there are 12 of them somewhere okay so i can do shift mouse click to flag one there oh this is just this is flag sweeper there's definitely one there right there's one there and there can't be one here then and there can't be one here then and then there can't be one here here can't be one here or here there has to be one here i know how to play this game this is very scary what if i get it wrong and now we see the trolls i did i did it on purpose i don't know if you noticed i could play again this is fun actually i really like about this um is that sort of moment of surprise when the trolls all appear i think that one of the things i i often wonder about creative coding interactive systems and it might sound corny to say this but you i would suspect that most of you had the experience of watching a film or listening to a piece of music where you had you know really strong feelings whether fear or love or sadness um and can you create those kinds of feelings from interactive systems and i would say here a little shock surprise little moment there when i saw those trolls appear so great work um you know i i would be interesting to think about i mean this is a sort of tried and true game but are there other kinds of variations about how the grid is organized what kind of multiple kinds of characters there could be that you want to find or don't want to find what other kinds of interactions might you consider beyond just mouse clicks could you build this as a physical device i think a lot of possibilities of things you could think about with projects like this okay now i think that's good for our community contributions today i am a happy boy i don't know this song from wherever i download this royalty few music it's called happy boy theme so i'm gonna move on and i think i think i've got to take a look at the live poll because um i don't want to let that project just linger and go nowhere and once we have it really working i think it'll be a very exciting thing to use on the coding train where i can very quickly put up a live poll and have people interact with it and sort of see results live on the screen so let's go take a look at that so for the next little bit i will be taking a look at your issues and pull requests related to the live poll application this is definitely a maintenance day on the coding train i don't particularly want to uh start anything new or look at anything uh new um and mostly i just want to like kind of keep some things up to date and work on a few things that i'm a little bit behind on um so let's see here there are 13 pull requests 13. how many get through 13 pull requests okay let's take a look we'll go in reverse time order and uh take a look here at this pull request from drc let's actually run the live poll just so i can sort of see where it is so what is the live poll application the idea of the live poll is to create a web application where i can quickly spin up a question which has multiple answers people can answer them in real time and using a view of that poll and an overlay in open broadcast studio i'll be able to see the results in real time um as an overlay onto my camera feed here and i'm sure this already exists and i could just use some software to do it but we're trying i'm trying to make my own coding train i'm you know when i say i am trying to help facilitate a coding train one being made um so i'm pretty sure that i have this on the desktop still uh here let's go to the main branch let's just kind of like grab whatever was there from last time uh let's open it up with visual studio code and see what i've got going here and um let's run it let's go to port 3000 and see there we go so this is the poll uh it is both it needs a lot of work um it is both the um the results of the poll and the interface for voting all in one so presumably if i click a and hit vote many times oh my goodness there's already been so so many votes and now i'm gonna go in this i'm gonna freak out i'm going to database db and i forget that i'm using this crazy database thing that doesn't delete the old records okay well i don't know about you but i'm feeling very stressed out right now so that's the idea let's go take a look at what sort of uh pull requests we've got going on here um this is from october 4th wow over a month ago apologies to drc um and thank you um let's take a look here and by the way the um de pam sen i believe is the github user who created the coding train um api so um i figured i would improve on the rest endpoints to use destructuring for the request parameters and update the database call to increment on update rather than searching and updating so this all sounds like a good idea and there's some discussion here how am i really this is hard to do live um okay i really like the new database calls but there are some other changes oh i wrote this 28 days ago resolve the conflicts okay this is how i review pull requests on the coding trade scan over it the button is green which means i can merge it do you hear the haunt the horns honking horns honking all day long cheering loudly in brooklyn is wonderful um so i'm going to click uh merge pull requests um here yeah that's this got sidetracked um this is how i like to do things i don't necessarily recommend this is how you maintain your open source projects it works for me merge pull request and let's just make sure um things work still i will grab the new uh uh the changes oh what i have changes why do i have changes something sad happened i don't i feel like my changes are meaningless i'm going to stash oh i was supposed to i could have squashed it yeah well let's let's go to squash a different one i always like to squash my pull requests and it's very important to not hold any grudges to to be kind and squash those pull requests okay get pull origin mean okay i've got those changes in now let's run it again uh refresh the page looks the same could i clear the database totally i won't do that yet let's keep going through the progress so i think that if i recall correctly um that was a pull request that just cleaned up the code a little bit and used object destructuring which is a way of setting varia or taking an object apart and putting it into individual variables which is very convenient to do in javascript moving along the twitter library is a thing that i need to work on too uh pull requests we're down to 12. okay so now we're going to go back to pull requests and let's go to add a simple oh right now i remember we discussed this so i think this i'm going to hold off on i think i would like to try a different database for this project and so maybe i will let this happen in parallel i'm a little bit afraid to merge this in right now because i'm not super familiar with sqlite and we will we will come back to that one so let's go to pull request number 10 refactor to use a post request oh this is from simon you can create an interface but for now you can use a piece of software called insomnia to make post requests so this also i think is a nice a wonderful um excellent point to raise and discuss that uh i could use this sort of voting with a post request instead of a get request i think i might like to leave it as a get request right now i tend to use those when there is not sort of information that needs to be hidden that's being passed through the request and if the information is coming in in very very small bitesized chunks so the id and the choice are i think can be sort of easily passed through the route i am open to hearing other points of view thank you simon for this i think um let's hold off on this one for right now and keep things simple with a get request so thank you and let's write a little note here um and um i always use my most used emoji of course is the sparkle heart because it's how i feel about all of you who are submitting pull requests and um there we go so now oh we got through another one i don't think i can ring the bell unless i merge it some small fixes um let's see oh there's some conflicts let's take a look at it first so one thing i might suggest um const 219 i haven't done my work here which is to set up the repository with a pull request template which would guide you through the kinds of things that i'm expecting to see in the description so i apologize that's my uh sort of failing on my end but i would say that a good practice is when you submit a pull request if you can write a little bit even introduce yourself um in the description of the pull request that's always helpful for the maintainer of an open source repo let's go look at files changed um oh editor config oh i love this i don't know what it is but i'm desperate to learn how this kind of stuff works because i think you can create these config files that basically control how your code editor works on a project by project basis so i'll keep that adding um dot env to get ignore that makes sense i don't have anything yet that i need to store in env but certainly if i did i would want to add that um and then requiring the env package i'm good with that uh name lowercase is supposed to be lowercase i'll take that these all look fine with me let's see what our merge conflicts are i have my merge conflict theme song which i don't really have but all right everybody it's time just like i like to squash those pull requests i like to resolve all my conflicts oh package.lock this i don't know what to do pause hold timeout uh oh po post i'm being told i'm being told that my point of view on post get and post is is not um the conventional wisdom uh post makes more semantic sense here because it's for sending data i understand i agree i'm probably i'm usually wrong in these cases i i optimize for readability and educational purposes and i think a get is much easier to work with on the client side uh than a post from whatever clients might ultimately want to connect to this live poll so for example let's say we wanted to build a raspberry pi an arduino with buttons to vote um by able to submit our vote through a get request we might make that a little bit easier uh to sort of manage and deal with i might be wrong still okay um i don't know what to do about this uh merge conflict in the package um i know i never understand what packaged lock is it has something to do with like versions and all that and dependencies i think if i just take this out and do this and do this and then that looks right now right did i fix it i mean is there something else i need to oh i think i did that right and i'm being told i'm being told a post is much easier so maybe my thinking is very flawed there i've always thought this way about teaching and in sort of the sort of creative coding rapid prototyping context um who knows if i got that package.lock right i understand i underst i understand what i'm doing i take all the risks and responsibility i'm here to merge to resolve my conflicts and squash and merge so what does squash and merge do if you have not heard of that before so first of all um the the original button is was just this merge pull request what that is doing is it's taking the changes from all of the various commits and here you can see there are one two three four commits and adding them to the history of the project and sometimes within open source projects it's advisable to take even if a given pull request has many different separate commits in them it can be uh useful to squash all of those into one commit so the project's actual history then has the all the change of the pull request within one um one commit and it it you don't actually lose you can still have multiple authors and differentiate these in in various ways it's a very sophisticated system but i do think that kind of does make sense i'll switch to squash and merge don't ask me to explain rebase and merge i'm not prepared for that today maybe another week squash and merge let's do that and now let's uh grab that so by the way the proper way for me to do this would be for me to pull that branch and test the branch locally and then merge or to actually have tests but for me i'm just sort of playfully enjoying this and um see and kind of just enjoying merging them and pulling them and we'll fix it somebody will fix it later this is all for our own i was going to say edification that's a callback um let's run it again oh no okay npm install so there was a new package.env my microphone is really i'm afraid to move the microphone and this is really insane what just happened because i don't know if you can see the light flashing you can see my arm because i just got a very very ridiculously generous super chat i it kind of makes me a little uncomfortable if i'm being perfectly honest uh thank you alexander sapphire i'll read your message uh four years ago i watched your first ever coding challenge video four years later i'm a software engineer consultant and stem evangelist who specializes in web technologies i owe you my career that's that that's got to be a little bit strong but i appreciate it for introducing me to js thank you for everything you do and a lot of heart emojis which of course by the way these kind of messages i uh really uh they do mean a lot to me to get them uh i i love to receive them uh without there's no need to provide a super chat or any kind of donation along with them you can always send them to daniel at thecodingtrain.com i do it takes me a long time to get to that email inbox but i do read all of the messages that come to there eventually you know within a few months my other email boxes are no better but um so please uh thank you for that message and the chat um i will um you have won you don't win anything i mean you've won your whoa camera oh oh no so i got a confession to make here and i apologize for this i installed my two elgato key lights hold on a second here we're gonna this is gonna be fun uh let me go to this uh and now i am just give me a second here everybody this is going to be worth it microphone's still going right okay whoops uh wrong camera here we go um so um this is me uh one of the one of the things that i love is oh you don't see that is this new uh way of just wirelessly getting a feed from my camera um into the live stream and you can see here that's one of the key lights that's the other key life i'll show you my like incredibly messy attic full of toys and various things and the sort of console that i'm looking at and laptop so here i am again um the camera that i use which is this camera here um i keep it plugged in but i thought i got to plug in these new lights i only have two plugs it's fully charged it'll last through a live stream i don't know whether it went to sleep like my cameras used to do all the time on the coding train if you were back from those days welcome again but um or if it actually the battery died so i am now uh walking around um i'm gonna take a look here and see whether it went to sleep or whether the battery actually died looks like it just went to sleep so i think unfortunately no battery exhausted look at that um oh it said uh let's see if we so it said by the way so this is my setup you can see now with a one light um and another light little behind the scenes here uh this is the camera view and battery exhausted so i will i think for the time being unplug one of my key lights to plug the camera back in i need another extension cord oh there's my knee hello everyone i think you're still seeing you probably can't barely hear me because the mic isn't coming through my phone far away now the camera is plugged back in um and it's quite a bit darker in here i probably should figure out how to oh i got dizzy stood up too fast um it should come it still says battery exhausted but it's plugged in now so you would think it's going to come back i guess what i'll do is it it is charging we can see there that it is charging that light's on so i think i'll turn it off and i will just give it um a few minutes um is it time for my break yet probably not this is kind of fun to stream this way i can just move this oops move this over here uh and i'll just put this here there we go all right while it's charging this is uh what was i doing the live poll i was thinking alexander i was going to give alexander a random number but you know what i wanted to say is that i do get messages like this you know oh thank you i got a job because of you or some things along those kind of lines and i i would like to say i appreciate that but i would say to all of you look into yourself you got that job for yourself you found that passion for yourself i'm thrilled to play whatever small tiny role in providing a little help or inspiration along the way but um i you know um really that all of the wonder of expression and creativity with code and the things that you are doing all of that is is comes comes from you and i i i love that you choose to share it with me and that i get to like be a small part of it so thank you okay um i hope that camera goes back on soon what was i doing i installed wait okay random number for alexander um the random number uh we have the book right here uh um i think for a super chat we'll go to the table of gaussian deviates which is uh 1.498 we'll take uh where's that camera right there that's that'll be your camera all right moving along i assume that the camera i'm gonna be able to turn it back on any second how long could it possibly take let's go back to the browser and i merged that another pull request uh refactor oh no we already make the emojis make more sense oh oh how could the emojis make any more sense that they already do they're all trains these make tremendous sense okay let's see uh what do we got here instead of constantly scaling so that the winning option is full of emojis has each emoji represent one vote then after it goes off the screen have each emoji represent five votes 25 votes i like this i like this idea this is very exciting this sounds like a difficult math problem and uh and okay let's see here so it looks like maybe there's some merge conflicts so let's take a look at that i'm going to resolve our merge conflicts um this looks like that'll be fine to keep the max emojis there now as a new thing um and then anything else the number of emojis is is w not being used anymore so is that what was being replaced from simon w was previously used to maybe um in some sort of rendering of the emojis but let's so let's do that let's take this out i think and so num emoji ah i see so this is the process of um figuring out what's 4 30. uh figuring out um what the divisor is based off of how many emojis how many votes there have been overall got it thank you simon this is wonderful so let's uh mark this as resolved commit this merge and then we shall um squash we we've we've resolved our conflicts we're squatching our pull requests everything is so happy today confirm squash and merge okay there we go oh i have something i wanted to uh highlight and mention um today that i that i have to remember to do okay uh but i should do that right now before i forget um all right emerge another polar crest let's try to move more quickly here add a dev script to run nodemon that sounds awesome um uh oh package.lock you are the bane of my existence um let's add uh nodemon should be fine i don't know what i just did but okay whatever well this is bad this is bad no this is bad okay wait wait wait wait wait wait i don't know i think this is right i resolve no remove all conflicts this doesn't i i haven't had this experience before where package.lock gets all wonky can i just delete it and like ignore it and uh i don't want it shouldn't be in git ignore but can't it like work itself out in a different way somebody explained what package.lock was to me before um okay so i think this is good scroll back up i think the camera's gotta have gotten enough juice now by now right so let me go see if the camera has come turning it on it is not telling me the battery is exhausted so it is telling me that the battery is dead but it is staying on and it is plugged in so hopefully it won't uh wow it really lasted so so little okay so i can oh boy i really need that other light huh oh this is so sad this is so all of this expensive hightech equipment i have here and i can't manage to find three plugs i guess i i do have an extension cord that might just be what i need to do because i have many more plugs in this room um please hold let me get that other light plugged in i need to mute myself okay i'm just i'm gonna get my extension cord out i'm running here plugging in extension cord and hopefully i'm not going to unplug something and shut this whole thing down by accident it's plugged in this is like a 40 foot extension cord to go about two and a half feet that i need but now everything's plugged in both of my lights and i return to a brightly lit space okay all right thanks for bearing with me here everybody uh we've got nodemon now um i should read this discussion ah oh so one of the interesting things is um i typically um just install nodemon not as a dev develop dependency but as a global module so it's just like a command i can always run i don't know what the sort of proper um you know sort of socalled proper technique is but let's see what this does so let's squash and merge this one uh get pull origin main oh i can do npm install and let it sort out the files yeah that's what i thought but it's still like um why is it showing up in the uh as a conflict in the pull request like i still have to deal with it there um so let's do npm install now um and let's just see npm run dev yeah so it's running nodemon so by the way i should probably get used to doing this so typically the way that i tend to work is just to like execute a particular javascript file by saying node index.js but in a project's package.json um under main uh it's listed as index.js and these are various scripts that can be run so start is an alias essentially to node index.js and dev is an alias to nodemon index.js in the ml5 library for example there's npn build and nbm run build nbn run start npm run serve like there's all these different things to like build the website to build the library to to there's like a laundry list of things you can run so i should probably get in the habit of demonstrating that and saying npm run start so um but the the nice thing about nodemon is um nodemon or node monitor listens to the files listens like keeps keeps its eye doesn't have any ears or eyes but it tracks the files and if any changes are made it will restart the server all right um let's see here um sorry i know that i know i know that this might not be the most exciting live stream ever but this is really useful stuff for me to do um updated ui um this looks good although i love oh i like this as a trained car now i think i'm gonna start getting into the place where um i can't resolve the merge conflicts anymore because so i love this idea um and i'm sorry that so one thing i want to apologize to people if you were hoping that these pull requests would be part of hacktoberfest i kind of forgot about that and now it is november so if anybody were really had their heart set on this being a hacktoberfest uh accepted pull request and it's like it's i'm entirely responsible for you not getting your tree planted or tshirt let me know maybe i can send you a sticker or something um but um let me just write here apologies i think i need to move a little more quickly here through some of the ones that i can actually implement um i love this and would like what i think what i should be doing is ones that i've reviewed and like the idea of if those get updated after the live stream i shouldn't wait till the next time i'm looking at a live stream to merge it it should just go in more quickly so i hope please let us know sparkle and so let's do that thank you so much for everyone who's contributed um let's move on to um improved poll structure a post for creating a new poll question string option string votes number okay change votes poll idea route to poll poll idea to avoid confusion with vote make necessary changes to work with arrays this all seems really really useful and i really do want to be able to create new polls to test cleardatabase.bdb uncomment create new poll function invocation commented back i really want to merge this so can i resolve these conflicts let's see here um this seems kind of uh silly it's just like silly formatting that got conflicted then this is um the poll id oh merch conflicts are so hard i think maybe maybe this wasn't the best idea for how to sort of like manage and maintain this project i also realized the reason it's getting darker in here and i'm getting more shadowing is the sun is going down and i was really benefiting from the sun shining through the window that's over there i guess i could point this light more this direction or make it a little bit brighter just wanna see if i turn it a little bit if that helps the keying maybe a little bit um all right now oh this is going to be hard so this was the new thing oh oh so so hard can i merge this this is so hard this is so hard okay i want to add this yes so this changed the name from pull pull id to vote oh okay okay okay that makes sense and this just had the object destructuring stuff oh no what what oh right okay i see i think if i'm right that this is the new stuff i want to keep and then i don't need this anymore okay so that's that this is the new poll great so i think we're good and i just need to figure out what the changes are so this is also really um using a new a different branch name would be super helpful here because then i could tell uh if you're like making your pull requests from your own main branch then it's hard for me to see the different branches because they're both called main but i think this is the more recent object destructuring so that can that can be kept in lieu of these two lines and then this if no poll would return error if the choice it's less than the length return and then increase i think this is all good i think it was just that okay i think we're good here so this is going to be exciting to try mark is resolved oh no no oh there's also sketch.js which just has now i think the idea is that it was changed to oh my god oh this is hard okay i think i know what's going on here i think that um de palm sen changed it to pole and simon added max emojis so i want to get rid of votes and keep pull but i want to keep the max emojis and then down here i want simon's new loop here which is replaces this no wait this finds the max votes then this is simon's loop oh my god oh no no no oh boy yes cause oh this is hard i need simon's algorithm to make its way back up here okay i got it now so this is the new way of doing it with poll options and simon let's try to pull simon's code up so let's get max votes and the divisor sorted out that that would replace this and instead of choice of choices the new way of doing it is poll dot votes i this is really insane uh and that's that and then this is fine okay but i need max uh where does max emojis that was already defined up here perfect okay so that's good um that's fixed and now this is i equals zero i is less than poll.options.length and then variables breakdown is this i is index before it was choice which was an alphabet so this should be poll.votes dot votes index i okay 10 and then i think that's right that's the only thing that changes with simon's new algorithm all right we're going to find out we might have to do some more fixing and the white space is all messed up this is going to require some work but this is exciting we're making serious progress here people once again the button is green it means i can click it i'm gonna take a break in a minute and kind of move on from this project uh squash and merge the button is green it means i can push it yeah i'm gonna fix whatever indentation bracket stuff uh now here on my own um so let's go take a look at uh here and i think if i do save whoa right so um whoops ah no ah i want to format the document wait what happened to my pritier uh oh oh no so something is wrong right okay so let's take a look at this clear background pull options oops for loop oh pull the number of votes pull options the actual option okay what's going on here oh let's see am i running the server okay sketch.js line 70 unexpected so i have an error on line 70. do i have an extra aha okay i think it format i might have taken out format on save uh format oh no it is format on safe who knows what's going on all right hopefully now we're good okay uh huh what's happening on the server oh id is not defined index.js 30 line 11. oh i've really i've really done a horrible thing here 30 line uh okay get poll poll id constant id equals await database update what yeah profit mesh is writing ideally after each pull request merge everyone else who raised a pull request needs to update their local copy and resolve the merge conflict on their end and then update their pull crest resolve code yeah i think maybe this methodology is not gonna is not working out for me to try to resolve these conflicts especially when i am not used to reading code that is now written with some of the styles that have that are here but i don't know if somebody um um i don't know if somebody can can catch what i missed this is the this is let's look at this route the idea of this route is we are getting everything from a pole so and what i think let me go back and look at the project uh history for a second because i think the change here um and let's look at the history let's look at the um i think this is the change that i have now messed up so let's look at what was changed here um the id the idea is that this is changed to this oh oh my god oh i'm gonna have to put this aside i'm gonna have to call on the community to save me because i this this is very clear to me what happened in this change um i'm pull this is like pulling out ah i didn't know you could do object destructuring like this pole id id equals request params look at that so this is like i d i d huh pole id id this is the same as what i did here you're getting the id as the poll idea id now i'm getting the id as the poll id so i should be getting this id as the poll id my lights are blinking does that mean that this is supposed to be this and that was my mistake oh wait should you snowden cannot access id before initialization was that the await database update i think i know how to fix this javascript is so crazy i do know how to fix this which is that i can do i don't even understand like where is it getting this stuff from where is it getting choice i i really messed this up i deleted complete functions i really ruined it okay yeah i lost like a whole let's go look at i think what i need to do is look at um this branch here i need to look at the um what was the one that i what i was this one okay let's look at this um let's go back and look at um let's look at dpawn mensan's uh branch so what did what was changed here this is without my messing it up under pull pull id oh maybe maybe this pull request actually had a mistake in it because it looks like uh this looks like what it what i have a reverb do we need a code style guide yeah all right everyone uh it's time to read some brands things have gone awry i'm gonna look at this later i was hoping to get like a nice little win here to like at least have this be able to create a new poll which i'm very excited to have this feature but i uh when your philosophy on on pull request is to just if the button is green to press the button i might need to uh adjust uh adjust my way of doing this also why i sometimes i like to write things even if it's more longwinded without this kind of object destructuring stuff because i find it very hard to read and understand um what's going on but um yeah like if i just go here let's just look at the this is i'm in oh no no no no no no go here no i'm in the wrong place ah what i want to do how come it's not taking me to where i want to go i want to go here there we go and i want to look at what branches there main and i want to look here this is what i want to see right this is this is the way the function is written here it looks the same right oh no error oh no there's air here id is not fine so i think there's a mistake in okay well where was id defined i'm very stubborn as you all know and i i sometimes have a lot of trouble ah oh i see i did everything right but for this new system to work the create new poll function has to be called for there to be an id because that create new poll returns id well now let's go and look at let's look at the instructions that i didn't read uh and then i'm really pulling that putting this aside uh where was it did i did i close it um is this one okay to test clear database dot db uncomment create new poll all right so let's let's follow these instructions database.db i deleted everything from it we're going to then uncomment create new poll function invocation then comment it back after poll is created in sketch.js fix all poll ids okay 9 and 32. interesting so now there's a pull and an id though right because there's a whole new database structure oh there's a whole new database structure so now here line 9 that's the new id which is line 10 and line 32 which i guess here hopefully now oh wait no i have to uncomment it uncomment create new poll run it again ah still id is not defined i think i think there's a mistake database dot update returns an object result of the function is what you're destructuring right right that i sort of understood okay okay so if i really want to solve this which i insist on doing i want to do the following let me let me be stubborn and solve this and then i will take my break um right can't i do this right shouldn't i be able to look at it and see what it's giving me back now um if i do this right i just want to like what's that object that comes out but yeah still there's something here that doesn't there's a thing that doesn't make any sense to me here but i will humor me for a second here yeah it's this like am i supposed to set like oh wait a sec wait a second wait a sec wait a sec yeah no no why oh i know it what got deleted by accident yeah this whole thing yeah hello people this this this was missing where did that that got deleted somewhere right i have to pull the particular id that's the whole point oh this was a disaster choice is not defined there's no choice that's up here oh i'm in the wrong place this these functions got merged oh everything's gone so horrible everything's everything's gone so wrong a pixel i appreciate your messages sometimes i have to like get revert to the rescue okay i'm canceling this so i i um i i've learned my lesson i thought i could do uh something somewhat superhuman that i clearly could not do um i i am going to come back to this i'm gonna move on to some other stuff this was a this was a failure i am sorry i don't know i i can't even speak let's let's take i'm gonna take a break i'm gonna thank the sponsor so i'm gonna have to totally like reorient my entire brain take a deep breath uh anybody who wants to um kind of fix this i'm actually going to um stash all the stuff i just if anybody wants to work on fixing this right now um while i take my break you are welcome to um you can find the horrible disaster that is everything right here in this github repo i will paste it as a link into the discord but i am going to oh this is really rough um i'm going to take a minute here to thank today's sponsor here's the thing coding is really hard and in particular managing web applications that involve databases and frontends and backends is really something that's particularly hard to do especially while you're live streaming which is why most of the content i tend to focus on has to do with algorithms generative art patterns visualizations kind of stuff that i can kind of bite off and chew in in a single chunk and a place where i essentially harvest so many of these ideas is a website called brilliant and brilliant is both an app and a website and has a lot of other aspects to it as well so i'm um going to open something up here so one thing that's really um exciting to me about brilliant so first of all what is brilliant it's a website and app that makes learning accessible and fun their approach is based on problem solving and active learning so everything unlike the disaster that you're watching that is my live stream it's actually a place where instead of watching somebody else do stuff you can go and read and interact and try and try different puzzles and interactive exercises to learn a particular topic algebra programming neural networks and actually new there's a whole lot of new design elements and an entire new uh illustration style called pixp i x and you can see it highlighted in particular in its um a refresh of its um geometry fundamentals course so the geometry fundamentals course is really awesome it's probably the it's the kind of stuff that i should be focusing on the coding train since again i'm really harping on the fact that i just had this total database merge pull request github disaster which i will really think deeply about while i'm after this live stream and come back and try to redeem myself next week but i really encourage you um to check out these uh courses that are available on brilliant another one that i really spent a lot of time with is the neural networks of course highly related to all the stuff that i do with ml5.js and tensorflow.js so if you want to sort of learn more behind the scenes of how neural networks work um and play with different this is showing you sort of visualizing the process of a neural network network uh recognizing a handwritten digit um you can check that out so what i tend to like to do i think i will uh i'm gonna have a little like wind right now is what i like to do uh is go to brilliant.brilliant.org the website i am already logged in and look at um one of its daily challenges i took a peek at this one before i started live streaming and i'm pretty sure i have a sense of how to answer it so um so i feel like i'm going to get a win here which i really need so sometimes my favorite aspect about work doing the puzzles on brilliant is i get them wrong and i learn something but based on all that i was trying to do with that live pull application getting something right is what i really feel i need right now thank you for this sponsor segment is like a therapy session for myself so um this this certainly seems connected to the geometry fundamentals course so if you're interested in this if you like this particular puzzle and challenge looking through the geometry fundamentals course i think would be highly relevant so um what let's read let's read the explanation here first so um some of these segments how can we find a the area of the colored triangle one we are only told the two lengths in the figure so i guess we know the with this this one tick and these two ticks and these two we know those lengths so we should be able to calculate this and then we know the area of the full um well this seems like not too difficult a problem keep reading to see one way to do this well let's read its explanation when we first when we first start when first starting a problem the wishful thinking strategy can help point you in the right direction i know the height of the colored triangle if i only knew the length of the base then i could find the area with the formula a equals onehalf base times height yeah exactly the base of the color drawn is a pair of tick marks so does the hypotenuse that means the two segments of the same length are congruent so now you might think as follows i know the length of one leg of the middle triangle if i knew the length of the other leg then i could use the pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse then i would have the missing leg of the colored triangle right uh oh i see the things that i know are the three and the four i misread this like this is what i'm trying to calculate so i know this three and i know this four i got it i got it i got it so this is going to run through uh show you that this is four uh then um and do some calculations and figure out that this side is 20 times three so one half so i encourage you to check this out i'm gonna do the actual challenge i want to do this one six equilateral triangles all with side length one let me let me let me pull up the chat here because i lost the chat and i don't know if anything's gone off the rails here um what is the total length of the highlighted segments so we have some if these are equilateral triangles and i can do this we've got some serious symmetry going on here right i'm almost certain based on the sort of yeah uh the symmetry here that the length of this is equal to the length of this right that that uh this wishful thinking is true based on the sort of symmetry of the this tiling of equilateral triangles therefore this whoops therefore this plus this is one similarly this plus this is two oh i forgot about this one that's three so we've got three and all i have left is this which is clearly one half so i'm so happy for this challenge i'm really really quite certain that the answer is three and a half i'm gonna i'll leave a a couple seconds here for anybody uh in the uh chat who wants to tell me i'm wrong i see we have a new member in the chat code guppy by the way i have to give code guppy a random number let's submit let's submit this let's feel let's have something that helps us feel a little good today in terms of this live stream there's plenty other things that i wanted to feel good about today i believe all right drum roll please i really hope this is right ah okay i have my one day streak again one of these days you're going to be shocked when you see i have a multiday streak fantastic um feeling a little better all right oh that was wild that look at this animation that is really cool so this is one of the things um that i also love about these brilliant challenges is they really lead to kind of interesting animation ideas and i would certainly encourage you to uh you know one things i like to do is sometimes with one of these challenges is then try to make a p5.js sketch okay um i'm going to take a a short just just literally like a two minute break um just to kind of take a deep breath have a moment away from that live pole debacle that i'm definitely gonna spend some time this weekend cleaning up um and uh i will be back so um it is now intermission um i'll remind you that um if you're interested in brilliant you can sign up for free right now at brilliant.org codingtrain those daily puzzles and lots of other aspects of the site are free um and if you want to unlock all the courses with a premium subscription um you can uh you'll get a 20 discount uh uh the first 200 people at least to go through this uh particular link okay um i'll be back i'm using my microphone and i'll be back in about two minutes do do do all right everybody i am again wow it's really bright i feel like i need to turn the lights down um go to my control center and powder my nose today so i feel like it's just too much um come on control center oh you got to be kidding me settings done well the lights don't seem to show up anymore that's so weird okay nothing is going right for me today sometimes i have these live streams and i feel like this incredible just coming together of ideas and weird code moments and it's beautiful and other times i feel like what was i doing for the last two hours oh my goodness thank you for being here with me um i am going to move on i'm gonna try to come up with something to do here in the next 50 minutes that will be a will have a bit more of a um hopefully outcome that you can take away with you to maybe try something new uh yourself this um weekend so i think what i actually want to do is i really don't understand what's happening today first of all code guppy thank you for joining code guppy i assume you are the code guppy from the wonderful code guppy website are you a different code guppy which is a um service that i have um looked at and i know that you've talked to folks at processing about service is maybe the wrong word but on educational coding websites so anyway thank you i think it is i i think the the sign here that i'm reading from the universe the universe is telling me to read some more random numbers so uh let's go ahead and do that row 14 column two is where i last left off oh a couple hours ago it was a simpler time when i had all this like energy and i was excited to be live streaming and i was reading random numbers and thinking about all the things i was going to create um and thank you k weekman for sharing the code guppy uh website um i think i think i probably have some unanswered um emails from you you have some unanswered i have some unanswered emails from you you have not received answers from me and i apologize for that um i am slowly getting to all the messages that i receive over time but i i really appreciate all that you're doing at codeguppy.com all right oh we're we're giving code guppy a um a random number for your membership oh wait this is a membership welcome code guppy to the cutting train thanks for boarding the coding train a youtube channel where i merge people's pull requests and resolve their conflicts without really bothering to thoughtfully check over what i'm doing i break everything and then i cry and well give out a random number the code guppy's random number is 5778 that is from page 366 uh row 18265 column three all right um okay so um i'm trying to think quickly about what i could do and i think actually i think the the the uh ex the thing that i could do right now that will lead to um the most positive result of me actually showing something on the live stream that people could learn and try on their own is to look at the new release of ml5.js so let's go on over to the ml5.js website learn.ml5js.org and i believe if i go to the ml5 github and go take a look at ml5 library and go under releases you will see as of two days ago version 0.6.0 and if i click here it will show a few of the things that have been added i would say the most significant thing is two new models hand pose and face mesh so hand pose can be used to predict the location of 21 3d landmarks on the palm and fingers of a single hand and face mesh can be used to predict 486 3d landmarks on the human face wow all right um there's a bunch of other things uh that are in that have been updated and fixed in particular related to convolutional neural networks which i'm working on a video series about which will come out sometime in the next few weeks but let's take a look at those um those particular models and i'll do it right in the p5 web editor in fact um i wonder if i just go i think this has been updated if i go to examples.ml5js.org we can look for hand pose and let's click on hand pose webcam ah so i noticed that this is an issue with our build systems for the website and examples are everything and everything one of the things you can do with um with the excuse me for i'm just having trouble finishing my sentences all of a sudden one of the things you can do um with the p5 web editor is you can actually now have sort of named permalinks to your sketch whereas really this sketches url is its id and some of them are like breaking when we update ml5 and upload new examples so i'm not sure how to resolve that but i believe if i do this and i go to hand pose oh it's not there so i think maybe some of the the release process is still in progress and maybe that's why it's not showing up which is all the better for me to now uh figure out how to get it to work myself so let's just go to let's let's get it to work ourselves this will be an excellent uh exploration um i'm in the p5 web editor i've got a basic p5.js sketch going i want to make sure that i import the latest ml5 library which i can do right by copying to clipboard this and i can paste it right in here into um right here into index.html i'm actually going to adjust this and just change it from latest to 0.6.0 i really prefer referring to a specific version because then i really know what version was i using when i wrote this code if it just is latest i won't remember that later and as ml5 updates something else could break so um let's do that then let's come over here into sketch.js and i'm just going to use just the webcam so let's say video equals create capture um uh video when i think i don't put that in quotes i think i just do this create capture video video dot size 320 240 let's do that let's make the canvas 320.240 as well um and um let's not have anything in draw well let's just draw the video right now so let's see what we've got and thank you very much for my open broadcast studio a virtual camera ah now recently i figured out there's a quicker way to fix this if i go to here and i do smanit like you can see how it's like defaulting to the obs virtual camera i think if i click manage it'll take me to this page and i can just switch it to this and then if i go back to here and just re well let's hit save whoops save refresh do i need i don't know if i need to reload it but let's reload it beautiful okay so now i have the webcam showing up now how do i get this new model um and let's go over here and let's look for it over here um under hand pose here it is hand pose so by the way this is bomani mclendon who is one of the lead maintainer of the ml5 website who ported this particular model so i want to get essentially this to work um so we can see here what do i do i give it um i call ml5 hand pose i can optionally give it the video so that the model is sort of tied with the video a set of options and a callback let's let's grab this and go to the web editor i'll make a variable called hand pose i'll say hand pose equals ml5 video options let's just give it an empty object right now we'll look at that later and then model ready let me move this over and then i'll write that callback function model ready console.log hand pose loaded so let's see what happens here if i run this again um maybe it's oh yeah just took a while to load so ml5 behind the scenes is going to a cloud server and retro okay so we've got the model and then presumably the other thing i can do now if i go back to let me close this here there is a predict function where i can give it the input media and get the results there's also an on so i think there's multiple ways of this is one of actually a points of confusion for me in working with the ml5 library um i there's the models sometimes have different ways of working with them you can call predict on a particular like i want to predict the po hand pose on a particular image and if i'm doing the video i might ask for it to predict on this video frame then when i get the results give it the next video frame but i think this is a way of doing it where it will just look at the video over and over again and whenever it finds a new prediction will give me those results so i think this will make sense for me to use this style of working with ml5 oh and that needs to go obviously like right here so basically and i think probably i should do this in a good practice would be to do this in model ready so the idea is let me load the model tie it to the video obviously i might want to configure it with some options which are empty right now and then once the model is ready handle the prediction event and just log the results so let's see what happens when i run this now right and so presumably uh in that object is going to be a lot of stuff about my hand let's try to look at it over here oh no i'm not getting sorry i'm happy no stop why why um okay so what do i let's see if i can um look at one of these you can see this right so this is when it finds a hand it offers me up this object the object has a confidence that it's seeing a hand it offers me a bounding box of the hand so an x and y and an x and y of the top left and bottom right of the hand these numbers seem rather high for my image being sized at 320 by 240 and i'm also not sure why it's negative although maybe it's guessing that the hand is extending past the canvas we'll have to like experiment with that landmarks these are the xy z positions of these particular landmarks on the hand um wow this is really wild annotations i can look at the thumb these are maybe all the sort of parts that are on the thumb wow look at this ring finger middle finger index finger pinky i love my pinky and palm bass fascinating that all this stuff is in there so i suppose what i could do quickly is just iterate over all of the landmarks i'm not sure what to do with the z location right now i could use that to describe maybe the size of a circle i'm also wondering why it doesn't correspond to the um the actual size of my the video image that i've given it um and whether maybe it's using the native video size let's let's investigate this a little bit further um which is to say let's look at the example that i'm ultimately trying to write here video model ready on pose model ready draw key points look through all the predictions go through the landmarks ellipse key point zero one not using the z and keeping it at six forty by four eighty so there might be um i don't know whether this is my mistake or ml5's mistake or a bug or not but to me it looks like it is uh returning the xy positions based on the fact that the video the source image would be uh 640 by 480. so just for argument's sake right now i'm gonna um make the canvas 640 by 480 i'm going to comment this out and actually let's not draw let's see what we get oh whoa the camera went off that's so weird why did that happen again like it's plugged in it's charging i think the issue is i let the battery drain and it just like it can't keep up well we'll see how it does okay um okay so let's see here if i can do something similar so what i want to do is do i'll create uh um i don't know what to call it the um let's call it like the hand talk to the hand people um the hand equals results so i'm just always going to store the results in there and then in draw what did we say was in there when i looked there was something called landmarks um i have one was an object oh there could be multiple hands so let's call it uh hands so let's just say if hands that means that there's at least one our hands dot length is greater than zero let's just do that then let hand equal hands index zero so i'm just going to look at one right now and i want to look at the landmarks i should i should learn how to use object destructuring right is this how i would do it is that object destructuring so i'm pulling out the landmarks property from hand zero and putting it in its own variable and then i can look through every single one and it's an array and i can say uh oh there's gotta be can i do this is that also object destructuring can you do that if it's an array does that work i don't know let's see if that works and then i'm going to say uh phil 255 ellipse xy16 that can't be right right i don't know i never i don't ooh okay cannot read property length of undefined so i guess in in when it starts it has the model hasn't loaded so let's this is maybe a silly way to do it but i'll do this oh my camera went off again i'm sorry about that everybody i'm just gonna i'm gonna let it okay whoa okay first of all it's insane how fast this is that is crazy how fast that is uh wow i'm shocked oh i sh i don't know why i'm deciding only to do one let's say hand of hands this is very weird what i'm doing my variable naming is really leaving a lot to be desired and then uh it's bothering me the way it auto formatted that so i'm just gonna say this no destructuring for me okay let's try is that right let's try running this so what could i do with this i mean okay come on let's see one hand oops one hand i can't see can i how come i can't get two what did i do to not if hands shouldn't i have gotten two if it sees two let's uh well my fan is computer fan is going crazy uh cannot read property length of undefined okay oh stop stop yeah different hands should be different colors for sure but i'm not sure why i'm only seeing one hand one oh maybe i have to set the options for multi or something i mean so what were the um what were the options and i also want to do the 3d stuff uh and i like that there's semantic groupings that i could color different parts of it and this whoops the camera is still sorry that i'm not showing myself i'm gonna let the camera kind of warm itself up a little bit uh so flip horizontal max continuous checks detect confidence score threshold interesting i don't know what if i'm doing something wrong or if it's just not able to get both hands let's try moving my moving a little further back from the camera that sometimes will do the trick here's one hand it's not mirrored so it's like making me crazy i can't figure out which hand is which well i could still do some interesting stuff with just one hand but i was i i'm wondering why it's not detecting two let's look at these options grab this flip horizontal boolean value for if the video should be flipped i actually would like that max continuous checks infinity detection confidence score threshold a threshold for removing multiple likely duplicate detections uh float representing a threshold for deciding whether boxes overlap too much and nonmaximusly okay so i wonder if one of these thresholds would um kind of help like what if i put all these down like if i put detection confidence at zero and i want to actually make this true so if i put the detection confidence at zero it's gonna always think something is a hand like it's finding a hand in everything uh whoa so that was a bad idea let's make it like .25 i don't think it's that the second hand has a low confidence can you join the dots on the hand i absolutely could i have to figure out how to do that so one no uh score threshold if i make those thresholds zero should probably i should do this more methodically wants me to join the dots using a line yeah okay i'm going to give up on this and i'm going to ask bomani and sort of research this um but let's let's uh let's let's see what some folks are asking for which is to sort of draw um draw the draw a line and apologies that i'm not showing my camera right now i am waiting for my camera to get a little charge built up um so what can i do well what order so first thing i want to do is actually i want to look at the z values so what are the z values what happens if i just put in the z right here as the size so i recognize this is not what folks were asking for but i want to get a sense of what happened there options is not defined whoops oh i probably could get away without passing it through but let's just put it back the way i had it so look at this so now closer they're bigger further away this month it's really kind of amazing and this is not a precise way of rendering this with three dimensionality but it is working pretty well that's pretty amazing um it's feeling kind of so let's think about joining the dots so one way i could approach that this is not a great strategy but let's just try it begin shape all right hold on let's do this twice let's just join them all with um let's give this a little bit of alpha let me join them all by setting them each at a vertex location so i'm curious what order are the landmarks in we'll find out now in a moment oh this and let me actually just comment out the circles right now just to see it this way okay so this is the arbitrary order it's kind of amazing actually it's in a sort of logical order that almost has so i can actually create a nice enclosed shape like this pretty interesting right so you can see the it's crunching your head and scratching your head it's crunching your head scrunching your head alright that's pretty interesting um take this out we could also look at does it show me uh yeah we could look at the semantic groupings um so let's look at the annotations this will be pretty interesting i'm going to leave that as is and i am going to take this out and let's say uh let group it let annotations equals hand dot annotations and then whoops and then i should be able to get all the keys so let parts equals annotation oh what do i say object dot keys annotations is that how i get all of the properties of an object i think so and then let part of parts uh let uh i don't know what to call this now uh you know i'll call this position oh no it's in the part it's just an array so let yeah let for let position of part and then draw an ellipse you can do this again and draw an ellipse at x y let's let's take is this right did i do this right so what i'm attempting to do is connect all the landmarks with a line then look at each annotation the thumb the finger except the pinky the piggy finger the ring finger the middle finger etc separately and what did i get wrong here uh on un unexpected token oh i have too many brackets okay oops i think my camera should be working again by the way it's had enough time to charge okay i'm back um what's going on here ellipse was expecting a number for the second parameter so i think i'm doing a kind of miserable job of unpacking this object so the annotations is an object where the arrays are grouped by property so this should be an array now of all those properties then oh no no no let that part of parts ah it's just the keys it's just the keys sorry so now i need to go through all the values so um let position of annotations part that's what i'm doing and again this is written in such an awful way and i would not want my example that ultimately would make it a tutorial to look like this but um let's first and thank you pedro for your pie super chat um let's see if this gets me to where i want to go for now okay great so yes i am seeing them all as circles and now and i'm sort of drawing a line and actually probably connecting them i'm realizing makes much more sense for me to now take this particular um let's just not work with the landmarks at all as a full array let's work with them individually and i'm going to go through all the positions and draw them as circles and then also do that again and again this is i'm just getting this to work it's a very awkward way and then draw connect them so now i should see uh all of the circles and all and all the connections for these particular groupings so we can see right each finger and i i should get rid of that close the close doesn't make any sense um anymore and i should say i'm gonna say stroke weight four and what i would like to do now is color give them a different color each so i will go to the coding train color colors where's that website that cj made whoa it was not in live poll it was in is it just in the website no there was a time colors no where did that where did cj make the colors there's that website that coding train did i bookmark it i must have right no no so sad uh i'll just make up some colors pink for pinky is a very good idea um how to trigger an event on thumbs up yeah let's we could we could definitely make that happen so that could be our let me finishing this out um so uh but i just wanted to see them as different colors let's just do um i'll just do it like this um really losing my mind here the super fast color scheme generator oh that's a good idea but i have a coding train color scheme and a website um all right let's see this in action whoops i like this oh it's so like spidery where's my mouse i lost my mouse what i've completely forgotten what i'm doing i forgot that i have stroke weight over here okay fine i'll get this i'll get a coolers dot co uh start the generator okay and copy hex sure i don't want i don't this is not colorful enough for me i want that i want the i want something more colorful okay i'm not a i'm not good at picking colors let's move on let's let's let's comment that i'll come back to that let's make a little thumbs up recognizer so here's the thing i have a whole um i'm gonna find a video for you called pose classifier so this is a particular video tutorial where i use the key points of the pose net model to um to classify poses and oh and thank you violet uh violet gave me the coding train color scheme site so i will pull that up in a second the way that i do this is i make the xy positions of every key point on the body's pose the input to a neural network i collect a data set with a lot of poses paired with labels and then i feed that through the neural network it learns those poses associated with those labels and then it can take new ones and yes and it works quite well this definitely would be a way to do it with the hand pose model and if i had infinite time uh that would be an example that i would build right now in fact you could probably get this code and swap it out really quickly i'm tempted to do that but one thing that i really do like to consider is that is there a way for me to simply analyze a hand pose and determine whether it's thumbs up or thumbs down for example now i know like if i'm all if this point over here is always the highest of all of the other points then maybe it is thumbs up if it is the lowest then maybe it's thumbs down right so certainly using a classification engine would be good but i bet you i can get this to work by just recognizing when the thumb is the highest point or the lowest point so which one is that it's certainly one of the ones that is um um and it is certainly one of the ones that is part of the annotations that is the thumb so let's do this let thumb equal annotations dot thumb boy wouldn't object destructuring be nice here and then let's say fill uh let's make a green let's just draw an ellipse at thumb index zero dot x thumb index zero dot y um that is uh 24. so a larger circle let's see what i get i just want to know which one is it and i could probably look it up but this is the quick way of finding it uh it's that top whoa it did them all that's weird because i am doing something let's take out this let's take out this and let's just look um for see which one it is so i'm not going to draw the other things as circles why don't i see the thumb okay so i made a mistake somewhere ellipse was expecting a number for the second oh there's no dot x these are arrays i'm just thinking they're organized into x y pairs so that might be something oh no no no no no it's not a two dimensional array it's literally wait no the thumb is an array no it is the thumb is an array of an arrays and the first array has an xyz so it is a twodimensional array this should be right we're about to find out okay so that's the bottom one right that particular the first one is the bottom one how many are in the thumb um i mean i could just hard code it in i'm curious if it'll tell me anywhere let's just guess i think there are probably if we look well when the circles were there i think there were four so let's guess it's index three i think there were four key points like along the thumb like one two three four i think there we go i got the top one so i found the top of my thumb so now let's do the following thumb t x is this t y is this and i'm going to say a boolean thumbs i'm going to assume thumbs up is true oh no i don't need to say boolean and i'm going to assume thumbs down is also true then as i'm going through all of the other parts um and i shouldn't do there's no reason for me to do this by annotation but since i'm already doing that i can say if and i only need the y sorry i only need the y i only need the thumb y if this particular y of another point is above is above the thumb thumb y then thumbs up can't be true anymore right if something else is higher than the thumb then thumbs up is not true else if y is less than thumb y if this y is below then thumbs down is not true so then when i get to the end let's say this text align center center text size 64. if thumbs up text come on paste it in there my goodness what are you doing to me there we go text thumbs up with divided by two height divided by two else if thumbs down let's draw this one so i believe i should get okay what's happening here uh got some weird errors thumbs up is not defined what did i call these oh oh i'm in the for loop let's well yeah we shouldn't be drawing it we're going to do this within not the for loop but within the if statement if there is a hand to be detected um there's only ever one hand so i'll just do it here now let's try running this again thumbs up thumbs down thumbs up thumbs down i'm going to blow your mind now i'm going to take simon's suggestion and i'm going to say uh like i think that's like much bigger and i'm going to just draw the video i am going to hide this and i am going to comment this out save now watch this people oh wait i got an error wait what happened image was expecting oh oh okay if video i knew i could make something successful happen with the new ml5 no what oh no it needs a place that's not the problem sorry needs to be at zero zero okay here we go everyone i mean look how accurate this is i was gonna say no machine learning involved but it's not true because i have a pretrained model looking for thumbs up or thumbs down but i didn't have to train a neural network to recognize the difference between these poses now if i want to do like rock paper scissors i would definitely want to use a neural network because people could make scissors in all sorts of different directions and orientations but thumbs up versus thumbs down and i should debounce this so it only registers if it's like um if it only registers if it's um and i'm still drawing that green dot which i didn't realize i was drawing let's just take that out what about pointing left so here's a couple things one is like hey thumbs up thumbs down this is thumbs down right because somehow the thumb is lower than all the others so it is a bit of a problem if uh you know i'm not it's not a very sophisticated way of doing it but i would like to point out that it's very easy to sort of let yourself go into a place where you think you must use the most sophisticated advanced technique for determining something when actually just checking the y location of the top of the thumb versus the bottom of the rest of the fingers is quite accurate it bothers me i need to debounce this because i would like this to be and i would like to clean this up a little bit so this could be an actual example so first of all let's say i don't want to count it so let's do let's do a counter up counter down counter okay and so if thumbs up up counter okay so i'm gonna do this up counter again there's a more elegant way of doing this but i think this will work i could do that fading thing but i'm gonna do it differently um up counter plus plus else up counter minus minus and then if thumbs down down counter plus plus and all of you are thinking of a million other ways to write this code i get it uh then i'm gonna say up counter equals constrain up counter between 0 and let's say 100 that let's constrain down counter as well to within some range and then now i basically want to say if up counter is greater than 50 else if down counter is greater than 50. so i only want to consider it a thumbs up or a thumbs down if it's sort of stably been there for and maybe i should say more than if it's 30 frames per second about one second and so it might actually make sense for me to sort of think in pack into multiples of 30. um let's let's see if my logic is not totally flawed here all right um whoa so why the flickering hmm like just if it's halfway it's got to like count it's got to be there for 30 frames is my are my like values too large this is kind of a silly thing that i'm doing but i just oh and let's make these separate thumbs up increase the up counter otherwise keep them between 0 and 60. i don't understand what the flickering was yeah i mean console logging the counter would makes what have i done something wait weird okay fine what have i done i'm trying to add like a simple extra thing to this thumbs down is never going down weird oh whoops oh when did that change that should be wait if i don't know what did i did i mess that up and that's so weird this makes no sense so i think i have the right idea but my i don't know why i don't know when that changed um and yeah that that also would make sense to do this i mean this this has gotten really ridiculous but i also think that um you know it doesn't need so much you know this is this is silly what i'm doing i mean it's not silly it's it would make the interaction theory much more elegant but well it it just worked so much better without this extra debouncing i think actually what it should be i'm now realizing is or i don't know all right i gotta put this away i'm gonna put this away the the there's an elsif oh yeah uh yeah but i think the elsif is fine because if it's less than t y it can't be greater than so anyway it's pretty good i think maybe i thought i was going to make it much better um let's just um so okay i'm going to wrap this up it's save you're all going to make much better versions of this thumbs up or down tracker uh detector um and i am going to put this as a link in the um discord uh links uh channel that's part of the live stream right here under links so you can grab that code and try it on your own please make a version of this i think i think it's it's it's after 6 00 p.m here on the east coast and my brain is really fried and so clearly i am not thinking straight and my sort of technique for debouncing this is rather flawed um but um what i really would suggest doing is taking a look at this particular video i'll post a link to this as well hello and welcome to another um so i'll post a link to this video what i would love for somebody to try doing is try taking this idea but instead of using pose use all the landmarks of a hand and i think someone in the chat had suggested um someone in the chat had yeah technically when it's equal it's not thumbs up or thumbs down that's a good point um uh suggested like okay you could you could sort of like point and make like a game controller you could you could actually use regression here you could train a regression model basically to extract an angle based on the angle of your hand that would be kind of pretty interesting to do there's so many possibilities there so i i feel like i'm this is like a um i would give this live stream a b minus and i hope to be able to sort of organize and plan for how um i do things a little bit better but what i what if i were to summarize what happened today that you could take with you and sort of ponder and perhaps contribute back is one is i think my methodology of going through pull requests one at a time during a live stream is pretty flawed um especially if a lot come in all at once because they're just going to cause a lot of merge conflicts people are trying different things and it's not really a particularly productive way for me to maintain and grow this live poll application so i think that to do so i think i probably should put that aside for the live streams and just try to like now in the discord maybe we can make a channel about it maybe some of the folks who help with various github repos can help go through some of these pull requests maybe i can work on it find some time to work on it outside of the live stream but i would like to have a goal that by the next live stream that i have a working version of that that i could just use because i think i've done enough of the kind of talking about or explaining like the idea of the live poll application i should just sort of clean it up and i can go through it in a live stream to help people understand how it works but i don't think that's too um that didn't work so well as a segment um i do feel like looking at something new like the hand pose model that just came out in ml5 that i haven't worked with before that to me feels pretty successful um i wasn't able to necessarily um make something super creative with it but i was able to get it working and kind of look through how it works and now i would love for any of you who aren't just immediately going to bed right now not going to sleep and if you're you know working on some projects and stuff today if you try it please share it with me join the discord and in there's a share channel there you can you can tweet at me as well um at shiffman and that i would love to see if anybody kind of gets um this working and certainly what's great about this is this has now helped me potentially go and make a video tutorial an edited video that would then come out about the hand post model um other things i didn't get to i didn't get to looking at glitch and runway i still haven't gotten to the java processing library i wonder if i could i wonder such a bad idea but i almost feel like is that just gonna take me five minutes just let's remember the old days when i used to have a timer uh here we go folks i'm allowing myself the amount of time hold on that the tory the dog song is five minutes and 21 seconds let me just check here is this one yes so i have been say i said oh maybe this is not it where did i recently maybe it was an email must have been an email this hold on everybody just just just hold on a second i'm gonna i wanna i've been some i guess this was an email thread i thought it was a github issue this library http request for processing i really need to use this library for some examples that i imagine making for working with runway and anything else that requires an http request i didn't haven't made a release of this since february 26 2016 and there's been a whole bunch of fixes that one and i wanted to just quickly make a new release but let's look at what some of these other i'm doing exactly what i said i wasn't gonna do this doesn't i don't get what this is so this i think i can't merge something about that i'd have to look at more and more detail but i was it was requested that i just quickly make a release of this so i'm going to see if i can do this in 5 minutes and 20 seconds and if not i'll come back to it next week this is definitely not going to work no can't clone a youtube video i'm getting the repo do i have eclipse on this computer sort of oh i had to go away i don't wanna i don't wanna deal with that right now okay allow cookies i can't believe i'm installing eclipse to do this this is definitely not gonna work four minutes and 18 seconds left everybody my download speeds have really got to improve do i'm really using a lot of time okay so if you're wondering eclipse is a development integrated ide that um you can use with a lot of different programming languages um it's the one that i used to use um like every day all the time and um i probably haven't done that in like 10 years but i have used it once or twice a year when i'm trying to like build some java processing thing and i think what i want is this one i did not think that i was gonna have to install eclipse i assumed i had it on this laptop but this is a pretty newish laptop so probably i just never bothered two minutes and 37 seconds then i'm then i'm moving to saying goodbye i i thought that i could do this in this amount of time because i didn't think i was gonna have to download and install the clips um after i sign off you might see a new video about making your own discord bot appear on the coding train youtube channel maybe i'll do it tomorrow morning sort of sunday sunday morning activity it's so dark out now i thought i was gonna go for a jog after i live stream okay this is definitely not happening oh my god what have i done i'm gonna let allow the whole time the time to run out this is a minute and 25 seconds coding challenge timed edition that always worked well in the past hi thomas first time in my stream this has been i'm giving myself now a cplus for this live stream although the lighting in here is really just excellent right now okay 45 seconds dan do you ever visit tandon well right now i don't visit very many places at all um trying to stay safe and at home and with as few people as possible um but i assume you're asking about the tandon school of engineering i would otherwise be there every single day because the program that i work at called itp is um in the same building as several of the tandem programs nine seconds uh don't copy don't copy don't copy don't copy don't copy don't come just allow cookies a lot of cookies whatever whatever whatever donate no allow cookies yes okay all right boom so um i will come back to this uh so this is step one to be continued a big giant to be continued sign i don't have a button that says to be continued but um the next step for this is to use ant to rebuild the jar files for the library as well as i believe here under resources like i can't remember in maybe library.properties or build.properties this is where i would um update the version number to 0.1.4 so i'd have to make this five and make that 0.4 oh i've got to also get the processing repo and then add that to the build path all right well we got a little bit somewhere here i've gotta go um i'm gonna put on my uh old timey uh uh goodbye uh music i don't even know where that is anymore here it is um so i will leave you with this parting thought um this song has about two and a half minutes on it where i can also take a couple questions in the chat um sherp says i think i saw you once at tandon but i was too shy to say hi i've been watching you before i even got accepted nyu so people do i i have to say i have um in some of the tandem nyu buildings people will come up to me or say something in the elevator in the hallway and so don't be shy please come up and say hi to me next time you see me um and kobe is telling me that that i'm that i haven't done anything i don't do on a regular basis so i guess this is what i do this is what live streaming is for the coding train these days thank you very much thanks everybody for watching the coding train here on a saturday um i will play this uh song um when i go to the uh closing animation so what's coming up next on the coding train you will see the next videos that come out a threepart series on how to make a discord bot at the end of the last video um oh unoriginal pun i i will answer your question it's a premade animation that somebody made i can give you more details about that later and unfortunately ask about the intermission animation um the what was i saying ah the discord bot series there are three videos basically by the end of the third video all i have is a essentially a hello world discord bot it looks for the uh a posting of choo choo and replies with a message so there's lots of other things that discord bots can do and you might have some of your own ideas for what those could do so please if you watch those and and you get to the third video leave some requests or questions in the comments about what you think it might make sense for me to demonstrate as i continue that series the other um thing i wanted to mention is that i'm working on two new video tutorials about convolutional neural networks in ml5 so stay tuned for those those will be coming out soon and that's all i got uh titan is saying i'm learning these days at code academy um codecademy is a wonderful website there are some alums of the itp program where i teach that work there and i think i have also they have some unanswered emails i have some they they have who has the unanswered emails if i've been sent an email and i haven't answered it i'm the unanswerer the email is unanswered i have the unanswered email but they sent the unanswered email so it's their unanswered email it's really confusing if only i could work that out i might be able to answer my emails all right everybody i'll see you next week on the coding train goodbye oh boy i'm still here this the start of this dot song never forget the vista i'm gonna say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens kids the kittens and kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and dusty you
