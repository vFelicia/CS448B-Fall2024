hello did you hear that that's my digital bell sound effect because i don't have my bell with me i am here in a recording studio where i haven't been for many many months to make a tutorial for you hopefully you're watching this at some point in the future or in the past after you've invented time travel or whatever and none of this matters but uh it is september 2020 right now i have not recorded anything here since march 2020 we're in the midst of a global pandemic um i am luckily in a room where i can close the door and i don't have to wear my mask for the moment while i record this and i hope everybody's doing well but let me just jump on in and what i want to show you is how to take a p5.js sketch maybe something you even made in the p5.js web editor and upload it to github and host it online uh using github pages if you're watching this uh the video has hopefully replaced this one right here github pages for hosting p5.js sketchers why am i making this video again well i made this one over four years ago and the interface and some of the ways that it works has changed so it's time to make it a new although i will note that oddly enough i seem to have the same haircut as in this one oh cody rainbow reveal i'm gonna show you two ways how to do this the first way is the easiest way where you can just drag and drop your files uh into the browser and upload them and then i'm gonna show you how to do this with terminal typing some commands to push your files from your local computer onto github to host them there so the first thing is you need your p5 sketch most of the time i'm working in p5 in the web editor there might be some like magic way to go right from the web editor directly to github but frankly you're probably more likely going to need to download your code first so you can go here to download and it's going to download a zip file with your html file css file javascript files and any other files that have to do with your sketch i have these files downloaded and in a folder on my desktop i also have the all the code open in visual studio code this is not necessary right now because i'm not making any changes to it but visual studio code is the editor that i use to develop locally on my computer and i have a whole video about that that you could take a look at as well as a workflow series about some of these different pieces that i'm using one small thing that i want to point out is that the reason you're able to see your p5 sketch over there running is because what's actually being loaded is an html page and that html page has references to all of your javascript files in it sketch.js particles.js boundary.jsray.js so this is kind of a sophisticated example that i'm choosing to use but you probably just have sketch.js if you've just started and making a p5 sketch with just one javascript file up here this is where the p5 library itself is loaded it's loaded from a url a cdn a content delivery network you might notice when you download your sketch from the p5 web editor it actually downloads the p5 library as well and then references it locally just like it's one of these other javascript files i prefer generally to load from the cdn but if you weren't connected to the internet and we're running your p5.js sketch locally having the p5 library itself downloaded is super useful but none of that is really relevant here what this video is about is just uploading any html javascript any files for hosting a web page it doesn't have to be a p5.js sketch and in order to do that well first you have to have a github account of course there's other places you could upload your files beyond just github but i'm showing you how to do it with github pages this is my github profile page you can see it has all of my various repositories for the ml5 library the nature of code book some of the courses i'm currently teaching this semester but now in order to get my p5.js sketch into a repo i want to make a brand new one so to do that there's this plus button up in the top right i'm going to hit new repository i'm going to name it p5 uh sketch video tutorial notice that by the way you can't actually have spaces so it's going to automatically rename it with the dashes for me and i'm saying i'm going to write a quick description i want this to be public although you could choose to make it private even with github pages for hosting and then now oh i have a quandary what do i do the clue that you should take a look at is skip this step if you are importing an existing repository i am not importing an existing repository yes i am bringing some existing code but i haven't actually made a git repo anywhere yet the difference between git and github itself a web hosting platform for git repos git being just the software the version control software itself is a really important distinction that i cover in a bit more detail in the first video in this series so you might want to double back and check that but what i'm doing here is actually creating the repo on the github website and then i'm going to bring my files into it the easiest way to do that is to add a readme file readme file is actually also where you can just describe everything about your project and talk to the community and put lots of nice like rainbows and hearts in it if you want but i'm just going to let it be a default one right now and then also why not i'll choose a license because i want this to be an open source repository open source licenses is a huge topic that i'm not getting into right now but one thing that i could do is make a quick decision of just picking mit which i know to be a very permissive license that allow would allow anybody to reuse this code in any way that they so choose now i'm going to create the repository and here it is here's my p5 sketch video tutorial uh it has my readme which i would probably want to edit and add a lot more information in but i'll leave it by as default right now and then it's time to upload the p5.js sketch files to do that i can just navigate to the files themselves i can select them and just drag them in give the github website is going to recognize that i'm bringing in files i can let go it's uploading them and then this is the key next step i want to commit them a commit is like a save to the repo and in general it's nice to write a note about what it is you're doing although i could certainly just leave the add files the upload default message but i'm going to add a little note in there and now i'm presented with two options generally speaking when you're adding files or changing files into git repo you might want to consider doing something called a pull request which is something that i've referred to in previous videos it's a proposal to changes that aren't actually merged in yet but right now i can keep things really simple and i could just commit directly to the main branch if this wasn't a repository that i owned that wasn't part of my account i wouldn't have that option i would only be able to propose these new files as a change as a pull request i'm going to hit commit i'll do my processing files dance and here they are we can now see that all of the files are there and there's only one step left for me to do github pages for hosting is not enabled by default so i need to find the settings for this repository it's actually over here on the top right under these three dots i think if my browser page a little smaller you'll probably more likely see it as a button like this i can click on settings make it larger again and then i can scroll down you can see there's lots of options of things you could consider but i'm really only want to look at right now this github pages so github pages is currently disabled i can select a branch in order to enable it now on a simple project like this that i just started there's only one branch and you could check my video on branches to understand what those are but the main branch is called main and i'm going to select it and this is an interesting option it's giving me here so i want to keep this default setting of root i want my whole repo to be hosted as a website but if you had a repo that had some stuff in it that's just for the repo itself and maybe a directory that's for hosting online i could change this to using maybe this docs folder or i'm not sure what other options i have but i'm going to keep root i'm going to hit save we can see it's now enabled and it says your site is ready to be published at shiffman.github.io p5 sketch video tutorial you can see that there's a url that's formed based on my github account name shiffman and my repo name p5 sketch video tutorial you can actually use github pages to host with a custom domain i'd have to come back and do another video tutorial about that but hopefully right now if i just click on this there it is i have now hosted my p5.js sketch on github using github pages and i could copy this url i could tweet it i could email it i could send it all around the world and have people come and experience my sketch as well as view my code on github itself and even propose changes and make pull requests and write comments and issues and all of that wonderful stuff that comes with the sort of collaborative software that is get on the github site now that i've done all of that you could stop this video i mean you could have stopped it quite a long time ago to be perfectly honest but if you want to stick with me i am now going to show you how to create the repo locally on your computer and then push it to github without using the github website interface instead just typing commands into your local console so for me i use as my terminal application something called item mac has terminal by default built in on windows people use i don't know powershell other things what else do people use so put some stuff on the screen you might be on linux so as long as you have console access to your computer and i can see if i type pwd or print working directory i'm on my desktop under a folder called p5 sketches and that's the name of this directory that has ls all of these files in for my p5.js sketch i've also already installed git that software on my laptop if you haven't done that and you want to learn more about working with git locally in terminal i have another video which also covers that in a bit more detail but to create a repo on my local computer in a particular directory i can type git init big word of warning i have seen this happen so many times with students it's very easy by accident to type git init like in the root directory of your computer or even just in like your documents folder and suddenly you've turned your entire computer into one giant monstrous git repo and could cause all sorts of things to go haywire if that happens to you there's a really easy way to undo it and i'm going to show that to you but let me first finish off with typing git init here in the correct place so now i've initialized an empty git repository in this folder why is it empty aren't there files in there well the reason why it's empty is of course you always have to add and commit those files as you might have seen in some of my other videos but let me just address this undoing by accident making your whole computer into a git repo if i type lsall i think that's what i type this is going to give me more information about what's actually in this directory it's like permissions and all sorts of stuff and you can see there's a new folder called dot get i don't actually see that folder here in my finder because hidden files by default are turned off but i can turn them on with a quick key command shift command period and you can see there it is there is this git folder all i need to do if i didn't want this to be a git repo anymore is hit command delete just delete that folder now you don't usually want to do this but if you by accident had a folder a hidden folder called git like in the root of your computer you didn't mean to do that just deleting it will sort of undo that problem i'm really getting into a lot of tangents in this video hopefully this is still helpful back to here so just to check to make sure everything is kind of working the way i think i'm going to type git status and you can see like oh i'm on branch this makes me very unhappy because i usually use as the default branch name for my repos the word main i think it's more clear it's also a bit more inclusive language it's what is github is choosing to use as its default branch as of october 1st 2020 but my computer defaulted to the word master so here you're getting a little extra lesson about how to change your branch name and i'm going to actually before i do that i think i need to add and commit some files so i'm going to add everything and i'm going to commit them which is a short message like initial commit of p5.js sketch and i've covered these commands in previous videos now i'm going to say git branch main get check that creates a branch called main get checkout main and there we go now i'm in the main branch and then i can say i think it's git remove master no i don't know why i just thought git remove would work so you can see even me who's been doing this for years and years i can't remember what any of these commands are i have to look them up thankfully while i'm recording this video i have a live chat going and i was just handed the answer get by cody garden with cj check out that youtube channel kit branch dash d master okay so i've deleted that branch so now i am here and i can type git status once more just to make sure everything's okay and i'm on branch made nothing to commit i've got all my files there i am good to go now i can go back to github and i'm going to create another repository new repo p5 demo 2. and i'm back to this quandary again oh what do i do guess what remember i said skip this step if you're importing an existing repository well guess what now i'm importing an existing repository because i need the repository locally on this laptop right here so i don't want to add a readme i don't want to add a git ignore i don't want to choose a license i just want to create the repository and it is empty it's blank luckily for me oh thank you github for providing me a nice set of commands that i can type in to get this repo up here on uh on um github itself so the first instructions it's giving me is create a new repository on the command line i actually already showed you that i kind of awkwardly did it and you know you could see how you could do it here with a readme file and also like just creating the main branch boy that was much more elegant there but or i could push an existing repository from the command line which is what i did so this is what i need to do i want to say git remote add origin so what that does is it's creating a remote version of the repo that's locally on my computer on github server and this is the url path to that particular repo paste this in here hit enter it's done then i could create that main branch which i guess this is the one way of doing it that i didn't know about what i did before that's probably the way i would double back and do it but then i could and then so i don't need to do that now and now i can just push it and by the way this word origin in here is quite optional i could have called it github or my special wonderful server that's just the name of the remote so i'm saying hey i have a repo i want to add a remote and i can have multiple remotes like maybe i'm hosting my website and like on five different servers and they each have a git repo remote and i can name them different things so i can know where they're going but by default most people use the word origin i actually like to call it github because sometimes it's a bit more clear to me but i'm just gonna use this i'm gonna hit this it is done now you might get an error message here where it's telling you like i'm not authenticated i don't i'm not logged in so i have also done some stuff to set up my computer to automatically be logged into that git account i need to make a video to show you how to do that but if you run into trouble there what i would suggest is coming up to the top and switching it to https and then use this url instead for when you do git remote add origin and then use this https remote that will allow you to type in your username and password for like kind of like a onetime login to push the repo all right now i should be able to just refresh this page i pushed everything and there it is now i got this like obnoxious ds store file which is something that mac made and i don't have a readme file so there's some cleanup that i should probably do to this repo but overall we're ready to go i can just go once again i can head over to settings github pages enable it on the main branch hit save scroll back down find my url open it up this is my p5 sketch same result as before but i had to like wander my way through all of those uh terrifying but not so bad really if you think about it uh command things to put into my terminal shell console thingy i hope this video was helpful to you i'm sure there are aspects that are confusing that there's missing pieces that are gaps in your understanding and knowledge please ask those questions in the comments also i was kind of figuring out some of the steps to do while i was doing them in this video but i am going to put all the steps in a clear guide that you're seeing right here in the video description or at least the link from the video description so hope you enjoy those later goodbye the video is over now i don't have a train whistle it's just gonna end
