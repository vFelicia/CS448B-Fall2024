hello everybody good evening I don't see you I don't see you I don't I I see myself I look over at this monitor over here I didn't check my sound the advance which I usually try to do makes me so happy it's so nice to be back on YouTube with you the viewing audience here on the coding train I am here with my special invisible cloaking device semi clothing advice shirt my space invisible space melon not very good I went to this store which shall not be named and this is what expensive these little melon pops that they have not a sponsor usually it's quite delicious maybe it was just sitting out all day I don't know melon keeps me going here on the coding tray which is a weird very weird thing to say somehow I said it anyway I'm not sure what to do about this shirt issue so I and Daniel Rodriguez says greetings from Colombia and I am going to do something on the coding train today which is a visualization of a number sequence called the Rick Amon sequence maybe somebody help me with the pronunciation there is a sequence invented by I believe a Colombian mathematician so I want to look up the actual information to make sure I say it correctly but that's that's one it's a main topic that I prepared for today Oh Bruno says we missed you so much I missed you interestingly enough though I was releasing with you it's just about everyday cuz I recorded so much before I went away so I was on a little vacation I was in the place called Cape Cod and I was also in the wonderful city of Toronto and a little up north into Ontario in the Muskoka Lakes region which was quite beautiful and had a lovely time like New York City just fine but that was nice I will be away again for quite a bit of time in August so the summer is a little bit I'm trying to keep up with things and make enough content to it so that I don't feel guilty and pause the patreon last summer I bought the patron for three months with the broken elbow this summer I think I did do five live streams in it's July now in June and I won't be gonna get at least 3 in July and 3 in August and then kind of make up for it later oh welcome new sponsor rhythmic Dragons Guk I'm sure I'm so sorry Prizm ik I'm sure I completely and of course the camera goes right oh I have so many plans to like upgrade my equipment and do better and oh did I just post something here oh so I'm going to the slack Channel the friendliest yeah so I don't know what to do about this shirt thing so this you know I don't but you know the coding training as as you know is brought to you by waterclear usually thirstquenching I do actually sometimes have some other sponsors and there are often YouTube ads but I know what I was gonna talk about my shirt but it's you know I got this shirt from one of these online stylist things that like advertise on a lot of podcasts and stuff and I really like it it has a little flamingo here it's like I never buy new clothes but the fitment but I didn't I thought oh I'm gonna wear this on Friday I'm gonna be back at the code grades my nice new shirt I didn't think it's blue shouldn't be a problem this is green back here see look that's green oh wait this is actually not this is me actually removing the background and put it green there so this isn't actually the wall I had a view of there's a way that I can show you the actual wall which I really shouldn't do right now because I should be doing coding but you know anyway really I mean you should know by now that it's not gonna be any coding for like at least another 30 minutes a green settings no no where do I go for this filters I just temporarily turned the filter off well I could actually play with it here maybe I could get my shirt to be less transparent so how do I just want to disable the chroma key there we go okay so I disabled the chroma key this is what look I feel like this is a very different color I'm wearing a blue shirt this is a green wall and yet somehow there's just a little bit too much there disable the filter okay um so let me put the filter back on so there's so here's the thing normally I would have just gone and you're like okay well I always I you know I'm the kind of person I don't know what kind of person you are but the kind of person who wears a tshirt under the shirt I mean sighs like just wear a tshirt I wear a tshirt under the tshirt yeah maybe I've all done that before I've worn a tshirt over a longsleeve tshirt anyway I'm the kind of person who wears a tshirt under this shirt so no problems excuse me for the microphone here that I'm just gonna have to move don't worry I'm not this robing so I have this other shirt on but I can't wear this other shirt for a number of reasons number one is I didn't even pay attention oh sure I was grabbing number one is this is a shirt is like kind of a copyright violation so I'm not gonna show you the whole shirt it also has a green stripe in it so that is really let me put up like a web browser I'm sure this is really fascinating all of you really this is what you tune did for I'm sure you can see here look that has a little like strike there so that that option is out hold on me button this back up try to put this back on somewhere here so I don't know I'm fine with being somewhat translucent but then I think okay when I release the video and I release the edited videos and the coding challenges every single comments it's gonna be your friends loosing your translucent your trans as I can see three I mean there's this one there's one I did one coding challenge wearing if I can find it I had these like rainbow headband and sweat bands there's the rainbow headband yeah yes I have this rainbow headband and if I put that on you can see that like it separates the top of my head so I need somebody somebody needs to get me I would really love to have like a some I don't know why I'm like headbands I'm gonna I never said that sentence before in my entire life before right now but it came out of my mouth I think it might be true but I need one that doesn't have green in it all right I have my ukulele still but I it's been sitting here I've been playing it for a month alka in the chat is saying just go over to makeup and wardrobe and get a new outfit wouldn't that be nice I do actually have a couple hoodies here oh wait what is this oh no that's a plastic bag so I have this unicorn hoodie which I believe is just from hold on I don't know where I forgot where I got this my wife bought it for me I think but I forgot it was like it was just from like some target it's from Target I think not a sponsor Kotick train is brought to you by h2o is it 2h + 1 hour is a 2o + 1 H and if it was I pretty sure it's 2 agent 1 Oh but if I get that wrong hmm thank you okay now and then I have this coding training hoodie actually probably downstairs I have also my ITP camp on it anyway I don't know what to do anybody have any suggestions unicorn hoodie go you're missing an ifstatement you want to get a shirt with a big circle people are you know I also I like the eye light I really like this unicorn horny but then I feel like if I wear the unicorn hoodie then I don't know then all people do is talk about the unicorn hoodie and really I'm you as it's quite evident and obvious this she's a live stream about coating it is educational it is to be taken very seriously and you will words is there green in it hmm alright so now it's also like this is way too hot it's like summer oh I can tune the filter alright alright sorry I'm messing I'm like probably making horrible sounds no matter what it's like nonsense I do hear somebody's always asked in the chat how come you don't you see sharks in unity well alright so there's the unicorn hoodie I need to do some stretching let's see if I could just briefly briefly tune the filter because I would like to wear my new shirt my new shirt from my personal stylist who knows me really well on the internet sends me clothes once a month a box if I keep all that might get a discount all right uh all right so help walk me through this everybody okay so I'm going to green a Canon filters all right I'm now going to chroma key and now I see I see key color type green similarity between 1 and 1000 smoothness and these are settings and open broadcast studios really smoothness between 1 and 1000 so similarities said 400 smoothness is set at 80 key color spill reduction is set to 100 Oh anyone could possibly sponsor this content right now is beyond me but thank you John Petrelli by the way what's wonderful about you should wait a little longer let me see if my kids got home yet because the lights anybody who's thinking about sponsoring the lights in my apartment I just move to a new apartment I got all these philips hue lights they blink whenever somebody sponsors I couldn't get that set up here at NYU because of all the security yes I think they are let's see they oh not yet they are a couple blocks away so if anybody's thinking of sponsoring right now just wait like 15 minutes I just you know because it'll be fun for them they'll see all the lights blinky blink oh I was I was talking about something important ah yes okay so now hmm key opacity 100 contrast zero just wiggle the sliders it'll be great okay what this is definitely gonna work I'm gonna wiggle the sliders you're gonna tell me when it looks good now we're gonna work cuz you're at a different time than me but I'm gonna I'm just gonna mess around her second let's just remember 480 100 114 no just you remember is 480 100 blue this is what happens when I make it blue King can you see okay what is this did this actually update your view I'm waiting to see if the chat okay so the chatted so this is definitely updating it magenta oh okay that's good custom Oh custom so how do I take a little change so the one thing I could do is it's that green and I can like mess around with this so like you know I am now my I have no longer translucent but there's more of a shadow behind me so splitting the difference here that's a little bit better yeah that works the similarities smoothness also key spill color reduction whoa I like that hold on whoa what was that at 40 oh my god did I make it better I don't think I'm translucent anymore I have a weird shadow behind pizza because of my poor life eh I don't know I make it better did I make it worse I should talk to you you're the person watching to get the dirt you can always add more key effects to get the darker airs specifically alright but if I stay up pretty close here actually I think it looks pretty good alright now here's the real question I usually like to keep this laptop so that it doesn't block the view looks pretty good there's something here oh this is my melon I'm a little afraid of eating this melon now it's just very like soft you know what I think the melon the melon shtick is done for today yeah just put this to the side I don't know hair just put it somewhere out of the way over here maybe alright hello welcome it's the coding train on Friday and I am going to do some coding my name is Daniel sheath mon and i am in the habit at least hopefully once a week although in the summer i'm missing some time here and there of coming on this platform called YouTube and livestreaming with some equipment and typing on my computer and doing tutorials or trying to code various things I I I and I'm just sort of curious here I'm gonna go to Twitter / Schiffman for a second and oh what am i logged in as a let me vote I'll just vote for this all right so these are okay so there are a bunch of things that I'm thinking about doing and I also I need to look up over here I kind of believe that I might have also written out some other ideas and view on watch page in the description possible topics workflow is the only thing really missing from here recommend sequence mobile net convolutional layers workflow okay so one other thing here so here's the thing let me get myself a little organized here so one thing that I would like to do the thing that I'm going to start with probably is the recommends sequence and if anyone could help me with some pronunciation there be appreciated because I I you know I like to try to as often as possible have standalone coding challenge videos that produce some mildly interesting visual result that people can remix those are certainly the most viewed videos on the channel um it's it's quite remarkable how many more views they get relative to the things that are like my twelve point part tutorial series on building a classifier with fence or float yes but I'm not so sure if views is the metric that I should be using to measure you know the value or worth of a video you know so maybe some of these longer tutorial sequences in the long term are better for the world then a video that gets a lot of views cuz it's Tim as long and makes a pretty picture I don't know so but I do if you keep these channels going it just hopefully do those coding challenges they tend to get a bit more traction so that's what I'm gonna work on today this is the second time now also that I will be taking inspiration from the number file I did this sandpile coding challenge based on a number file video this will be based on a recent numberphile video on this number number sequence okay now so that's number one number two is I kind of feel like I might as well do it like a coding challenge at some point like it's a thing that I know and it produces interesting results I think I could build it in one video I should do that so that's there on the list it's been on the list for a while in terms of my machine learning long term project to try to like step through and by the time I get anywhere I'm sure everything I'll have done will be out of date but nonetheless if I go to the channel page and scroll down a bit and go here too by the way somebody in the chat earlier was asking oh don't you have any beginner tutorials this is where I would start if you're a total beginner to programming actually in the fall I'm going to be remaking a bunch of these videos because the stuff has come out of dates in the fall coming soon some sessions for total beginners this is my machine learning set of playlists and the last thing I did was tensorflow das classification so I built a classification model attention for address the next thing that I want to do is build an image classifier with tensorflow chess using the Google quickdraw data set so I'm going to not write a convolutional neural network from scratch I'm gonna build one using tension flips yes but I wanted to make a couple videos about how the elements of a convolutional layer work and I might just use processing for that to show the different image processing pieces it bothered me this noise over here is bothering me so much I have an idea this light is pointed in like a weird direction will that help mildly better oh wait no yes mildly better okay yeah people someone is asking in the chat John sizing can you redo your processing tutorials yeah those are really old and the quality of them terms of the production quality Pro X quality is that great right now that's clearly evidenced by be trying to tune the green screen live but those really could use a refresh I'm not so sure what to do about that often think about that I would like to do that it's just sort of limited time here and things that I can do they do the reason why I'm les les has changed I mean in terms of the syntax so they do still apply the IDE looks totally different in the video so I have much less gray hair but alright so so that's the other thing here ml5 the project is coming I want to do a whole tutorial series about different aspects of this ml5 machine learning library which is a beginner friendly library built on top of tensorflow Digest I don't I'm not really ready for that but I thought I should at least like I could do like a coding challenge where we get image labels from the we classify images coming in through the webcam according to the mobile net model so I might try to do that and so those are the things I have on beach I also would really like to update my workflow and look at kind of improved sort of console terminal features and you look at using I term I I get a lot of recommendations to take a look at Visual Studio code and some features that it has that might be useful in terms of running a live server and having a preview pane so I know those things can also probably be done with Adam so that's those are all the things on my list for today but you know it's been a half an hour so I got to go no I'm just kidding Sammy Haas for better melon I'm pretty sure that also flashes the lights the super chat so we'll see I'm going to see if I get yeah oh boy there's aw oh yeah there's an interesting discussion going on in the slack channel here for sorry let me just let me just see okay I'm Austan in the chat is reminding me to mention which I I mean it's not reminding me to mention I've is mentioning and I've reminded to mention fun fun function mpj has been doing a set of let's look at videos here yeah part one part looks like there's three parts out so far I would definitely recommend these I believe mpj mentions that some of the inspiration for this came from some of my early perceptron videos and so this is another and by the way if you want to this is the comment I get all the time why don't you just do stuff with plain JavaScript you always use frameworks and libraries you know just like I'm the kind of guy who wears a tshirt under the shirt you know added protection I'm also the kind of guy who the kind of person who uses Josh Rick Aman sequence so let's first there's like that website that's the number sequence website like so online it's like encyclopedia of integer sequences this is like this is like the greatest thing ever you know from from a person who whose favorite book is a book called a million random digits you gotta love the online encyclopedia there is a bit of a dark shadow in the top right oh yeah that's not good all right let me I got a time sorry tweak the settings a little bit that this is this over here you can't see it this over here is going to be a problem filters I'm going to back out of can't tell what's gonna make it better let's just make this hold on I'm gonna put this back okay hold on I am going to be doing some tweaking here so I'm translucent again okay you can sponsor I mean if equity was waiting there hope to see the lights flashing all right so that makes me less translucent but it's more noise I wonder if other thing I could do is what if I do select color oh look at this can I not just click in the window and get a color if I make it darker no that's bad let's go for 375 I'm still translucent in 375 65 that looks better so 65 I think it's just enough to like not get my shirt okay oh look at that I could crop that out but then I have less room to move over here I could crop that out I'm really wasting a lot I'm never on that side very much hmm good point let's see green cannon walk man oh no that's making you smaller how do you crop instead of shrinking for president is asking how long until I get slack channel access for subscribers shouldn't it be instant unfortunately it is not instant it's a manual process and even worse than that I don't it's if you subscribe to her patreon I actually like get your email instantly but if you subscribe through YouTube I don't get your email I just see your user name on a list so if you go to the community tab there's a sponsor's only post you can see that has a link to a Google form where you can enter in your email and then I'll send you a slack invites sorry I don't have a better system than that if anybody who I don't know if anybody who's in the chat actually has permissions to add somebody right now but you could there's a system you can work out I'm happy for that to be worked out oh yeah Bruno makes a great suggestion I have two extra screen with a live webcam at home we hold on I'm trying to crop do I have a soft light to direct at that edge of your background hold the Mac equivalent of alt then I can drag the edge okay the Mac equivalent of alt is that oh that's option I think there we go crop I don't know I'm really getting into too much monkey business today but this is good better better this needs to go down a little bit okay do I have a soft light I also do I don't know a soft I have a clip light with no bulb I have oh you don't have I do actually maybe I have these like light things which I think I should wear this is probably like some sort of good exercise to balance I can do this but I do have let's see I have this which is like this like led like very not so powerful LED light thing anyway I don't I think I should give up on trying to make this better right now and actually make some content what is this so much weird stuff in here this is like a bulb that's burnt out I guess by the way anybody recognized this in the olden days of this channel I had a button that I would press to change cameras now I have something called a keyboard with numbers on it okay a clip without a bold is pretty soft alright okay alright ah okay online encyclopedia of integer sequences let's look for recommend a here we go okay so we're here and then we should reference the numberphile video and the and the look this 589 people watching live now and let's see what is that recommend mathematician I forgot the fullname Bernardo Bernardo recommen whoops I spelled that wrong here we go let us not translate this page let us put this here so this I think is everything that I need to reference then I also need to get a project going we will not be using any new workflow right now and let's run a little server and let's minimize this say background the zero let's have a console open and let's make this a little wider all right I think this is going to do and we don't need the libraries folder anymore what version of p5 am i using zero point six point one seems like that's probably the most recent all right I think I am ready okay all right cycle the cameras alright let's see it's only been 35 minutes now the thing is do I want to have a visual to start with so one thing that I might do with this here is I might record an introduction to the coding challenge after I finish the coding challenge so I know for the live viewers that can be a little but so what should i what am I gonna say in the introduction but I think I want to explain it so yeah so alright I think it's that's fine I'll figure this out I'm gonna go as if I'm not going to and then I'm probably going to anyway alright so yeah I'm going to though so I'm just gonna say let's begin but I'll talk about the fact that this is a coding challenge when I do an introduction to it later alright and does anyone can anyone all right before I begin Tim s you've done anything productive yet nope don't worry nothing productive be evasive but anything productive happens but how electronic all right Bernardo recommen Santos for an American how is that in terms of pronunciation I will just sit your weight all right Lewis writes movie n which I probably completely mispronounced alright alright I'm gonna do my best this goes over here I'm gonna not look at the chat I'm not gonna look at the monitor too much I'm going to just over here now we have told me to get coffee guess what I confused myself by this wanting to do the introduction after the fact I don't know okay alright so the idea for this coding challenge originates from this wonderful numberphile video about this thing called the recommendations is a numeric sequence a sequence of numbers really like I keep a book that does lots of million random numbers in it around it sooo this me if soothe the soothed is me it soothes me at nighttime but I'm feeling stressed or anxious just to read some random numbers and so this particular number sequence is a fascinating one is invented by a Colombian mathematician named Bernardo recommence Antos and you can find out more about it at the guess what there's a website which is actually the online encyclopedia of integer sequences and I think now possibly for the rest of my life I'm just going to be at home browsing this website know about this till now so here's the thing I'm not going to go too much into the background of this numeric sequence or number sequences I definitely recommend that you also check out the numberphile video I'm really just gonna try to code it and visualize it that's what I'm gonna do in this video I'm gonna do it in JavaScript and if I'm feeling a little saucy afterwards I might I might do a video where we try to make something musical out of the number sequence so anyway okay so what how does that let me first try to get my system to work let me first attempt to just describe to you what the number sequence is now for a number sequence is just exactly that a sequence of numbers like 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 that's a integer sequence counting up by one there's the Fibonacci sequence 1 1 2 3 5 8 right where you add the two numbers before and get the next so maybe you want to pause this video right now and invent your own number sequence this particular this recommen a numbered sequence is particularly beautiful and interesting as a kind of this strange balance between order and chaos so you know anything that has a nice this dialectic quality of having both order and chaos is always fascinating to visualize well mostly all these I think all right so let's say we have a number line and I'm really just regurgitating here a bit of the explanation that is in the numberphile video in my own words probably not nearly as well 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and this could in theory go on to infinity oh boy pause there's like a giant a glare right there it's actually not so bad is that a problem I think that's actually fine I moved a light to try to get rid of that I think I'm just gonna I think I'm gonna leave it alright apologies there's a little glare there but I think everything's gonna be fine alright now let's say I have a counter and that counter is gonna start at 1 the idea here and it's going to go up 2 3 4 5 6 now for every number in the counter I'm going to try to go backwards but I thought if I I'm going to start so I'm going to start right here and I'm going to attempt to go backwards if I can go backwards by this number of spaces and land somewhere that hasn't been landed on before great I'm gonna go there if not I'm gonna go forward this seems weird and I don't know if that explanation made sense but it's going to make sense to you if you keep watching I hope I think all right so one I'm gonna try to go backwards there's no spot there's no negative numbers in the sequence so I can't go backwards I'm gonna go forwards I'm gonna go to here so my sequence is now 0 1 now I'm going to go I'm gonna try to go backwards by 2 1 uh nope I can't so I need to go forwards by two so I'm gonna go here three now I'm gonna try to go backwards by 3 1 2 3 up no that spot is take it that spots taken I can't go there I'm going to go 1 2 3 4 now I'm gonna try to go back four one two three guess what guess what this spot is open so I can go backwards for it now in the visualisation of it I'm going to want to draw the moving backwards below in and this is an arbitrary decision it's sort of the common way to visualize this sequence it's certainly what's done in the numberphile video the point of these showing this choose to code it but you might invent your own way of visualizing this but I can go back for now by the way I forgot to keep updating this 0 1 3 6 2 and then now I'm gonna go forward 5 no I'm gonna try to go backwards 5 I can't there's nothing there so go forwards 5 1 2 3 4 5 so now I go here so we can see how this goes and this is now now it's just double check so so on and so forth so I could you know I could keep doing this it's gonna be a bit easier for me to write a computer program to do this then for me to do this manually on the board first of all I really really hope that I didn't botch this so I'm gonna go check though it's like a PDA and see if this sequence matches what's there oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy I have a good feeling about this oh wait here we go zero one three six two seven zero one three six two seven okay we're good I think we can write some code now all right pause I'm gonna pause for a second here I'm just looking at the chat to see if anything is if anybody saying anything really important I don't think so so I'm gonna move on in code okay I need to turn off the notifications on my watch all right all good yes there must be a disk I see that K week monitors wrote in the chat I don't think it has any applications the joy of pure math should be enough now I don't know what the question was but I can imagine what the question was yeah this is that's a this is a an idea for an algorithm that produces a sequence of numbers and there's I think we can ask this question are there any applications of this does that sequence have meaning I mean you could say the same of the Fibonacci sequence what why why why should I care about that sequence well that's a sequence that actually appears quite often in nature in in different patterns found in nature so I think you know the interest equations there's so many different number sequences and thank you to NJ a slow for cyclopædia of integer sequences all right all right so let's begin and write some code that's going all right so let's begin it and write some actual code now so here I am in a JavaScript program with the p5.js library loaded I what do I need so I need to keep track of if I go back to this I need to keep track of the number sequence will be nice to keep track on I want to keep track of the counter like what spot of my own I need to keep track of which spots have been landed on or not so I am going to so I have a problem I don't know why it happens oh you know why it happens I don't know why it happens they just not anywhere near the buttons to play the sound effects all right so I'm going to say let numbers this will be an array that's going to basically have a value in it you know something like this for every spot that's been landed on that's kind of my idea so I'm gonna have that then I'm going to what else do I did I say I need that I needed a counter that's gonna start the counter is going to start at 1 and I guess this could like have true in it to start because the zero spot by definition is what's been landed on at the beginning let's see how is that and then let me just say what is the sequence this will be the sequence so let's write let's let's write let's use the fact that p5 Luc's automatically with the draw loop but let's write a function called step so oh and I need to keep track of where I am so I get something to call that index because I'm think of it as the index into this array and so actually what I'm gonna do is at the beginning I'm just going to say numbers index equals true because that's where I am and every time I want to step the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to say num index minus or I'm going to say I'm gonna say next equals index minus count this is me attempting to go backwards right and then I will say numbers oh I will say if numbers next if it's been landed on or if next is less than 0 if next is less than 0 or if it's already been landed on then that is no good next needs to equal index plus count and then I can simply say numbers next equals true because that's now a spot that I've landed on and the sequence I can add to it the value next and then I can say index equals next so let's do this for and actually let me forget about draw for a second let's see if this algorithm works let's say for let a equals 0 I is less than 10 I plus plus step let's just do this 10 times and then say console dot log I'm sure I've made a mistake the sequence so this is my idea for the algorithm we try to go backwards if that is a negative number it's no good or if it's a place that's already been landed on then I need to go forwards I need to set the forward spot to be true I need to add that to the sequence and now that's my new my next spot and so I suppose in addition to saying numbers index it is zero technically the first number that's the question zero is the first number so I also want to say a sequence dot push index in setup so let's run this code and see is this the sequence no no no no no no no that is definitely wrong oh I could see in the chat Sora's ink count didn't increment so I forgot a really crucial step right the whole point of this is I go forward once then I tried then and twice then three times then four times trying to go backwards I was always an increment counter so it's just going you know trying to go backwards once each time it's never going to work all right okay good mistake are good mistake to have so I am now going to say when do I want to do that I guess right at the end I just say count plus plus right I just want to the next time I want two steps that's probably count I don't know if is the right variable name for this could be like number of steps but all right now let's try this again and let's see 0 1 3 6 2 7 13 2012 21 11 0 1 3 6 2 7 13 2012 21 11 the next one should be 22 let's just doublecheck this a little bit more and see if I've got 22 all right woohoo I feel so much confident that at least programmed an algorithm to generate that number sequence so now we are ready to visualize it okay this is the fun part or that's all the fun part for yeah any of its the fun part for you alright so let's think about this so one thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take this out of setup and I'm gonna put the step function in draw and let's just say console dot log index so we can see if this is kind of doing what I expect it to do yes so this is the sequence now this is the rickum on sequence just going and going and going you see the numbers are getting bigger and bigger and bigger over time because that count value is always increasing all right whoops I didn't mean to close that I don't know what's in that history although this is only use this browser for making these tutorials that's all right all right here we are all right okay so I'm gonna take out this console log refresh now what do I want to do now each time I need to draw right what I want to do is draw an ellipse right so let's say I'm trying to draw an arc actually let's say I'm trying to draw this one here between 3 & 6 well I know that the I could use the ellipse function the ellipse function and I need an X or Y in the diameter so the X the Y is gonna just be a fixed is I'm gonna do this plot this on basically a horizontal number line the X is going to be the 4.5 these start plus the end / right the center and the diameter of this circle again this is just a way to visualize it maybe you want to do it it totally the R will be an ellipse with diameter of 63 the end the next the start so if we think about this what I'm what I what's important here if I'm going to do the drawing right here the diameter is next index the xvalue is sorry the xvalue is what did I say next plus index / this is assuming there's one pixel per one pixel per number and then I could draw an ellipse I'm just gonna draw a full ellipse now at X the Y is I'm just at the Y at 0 and with this diameter what did it what key command did i time out for a second what key command did I hit that's like got this weird thing at the bottom now like I have something in the view panes yeah what does that always been there I just only noticed it now where is that Oh interesting Simon is giving me a good comment in the chat about different ways to visualize it just though technically though the numberphile video am I correct that the numberphile video goes above for forward and then below for backwards or does it actually just oh it alternates each time I'm wrong about this ah alright but that's fine I can fix that that's fine oh so the numberphile video actually does that it doesn't I don't know why I was thinking it goes above okay thank you that is a very good point command+ no oh it's gone now right all right all right command + . command + comma oh there we go okay I think I am back tell me if you see me I'm gonna try to get my computer screen back yeah and then get the chat back open up Chrome and say history here we go oops um okay great thank you I can see I'm just gonna put the chat over here so I can see it close this close this okay so I assume it froze while I was whoops trying to figure out this command period thing to get that this bottom thing appeared right so I'm actually good in terms of continuing the live stream like I didn't lose any of the actual coding of the recommence all right hopefully that's correct correct okay okay so I need to keep going here all right not rested I'm seeing more people I'm still it's still working right people are saying it froze again let me look at least look here yeah it says primary stream bad we are not receiving video data at a fast enough rate your viewers may experience buffering ensure your connection is fast enough or consider using a lower bitrate so I am going to I'm gonna just keep going because I think it's just a little wonky right now but it is not crashed so alright okay okay so let's see what happens let me add a stroke of 255 no fill and let me just see if what happens if these ellipses start appearing and the other thing that I should probably do is right oh I should just make the Y the middle of the window okay so and actually you know what I'm gonna do well that's fine this is fine this is fine okay we hit refresh and we can see okay circles are appearing so this I think this is already somewhat interesting that you can see this pattern that's emerging just from visualizing the the recommend sequence on a number line between 0 and 600 and eventually we won't see anything anymore because the numbers are getting way too big but let's try to make this a little bit more interesting and so I actually misspoke earlier I had watched the numberphile video earlier today and in some reason in my head I was thinking if I'm going forward I'm gonna go on the top if I'm going backwards I'm gonna go along the bottom and I think actually what what the comp that standard visualization or the one that's in that video is just alternating so I go forward I go forward I go look sorry I go okay I go forward above then if I'm going forward I go forward below then if I'm going backwards so it's always this it's more of a continuous loop so let me try to implement that so one thing first of all is what if I just want to draw the top of the circle the arc above the number line or below the number line well this is actually easy thing for me to do I can just change to using the arc function instead of ellipse I'm going to have to specify both the width and the height but now at the end of this I get to have a start and an end angle so if I say between zero and 2pi that's between zero and 360 degrees that's the entire circle so this this should look exactly the same but now if I were to say just go from zero to pi we can see here look I'm always getting just the bottom now if I were to go from PI down to zero I am getting the so what I can do is I can say if count modulus 2 equals zero do it one way otherwise do it the other way and there's probably more it might be like a more elegant way of doing this but this should be fine so let's I think I want to start the first one count is 1 and so that should be going I think I want to do it this way I want the first one to be over the top so now we can see there we go so this I believe should match precisely the circle starts with down up someone's telling me okay so let's try I mean let's try with count up once again this should be precisely the algorithm of a visualization that you find in that numberphile video if I got something wrong I'm sure I'll hear about it in the comments please let me know now let's see there's so much more to do with this going so far I don't need the index I could just use the array length that's a good point alright alright sorry alright so this probably should be the end of the video and I should be now giving you some exercises but I couldn't so you should pause right now and try something if you're following along couch what if like right now this I'm only seeing the results here because I'm layering each ellipse over and over again but what if I want to animate or change the scale like what if I want to sort of shrink the space as I'm drawing more and more circles I'm gonna need to store all of these arcs in some sort of data structure so I'm actually gonna do that right now just to add a little bit more to this video and then I'll give you some other ideas of things you could try to do at the end so what I want to add to this is I want to create another array I'm just going to call it arcs and I'm actually going to create an arc class I'm gonna use a little objectoriented programming so what makes up a particular arc well it has it has a start and it has an end and it has a direction so I'm gonna say this dot start equals start this dot end equals end and this dot direction equals direction so then all this drawing thing or I could take all of this drawing stuff and put it in a function in the object called show and the difference would be this would be saying this dot and minus this dot start oh you know what I should be doing the end can be this is a little bit this kind of worked by accident but this should really be absolute value right because the end could be before the start this would be a negative number I think p5 doesn't really care it's like negative diameter is the same as a positive diameter but that's probably better for me to put this in here and then I'm just gonna say if Direction equals zero I have the direction be zero or one X is also this dot and I shoot this dot n Plus this dot start / and so this should be good now and so what I want to do here is create a arc between index and next with the direction that is what did I say count modulus okay so this is what I want to create I want to say arcs push a and then in draw I can now set the background in draw and I'm just going to say for let um all the arcs I'll just call it a of arcs a dot show so this your beat I did this kind of quickly but basically if what I did is I just took the drawing code that I was doing kind of like live as the algorithm was going and I encapsulated the idea of drawing one of these arcs in an object and then I build up a big array of them so now I have this big array and every time through draw I want to draw everything in that array and this is going to allow probably you if okay direction is not defined this has to be a forgot the vista obviously alright so this should be exactly what we had before but here's the thing now this is actually an animation so let me try something what I have this idea which is I want to actually scale scale the visualization according to how far I am in the sequence so for example what I'm going to do now is I'm actually I think it might help to draw the arc everything centered around the left side of the screen so I'm going to draw the arc at 0 in draw I'm going to say I'm going to say translate 0 height divided by 2 and then I'm going to use scale so the scale function for example if I were to say scale like 5 that's gonna draw everything at five times the size at five hundred percent so you can see it's already like thicker and bigger at the start if I were to say scale 0.1 you can see everything is really really tiny now it's being drawn at 10% so what I want the scale to be right I have a window that is 600 pixels wide and so that each pixel is one number in the number sequence I want the whole number line if I've done five numbers I want that to be the width so I think I can actually just say scale with / count that should do it whoops yeah so now you can see it is like live adjusting itself to how how many numbers I've done so far and let us let me give myself there's really no reason let me give myself the full is this how I do this in p5 the full window width and height and let me actually also say style body oh boy I do not know CSS margin zero it's not going to do it I just don't want to have any padding is it is it padding is it a margin no no padding is this how CSS works no somebody tell me how CSS works no on the CSS comma oh no I need these padding0 semicolons yeah pick say pixels is this does this call and go here no no there we go no so and let me make the I feel like the let me let me say the stroke wait let's try I mean I shouldn't try to get into anything that's to do with the visuals well let me just make the stroke weight a little thinner because maybe it'll be interesting to see some space between them and let me get rid of here and let me save refresh and now we can see this is chi mean this to me is sort of interesting to see this sequence now here's the thing this is actually what I would like to see what I would like to see is instead of right now I'm just stamping the entire arc but I think it might be really beautiful to watch if I actually animate each arc you would also be much slower like right right now to slow it down just as sort of like a bit of a kind of hacky solution I could say something like frame rate five it'll look very stuttery we can see you know each one is being applied one at a time but what if I were to actually see that full arc kind of animate itself I think that would be kind of nice so if you watch the numberphile video you'll see people have made like coloring pages out of this and done all sorts of visualizations I mean to me like animating it thinking about color it could this be polygons that have fills to it could you put this into like 3d space where the Z is changing over time you know maybe you want to draw something that's not just an ellipse or an arc or maybe all the arcs are lower I think there's probably a lot of possibilities there here's what I want to do I want to do so I hopefully you'll do something hashtag coding recommen share with me your gifts and animations and screenshots on Twitter and in the comments here and through the website contribution system I'm gonna do one more coding challenger and do this again but instead of doing something visual I am going to play each one of these numbers in the sequence as a musical note and this is not my own idea this is also an idea that is talked about in the numberphile video and produces the kind of spooky quality to it okay thanks and I'll see you in coding challenges recommend sequence part 2 music edition all right it's very slow right now by the way all right um questions show it fullscreen yeah I probably should do that all right so let me do this let me record an intro let me actually do it much slower hello you were about to watch a coding challenge to create this pattern think be slow frame way it was kind of pointless and let me just say what's like I think if count is greater than window with just say no loop let's try this just hello welcome you are about to watch a coding challenge to produce this pattern which is a visualization of something called the recommend sequence so this is the end result I'm this is a little experiment showing what happy end of this video and now watch the video is that too short uh it was like I rushing through it let me let me do another one just case hello you're about to watch oh I feel like I just needs the train whistle or the melon or the the headband don't tell me it's like seven o'clock already and all I'm gonna do today is just this one coding challenge but might that might actually be the case I'm not gonna do more I just don't know what happened to the train whistle do you think someone came oh no it's hiding over here add colors yeah I think I won't I guess I could add colors I I had some complaints I'm not gonna add colors hello welcome to a coding challenge the recommend sequence I just completed this coding challenge it will start in a moment the project that I attempted to do is a visualize a numeric sequence called the recommend sequence I'm going to explain it to you this is based on a number file video that I will link to in this video's description as well as lots of other information and there will also be a part two of this that you can watch after you watch this one if you want alright so this is the end result I think that you after you watch this could make many more beautiful versions of this with creative ideas that I couldn't possibly imagine so I hope that you do and share it with me on Twitter hashtag coding recommen see ya after this intro please scale it down to the biggest number of this series not the counter oh shoot that is so a such a good point so how do I let biggest equal zero yeah Oh index yeah so here if shoot this I really should be doing in the video if index is greater than biggest biggest equals index and then the scale should be biggest divided by count let's try this what did I get wrong there bitrate is dead make a tiny full video oh is that gonna kill the bitrate what did I do wrong there Oh with / biggest what I that was just I don't know what I wrote there yes this is what I meant shoot so let's see yeah okay so first of all is this gonna survive bitrate wise well this is much better processing would be weighted do this in processing I just wanted to do this because I was gonna use the p5 alright hold on hold on everybody so we're gonna have to deal with this okay guess what guess what this video is not over yet I realize in the chat I got the comment which is I can't believe I didn't think of myself which I actually I can because I never think of these things well I really shouldn't be scaling to the to the where the in where the count is I should be scaling to what's the biggest number that's been been part of the sequence so far what is the end of one of these circles I'm not actually seeing the full sequence right now so if I go back into my code and I add something which I just did if I have a variable called biggest equals zero then what I can do is each time through step I can check it's basically if index is greater than the biggest number then I want biggest to be that new index and then here I want to scale not by the count but by the biggest number so let me add that in hit refresh and you can see now I know I max this is what I meant to show you this is now I believe the visualization that you will find in the numberphile video so what can you do I hope you will make your own creative twist on this you can think about different ways of visualizing this besides just arcs you could think about using color you can think about putting this in 3d space I mean what would the zaxis mean in terms of visualizing this I would love to see it animate right now it is currently just you know this stamp of each ellipse one at a time what if you drew animate the full of its arc one at a time what if you animate that arc so ship make those exciting different versions of them to share them with me on Twitter hashtag coding recommen and there's also if you look at the coding train dot the Cody Trent comm webpage that's in this video's description there's a place with instructions of how you can submit your own version of this there as well okay so I hope you enjoyed this coding challenge I am going to come back in a moment and I'm going to do one more version of this but instead of visualizing it I'm going to play it as musical notes and those musical notes are will sounds like something I forgot what I was talking about and this is so something that's in the numberphile video and I thought it'd be worth exploring the p5 sound library as well alright see you soon yeah I should lurk yes I should be lurking yes I should be lurking I should be lurking I'll add that I'm not going to put that in I'm gonna make a variable called scale I'm gonna say scale equals lerp scale with / biggest 0.1 or something like this and then I'm gonna say scale by scale here we go that's so much better okay I'll leave it as an exercise yeah all right but it's gonna be for the full screen now here's the thing I'm going to redo the intro does this is this gonna be okay bitrate wise yeah I could calculate yeah all right so I'm sort of looking at the chats why stop talking all right all right I'm gonna record the intro to the intro hello in this video you're gonna see me do a coding challenge where I make this visualization this is a visualization of the recommen sequence I'll talk about what that number sequence is how it works and then write the code to draw this using javascript in the p5 library this is all thanks to and inspired by a number file video which I will also reference and you can find links to in the video's description so I know apparently it's spooky all right so that was is it still going oh it's actually still going that's crazy I really want to do this in processing actually because I could generate a much larger yeah all right I am recording yes but then when I upload it to YouTube it's just going to recompress it anyway so alright alright so I am pretty happy with this coding challenge video now now what I want to do so first of all let's go here I think there's like a button here where you can listen to it right where is that ah right am I crazy I thought there was like a button where you can listen to the number sequence listen oh listen right here oh okay hold on let's see if you hear this do you hear this I don't hear it I'm not hearing it hold on let me let me see if I can make sure I hear it sound oh it's downloading something play as MIDI okay sorry so what's this kind of open with QuickTime Player will that actually work cannot open played MIDI I'm now googling play a MIDI file GarageBand I'm not gonna open up GarageBand just to play a MIDI file alright fine I I will break my own program to play online upload mini file oh boy this is bad this is bad I don't like the looks of that website I'm gonna have to write my own audacity will play a MIDI file let's see about density will what ancient software is this downloads bad bird is a MIDI file not an audio file Oh file import MIDI file import MIDI play play play today I see it I see the notes selection start and VLC yeah there's some party going on in the hallway I don't know what it is there's like summer camps and different things going on here VLC VLC you gonna play it no suitable decoder can I export this file export export MIDI oh my goodness alright yeah I can write my own MIDI player I could open up GarageBand alright I'll open up garage I don't even know if I've GarageBand installed on this computer but let's let's just try that I actually kind of know wait I don't have GarageBand on this computer yeah I do not have GarageBand on this computer there's YouTube videos with recommend sequence audio yeah MIDI upload MIDI file player let's try this that's what I like this website online sequencer net import all right upload mini file all right and the whole point is I was gonna do this myself anyway so forget about it I don't need to I mean somewhere in this video oh yeah it's the beginning okay this is good hold on hold on I gotta get it so you can hear this I got two sorry I'm confused here multi output device think this is piping the audio out through hola hola okay all right here we go so I want to make sure I um let's make a second one let's call this viz let's call this a music and let's go to here and okay all right oh I still have I have this awful it's over here oh this is where such a doofus I was like changing the wrong light there we go better I think that's good now okay okay I'm gonna do this or I can't do the oh I think I you guys definitely hurt myself there all right okay we're ready for this p5.js reference we need an oscillator with p5 sound there we go oscillator an envelope this is what we need yep and then we need okay all right all right oh this video is pretty good too alright recommends sequence whoops sorry hold on youtube.com watch this is a really ridiculous way that I am getting to this video but it shall work like this all right here we go everybody let's cycle these cameras all right people telling me not to dance you know what I'm gonna dance well Jeff we heard something there okay hello I back for another coding challenge about the recommen number sequence inspired by this numberphile video hola to the wonderful let me try that again the only reason it sounds spooky is because of the arbitrary choices using a chromatic scale that's a very important there's a very interesting comment point three replies boy they have like okay hmm what's the alright hello I'm back in this video I'm do another video about the recommends in the previous video what I did was visualize it and you can see here this is me vision this is not me but this is the p5 code I wrote to visualize the recommend number sequence as a continuous series of arcs it looks like they're circles but they're actually connected arcs you can watch the previous video where I go and build this whole code but one of the things that people that you can do also with number sequences besides visualize them is create an audio version of them and in fact if you go back to mine your favorite website entirely in the entire world the online encyclopedia of integer sequences you know if I'm here on the recommendation and it will give me a MIDI file MIDI being a system for encoding music as numbers so if I can encode music as numbers and I have a number sequence then I can make that number sequence MIDI and then I can play it as music so this is what I want to try to do and I'm going to attempt to do it with the p5.js sound library making use probably and this I don't really know that well so we're doing a lot of looking up in the reference while I do this learn to do it with an oscillator to generate a sound and the envelope an envelope to kind of craft that sound essentially creating my own synthesizer should also mention that um this video was pointed out to me from Dale Gert Amon which is also visualizing the sequence and a completely different way with colors and also making it into audio so I hope after watching both of these we will see a world full of I mean I don't know do we want this world I think why not let's see a world full of visualizations and audio versions of numeric sequences okay so let's start coding again I'm gonna close these windows I'm gonna go here and let's think about this so do I want to I'm going to keep the visualization going and basically so I could start from this code I'm gonna add to it and what I want to do is I want to play a note so let's see if I how to best to do this so the first thing that I know that I need to do is I need to create an oscillator an oscillator is an object that will generate a tone and there are different kinds of oscillators right I it's basically a pure sound wave and I can have a sine wave or a triangle wave and I believe I have a video about p5 oscillators that will go into that perhaps a bit more but I thought what I'm gonna do is I'm just going to take this code exactly as is and I'm gonna paste it in to set up your coding challenge copy paste from examples and then I'm going to create make that a global variable and I'm going to discover what interesting error I will have now so p5 oscillator is not a constructor why do I have why did this come up why do I have this because I don't actually use the sound library that often and I didn't include it here I should use it more often so I'm going to go and add reference in my HTML file to the p5 sound library so hopefully that's gonna clear that error up great it's going do I hear anything mmhmm so let's go to the sketch and why do I not hear anything because I set the amplitudes to zero let's set the amplitude to one do you hear that that is the oscillator the sign oscillator playing the note playing a note the frequency so now let's think about this would I stop we have to get back so what I want to do here is I want to basically take the number and and assign it to a frequency so this would be kind of crazy but what I could actually do is just to get started with this is in the step function I could set the frequency whoops not in setup in step I could set the frequency to the next number the index so that's gonna I mean this is not gonna be that logical but I could actually just use the current value of the sequence as the frequency I in setup I want to just set the framerate to like 1 so it's just changing it less often let's do this and see what happens but instantly like I heard something for a second and then I don't hear anything anymore so why do I not hear anything maybe I will eventually oh is it really loud oh boy okay I better go rerecord that apologies so I better go rerecord that so there's a couple things I could do why let me see here let me do this yeah I'm sorry let me just tell me if this is better warning headphone warning I'm gonna have to go back and redo some of this tutorial so I mean we could probably fix the audio in post but I it's probably better for me just to redo it hold on is this okay right yes Austin that's the point that I want to make is this ok I just wanna I want to know if this is a reasonable volume and when I hit back does that make out like a piercing horrible crackle or anything too quiet okay what was too loud before all right all right all right right I'm splitting the difference here because people are telling me it was fine before I was too quiet it was fine before too quiet alright I'm gonna look at the slack channel which I've just to piano key frequencies thank you that's good okay all right I'm gonna leave it at this okay oops I'm in the wrong place all right so hold on let me go back let me back up a little bit I'm gonna just back up to where I set the amplitude to 1 okay so I don't know how this is gonna add it together but Matt we'll figure it out I'm gonna set the amplitude to 1 at 100% volume and now we can hear that sine wave okay very relaxing very soothing we could try different waves like a square and option I'm waiting for the livestream to catch up to that horrifying to that horrifying moment sorry everybody we won't use the square wave harsh okay I want to try triangle okay just warning you let me set the amplitude to zero point two okay here I'm about to try triangle I think sign is gonna be the nicest let me try this one more time everybody all right all right all right let me try this again then I go home and have dinner I was gonna do this from five to seven when we had 20 minutes left I'm only getting that nice list I made of all these things I want to do I'm just doing this but all right all right all right here we go okay I'm gonna change the amplitude to 1 and which is 100% volume I'm hit refresh so now you hear the sinewave now so what's what do I want to do here so I have this and I'm gonna click back here to stop the sound for a second I have this number sequence that's going up we can look at those numbers there 0 1 3 6 2 7 13 20 so what if I just took each number and assigned it and took the number in the sequence and made it a frequency so for example as I'm stepping through I could say oscillator frequency index right index is actually the number of that that's currently part of the sequence so if I do this and go back to here and click on this I don't hear anything do you hear something you might have to have headphones have it turned up eventually I think I'm gonna start hearing something so here's the thing there is a range of frequencies frequency as being a measurement of how many cycles of a wave per second we can start to hear it I kind of like that alright but maybe what I want to do so it's an audible range of frequencies if I search for this we can see like this is generally you know this is we can find out some more information about frequencies but really what I want our piano key frequencies like I want to know what are the frequencies or MIDI note frequencies is another way I could think about it and we can see here oh these are MIDI note numbers and these are their frequencies and there is actually a formula for doing this I'm gonna pause for a second ah soak a week saying F underscore zero frequency times two to the N divided by 12th power ret reference frequency meaning like middle C 432 all right what should I use people MIDI to freak index that's what I was going to I go to the Wikipedia alright okay so let's go back to this people are not cheering for me by the way if you can hear that let's go back to this page food so following equation gives the frequency F of the nth key as shown in the table so this is real it's just time out for a second this is way too distracting um how how audible is this cheering so aunt ki this is the frequency the square root of 2 the 12th root of 2 to the N minus forty ninth power times 440 is that the which could be written like this okay oh yeah this is what I want to do so okay all right it's very audible all right let me go back a little bit to where I ended off just sort of clicking out of this okay so for a while we didn't hear any notes and then all of a sudden we started to hear stuff so this is much too arbitrary to just put the looks elsewhere Oh No ah I'm so distracted by the cheering it's making me crazy okay so for a while we didn't hear any notes and then almost when we started to hear something so here's I think it's much too arbitrary to just set the number from zero to whatever as the frequency there is a specific audible range or frequencies that we can hear and so and there also are formulas for converting from MIDI notes to frequency and back and forth I'm sorry about this applause there's nothing to do with me clearly there's nothing going on in the hallway there's nothing I could do about it right now it's gonna be in this video forever but um and so I pretty sure that p5 has a like MIDI to frequency or two note or something function somewhere but I'm actually I'm not gonna use that I'm gonna go to this Wikipedia page which I have loaded up here called piano key frequencies and if you look at this this formula here I want to use this basically if we number all the keys on the piano from the very bottom key to the top key I can't remember how many keys are on a piano eightyeight Keys standard 108 key extended we can actually find the frequency of any key n through this formula sure we could think about this in interesting ways but I'm just gonna go and use this formula so look at this I'm going to say so if the if the recommen all these numbers and I'm just gonna do from zero to 88 like I'm not gonna let it go forever if I consider each one needs to be a key on the piano then we should be able to play the music so this is very distracting all right okay so I want to say the the frequency is and go back to this formula 2 to the n 49 okay so power 2 and n which is index 49 divided by divided by 12 times and I believe it was 440 it's for 440 I wonder for 40 is like middle C or the note a I think it's the tune to a 440 so a is like the 440 is a Hertz is the is the note a so so now if I were to say this and let's console.log index and the frequency just to hear it and I also want to just go to setup and I'm gonna if I already had set the frame rate down to 5 and anticipation of this but I'm actually set it to 1 to make it even slower all right let's take a listen do you guys hear those very low notes I use index mod 88 that makes sense so it's kind of loud alright so I can't seem to get those really low notes to play let's increase the frame rate so first of all I will need to add an envelope to this the whole point of this I wanted to sound somewhat nice so what is an envelope so in addition to the oscillator there is this thing called an envelope and an envelope has four elements to it they're actually described right here and I have a video all about this which is attack decay sustain release so you're thinking about playing a note like when you hit a note on the piano there's the sort of attack there's the notes for fading out there's the sustain there's the release all those four things there's various parameters I'm just gonna kind of use a default setting and I'm gonna go to this example p v dot envelope and it sort of looks so let's let's grab thank you well that's a crab putting because I have fake applause sound effect and then there's people applaud answers so I'm gonna grab all of this stuff these settings for that envelope I am going to create an envelope I hope to rerecord this video sometime I'm going to create that envelope right here and then I'm gonna make the envelope sorry before I make the oscillator so I basically want to use the envelope in the sense as a wrapper around the oscillator the oscillator is going to give me the quality of the sound and the frequency is what kind of wave it is and the envelope is gonna allow me to make it feel like I'm almost playing a key on a synthesizer and so now if we go and look here we can see envelope dot play so now so the amplitude gets tied to the envelope so instead of saying amplitude of one I'm gonna say awesome amplitude envelope and then I'm just gonna say envelope dot play let's try this and I need to start any frequency on envelope top play okay so then I want to then I want to also comment this out right now and just we should just hear one note you hear that so what I'm going to do now is I should be able to then say I should be able to set the frequency and play the envelope again so here I'm going to set the frequency and I'm going to play the envelope again I am going to not set the frequency here or play the envelope here and let's see what we get these okay that is loud I don't know if I just totally destroyed your ears one thing that I can do here that would be kind of nice would be to make this actually index mod 88 so that if the index goes higher than the last key on the keyboard it will then wrap back down to the bottom one and I almost feel like what I want to do is use a smaller range but let's try this I'm going to turn the volume down a little bit how's the volume as you can I'm terrible at doing stuff with music and sounds please work hopefully you can come up with something maybe make it sound beautiful you know perhaps we have achieved something spooky I don't even know if I'm doing this correctly but anyway I said I was gonna make this video and I made this video all right so thanks okay all right hold on this video is not over yet getting a suggestion from the chat from K week mom saying you will get more musical results by restricting the range a bit I'd say two octaves top so what I should be doing here is basically two octaves right would be how many notes total 24 C C sharp D d sharp e F fsharp G gsharp a a sharp B that's 12 then I have C so that's 12 notes total so if I so I want like range of two octaves would be twentyfour notes but maybe I would allow the last note so I would have twentyfive notes so I would maybe I want to say something like the the N is index plus I don't start up somewhere like plus 48 modulus 25 is that like crazy Oh 14 and minus fortynine that's interesting okay so is this does this make any sense at all let's try a little bit higher like 24 48 96 what Oh cuz I'm I'm module no no no I want to modulus the 25 plus 48 this better so anyway now you see that I have no addition having no visual Talent I also have no musical talent I don't know that much about music but I played the violin and I attempt to play a very out of tune ukulele the 49 is no longer needed that kind of makes sense right I could just take out the that's an interesting way of thinking about it if the modulus whoa whoops is the modulus is the modulus 25 writer should be 24 oh boy all right let's pretend that didn't happen we're gonna edit back sweat and got the ukulele the ukulele oh those are weird edit or something there as I went off the deep end anyway all right so this is the end of my video I've said that so many times share with me your musical compositions based off of this number sequence or other number sequences and ways that you discover and I look forward to seeing you in future coding challenges okay goodbye boom I'm gonna dance my way out of this so one thing do it at 60 frames per second it's like flight of the bumblebee but the I need the envelope to be quite different I think okay all right I I'm gonna let people figure this out themselves okay all right this so forth so I guess I guess this live stream was all about the recommends it's 7 o'clock is there something in my list that I made that I could possibly do I okay I definitely don't want to talk about convolutions right now the flocking coding challenge is too long Charlie it's 7 o'clock I think I might just leave it at this for today there's something else in there om l5 let's try doing let's do this ok we're gonna do the ml5 thing let's do the ml5 thing just as like just to try so let's let me just see if I have any messages here who I have a message I don't know if Chris if you are still watching but I just saw your message from an hour and 40 minutes ago which is pretty awesome okay so I have all these text messages let me make sure that everything is okay pizza delivery is on the way babysitter at home everything's fine let me talk about my plans for the summer no no no let me just go and do this ml5 stuff okay okay what I need to do is just bear with me for a second what branch is this in so what I'm doing right now is so here's the thing I kind of want to do this ml5 video today just to kind of do something with ml5 but there's a new release of it coming out next week that hasn't been published yet there's some kind of key API changes so I want to I want to kind of use the updated version that's not officially published yet and by the time this video comes out it'll match so let me see if I can grab this so I'm just grabbing the full ml five examples repositories of repository go back to the slack channel here and why did that not okay I don't know why that happened so I'm now grabbing this repo okay here we go now I am going to go into that repo I want to just make sure I have everything boy okay I do and then I want to say get checkout I want to look at pull request this pull request 1/5 I want to go I want to deal with this branch ok so I want to do this ok and then I want to look at the files there should be thought in this branch there was like a temporary time so let me just look here I might have to like build it or is it did I just not notice it I'm looking for the prebuilt where do I browse files here well hold on let me just look did I just miss it that's weird I guess it's not committed in the repo so but it was merged ok let me think about this let's go one step further and let's actually go and grab the actual library is there a did we commit oh we do have a that's interesting that's from 11 days ago was this merged maybe it wasn't you know this is the where is the what I'm looking for is yeah this one was this one merged looks like it was a day ago so but this distribution is from 11 days ago that's weird well let's try to build the library so I'm gonna clone the full ml5 library I'm looking if somebody maybe in the I'm gonna so I'm gonna clone the full library then I am going to look at these instructions for developing where are those contributing I think they're in this okay so now so this is by the way what I'm doing right now is something that the whole idea of ml 5 is to make doing some machine learning tasks in the browser friendly and simple but I'm kind of doing some library development itself now which is not what you would need to do to use ml 5 I'm just doing this for my own just to try to prove sort of compatibility issues but so I'm gonna go into that I'm gonna hit npm install so here we're gonna install all the node packages and then I don't want to do this I want to build yep then I'm gonna do NPM run build which should give me the most recent built version of the library I'll have to wait for this to finish hey once again the chat is talking about what programming language it's really so uh okay great we should all run our own sanity check failing left and right now I'm gonna try this run build so let me just open this up for a second 704 p.m. so I'm going to just delete these files and I'm gonna say NPM run build so everyone's asking about this song here's the thing this song it's Adam plow who is a friend of mine from college he is that television and film music composer amongst other things I'm sure and he like he does the music for the tfx show you're the worst I think anyway he composed the coding train theme song which is the thing that you see in this thing over here but I once I was emailing with him and I was like oh I'm like thinking about getting sort of like stock music he's like oh I have this thing I made you can use that and he sent it to me that's what it is I don't think it's anywhere on the internet but here but you can tweet at Adam Lau on Twitter and ask him more about it okay so it looks like it looks like I have successfully built a new version of the ml5 library so I can now go into and I can say p5 G B image I'm gonna say image classification and then I'm gonna go into that I'm going to open that up I'm going to go here I'm gonna paste ml5 in I'm gonna delete this and I'm going to add here ml v dot Minjae s okay and now we are going to go here and then actually I know I have other terminal windows open yep terminate and on a server okay let me look now at let me just review so what I want to actually create is I'm going to I'm going to look at the code and then kind of like build it as a coding challenge I'm gonna go into ml five examples p5.js image classification video just open this oh I don't know why I just went here I mean the weirdest place ever but that's fine create capture mobile net via model ready and then predict got result err results okay great okay great and if I want to do it with a video an image okay okay all right I think I am ready oh yeah all right people are there's some guessing going on as to what version of node I'm running hey that's not so bad that's not so bad that's like you know what's you know it could be much older than current version of node I guess I'll just go tonight only this yeah big deal look I I take this very seriously I have a person who falls under the category of most users I am NOT a person who falls under the category of clang I have most users so I am at eight point nine only a couple versions behind what's recommended for most group for most users okay node update new NPM update computer computer Alexa no ok Google update node none of these things are working for me I don't know why food I don't know if I could do this all right mobile net image nets boy slow internet okay just looking is there like a JSON file in here that just says all of the labels like what's a label in like if I search I should really sign in here this is making me crazy sorry looking at my foot let's I I forgot what I was doing I gotta get my two factor authentication going okay somewhere in this repo I believe is can I search right in this repository no I thought there's like a JSON file that has all the labels that are in mobile net I've seen this before oh I forgot about that I'm like setting off people's al exa s sorry about that I'm looking for all the labels is it here maybe I should just look for mobile net classes no it's funny because I've used this before where is it I don't know what's going on out there does anybody know where I could find out basically like what the 1000 lei Buhl's are I feel like this is well is it could I actually just find it on the imagenet website this looks different than what I remember imagenet being visual images bounding boxes features right these these are all the labels but there's more mobile net just has a thousand so that's a subset of this google image net labels ya know as I know all right hold on here's a way of doing this I don't know why so this has to be in there somewhere so I should be able to search this repo so there's no file all right I've seen this there's actually just a paper that there's like a total Twitter discussion about what's in there it's literally the first link Oh API Docs Python on somebody's what's the first link on which page somebody just somebody just posted it API Docs Python tear okay model from JSON mobile net Python Kara's models model from JSON here we go Google Image net labels this doesn't seem to be what I'm looking for imagenet labels ah here we go it's literally the first link thank you [Laughter] all right tabby cat all right here we go whoo where did this come from all right well I will use this great thank you yeah okay okay all right folks I'm running out of steam here but let's see if I can get a little further give me a second I know I need bear with me everybody I am going to where where where where is and all five examples on this computer what was the name of that branch I just want to have that code for reference updates okay all right just about ready here everybody thank you for your patience leave this open another reference something else for lunch rest from me oh so now I just need a few images all right just thinking about this for a second okay all right everybody I am now actually going to do something this will be my last bit for today and thank you for tuning in my elbow against this filing cabinet here and I have very very sensitive elbow so this is the elbow that I broke last summer you can see I have like a huge scar on it and I have a lot of titanium and this arm it's really pretty much fine and I could do just about everything it's a little bit weak weaker than this arm but it's very sensitive by peg it's okay all right I don't know about this but I'm gonna do this anyway welcome to the last thing that I'm going to make I'm going to give myself a little reference over here I'm just going to check something okay okay everyone hello this strangely is a coding challenge so let me try to explain this to you what I'm thinking about I'm going to in this video make a webpage I'm gonna start over I'm gonna start over because I'm actually just gonna let's first make sure this works on this computer okay hello greetings from lab coat bolo tie me person thing so this is a coding challenge I'm gonna make exactly this what you are seeing here is a web page that is taking a live video free from my webcam and attempting to classify what it sees it's with some text on that page so let's see let me see what's the chance that it knows this no it doesn't know what this is oh let's try this bottle water bottle tripod what about okay let's try oh I got one I got one for you got one for you yeah okay alright hold on we are starting over now I don't need to refresh this I'm the widest at that hello it is me you're a friendly neighborhood oxygen mask tennis ball lab coat person thing alright so this is a coding challenge it's the first time on this YouTube channel called the coding train that I may use a new JavaScript library that I've been working on with a lot of people here at ITP new york university school of the arts called ml5 and i'm going to recreate this particular ml5 example which is taking a live video image from the web camera and attempting to classify it now what i want to do this for is i want to have a talk what talk about machine learning and I want us to I want to have the discussion about why it's not magic what where it works where it fails and sort of thinking about data and models and I want to make a lot of videos about this and eventually those videos are going to be part of a tutorial sequence about ml5 and the basics of machine learning I'm not really ready to do that yet so I'm just dipping my toe in there by just doing a coding challenge to try to recreate this example now here's the thing why is this what where's this stuff coming from why is it think I'm a lab coat I mean that's not such a bad guess for me frankly well let me just come over here and grab this particular ukulele that I happen to have it's very out of tune I'm not gonna play it for you right now and I'm gonna put it here and we're gonna see that it recognizes that as an acoustic guitar acoustic guitar so with a violin or fiddle it's got a very high confidence that's amazing didn't recognize that as an acoustic guitar and yet here I am hey lab coat so what's going on so this particular example is running using something called mobile net mobile net you can go to this link here and read this very a depth indepth academic paper called mobile Nets efficient convolutional neural networks for mobile vision application what I'm showing you is how to use a pre trained machine learning model meaning somebody already took the time to train a model saying hey look model machine learning model here are all these images and this is what's in those images learn from this so that you can then look at new images and try to guess what's in them based on what you've learned well anytime you do this you've you've got a problem because what what images were used to train train that's model what was there an image of somebody with a beard and glasses and a nice lake blue shirt with a flamingo on it and it could just say person with like blue shirt and flamingo know this in fact this particular mobile net model these are all of the labels or things that it knows how to recognize prairie chicken African Grey macaw sulphur crested cockatoo go it's very good at all like these obscure strange obstacles somewhat in here acoustic guitar but nowhere in here ukelele right I can't find ukelele in this list well I didn't get for the code just bear with me this is so important machine learning is not magic it only will recognize what it's been trained and so while this image this this particular model pretrained model called mobile net was trained on a database of images called image net you can go to the image net website and read more about it but this is the thing this database of images was really designed for computer scientists and people were studying machine learning to do some research but it wasn't necessarily designed to be practically applied in the diverse world of many many things that we have here so anyway I want to like this is the first thing that I want to talk about but we can use it we can experiment that we can play with it we could see where it works where it fails and then as I make more videos we're gonna look at how could I retrain it with my own data how could I make my own but I want to just start by making this thing and so that we can play get our hands in it see that see how it works just just give it a try I okay I feel gonna like redo this whole thing because I went on for way too long alright we're gonna try this one more time and matsyas gonna use whatever and once he is sorry everybody most of you should have gone to sleep by now like an hour ago I just want to see if I can do this again in a less convoluted explanation way what that was only a minute 30 seconds are you serious I felt to be like I was talking for 10 minutes well I'm gonna do I'm gonna oh yeah burger Bob is asking about workflow and not getting to that today but I wanted to update some of the stuff that I'm using like visually yeah exactly Visual Studio curlier live server all right hello it is me your friendly neighborhood OBO bolo tie lab coats what's going on here hello I am going to do a coding challenge that has to do with machine learning I'm gonna use in this coding challenge a library called ml5 I'm actually here on the ml5 website friendly machine learning for the web this is a new library it's being developed at ITP which is a graduate program here at Tisch School of the Arts New York University it's where I work I've probably talked about that before links all about that in the video description now there's so much here that I want to talk about and go through and I plan many videos almost like a tutorial playlist of videos about machine learning concepts and beginner steps working with this ml5 library I'm not ready to do that yet so I'm just gonna do a coding challenge where I recreate this particular example and what this example is doing is it is getting a live feed from this webcam and it is trying to guess what is in that image and you can see it's getting it terribly wrong now I can get it to do something correct I'm gonna come over here and get this ukulele and you can see this it confidently registers this as an acoustic guitar so why did it work with that but when I jump and stand in front of it it thinks I'm a bowtie again which isn't such a bad guess it's suppose labcoat so what's going on so this example this is a machine learning image classification example but it's not magic it came from somewhere and where it came from is something called mobile net so this particular example I'm gonna write the code for it is going to load behind the scenes a pre trained model called mobile net what is mobile net mobile net is a pre trained model that researchers created that used this other thing called image net image net is a database of 15 million images that are all labeled this is a bird this is a donkey this is a turkey know why those things that are popping into my head this is a acoustic guitar but it wasn't necessarily made for a use case that you might be thinking about or something that's going to be applied to a particular problem it was really named for research into how image classification works so there's a lot missing from there we can actually go to this page here and see these are all of the labels that are actually in their handheld computer harmonica a horse cart iPod so we can see like okay iPod is in there so if I go and grab this glowing rectangle device we can see look at it because it's a lab coat I guess I probably have to turn it on okay anyway cut that out that didn't work he really recognizes the phone pretty well it's a meat cleaver this is why I love I love for this to fail because we have this thought that is all just this like magic working stuff but what I the point of me making this video in this tutorial is one is the Strega ml5 works to allow you to make something to play with it get your hands in it to ask the right questions about what's there what's missing what's good about this model what's bad about this model so let's build the code for this and I'm gonna come back later and make many more videos and one of the things I burst rate is how to train on top of something that's pre trained so this is a pre trained model but I could actually instead of having to train a machine learning system from scratch I could actually take something that's been trained already and additionally train it with some new images but something I'll do in a later video okay so let's see so I'm gonna I'm gonna close this page out if you're still watching this I'm gonna go to this blank p5 sketch so the only dependencies here are the p5 library which I'm going to use for quick access to the webcam and then the ml5 library and I have that now downloaded as a file called ml v Minjae s if you look at the video description and go link to the code you'll see that you'll have it there now um you can also reference ml v as a URL just like I'm referencing the p5 libraries in here but I'll you know I'm gonna come back to all this when I do a more proper tutorial series about ml 5 all right so now let's first get the the camps the camera so I'm gonna say video and I'm gonna say video equals create capture I think that's what I say video and then I say like video dot start I don't remember how p5 works so I think this is how I create a video element on the page I'm gonna go to running my code right now go look and there's the camera what did I get video dot start is not a function I don't need to say video not start probably so I'm gonna run this we can see oh there's the video now I could that's the video element on the page now I'm actually what I want to do is I'm going to a hide it and then I'm going to add a draw function and I'm gonna make this 320 the canvas 320 by 240 and I'm just gonna draw the video to the canvas this is not necessary but you know if I want to use this as a component in some other algorithmic drawing thing I can actually just hide the raw video element and draw to a canvas so I'm gonna do that and we should see now there it is look so um that's smaller probably the videos native side is 640 by 480 I can shrink it down and I'm gonna do that just to shrink it down and then make this a little bigger and then I'm nice and picks later okay hello it's me green screen all that Sirsa all right so now now I have the video how do I now create the image classifier well this is one of the things I love about ml 5 I'm going to make I'm gonna actually call it mobile net I am going to say mobile net equals ml five dot image classifier so ml 5 has a function all of the functions inside of ml 5 are namespace so if you have only used P 5 P 5 is kind of nontraditional in that you could just call stuff globally like create canvas or image these these functions that I'm calling here are I don't say P 5 dot create canvas and this is this is a part of a design decision p5 to be very beginner friendly but it can be a problem with JavaScript libraries that you don't love using two libraries and they both have the same function name so this all the functions are names based under ml5 so this creates an image classifier and there are many ways that you can make an image classifier in p5 I mean ml 5 what are the ways is by passing in a string with a reference to a pretrained model that you want to use now you can't just like make up anything you found on the internet and like pass it in there but ml 5 knows about the mobile net library so what it's actually gonna do this wouldn't work if I were offline like if my computer were not connected to the Internet this would not work because it's reaching out and behind the scenes downloading the mobile net model it's actually a pretty small file where the reasons why it's called mobile net it's highly optimized not for accuracy but for efficiency for like you know work run on a mobile device so I could say this and then I need to I think give it a callback where I say model ready because that actually takes some time like that that the models not gonna be ready instantly so I'm gonna write that callback call it model ready and I'm just gonna say console dot log model ready and so now I am going to refresh and I'm gonna see the model is ready now the other thing is I can use mobile net with static images of course I can do image classification but if I want to use it with a video feed ml5 is designed to sort of just know how to do that innately so as an optional second argument before I give it to the callback I can actually just give it the video element itself so I'm saying hey make an image classifier use the pre trained model mobile net always look at whatever is in the current this video element but also you know it just tell me when you're ready so now here we go I should see the video model ready I'm not sure why I wouldn't expected the video to appear and then model ready to come after I'm not sure why the sequence is happening that way but big deal oh you well I don't know I'm not gonna worry about that too much right now so now as soon as the model is ready what I want to do is ask for some information so I can now say mobile net dot predict so predict is the function that's going to say hey predict what's a prediction is the step that happens after something symmetry right so I've done a lot of video tutorials about machine learning and training them through the training process none of that exists in this video we're just saying hey somebody else did all this work to train this model it's published I can gain access to it through ml 5 which is a layer on top of tension flow digest all these different pieces um so I can just call predict now now predict is gonna take some time so I also have to give that a call back I can say got results and so now I'm going to write the got result call back got result and I'm going to put results the got result function requires an argument and inside that that argument is filled that the results Evette is filled with the results from the prediction so I'm gonna just say console dot log results and let's take a look at what we see now so the model is ready and undefined hmm that's not good I know the mistake that I made so here's the thing I forgot about this I'm so used to working with p5 and so used to this sort of like load JSON with a callback and got data and here's the data that I forgot that the way that p5 works is somewhat nontraditional for JavaScript libraries and actually most job and because p5 like optionally lets you check for errors and most job scribe Rarity's want you to say like hey no no you have to check for errors so actually this got result callback should have two parameters it's too big things are filled to arguments and error and results because I can say like so in other words if something went wrong the first argument would be the error if there is an error I could say console dot log there is an error and otherwise I can just say console dot log results so let's take a look at this now I'm already oh look at this we got something OOP got three things let's take a look at what's in there I'm so excited bowtie it's me Oh a Windsor tie or a sweatshirt I send such a sweatshirt but I think about myself I think about being a sweatshirt let's run this again and let's see what we got I'm a puffer fish excellent um so we can see that this is working now hmm interests strange this is a continuous video image so once I got that result what is it that I want to do well I could recursively just call got result again so there's different ways I could approach this but I what I can do is basically I'm saying like as soon as the model is ready ask for a prediction then when I get the prediction log it to the console and then ask for another prediction and in because I pass the video up here the image classifier model is going to know to always look at whatever's currently in that video so let's run this again and let's see hopefully the browser doesn't crash with me trying to do this a bunch of times I only thought once what did I do wrong here mumble net dot predict got results that should work so I'm thinking here what did I get wrong when in doubt refresh oh now it's working I'm uh scenario okay sorry edit the part where it didn't work for no reason probably and hit save alright so now we can see the console log it's like doing the labels over and over again we can look at tennis ball bowtie microphone there we go so now what do I want to do I what's in here for those so first of all by the way it gave me what's in here it gives me three it's an array with three objects in it each with a class name and a probability and the highest probability is first so one of the things you might notice here is that I can optionally like if I ask for I believe if I say comma 10 this would actually give me the top ten things that it thinks it is so we run this again and we can see now it's always giving me ten labels so I'm gonna be very basic about this and say just want one thing and then instead of console logging results I'm gonna say console log results zero dot class name so this would give me what it currently thinks it is and we should be able to see that in the console so we can see things I'm a laboratory coat and if I come over here and I put my ukulele up here we can see if we've got acoustic guitar so this now is essentially that exact example remade I you know I probably want to not look at the result oops not look at the results in the console so I might do something like say let label equals empty string and then in I'm gonna say background zero I'm gonna say fill zero and I'm gonna say text size sixtyfour and I'm going to say text label you know I'll just put it at the bottom of the whoops height how do you spell height I'm gonna put it at the bottom put it at like the bottom of the window and I am here instead of console logging it I'm just gonna say label equals whatever currently thinks it is and I'm going to hit refresh and now this is I can I'm going to have both the canvas and some text saying what it thinks it is I'm like does it know what Kleenex are thinks it's a remote control that's fascinating how about some tape some jewelry maybe that text is way too big anyway you get the point so now you've seen how this works so there are a bunch of questions that were in the chat that I'll mention very briefly I guess I can just leave this running here I know I keep hitting back number one is time out for a second I'm sorry hold on I'm just looking at the chat for a second okay oh I left 110 in oh yeah okay sorry the chat is just telling me that I left the 10 here it's not really going to make a difference in terms of speed okay so people are asking I in the chat kind of about and a little bit more about ml5 again I'm go to my intention is to do an introduction to ml 5 tutorial where I talk about sort of how Y where that project came from and what the pieces of it are I would recommend that you check out this article on AI TPS adjacent journal which kind of explains everything about ml 5 the people who worked on it and how it's built on top of tensorflow Jas I will just briefly mention here that ml 5 and P 5 are separate projects and the reason why ml 5 was called Pete called ml 5 was as an homage to P 5 say well P 5 did something to make programming in the browser drawing an animation friendly and accessible for beginners and approachable for beginners and ml 5 is trying to do it's having to do the same sort of thing with machine learning so I encourage you to poke around the ml 5 website hopefully this remix my coding challenge to do something with it maybe you can make one of the example projects that my brain is like totally melted it shouldn't be doing these live streams for like three hours to remix the coding challenge I made to use this in a project you could you know just for fun have it like try to create poetry or sentences out of stuff that the webcam is showing you could actually try using this with static images you know you can see an example of this on the ml 5 website where if I just take an image like cow wait a second what just happened here okay I don't know what just flashed on the screen there I'd never Google image search live while livestreaming make make some kooky project that shows labels for an image but really think about and be critical minded about what's in there what's missing in the data set of mobile networks this gonna work where's this not going to work um have some fun with it and I will see you hopefully in many future videos about ml5 good bye oh shoot all right I think I have to go I don't know I don't know if that's gonna I don't know if that's gonna make it as a video oh when will you be making games again I know I agree maybe next time I still have too many things to do I would like I was kind of interested in doing Tetris because it's been suggested a lot and I think it would be fun I really want to make actually have a question for the audience here I want to make the tesseract 4d tesseract let's see if I go and basically it should be an animation of it here this this animation I want to do a version of this in processing and I'm trying to decide whether it makes sense to try to do actually the sort of like matrix math calculations or to just compute in 3d like the vertices of two cubes and then interpolate between them to move stuff around I don't know if anybody has any advice I would like to know that well I made the font so big there I am a lab coat I am a Windsor tie I am a person or microphone a lollipop ice lollies would you like an ice lolly popsicle what's a popsicle in British English is the popsicle refer to anything I don't know I don't know I I came back to do a live stream how is that all right I will do the matrix math I made a matrix math library that's a good point all right I will try to take a few questions before I go and hopefully this live stream will turn into some edited videos that people like to watch I'm looking at the chat anybody have any questions for me before I go I'll put on my goodbye song when will you finish AG RI oh I forgot what I even need to do next for that hope I'm finished yet but I could I could try octree that's I did one do you know how to program C++ for Arduino all right thanks Marshall you promised you workflow hey so first of all I take issue with the promise I specifically said I doubt I'll get to all of this time now a drumstick can you make videos about Arduino I do have a recommendation for you if you're interested in videos about Arduino let's see if this shows up yep if you go to yeah if you go to Vimeo calm / channel / P comp there are tons of wonderful videos about physical computing there's actually looks like there's Raspberry Pi ones and so I really recommend these videos check them out ok so there's that what else is going on here promise yeah this promise was unresolved can you make the face detection and blurring the face into a video sequence that's interesting I don't know if I fully understand that question let me just check am I getting any important messages and now that's good alright I'm looking at the chat I was gonna wait yeah how long have you been learning coding I I would say since 2001 would be the answer I would give so you do the math but I but you know I but I did do coding a little bit in elementary school and middle school and even a tiny bit right after I graduated from college but I really didn't do coding until they really didn't do coding until 2001 Oh detecting face and blurring and automatically yeah that's an interesting idea for a project ooh the game Kinect for with the min/max algorithm in canvas this sounds like an awesome idea let's see if it's been suggested already connect what would I let me look for a min max maybe tictactoe with AI using min max algorithm or also connect for was just suggested now I like this idea so often what I do is assign it the sinus issue to myself when I like the idea okay excellent I like that idea what do you think about learning assembly in order to become a better programmer it's an interesting question Oh Marshall is suggesting also more tensorflow dodge as videos and note I would also like to do that I'm suppose that's about d3 okay let me try to take those one at a time attention photo just videos in node yes I would definitely like to do that the next thing on my list for tense flow des is convolutional neural networks we'll see when I can get to that but we're adding the node stuff certainly I would love to have that okay and then the other question was d3 I have done a little bit with d3 d3 is quite wonderful it's not my expertise it's not sort of what I natively know well that's a great thing for me to have a guest come do some d3 tutorials about it was one other question and I saw sorry but I missed it do I work for a company I work for New York University as my fulltime job I make these videos as part of classes that I teach at NYU the program's called ITP and also ima just participial of the arts and then the videos have kind of taken on their life is own so I kind of have a simple second parttime job here doing the coding train okay néstor asks how's life outside of the coding tre now are you a little bit overwhelmed it was hard to be traveling for a while also moved to a new apartment so I think my things is gonna slow down for a little bit over the summer but hopefully when I'm at work everyday in the fall that's where I record the videos is where is a building where I teach classes so hopefully things will ramp back up to speed in September oh it's the assembly question I missed thank you that's an interesting one you know I'm generally on the spectrum of you know do I need to learn every lowerlevel detail about coding for to like should I just kind of like experiment play around learn some stuff trying to make stuff I generally lean towards this end of the know it's not really a reason to learn assembly just to be creative and make stuff and learn about code and participate in this world of comedy this computational world that we live in that said you know admittedly I find things like assembly language kind of fun and interesting and exciting does that lower level stuff to be weird and crazy and I do like having that depth of knowledge myself personally so I think there's value if you find enjoyment in that if you were want to make if you have some idea for an app and you that's gonna help people do you need to go and spend two years in a cave becoming an assembly language expert nothing you need to do that in a cave I would say no but there can be some value and some enjoyment in learning a lot and certainly for research into the science of computing and understanding and lowerlevel how computers work it's a credible value but for being a person who's making stuff and doing data visualization or solving problems and trying to experiment with making art with computers you know you can find that you're a place on that continuum of where you're most comfortable is it tough to become a good programmer is it true you must be born into it no it is not true they need to be born into it programming is hard and you have to take a lot of time to mess up and be frustrated and anybody should it can be a part of programming and and triads and you don't have to have there's no such thing as some innate magical programmer thing that you're born with maybe for some people not for me not for I hope I think all of you watching except for some person that I don't know who's probably not watching but so I would say you should go for it it's hard and don't let don't let it get you down it's hard for everybody where did the names coding train and coding Rainbow come from coding Rainbow kit wasn't omage to a 80's television show called Reading Rainbow that I love but there were some issues with making something that kind of has the same name as something else which I should have been aware of and coding train was just somebody suggested it and I'm forgetting I really should keep track of this stuff better I'm gonna I can go back into my email and I said that this person a tshirt so after we suggested I like it I just like the like train so like the vibe of it people complain about the fact that I have this sort of like branding like I'm a kids show and it's like it was not for kids but I like that that's me so that's what it is good programming habits I don't have any good programming habits next question you should usually develop good programming habits I'm sure other YouTube channels have good programming habits oh okay everybody I have run out of steam I've been live streaming for three hours thank you for joining me I hope you found something useful I definitely think that the recommendation JH makes for a fine edited video to come out some point next week pretty sure that the music one also is fine and then I'm not so sure about I feel like I I don't know but whatever I think the ML v one is a good trial run for making video tutorials of ML five and I want to plan to make a lot of them okay I'm sorry I can't answer every single question I don't know when I'll be back next week i I really if you're a content creator establish a regular timeslot I'm just completely incapable of doing that but I do like Fridays so but I and I and I am using YouTube events to at least schedule stuff so if you want to you could subscribe but cookie alarm bell and then you get a notification when I scheduled an event and blah blah blah if you want there's no requirement to do that whatsoever but that's probably the best way you know you can also sign up to be a sponsor or a patron and I'm always posting in the the slack channel that's for men what's a cult any more like well I think I'm gonna do it this Thursday oh never mind so that's where you can get the most information but I will when I'm pretty sure about it I schedule it on YouTube thank you everybody I but don't take my code for it I like that suggestion I think I'm not gonna play the outro today I think I'm just going to press the button stop streaming I really and I'm gonna go home and I'm a nice weekend and yeah that's that oh hi Jaden first time watch our Jaden thank you I'm glad that you're still watching and oh yes so let me just the first of all I you know I understand that not everybody has the means our capability to subscribe sponsor or patreon whatever that is please do not feel any obligation to do so I love that you're watching the fact that you're watching and you don't even have to watch you're watching is really nice and if you're getting some value out of this that makes me really happy so I wish and hopefully there are other ways that we can create a community as you can participate in communities of people trying to do stuff with code and creativity and whatever just through the magic of this thing called the internet now if you are a member or a patriot patron and you do not have a slack invitation which Marshall just posted unfortunately this is a very awkward system for doing this so best thing for you to do is go to the I'm not going to open up the community tab and somewhere in there I have a post for sponsors only with a link to a Google forum so you try to find that if you can't find that message me on Twitter I try to get in touch with me you know you shouldn't be too hard to do so but the and I will get you that slack invitation I just have to do some kind of cross check to make sure it's the you have to give me your YouTube username and then I can see if that username actually met matches a sponsor and boy now I don't try to gain this system I'm just relying on the honesty good faith of the internet you just go to them the Google forum is the way I have to see that you have view of that anyway so Marshall hopefully can find it this I would love a better system while amazing that people in Malta are watching and I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I was I said I was gonna get home by 900 and I got a subway ride some way to catch new direction I go downtown not uptown now I live in another borough it's all very exciting moving is rough I just unpacking some boxes will be my weekend there's a lot of it's the mess and it's it's but I did get some air conditioning installed this week which was huge ok goodbye everybody I'm gonna I got to go over here and hit first I'm gonna hit stop recording that's me recording to disk Sweden Canada Germany amazing amazing and then I'm gonna hit stop streaming I'm actually gonna click the stop streaming button now this entire live stream will be available for you to watch as soon as I do this I am trying to get us set up for some live streaming from my apartment so that I could actually do dare I say more live streaming but more frequent shorter live streams I would I would love actually honestly I have this idea that if I just like live stream every day for a half an hour or something that that might mean there's some value to the longer ones but I don't know okay I'm stopping streaming goodbye have an eye
