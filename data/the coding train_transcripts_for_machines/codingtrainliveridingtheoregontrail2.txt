thank you foreign foreign foreign oh my mic is on [Laughter] you know I didn't realize my mic wasn't muted because the uh these there we go I I computer crashed and the audio's not playing this is a professional operation here people [Laughter] well how's my audio folks I'm gonna mute my mic for a second and see if I can get the music going thank you foreign hi that's right welcome to a sort of popup surprise spur of the moment uh Saturday 409 p.m eastern time live stream of the coding train that's right it's me Dan your friendly neighborhood awkward internet personality live streaming on a Saturday afternoon uh with a lot of incredible unanticipated technical difficulties in getting this thing going um and uh so feeling more unprepared than I did 20 to 30 minutes ago when I decided I've got a moment to just run into the studio and turn the lights on and get this thing going because I started a project yesterday and to be honest uh what I mean by started a project yesterday is I talked about the idea of a project yesterday four two and a half hours and then or I or I talked about other things for about an hour and a half I talked about the idea for an hour and so I wanted to keep the momentum here I don't know that the idea he that I that it's my intention to build this entire project entirely while live streaming but I do feel it's important to kick it off and get it going if I um want to make it possible for the community the viewers like you at home to be able to contribute and participate uh it is 9 p.m 10 p.m 11 p.m everyone 2 A.M no one is there anyone in the chat who was on eastern time I would like to know maybe uh maybe it is earlier in the day is it morning for and like uh is it is it early afternoon for anybody early morning maybe somebody from Hawaii uh um and okay uh zdax wanted to help out true bolt asks hey Dan I have a question when will you make a video where you try to make Geometry Dash on an Apple II Plus I'm sorry to disappoint you but Eastern Daily Time represents says bill yeah um that doesn't sound super likely but not out of the realm of total possibility I think it's more likely if I were to attempt some kind of version of Geometry Dash as a coding challenge that would be happening right here on my trusty uh Apple Macintosh laptop computer um for any of you who are uh supporters on patreon or YouTube membership I've got the Discord chat I'm going to try to keep my eye on it today I'm not gonna run two simultaneous YouTube chat and YouTube q a so if you've got questions throw them in the live chat just know that I basically the way that I interact with the live chat is I kind of peer at it every once in a while and there are some people who have that wrench icon who are moderators who can hopefully help answer some questions and please try to stay on topic and be friendly and kind to each other uh uh um in the chat um it's a freckle pasta hair maybe Tetris Tetris Tetris is really really missing from the library of coding challenges on the coding train so let's um let me talk about two things one uh a correction time I don't know if these really count as Corrections wait a second what hold on hold on I had some really weird stuff going on here that I do not want to uh I messed up my okay I put the wrong I I charge the sound board iPad up and um but I had placed the wrong one in the place with the sound board we'll see if we have some sound later not that we really need it because today is a work day I don't have time to just mess around on a Saturday afternoon if if I'm not taking a nap or playing Monopoly with my children or cooking dinner I better be doing something productive right here I just I started with the nap and then realized oh that's not a good look naps are underrated for me just nothing like a good nap I um I'm getting some Sounds here getting some messages all right um just just bear with me I'm trying to get the sound board going uh oh no go go yes sound cue okay hold on it's happening people the iPad I couldn't charge yesterday is charged Trust oh oh no no no I don't need to do this right now just unplug from there not now not now not now not now not now this is not what I mean to be doing welcome to the coding train where I hook up all the technology of the coding train at the beginning of the live stream you know what they say you got to capture the audience's attention right there at the beginning which is why I usually read random numbers because that really captures the audience's attention well we're doing that today people that's happening if we can get this going just give me a second we're back baby um okay let's do it here um oh okay one eight six two five two three six seven four five three eight five zero three two eight two seven eight one six four seven eight zero eight two zero zero zero four two zero six three five five seven four four eight nine eight zero one four one seven four six two three six eight three nine four foreign all right and with that I think we really can begin today's episode of the coding train C all of that manic energy that frantic neuroticism it's all melted away I am here with you I am the soothing internet coding person who calms your nerves and helps you work through those for loops uh was that music too loud okay sorry uh you remember you know how I did we get a new um did it so did a new member just join did I miss that tie lie welcome to the coding train come on on board where you will receive your very own random number six seven two four one by the way you should everyone should know that I've spent um many a year talking about these custom uh laser etched train whistles that I am making uh as a a token and a pre of appreciation a fun treat to be sent in the mail to supporters and members of the coding train and it's really happening folks um but the the new the truth is uh doing them custom with a custom number and a custom unique random uh random walk has proved to have defeated me uh and so I am um I don't want to say Mass producing them because that's not exactly accurate but I'm just having a batch of about 50 of these made they're all identical they will be numbered but they all have the same algorithmic patterns on them from a few different coding challenges the coding train train and uh this is for I can't remember which level but the conductors or the engineers not um so stay tuned uh if you're not in the Discord uh everyone is welcome and should be in the Discord that's one of the things that I forgot to show yesterday that I wanted to I have three things three Corrections from yesterday um but uh for any of you who are members and are wondering what's happening with your train whistle or or your stickers so some of you are expecting stickers please um con into the uh Discord and make sure you tag me or station manager or any of the um the the folks who help out there in the Discord okay um uh Frank asks are you a professor uh well technically speaking I mean there is a place where you can find the word professor and my name in the same web page and on the deployment logs of a university but I don't know so at some point someone's gonna uh that's I don't know how much longer they're having to be able to keep that up but yes and in fact I am returning to teaching live and in person at NYU uh this spring so I've I've been on leave for a bit which has been wonderful uh I I prothomash great to see you there in the Discord chat um and I'm going back to teaching all right let's go through the corrections and I'm not a CS so for warrior great name um uh pravesh I'm sorry that you have covet I hope that this stream can bring you some little happiness and and help you feel better uh I hope you feel better soon um I'm not uh just to make a correction I am not a computer science Professor uh I do not um uh I am part I I uh I teach at the uh Tish School of the Arts in the interactive media department so um yeah um okay um let's go to Corrections Corrections so a couple things one is let's see I'm very excited that we'll be returning back to the um Apple II today uh and and trying to Port a project here one of the things that happened yesterday do you see my face how I'm talking to you I had cropped it in obs cropped the video in OBS right about here and I didn't realize that so I was in this position most of the stream talking to the camera while typing I didn't look and check the whole time yesterday's live stream you don't see my face so uh I think I fixed it just now let me know if that's the case we'll come back here in a bit that's correction number one uh crook um correction number two uh let's see look at this I fixed my curiosity stream Banner so I I literally have a mulligan here uh today yesterday's stream and today's stream is sponsored by curiositystream and the reason why I was so excited uh for this sponsorship and this collaboration is I recorded a new course um if we go to here and here uh I you know I apologies for those of you tuned in yesterday that this is a total repeat but I imagine there's quite a few uh uh new viewers today um if I go to nebula.tv uh Slash what is code uh nebula is a wonderful streaming service uh built by creators including myself and owned by creators um and if you kind of want if you like a certain set of interesting educational YouTubers I have a feeling you're gonna find most of them on nebula and you can watch all of their videos uh ad free um there's nebula first so a lot of videos get posted to nebula before they go on to YouTube there's lots of wonderful aspects of um of the uh the the site um if I'd like to go to feature and sort of see what's going on here um but um what I wanted to uh mention was classes there's all these wonderful classes one of which I don't let's see if mine is still up here in this like top uh row it doesn't look like it is but all these awesome ones are somewhere here we would find mine if we kept looking but uh what is code and so it used to be that this was a separate purchase that I mentioned on many uh previous um videos but now it just comes with nebula but the um the best way for you to get it is through the Curiosity stream bundle this is the cheapest way at least it's like a price hack so if you go to curiositystream.com choo choo Link in the description sign up for curiosity by the way you're getting thousands of curiosity Street documentaries I'm talking about nebula because that's where my clap my Apple II classes that you might be interested in because you're watching this um but you're you know curiosity stream is an incredible range of content as well so if you go to that link you'll get curiosity stream plus nebula for a full year for 14.79 for the entire year it's a bundle um it's like a little over a dollar a month and then if you uh come on classes uh just for a onetime fee of ten dollars you can upgrade to have classes or a one dollar a month so technically you could watch my class for one dollar extra if you watch it all for the same month I suppose I hope I think you would just once you're there you're going to realize there's so much other stuff you want but anyway so I just wanted to get that out of the way at the beginning of the live stream and correct that um I will I might mention that link again later if you've got any questions about that come to the Discord ask me um all right so that was those are two Corrections ah yes speaking of the Discord this is what I wanted to mention um the Discord so a lot of these things um are in uh my announcements on Discord which I'm showing you right now I talked about sure and I'm not going to go through all this other stuff but here's the links also to the Curiosity stream bundle and the nebula class but what I wanted to show you that I'm really excited about is that um our Discord the coding train Discord now has help forums so there's lots of fun Lively chatter of just people hanging out and talking about I don't know who coding train and there's a pets Channel which is my favorite Channel there's the introductions Channel which is actually truly my favorite Channel because I love hearing about where people are from and how they found the coding train and what they're interested in and their Hobbies I really want it to be a place for people just to enjoy meeting each other and hanging out in online space but one of the things that I feel like we were never able to successfully really do until I would say now it's really happening is be able to provide uh help uh oh Stefan from Germany hello um and I will catch you up name name I love that name name um we've never I've never really found the right tool for people to be able to ask for help and get help with their code as it relates to the coding trade so certainly this is not perfect but let's go take a look at it the help forums I um so you can see here now if you want help with your code you can create a forum post and most of these I'm noticing are like very active um maybe I'm just going to look through here to see there is one here that only has one comment so maybe that's one we'll take a look at here's another one with one comment so there's a few here's one with zero uh maybe we'll look at this one since it has zero but most of these are pretty active you can see that they're new um and so there's a lovely community of folks in here who are helping each other out with their code discussing coding problems I have to admit as you can see it says 24 new posts so I'm not able to be in there on a regular daily basis is answering a lot of questions not to mention the fact that I you know I'm an old man and I don't know very much anymore I mean I I want to thank just speaking of which I want to give a shout out to um F terminal ft Irmo who watched the live stream yesterday and just opened this total pull request to help optimize the build of the coding trade website Gatsby and I'm looking at this and be like I don't know how any of this works I don't understand it somebody asked a question in the Forum about this I'd be like I don't know I gotta ask a question too because I don't know how to do any of this so I'm just thrilled for the community who's been so generous and helpful with the website who's being so generous and helpful with these um uh uh Forum posts and I just want to say thank you and let everyone know about this um so um did I name the stream the coding Trail on purpose yes no nobody it's I meant for it to be but I don't remember doing that yes okay so I kind of wanted to look let's let's I don't have a ton of time and I I it's already been a half an hour and I want to really begin this project in earnest um and welcome to Simon uh one of coding Train's most loyal viewers and I I always think of Simon when I say that because I think once I said Royal by accident like a little Freudian slip if you will and I think Simon truly is a royal viewer of the Kodak train okay um let's look at this one it has one comment and I'm gonna open this wider so I can see it better look at all this look at look at look at me uh messing with these windows okay oops ah no okay no ah it's okay uh I haven't I have haven't completed typing everything but until here it is working the way it should uh oh okay so so one thing I would say is to mushy um is that I'm not sure exactly what you're asking about so one thing that I would say like if you're posting your code questions that could be helpful and I know for many of you uh English is not your first language and so that is a big challenge to overcome if you're in a you know englishcentric uh Discord server um so I would love to think about ways to make it friendlier more accessible for a global audience but um but I'm not so thinking about what the question is also um sometimes including a screenshot so if this code is not working the way you think it should and you have an image of what it the output is currently doing as well as an image of what you think it should look like that can be helpful um posting the code is always excellent a couple notes about this in Discord is uh if I do this that's a way of noting that this is going to be uh um pre what's that not forgetting what preformatted text what does the pre stand for I forget um pre um but uh which will look like this but um if you want to syntax highlight it you can add a JavaScript or a different language and you can see now it's syntax highlighted so that's always something I recommend when you're posting your code but often even better with the P5 web editor uh just posting a link to the code in the web editor is a really good good way of when you're asking for help because um then you know otherwise I'm sitting here and I'm kind of copying and pasting it um and I would say like uh Snippets are better in here but a huge block of code is very hard to parse and read inside of Discord so let's take a look and see if we can help it all um so I can see I see that this looks like something and then uh the poster mushy maybe is expecting it to look like this ah you know what I know what it is okay so let's take a look let's see if we can fix this um so fascinating so first of all I'm seeing dots here I was expecting to see text oh they're points okay well that's interesting so this is also doing something totally different than what I see here so this I think is going to Merit some more time this is pretty cool though well this would be a great coding challenge uh it looks like they tried to take this code and then um ah and then I'm kind of Fork it not for fork it just sort of adapt it and you can see some JavaScript code so I I I think this is perhaps not um unfortunately this is not a great question for me to pursue right here uh I'll try to return to this if somebody can remind me or tag Me Maybe um in this thread later not right now because I won't that the notification will come in I'll see you later but if anybody wants to kind of help maybe we can take it upon ourselves as a community to see um if we can get this working I love the idea of doing this as a uh coding challenge um itself to create an ASCII rendered donut that's pretty cool okay so I always wanted to ask this is a great question from Stefan uh are we just talking about processing Java JavaScript or can we ask about anything coding related Swift swift UI Swift playground okay so great question the the short answer is the the Discord and the community is not limited to processing Java JavaScript and p5.js definitely not any question uh related to the coding train World which encompasses all uh code work and Beyond really is welcome here um in the Discord um so certainly if you have questions about Swift swift playgrounds all these things opening a question here there is a a tagging system so you probably would want to tag other uh tag it as other if you're if you think it makes sense to include something like Swift in this list then uh I would suggest pinging a station at station manager the moderation team who sort of handles and curates this stuff but I think other is pretty good catchall for other things I just think be aware that I uh prob you know I don't have an accounting of this I haven't done some deep dive into uh the sort of skills and the depths and skills in the community but probably there are fewer people who are around in the Discord who know about these things but they may be interested and would love to take a look and participate so yes please all topics related to code and the universe of creativity and design and interactive media and working with computers are all welcome here um ah so Starkey asks a great question I just joined the Discord how come I don't have the help and questions tab on it so most likely if you just joined the Discord all you see is read me um and so um I know that there are newer systems for how Discord can onboard people and Kobe I believe is working on that but you you're you probably have a role called waiting to board let me see if I can find you um so a whole lot of people just joined uh Starkey 3000 let's see uh Starkey 3000 so yeah if I look at you Starkey I see that you have this waiting to board roll and so I could actually manually remove that and every it would unlock everything but what you need to do is read through this uh readme which gives you all of the pertinent information about you know what the different channels are for uh what the different roles are and they need to actually update some of these I realized because Psy has moved on to uh bigger and better things um and so um um but um uh and thank you to CJ who helped you would a lot of this is pulled from the coding Gardens Discord but once you uh react to the with an emoji to the code of conduct sort of accepting the code of conduct of the community um then it should unlock all the channels for you you won't see um some of uh these channels that are for uh supporters only I know you can't even see this right now because it's I'd have to move it over and then just as a key thing as I often post links to things um here and check and just check the announcements recently because I've posted a lot of stuff there okay uh uh saw and everyone uh wish Simon well who has uh broken his arm hopefully it's healing smoothly uh um all right so yes uh prothomash is saying uh Daniel starts coding within 40 minutes of starting the stream challenge impossible mode like can we make that happen yes we got four minutes all right so um let's get going what is the work of today and I don't expect to get super far with this which is why I probably need to ultimately work on this not while streaming or do a more sort of ambient stream but let's go to repositories and let's go to um oh whoops oh did I wait a second help oh you know what I did I didn't realize that yesterday I put the repository under shiftman not coding train so that's let's fix that speaking of Corrections settings uh no um uh settings um uh it's usually here somewhere transfer transfer the ownership um sorry I can barely see my screen uh coding train this is the worst this is what I always do it says type this to uh confirm because it really wants to make sure you really want to do it and I always just copy paste it uh okay so uh now I've gotta find my twofactor code um so please bear with me look I can play music now though no no not now foreign so let's go ahead and clone this repo sure we'll also install the item update why not ah we got some folks from Sweden in the house um guess what I'm sorry I missed you but I was in Sweden over the summer I was had the opportunity to visit your lovely city of Stockholm um I had an incredible time I know this is probably very like touristy like the sort of like obvious tourist thing but the Vasa Museum was incredible I also really enjoyed the Abba you see him uh I had some lovely uh food some lovely beer some good coffee even had a really wonderful time there and um that was it was pretty brief but I was only in Stockholm so that was my only regret I was I'd love to list visit more of Sweden I would um one of my dreams is to go on a trip up as North as you can go up in northern Europe and see the Northern Lights maybe stay in one of those ice hotels I don't know maybe this is like me being like a sort of like really embarrassing American but um uh that's uh that's that sounds really cool to me okay um let's just put it on the desktop grab this repo uh open it up in vs code okay let's actually only open that repo up so we're gonna get the beginning of this going today um and let's also um let me merge this thank you to uh python coder unicorn who helped create this text file which is going to prove enormously um useful um for today's work incred enormously useful incredibly um useful um all right so let's bring this in and uh well it's okay sure we'll take a look at this great all right now what I would like to do wow so many people from Sweden that's really cool um the Discord invite on the website is outdated we're really working on this people so why does this keep happening we went through a whole round of this um so apologies for that please file a GitHub issue for the website uh noting that so we can fix it but yesterday I checked and if you go to thecodingtrain.com Discord uh thecodingtrain.com Discord that should take you to a valid invite I hope okay so let's move on over to the Apple II uh briefly um uh oh where's my button for that okay um okay we're gonna move over to the Apple II and I'm going to apologize in advance because those of you who are you the the Young and have all your faculties and wits about you which is not me my brain moves so slowly these days but my ears do not hear sounds above a certain frequency and this um this monitor emits a very high pitched wine it's an oldfashioned CRT Monitor and uh I should have set it up to put a low fat pass filter but I'm not so you might be hearing that apologies for that once I get back over the computer it does not transfer that far so this is actually all I wanted to do which is I wanted to have this Opening screen because this in many ways is the first thing that I would like to implement today during the live stream so I have this as a reference we can play it as necessary um and then I'm going to come so somebody asked somebody asked um and I and I could put the maybe what I'll do is just put in the top I don't know where but let's uh um video capture device um let's let's bring in a picture and picture of it oh that's the wrong one sorry everybody um uh sorry I should have had this prepared maybe this is unnecessary but I would like to I don't know why that I'm sorry about the um I'm sorry blue boo is anybody is uh if somebody who has access to um Discord invite URLs and could help with that I will I will deal with that in a moment um sorry uh Apple II this is what I'm looking for okay so let's move this up here in a place where I'm just gonna like leave it up here as a very small reference um so apologies about the Discord uh I don't know if Kobe is watching in particular who can help uh with that but um I will get that sorted um blue uh and so somebody remind me when the stream is wrapping up perhaps okay so and I guess probably makes more sense for me to just go over here but here's the real here's the real question this is the sixty four thousand dollar question do I want to do this entirely as canvas or do I want to create this as Dom elements and let me talk you through what I see as the pros and cons of each and um and actually what I'll do here is I'm really getting kind of ridiculous about this oh sorry everybody it's me with a giant green screen okay uh let's just put me here uh and uh chroma key that uh great okay so look at that tiny look at this giant Oregon Trail I want to be able to talk to you with this here I guess I could make myself a little bigger a little bit absurd okay so um pros and cons so for me I like the idea of doing this in canvas because it is more act it reflects the reality of this very low resolution pixel space right um Dom elements you know divs and all of that jazz paragraphs are all kind of the have all of these features for responsive design and uh the sort of modern capabilities of the web and if I want to create something kind of true to the look and feel of this game having a fixed canvas which doesn't mean I couldn't resize it and and alter the sort of Dimensions I think would be more true to the look and feel of it um the uh the disadvantage to doing canvas the downside is uh the text would be not selectable sort of viewable as part of like the source of the page um it would make inevitably I think we'd have some issues around accessibility although come to think of it this could be a really nice opportunity to investigate creating a canvas game that is accessible and what I mean by accessible is works with a screen reader um so Dom elements you know have builtin features to be able to be read to screen reader users um whereas canvas that you know there are capabilities that do that but it's a bigger challenge especially when something is highly visual or animated at a very fast you know frame rate but with this I wouldn't have that issue I just would have to build in some hooks to read the text on screen describe the images I kind of like this idea now canvas presents the most interesting challenge says bite spider which I like that the other thing I like I mean so I'm not I'm not doing this because this doesn't exist like let's look I I haven't uh Oregon Trail uh emulator like let's just see classicroad.com start this is like made with some like plugin I guess um blue okay I can't look at this it's all ads or whatever retro games so here's one I guess it's running in an actual emulator perhaps well this is a 1990 oh you can't see this this is a 1990 version of it wow that's cool so yeah so this is emulating the sort of like 1990 dos uh dos version of it let's see Oregon Trail JavaScript let's try that I'm just I should have researched this in advance a reimagining so somebody's uh six years ago did this oh dear so this looks very much like what I want to do already done this these are Dom elements because they're selectable oh interesting so I do quite like this and it has an interface and it has new images so this is kind of exactly what I want to build uh but I I still think you know I mean the point of this is not is the learning and the challenge of doing it um let's just like take a quick peek at the code just to sort of understand it yeah oh interesting yeah this is kind of what I imagine doing and is a lot of Dom element stuff so this this is a very clever design that I it sort of feels like it could easily be canvas and what is this font because I'm going to want to use a font like this um it is can I find it here I would think that it would show inherit I don't I don't see it in uh the font family vt323 yeah vt323 font ah yes so this could be a great font to use um so Kathy says I think you should update to modern times so I don't know if you mean the visual style of it or the content um so my goal for the so my goal for the project is to stay true to the visual style of it so that doesn't mean the interaction couldn't be a bit more clever and more fluid and there couldn't be some additional like fun animations but I I want it's important to me for the way I'm thinking about this project to and also just my own sort of like capabilities and keeping things constrained to keep the original visual design content wise the reason to do this ultimately is not to play the Oregon Trail but to have the coding Trail well I want to make it somewhat uh templatable so I'm imagining kind of like a big Json file that has all of the narration and the data and all the stuff in it so you could like basically write your own organ Trail Story retitle the game so that's content oh yeah so the content absolutely but right now I don't want to have to uh develop the content so it's easier for me to just use the precise content of the Oregon Trail and uh then once it's sort of up and running we can start to rewrite and redo the content that's kind of my thinking okay um Terminus font I'm afraid to like just look at this but I'm going to trust uh screenshots all right uh this is not showing me anything but oh cool ah yeah that's great yeah I think I used this font in uh I don't know if it was this font that much you used in the recent Apple II video okay so so that's the question that's a starting point um and I don't think I don't think that um and let me go back to here I don't think that any decision that I make right now that I'm going to be so far along in the project that we couldn't switch gears and change it to Dom um but that's kind of what I'm thinking let me put up a poll yeah famously I almost I never do what the audience says in the poll so in fact I have some like Affliction which is to do the opposite um Oregon Trail uh canvas um so no matter what this is going to be canvas or it's going to be P5 and I should really do I should the reason why I have this other laptop here so I can create the poll like this and still talk to I look so weird when I'm over here like off in Never Never Land but I have a computer over here that's what you can't see Canvas OR Dom curious to see the thing that I worry about doing Dom that um uh is that everyone's going to complain that I'm using the P5 Dom Library which is a little bit wonky but um so I'm kind of interested in canvas to be honest that's what I'm leaning towards starting today and while that poll is going let's at least start to create a bit of a framework here what image do we get oh thank you for this yeah I choose Dom so you do it in campus right no no don't try to game the system to Dom but probably still didn't canvas and he wrote canvas I'll just be more clear about where I'm starting I I fully uh expect that I I think there's a a a a a significant chance definitely a nonzero chance that I start with canvas and change to Dom later or kind of use canvas but put Dom uh I could also uh you know what makes sense is actually to have um fixed position Dom elements over the canvas but I'm getting ahead of myself here I haven't even like started this I got we got to get going so I'm going to make a uh file called um index.html I'm going to make a file called sketch.js and I don't know what's going on here should not be in the image directory this should index.html so let's move that let's go to the web editor and let's just grab this and let's go to the web I don't need to grab anything for oh yeah so and let's take a look here oh you're not seeing me again I'm sorry ah see this is why I shouldn't go to that screen because I'm going to forget so sorry about that it it is I did correct it just now um it would be interesting to try to do this in basic and actually what I should do is I should grab the code for it do I have a all right well one step at a time uh canvas is winning uh yes to be clear again I'm not going to use the original Graphics the content is entirely going to change the look and feel of it should be the same the whatever new graphics will be pixelated in the same style as the old Graphics that's the idea um okay um so let's but create a style dot CSS in case we're going to need that um let's add the ubiquitous setup and draw whoops and let's just try um let's try this font just because it's a Google font so I should be able to load it easily how do I okay wait wait wait wait I know how to do this I don't want to download it isn't there a way here to get the um like that like it should give me like the CSS for select yeah so I think I can do this right if I put this I'm just curious right I think if I for any font and I'm sorry this is uh small I think if I copy this put this in the HTML and then now why did this not format I don't know but I'm going to manually do it and then uh and then I think if I were to go into style and do body and again we're gonna I have to be more specific about this at some point and grab this press start to P looks like a 8bit font ah oh and I'm seeing some oh no stop um input handling is much easier doing HTML instead yeah I know that input handling is much easier doing HTML but so there's a comment here which is saying input handling is much easier to do an HTML instead of in canvas but you have to remember whoa this was not written with can't with uh HTML dominant complex input in mind like there's very little input that I need which number on the keyboard did the person press did they say yes or no what number did they enter so uh writing a little engine to get that basic amount of input from the user the player is not going to be is it's going to be work but that's kind of an interesting Challenge and I think a throwback to how these systems were originally done but anyway so yeah I just want to get a sort of hello world thing going here um so I'm going to say text align Center Center let's do a create canvas 640 so the Apple II is 280 by 192 I believe is that right yeah 280 so let's multiply that by two just to sort of like double the resolution and uh let's say um text the Oregon Trail width divided by two height divided by two put that in the center text size let's try like 64 and fill of 250 ah I gotta turn off that autocomplete and no stroke so you've never seen P5 before friendly um uh creative coding environment for drawing into canvas with a lot of other hooks with a very nice API okay so let's go to oh and let me um run a little server here in fact let me actually uh use live server and I I could run a server through vs code okay there we go thank you everybody uh thank you thank you we are done we're done we're done we're done yeah okay uh all right uh the the um what was Simon's great idea in the chat I missed it Trail okay so why didn't my font work um so that would be oh did I take no I mean this shouldn't matter the order right oh you know why canvas is not going to pick up the fonts interesting uh so how do I this is an interesting question P5 load font take a look so it could be a an asset that's if I want to load it as a file but that's not what I want to do unless I can put the URL um text font but what would happen if I whoops text font let's see and again I'm going to use a diff I'm not saying this is the font I'm going to use I just wanted to sort of see oh there we go okay that worked okay awesome um great so we've got this um clearly not exactly the same uh font but something close to this font here pretty interesting all right so we've begun so let's think now um a bit more holistically about this project and I'm going to check the time I'm um I think I'm probably going to wrap up around 5 30 which is a half an hour from now so again my this this really would if I'm really going to build this we'd need like an allday stream uh yeah so making a CLI and node would be super fun like that's a really fun idea a fun project but um not going to make it as easily sort of playable or usable for a wider audience as it would be if it's just on the web um okay um so let's take a look at what uh python unicorn coder had uh offered so python unicorn encoder I don't know whether they were able to find this or just took notes but this is awesome because it's given us a really nice long script for the whole uh game but I think what would be useful to do as an exercise and I'm kind of doing this without a lot of um planning or note taking but I I would like I'm just going to call it data dot let's call it game.json I guess maybe what I would like is to create a data file I'm calling it game.json which stores all of the metadata for the game so and there are references up here I can't see this at all so like for example let's just put it to there so for example I and I I think we're good it's going to need a lot of work but just to start like imagine if I had a um let's just think about this for a second like a array called choices and in those choices would be the options like travel the trail uh learn about the trail uh see the Oregon see the organ top ten um and turn sound off turn sound off so the idea here zdax that is you great so the idea here is that for any given sort of like page of the game part of the game the story The Choices the story and the data are all inside of this um Json file so what I want to do is like play through the game a little bit so let's imagine I I think what I'm going to need is um like we'll call this we're gonna have to do this a little bit on the fly like uh intro which is an object which has the choices the prompt which might be the same for everything what is your choice and then like you know maybe it would have a you know image you could imagine there being like like what was this there's this like imagine if what I did was crop this image and only kept the top let's try that just just as a sort of exercise uh okay so again this is not I'm gonna really have to rethink the way um the source code to the original game was late says Joshua Walker thank you for that let's go look uh I missed a membership upgrade okay okay okay it's hard to keep track of everything no the Super Chat I see someone joined at the conductor level okay fine interrupt me someone who joined to the conductor level it's got to be a way for me to find out who you are welcome thank you for joining the coding trade at the conductor level ah it's Joe who gifted a membership thank you Joe I forgot that we have membership gifting that's a very very very much appreciated um Joe has been a wonderful new member of the coding train posting a lot in the Discord I owe you a reply to an excellent set of questions that you sent me that I've really been thinking about just I haven't had a chance to uh dig into it yet okay so let's do um let's call this title.png so imagining then there's going to be like title dot PNG so this is like kind of the idea that I'm thinking about um the intro is going to have a set of choices a prompt and a title card so we can so we can now go I just want to like go through and start playing the game so I'm going to go over and I gotta end this poll because it's blocking my view of the chat so oh no end poll um okay okay well sorry I I will I'm sorry for whatever I missed it's not showing on my screens I can only do what I can do okay um going to the Oregon Trail come join the Discord so I can say thank you okay yeah BB asked if Emma is Dan I I don't know I want to keep doing twit twitch and I would have normally done this in twitch but I was streaming yesterday on YouTube and I got the setup and then I thought I should continue if I go back and forth so I'm really lost so your help and thoughts and advice and I'm going over to there so um I'll be right there in a second I just apologies um okay um I'm going over now to here and so I think for right now what I'm going to do is I'm not going to bother to work through learn about the trail or see the Oregon top 10. I really have trouble pronouncing Oregon because I think there's a proper way to pronounce it I know it's incorrect to say Oregon that's definitely wrong but Oregon is that right I think I'm not looking at the chat right now so sorry I didn't bring my laptop over here but I'll be back over there in a second um travel the trail so if we go to travel the trail so now we need to do this screen so um so I don't know to what extent it's useful to do all this data entry but I'm going to go back I'm going to do this at least do this okay actually I'm going to skip this because now we kind of understand what I need to do for this just data entry um so let's just I'm gonna go ahead and do the banker again that's what I did yesterday just to kind of do that and see okay what is the first name of the wagon leader okay so we need a this is important we're going to need a um we're going to need I don't I'm going to call it game for right now and the I don't know what to call the people who ride the wagon oh DJ manga says or gen organ or again or again or again okay the Oregon Trail thank you DJ Mangus um so what are the people who ride the wagon so there will be an array with the people who are riding I mean I guess there's the do we need to keep the leader separate I don't call them passengers which would be an array so like for example if I entered my name you know yesterday we had choo choo this Dot and obviously this wouldn't be in the Json in advance because it would be empty it's just sort of like loaded and then these things would get filled in I'm not again I I haven't thought this through maybe we need a separate data structure like but I'm going to keep going with this because I'm figuring this out this time okay so that's the idea but let's leave it empty knowing that the idea is it for it to be filled in and uh let me go over to here so this would also need um this would be part of the story um so um I'm just gonna say uh a simple Dan uh this is what I did yesterday so again so one of the things that people could do today after the stream if this seems like a good direction is help um do the data entry for all of these different uh screens pages are these names correct yes um and then all right so then we need something for this screen with the text okay uh Okay so now we have uh the month that you're leaving so again this is just something to enter just like before so I'm not gonna go back and type this in I'm just going to put in April and this would be another page so money how much cash you have is very important so cash and then the through your inventory so um okay so let's go back and think so again I'm not so sure everything needs to be in this Json file or it's a matter of me just creating variables right because like the amount of money could be just its own variable but I think what I'd like to do right now is I'm kind of working this out is have everything be in here and so this would be um the amount of money you have so you can imagine like it's going to start with some amount then we would have an inventory which would be another object with properties like oxen and then the number so all these would start at zero like this would get filled in Oxen what were the other things a team of oxen clothing I know there's food and there was uh what else was there um recommend having a Json data structure to hold all the game State exactly that's what I'm hoping to do here um State machine we're definitely going to need a conductor right I mean certainly this should be the conductor but again I just I'm not I'm just going to use the language and the story of the Oregon the Oregon Trail right now food okay that computer is very far away let me make more sense when you do this with an emulator so before I leave I'm going to see if I can get the code um okay clothing and I don't think I switched the screen sorry about that um clothing food ammunition spare parts for the wagon food ammunition spare parts oh this would have made things easier if I just saw this okay so we've got oxen food clothing ammunition spare parts oxen clothing food ammunition uh spare parts now the prices I should also yeah what if I made a slide class um and uh would render and wait for input yeah so these are all great ideas I don't know how to organize doing this in a sort of collective way I think what I would love is for those of you who have the idea if you want to contribute and work on some of these features after today because I am going to wrap up pretty soon I'm not going to get much further is um is like file an issue uh with a sort of short description of what you want to try to implement um and then I can kind of like give you the thumbs up I will try to stay really like a close eye on this repo over the next week and then uh and then so people can also track and and don't have uh both people aren't kind of doing the same thing but I know it's this is tricky because the sort of foundation isn't really there yet game State and gang config text should be separate files though since one will be read only and one will be read write um yeah that makes a lot of sense that makes a lot of sense um so these should be also the price like the game state in a way I don't even need it to be a Json file like I'm not going to be I'm not really intending to implement this we might I would use local storage so I guess if I'm using local storage to save the game state so somebody could leave and come back to their browser that would make sense so all right I think what I need to do because I uh is start to wrap this up and file a bunch of issues with sort of some plans and people could I I might work on it knowing these plans um Okay so that's what I'm gonna do so I'm gonna put put a hold on this right now um yeah the money is 1600 right so this is the this is the disconnect right now the money is sixteen hundred dollars but that value doesn't go in here that value is listed with um okay so these are like what are um the Prof I would call them professions so I the professions are Banker um which gets sixteen hundred dollars there might be more to it so um so we like the name of the profession as the banker the money is 1600 right so when so this is why I'm mixing up the important details which was what I can't remember which um viewer just said um um and I have somebody by the way who a a foreign asked about the art um so I have somebody who is interested in helping do who specializes in pixel art and it was interested in helping create all the art so certainly if somebody's interested in that let me know um and I probably just use as placeholder I'm going to kind of like screenshot the actual art from the game and just put it in there but eventually the idea is to have updated new art um the profession also has an effect on score so right all of the details for each profession would go here I don't know if anybody knows off the top of the head what um what amount of money uh the farmer has I'm just gonna put zero in right now so this is really the game State and I think I should take this out here now because uh so let's do a game uh I'm gonna call this game data and I am going to do game state uh which would be this part of me actually wants to make this I'm going to do it this way I'm gonna do actually call it state.js so I'm gonna have a Javascript file which stores the state of the game in a variable so um the idea here is that the game state is not the data we're loading right it's ultimately there is a little bit of an issue here because the language here probably has to match in some way and maybe what the state the initial State like maybe it makes sense for the initial state to be part of the Json file I don't know see there's so many different ways I could take this and I that's why I'm interested in getting people's opinion of people just jumping in but the idea is that this is the current state of the game and it's empty when the game begins then when you select being a banker the amount of money that's tied to the banker would go into the your current money in the state of the game so um but I am just going to uh say let's just see if still loads uh let's do git add git commit uh starting the foundation for the game and I'm sorry you can't really see what I'm doing down here um uh get push well I didn't create another Branch but that's okay by the way if you forget to create another branch and you want to do a pull request I can push the main branch to a different branch on GitHub Itself by doing this uh live I'll just call it live stream two and then I'm going to open up a pull request here and um this is from today's live stream and if I go to YouTube and coding train I should presumably be able to find this uh right it might make sense to make it a class maybe the game State should be a class I like that idea so I'm just going to go ahead and merge it I mean I could leave it unmerged so people could comment on it but I think that's going to be more confusing so let's start by merge attempt failed oh I probably did it twice it has a conflict what is going on what just happened what how is this even possible what did I do okay fine let's do this uh uh let's do this get fetch uh get check out live stream two oh no I don't know what's going on here did I think I hit the merge button twice yeah oh so yeah I think I don't know what just happened did I push it to the wrong thing I have no idea what's going on this is very weird nobody knows I don't know what I just did so strange I'm just gonna close this pull request and just walk away slowly from this um one thing I want to do is add a git ignore file and put DS store in it and remove um I should really step I want to set this up with netlify as well remove git remove no get RN there we go uh uh great let's do this good okay uh do this okay so um great so oh all right States got to keep track of Health yeah everything everything so let me think here let let me start creating some issues um um um do I still have that yeah okay I'm gonna close this issue so I am now looking for in the chat or in I lost the Discord uh supporter chat uh Richard v d Veen thank you is the uh welcome to conductor so Richard if you're still watching I appreciate thank you for your support make sure you link your Discord account come and say hi and Discord um font for the title page okay great so uh um okay so fonts so no brainer uh Chris Sears who just suggested a font that'll work well anybody wants to pull request the font go for it so what are some things that are that people who are watching could do so one is create uh create class to store game state okay so that I welcome is does that make sense um uh yeah I don't rebase it's not for me that's that's very uh you know exciting and I'm sure it's very you know it's kind of like a big party when everyone's get rebasing but but for me I just merge um so what are some things just based on what we've seen today that you could imagine uh doing um that I should create issues for is what I'm looking for in the chat or maybe I should just go work on this more on my own and then come back to another live stream and and let you all know where I am um all right let's do create a class okay um let's see data create a class to store game State all right I'm just going to file that issue uh okay yes so the idea is using the text file so the text file just needs is exactly what we need just needed to be adapted into the Json format um okay adapt text file script into Json format that's something that somebody could work on potentially um another thing could be that I'm thinking of is render a slide maybe there's a better term but taking the data from um game data.json and rendering the text and and choices uh uh so like a framework a simple engine for uh user input so we need to we can use the P5 key press function to just kind of like keep track of user input um then I also want to um accessibility uh screen reader support for each game slide what's the you know game page page um so uh describe p5.js yeah we should be able to use this um uh um read prompts and describe imagery for screen readers p5s describe function might be enough um okay I meant to grab this URL here okay um all right right the shop right so you could use older each screen or slide can also accept input theme it you can use labels to Mark the tasks right all these are great suggestions um the shop interface is uh is its unique one is is kind of unique so like maybe there is a um you know what are list of possible classes so there are there's the um shop there's there's sort of like an interface slide class shop extends interface slide keyboard input class so again I'm kind of just making up stuff as I'm talking here you know if I were building this just all on my own I probably wouldn't be trying to architect it so much I just start like making the first page and then as I go on then I'd refactor a bit but um so uh so um so yeah so so and I'm not really worried about the visual design right now because that can be cleaned up what I would like is kind of like a core framework for the game just to like be able to start it with reduced amount of options play through a few pages um and that's kind of what I'm looking to do um okay so what else can I possibly do before I go here so people jump right in uh to comment file your own issues to propose things the ways uh you know make your uh look freaking there you are um and um uh we'll see I mean I guess I'm gonna work on this a bit this weekend um and over the course of next well week um what I wanted to do see if I have the tools for this okay so let me go over this one of the things I'm curious to see is if I don't know if this game itself the one that you're seeing here is actually um written uh in basic but I want to look at the disk image of the Oregon Trail game which I have on this um micro SD card and I can put it into here the only thing is I need a a card reader which I I have somewhere in this room ah found it so I'm coming back over here I also need a Windows computer which is not this one so I might uh love to get some help from from all from any of you who are watching here um okay so I'm going to put this in here put this here hopefully this is going to appear uh great perfect um Apple II stuff five and a quarter discs uh games so Oregon Trail one and two dot d o that's not a format that I'm used to seeing let's put these on the desktop um so one thing I'm curious about is first of all before I go is can I can I open will it support these do files let's see ah yes awesome so I'm you watching at home the version we're doing this version the 1985 Apple II version um you can play this so would it be weird for me to put in the repo these two files they're tiny files so I think it's fine I don't think they're I think they're they're my public domain so let me add uh let's go here so this is going to help everybody um so let's upload add a file upload files uh all right no all right let me just put them in let's create a branch um it's a couple things uh I'm gonna move some stuff around and put this in there it's a little silly but just in case just let's do some like file management here and let's create a folder called uh original and let's put these disk images there so if anybody you know if if we want to check uh look at the chat create an asset folder however there's a reason you don't usually find that version of alignment instead of the 1978 basic version I kind of I don't am I wrong to want to do this version I kind of like this version um so um so let's do this so get checkout uh get branch file management let's add the wait what happened here let's add the original disk uh 1985 Apple to disk images organize files okay um organizing files and adding original disk images for play at here okay now what I would like to do is this is the best version just not ever released to public domain interesting um thank you DJ Mangus okay so what I would like to do is I think what's the thing I think it's called Cider Apple II disk image cider press yeah so anybody who's watching on a Windows machine right now I'm pretty sure that this tool I know because I've used this and somebody helped me um with Soren who helped me with this um this tool should allow you me you to extract a disk image and convert it to raw files that are that you could open on your Windows computer or on a Mac so if anybody is watching right now who might be able to very quickly uh grab these two disk image files and open them with cider press and let me know if you've got the um uh uh let me know if you've got the um if you're able to access the data that's on these disks because I'm curious what's there is it some kind of you know binary assembly version of the game is there basic code that's running the game uh I wonder so I would love to I would be curious to know um but Gerald this so so now let me talk about one of the reasons why I'm doing this so I so I want to make a faithful version of the original to sort of like learn about it and kind of build this but um there is a podcast that I listen to uh Oregon Trail Rob and Akiva let's see if we can find this Rob and Akiva go on the Oregon Trail um this looks like the version that this is interesting is this the version that um cord on the computer oh they're playing this one so funny okay I'm gonna mute this so this podcast oh so I wonder if I this is the version that they played through and uh I have volunteered which looks very similar to the version that I played through on the Apple II this is a slightly later one so I don't know if um so this is a good question uh um which one to model ours after we should go with the Apple too because that's what I have and it's largely the same so that's the Dos version so unless somebody uh knows like you know like is I guess I'll ask this question is there anything from the Dos version We would like to incorporate again the story is really we could ignore um see uh dos Oregon Trail and I think this is it here right I think this is it yeah um no uh what happened to that lost that page where are we have lost here we go um so I I encourage you to check out the podcast watch that episode but I have volunteered to create a custom version of the game that uh um for their sequel to that episode where they played the Oregon Trail and the idea is that much like if you could imagine if we can make a version of the game that is like the story of the coding train with the coding Train characters and you're trying to journey to find your way to like the promised land of you know your code or whatever um then think of that what I would like to do is make the same idea for that this particular podcast resolve it's weird and fun inside jokes and characters and there's a lot of things going on there so um it's a port from the Apple II version basically the same game yeah that's what I think too so um so um so this is the trajectory here so if anybody would really is interested in being involved with this project I fully understand if you're not um uh then you know go carry on if you're interested you know even in just like a a small way follow the GitHub repo I'll probably do at least one more live stream maybe move these some of these twitch I don't know um uh and uh or if you would like to actually work on the implementation uh feel free to chime in on an issue uh but probably what would make sense is for us to organize a bit in a Discord um a channel in the coding train Discord so maybe I can set that up depending on the level of interest and who's interested so I'm going to keep going um and uh uh oh there's a there's a switch version of it that's interesting um so I'm gonna keep going with this I appreciate all of you for tuning in and watching this has been a couple hours uh close to two hours um and if in an Ideal World I would carve out a full day to just really like work on this uh maybe without like sort of talking through it even so maybe that would make sense for like a twitch stream to just kind of work on this with less um uh with just sort of like you know in a more ambient way and let people contribute um so what else do I want to say um before I go so um if you haven't I guess uh so first of all this is your first coding train live stream thanks for watching uh I've got a huge back catalog of stuff so enjoy if you if you like this you you could spend you know probably the next six months of your life watching all my videos I don't recommend that uh if you've never programmed before and want to get started learning um I have um go to thecodingtrain.com uh under tracks uh this is your the track for you the beginner programming with p5.js um I also want to encourage everybody to uh check out the sort of latest videos that I've been making about the um uh uh programming in basic on the Apple II which has kind of led me to this uh sort of well the the aligning with this Oregon Trail project um and I also want to encourage people uh to I'm just going to pick wave function collapse to if you're making things um based on videos that you're watching there is an entire way for you to submit your work that can be featured on the website itself uh there's a submission form you can also do it as a pull request and on the home page uh thanks to Kathy who's been helping with this uh we cycle in and out of different uh featured projects that are just up here on the home page of the coding train that are made by viewers just like you uh so I want to say that join the Discord thecodingtrain.com Discord does that still not work what's going on so I don't know what I'm doing wrong uh I'm sorry for those of you who have failed um uh failed to get into the Discord this should be like the easiest thing in the world hold on I'm gonna just do something right now on this other computer which is do invite edit invite link never No Limit generated invite link copy I am putting an invite link into the YouTube chat right now one that I just made I don't understand why my redirect is not working um but if you wanted to join the Discord and you weren't able to there you go just make sure that you read through the readme and it moves you react to the code of conduct it will unlock all the channels for you uh it's I would also recommend you don't need to do this but if you sync your if you do if you did sign up for YouTube membership you should sync your YouTube and Discord account there's like a setting there and Discord from your Integrations where you can authenticate to your YouTube account that will unlock further Badges and things for you um and then I created a permanent invite and we also have a vanity URL invite I don't know what's going on with that but regardless it's there right now um the other thing is um if you uh are interested in subscribing to nebula which is the uh streaming um service that I talked about um that is um built by creators many of which do a lot of educational videos and really interesting videos there are a amazing amount I want to look at Originals this is really what I mentioned there are an incredible amount of really fantastic original content that's only available on nebula um uh I talked about jet lag which is the show that I really like native the coconut is a really fun uh movie um I want to make a they have this series called working titles I'm hoping to make a working titles uh episode which will only be on nebula for um um uh this TV show Severance and there's you know there's an Android app there's an IOS app there's lots of ways um I think there's a Roku app that you can watch uh nebula videos so I uh really recommend um taking a look a lot of the animation stuff is really cool uh you know I'm a huge fan of all the science and engineering uh videos um so nebula but the reason why I'm mentioning it is nebula has nebula classes and um here one of the things one of the classes you'll find this is a great one by the way if you're interested in live streaming from luria Petrucci but is my class what is code and this previously was kind of an expensive purchase but the cheapest way for you to get it now is to go buy the Curiosity stream bundle so you get curiosity stream which is over a thousand documentaries and all of nebula together in one package at that URL for 14.79 for the entire year um and then that doesn't actually give you nebula classes but once you get access to nebula it's only one dollar a month more for nebula classes or ten dollars for the whole year so it's actually cheaper than your standard nebulous subscription to do the bundle plus addon so if you have questions about that you could join the Discord you can ask me about it you can contact I believe it's help nebula.tv so thank you just wanted to mention that uh sponsorship here at the end um and and that's the the latest I just want to read this comment from DJ Mangus it looks like that version the later ones is copyright The Learning Company and if you don't like people in fringing don't see why you can't recreate but probably shouldn't post the disk images okay that's a good point okay so I think I'm going to remove those disk images from the repo um if anybody if anybody wants to try to I mean I guess I could do this now offline I just don't have I have a Windows computer right here so I can just do it myself but I'm assuming nobody did did anybody try extracting those disc images uh the link to the repo is pinned the link to the repo is pinned in the chat but let me just put it also in the Discord so uh where is the the organ Trail repo here it is should be pretty easy to find um and I'm gonna go to the Discord and I'm gonna go to links and I'll put it here so in the links Channel uh under live so uh uh by the way for those one thing I'll say is like I do sometimes so um Matt Baker just tuned in and said this just popped up as being live have I missed much so yes because I'm wrapping up and I'm finishing I gotta go Saturday night gotta have dinner make dinner and hang out with kids and I don't know do weekend family stuff but um the um if you want to be a person who knows when there will be a live stream in advance your two best paths are one subscribing to the YouTube channel and clicking the Bell thing you know that should notify you whenever I schedule a live stream in advance but uh your most reliable way is to be on Discord and subscribe to the notifications role so I believe the way that you do that is in the channel bot talk if you type in exclamation subscribe I've already subscribed so that just removed that role so I'm going to do it again that will give you the notifications role and that is the role that I tag whenever I am scheduling a live stream now sometimes I will tag at everyone uh but not usually that that's pretty rare I don't like to abuse the at everyone which notifies like you know everybody but if you want to opt into more notifications from me that's your best way of doing it the repo is pinned great um so so that's all I've got um so thank you Matt for your nice comment of saying thanks for the content I'm sorry this is you you will I don't I don't you know sometimes these archives are meaningful for people to watch back later uh sometimes it's really about being here present in the moment so you know certainly not required but you can go back your your main advantage to watching the archive is you could to exit and Skip through stuff and uh thank you to Kathy who has been helping write time codes so uh this is a huge shout out to Kathy like if you go to uh my last live stream um by the way one of the reasons why I'm much more excited to do everything on YouTube now I was excited about trying twitch because twitch has many many excellent features and uh and and for live streaming but I just really like the way now YouTube is organizing videos which is you know you can see here all of my video uploads you can find them right here shorts which I am now diving into for better or worse I've got it's a one month experiment might kill it after the experiment we'll see how that goes honestly they aren't getting a lot of a tremendous amount of traction which is fine but I am I'm getting some positive and some critical feedback um but uh the live streams are now organized under their own tab so you can go back and find all the live streams or you know this is the thing I really do want to organize better but I'm here to say thank you to Kathy because I don't know why this doesn't happen it must be it only happens when I'm logged into my account that the chapters don't show up let's go oh so hold on let me just I I'm going to quickly switch account and I'm going to switch to um I have access to the processing Foundation YouTube so I don't know why this happens but now they're there so one of the things you can do is uh thank you to Kathy who put time codes in so if you're interested in like learning about the coding trade website to talk about it here uh talk about the the recent coding challenge here curiosity stream this is you know the sponsor segment here and this is where I started the playthrough of the Oregon Trail and I'm in so much pain about the fact that my face uh if I skip to that like the whole time my face is right over there talking to the camera and I did not realize that I cropped it so apologies for that um so anyway so thank you to Kathy and you can so if you want you could go back and look at this yesterday and as soon as um I finish uh streaming today um this will also be an archive so yeah you know I have lots of mixed feelings about the uh the idea of our kind of like social media addictions and short form uh video uh you know which I do find quite entertaining and interesting in many ways I don't know where I fit into that world you know you can see I tried a few a while ago that were different and then these are three that I made very recently I'm working with a wonderful team um out of Brazil who's been helping me kind of with the sort of editing and production on these I almost think that one of the issues with these is that the production quality not not what I'm doing but their work it's almost like too good shorts have a are meant to have kind of this more informal quality to them anyway um I'm go I can't stop I'm going on and on uh if you post shorts regularly like one every day and it's supposed to help a lot with Channel growth yeah and I I'm I'm excited to have I want people to be excited and engaged with their creativity and their enthusiasm for coding and their enthusiasm for helping others with code in all the ways that are possible so I'm going to try it all live streaming making the videos the way that I do making shorts I got to grow with the times people can't just can't just coat ride on my Gorgon Trail and coattails so we'll see um more is coming out some of them will just be sort of silly but my goal with the shorts is to ultimately make informational ones that you can get quick tips out of that will spark your imagination or spark your day as well as by the way I'm going to feature people's the passenger Showcase in shorts so I think that's also something nice if you make something for the passenger showcase I can select it share it in a short and it's a nice uh it's a circle of life people the circle of life all right so I've got to go um thanks everybody for tuning in uh if you haven't been live streaming very much and all of a sudden I did two days after a one after another and who knows maybe I'll be back tomorrow or Monday uh it certainly won't be around most of next week uh there's the Thanksgiving holiday happening here um but um be on the lookout for shorts check in say hello and Discord um no new videos are uh coming but I do hope to record some more uh whatever I do next probably won't be an apple II video gotta take a break from that um I love that you fell in love with Git and GitHub Slumber thanks for that um so yeah uh I'm letting this little track play it's got about two minutes on it any last questions or comments um please let me know in the chat as I start to close things down here I'll leave this banner up for any of you who might be interested still in checking out this bundle deal um gonna start cleaning up and closing things here on my computer um midnight it's a good time the best way to do is to stream everything and cut shorts and highlights out of it that's certainly something I am that was kind of my original uh intention but I don't know that I'm complaining brain dead this is the you know how Cinderella turns into a pumpkin at midnight or whatever after two hours of streaming I cannot put words together all right um good night to Marcus uh come on say goodbye in the chat at least no no you don't do anything we should probably have left already this song is way too long but I'm committed to the bit of letting it play itself out guess what what uh I'll read you some random numbers uh thank you see uh 88709 7983502268 three four eight nine nine four three five seven six that's what I should really I should just make shorts where all I do is read random numbers that's a someday someday next sabbatical I'm gonna make the audiobook of a million random digits that's all that I spent the whole year just reading all of the digits snail from Brazil good night Daniel good night Finn good night Michelle good night goodbye Matt Parker good night Lucas good night everyone's saying good night now because you're you're 30 seconds behind me appreciate you all and I'll see you next time on the coding train as always bye everybody this Dot I'm sorry Mark Rogers that you made it just at the end this stop I agree this dot this dot this Dot that it's late for most of you and that that wasn't the best way that wasn't the best way to end the coding train this will be better I was to frantic manic energy that this thought so foreign to random number ASMR with the
