good afternoon and welcome to a special extra bonus livestream as you know I typically wanna not know this but if you're watching or if you watched before I typically livestream on Friday stop enjoying it it's gonna be over soon I kind of tame it where I Club it in right when there's about 10 to 15 seconds left so the music could trail off to the end but it was that like 35 seconds I'm just kind of waiting for it so here I am I had to get cancelled today then I typically often have to do on Wednesday afternoons and I have been aspiring for awhile to do more often shorter live streams than less frequent longer live streams as much as some people might enjoy the 3 or 4 hours at a time of live streaming on a Friday I do find that the content somewhat suffers especially towards the end and if I could find little pockets of time to record a video to do tutorial to update something and so today actually I was I was thinking oh I had this extra bit of time what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna sit at my computer and go through a bunch of pull requests on the toei neural network library that I built last Friday and I thought well I might as well just livestream that because there's I've got some questions around then I can talk about it I don't see anybody saying that they are listening oh they are ok first figure I thought did I just totally not get that start streaming button the other thing was is I've had this cold and I was kind of sick on a little bit last Friday much more over the weekend and Monday and I thought I'm all the way better now and then all that's enough talking and realizing like it there's still a little bit of scratchiness there so I will be here it's about 230 on my time Eastern Time now in New York City I will probably live stream for one hour possibly a little bit longer but this is gonna be a shorter live stream and I have two plans I have two plans for today one is let me just open this up here a web browser is to use a web browser and I'm going to go to this github repository this is the coding training toy neural network j/s github repository I have actually now for a couple things one is you can now go to I have arrived finally you can now go to youtube.com slash the coding train and we'll take you directly to this channel of which you are watching and there you will see a check mark because I it is me a verified person I check check I am Here I am truly here as and if you're wondering if it's true it's so um I have been releasing these and in fact let me find the playlist for it because I think that will be most useful here we go oops don't play the video just go here so this is the playlist starting off just with an introductory video to the idea of neural networks I built a simple perceptron and talked about a multilayer perceptron then I do a bunch of matrix math things then I look at the feedforward algorithm and then I continue looking at that and then as you know I struggled massively through the back propagation training process but I did five videos and finished that off so that's everything in all of those videos has now gone into this neural network JavaScript library so and I've been getting some lovely pull requests and so I want to look through some of these and merge them so that's item number one and I will mention in case you're wondering about I will also mention that if you are looking for the code in the state exactly as is when I finished that part five that I am putting here under courses nature of code ten point eighteen toy neural network so that's in my the repo that has all of the code for all of the videos and so this is kind of like a frozen state of the code as it stands at the end of that particular video and then I will allow this repository to grow and improve and one of the reasons why I'm doing this project is I intend to start using two other frameworks so I've mentioned before deep learn js' is a project from the Google bigpicture group Google pair initiative people and AI research it is a you know one way you might think of it as a tensor flow but in the browser so this is a library that I intend to use and in further tutorials as I get further along down this road and in fact related to that is a project that is being worked on at ITP ITP NYU github dot is / ml 5 Jas this is another repository URL that you might take a peek at this is now a highlevel JavaScript library for machine learning so this is a library that's built on top of deep learning is to make using deep learning Dutch yes a bit easier for beginners specifically beginners who might be learning to code with p5 Chasse and so for example there's some nice examples here here is an example of simple image classification using a pre trained model I will talk about eventually what all these things are and you can see here the code is simple in that you can just say you can ask the model to predict what it thinks about an image you can look at the results and update what's on the page with the results so this there's a lot of stuff like this that you can start to look at you can look under experiments which are some things that people have built with this but this library is you know less than 2 months old so this is a brand new thing that and I will be doing many more videos with this library so part of the reason why I'm building my own kind of toy version of a machine learning library is just to really understand how all the pieces work so that when I start to use other libraries and frameworks I can have a kind of language to speak about them and I don't know some experience so anyway so did I say I'd be streaming until 230 I did yeah I meant an hour or so so it's 230 now until 330 or so okay so that's two things I want to mention and then of last on Friday I did the X or coding challenge and I thought it would just some reason I don't know why just felt like I wanted to do it again because a couple things one is I got some interesting comments so you know one thing that I think would be really useful to demonstrate is if I manipulate like okay well what if I use four hidden nodes instead of two hidden nodes and I just didn't have that as part of the tutorial which I think would be really useful but also I felt like I wanted to have some distance from the library I just was at the end of like hours and hours and hours of doing the back propagation and I really want that video to kind of stand alone in its own way and be disconnected from that so I thought maybe I would try it again and see what happens okay let's see so now what do i what let me while I'm here let me mention a couple other things this repository coding train slash rainbow code which ostensibly if you're not looking very closely is just a repository that has all the source code from all of my video tutorials right I can say that go look I want to find code for some one of the coding challenges or one of the p5.js courses or the node sockets playlist or code that was one of the QA videos I know tutorials courses there's there still could be some work done on organization here but you'll start to notice oh what are this underscore underscore underscore there's all this stuff landing page and then all of a sudden there's readme dot MD and contributing MD oh so this repository thanks to Niels woman thinks in large part to many contributors but most notably Niels web has turned into the repository which is also the coding train web site now I will open this up a bit wider so this is the new coding train so a drought for workinprogress and each video now has its if it's put into the website has its own page so for example the latest video is here snakes and ladders part 3 and this would obviously take me directly to the video on YouTube but if I click on this link here it'll take me to a page which has the video embed it has a link to run the example in the browser so here's the example running in the browser it has a link this link will download the code a little description here and then a place for community contributions but there aren't any yet but you can add your own by looking at this guide so you can submit a pull request to add yours there's links that were discussed links to the other parts of the video so this is an attempt to create a more navigable version a new more navigable system for finding and looking through all the videos separate from the YouTube interface as well as aggregating and collecting community contributions and relevant links and source code and that sort of thing so I think this website as remarkable and amazing and beautiful as it is it's just it's just like tremendous that Neil's web was able to just put this all together it runs on something called Jekyll which is a static site generator plating engine that works well with github pages I think you can still use work in visual design and it's missing a lot of content so I encourage any of you who are interested in kind of purging to participate in an open source project here's one for you if you I want to make a design contribution or add some content that's missing let me know that shift been on Twitter you can read hopefully the documentation that's in the github repository I would love to have people help with that all right is he sick right yes yeah I thought my cold was gone and that's why I felt comfortable I feel so much better but I think the congestion is still lingering in my throat's so I don't know I have a hold on let me just check here okay okay okay all right just looking at some messages here let me go back to the live channel what I'm looking at over here by the way is a slack channel I often get the question Oh what how could I ask a question or get help so of course I would always recommend that you use if you're if you've got a forum that goes well with a lot of my videos is forum dot processing org you can you can get in contact with me on Twitter but I also have a patreon and if you join the patreon at patreon.com slash coding train that's where you'll get an invitation to the slack channel which I will which I participate in and but honestly think about this black journal that's great it you know the idea was like oh I could help people with their code if they sign up and subscribe but there's so many people already now in this last channel who know way more than I do that are much more helpful so it's kind of built itself into a nice community there okay I'll take a couple questions from the chat ricardo asks have you ever thought about going fulltime youtuber actually I have I mean I have thought about it some ways I might be interested in doing it just so I can say fulltime youtuber it sounds like a weird thing like a crazy thing to say I do have a fulltime job that I love I live in New York City which is a very expensive and complicated place to live and so and then the job where I have is that a program called ITP and NYU in fact that's where I'm recording these videos so while I fantasize and think about it sometimes I don't know if it's realistic for me at this point and I wouldn't want to give up the wonderful inperson community and teaching stuff that I'm able to do through working here but it's interesting question okay Ben Anderson asks can could you explain to me the basic premise of neural networks so that's where I would recommend starting with the this neural networks playlist so in theory the bit I don't remember at all what did this video I made it quite a while ago but that's a introduction of neural networks and I believe I do cover in that video the basic premise of neural networks and I will rehash that again when I start doing the X or coding challenge and I also would recommend the three blue one brown neural network channel yes moving up state becoming a hermit is an excellent idea was a suggestion for how it could become fulltime youtuber and dye my hair green okay ah it's cold mmm this is not this is not I've been silent I guess all day and didn't realize okay so I'm looking at the chat well there's a class going in behind this wall and they're watching a movie right now I can almost hear what it is what's the chance you can hear it if I put my microphone up to the wall I probably just made a horrible scratching sound as I put the microphone on the wall alright so let's get set here okay so the first thing that I want to do is I want to look through the pull requests here and let's think about let's do this let's do this backwards so I'm gonna look at the oldest pull request and move up and see which of these I can merge now one thing you'll notice is they all have a green check mark and that green check mark is because I added unit testing testing to make sure the code does what it should be doing before it could be purged so let's say use matrix constructor okay so tidied up the construct this is from Phil a Turner tidying up the constructor a little bit plus I've never done a pull request before amazing could this possibly be fill a Turner's first pull request that we are hopefully going to merge okay then I wrote apologies can you resolve the conflicts I love this change but since I haven't explained fill in a video yet I wonder if it will be confusing I'm just you're reading my cup mint or maybe this means I better just get to explaining it conflicts are resolved and I am noting another issue that I discussed this in but let's take a look at the code changes here under files change excuse me ah so first of all oh this is a wonderful little addition here but I'll come back to that so look this is the change this is my ugly longwinded way of creating the two dimensional array to store all the values in a matrix and now instead and should this say should this a new array or is it okay to say oh no its array dot fill map a raid Phil zero so it passed the test so I can assume that I think this looks pretty good to me but let's let's just so I have this on record here if you haven't seen Phil before where is Phil now if you haven't seen Phil before JavaScript array functions alka in the patron group is saying it's fine it's ugly either way so the array object has a whole bunch of functions built into it like Phil fine filter Map Reduce and I really should make a list of let's make a list of these let's go lets go rainbow topics under issues and let me look at array let's see if there I think I have one that's talking about arrays like array higherorder functions in JavaScript so I definitely should do this okay neat let's making a list of functions to cover so I am going to add Phil here so by the way in github at issue if you do you might not be aware of this if you put this notation this will leave a checkbox and if I put this notation will leave a checkbox that's checked but I haven't made it yet so I know I want to cover Phil I know I want to cover map I know I want to cover reduce and probably filter right these are some array functions that I want to eventually cover so maybe in the chat if there's some is that some that would be important so I am now going to where am I merge this pull request well it's not this one where is it ah here we are I'm gonna go back to conversation and I'm gonna say merging this live on air and noting to make a video a video about Phil here okay comment and here we go okay I kid you not the class I'm in the middle floor which is the film school here at NYU and so they're always watching movies I think in the classroom next to me so I can hear the soundtrack I don't think I hear that that was totally a train going by it was like a very loud train going Trude going by I'm here with you people in the next room we are one on the train alright here we go merging confirming alright that thank you thank you that was emerged I was the pull request merged Alka is mentioning sort I I've actually talked about sort in a video I don't remember which one but I have a very distinct memory of using sort but like it it would be worth mentioning or covering in that context as well thank you for that all right so we got one pull request done now use es6 export import functions ok this I'm not ready for yet this is there's a nice discussion here it's also out of date but let me see if I can update it that should be fine because I merge that other pull request it's gonna run the tests again let's look at the files changed here yeah so this is using es6 modules and I feel like I'm not ready for that yet but I really should add that soon it'll fix the whole testing stuff so maybe I need to do a video about that and understand that better because it's got the export here and it had need to this like Babel thing so I could be talked into this but this I don't feel ready for you know I'm super thankful for this wonderful thoughtful pull requests okay so now updated todo list oh yeah this was a oh yeah this was somebody who added and fixed up the todo list that was in my nnj s file that I just put in the comments and I guess I had done I've done all these things now except for the end missed coding challenge I'm going to redo the XOR coding challenge today but I did make a comment about this one which is I thought this might be better in say the readme so I'm going to I'm gonna merge I'm gonna merge this right now because why not merge merge this for now but I but maybe someone will pull requests a new place for the todo list now interestingly enough I cannot merge it why is this there it's because it's got to run the tests again and it's probably waiting let's see show all checks oh it passed huh so what test has it not run yet that it won't interesting so I'll come back not sure why this won't allow me to merge it by the way if you're wondering what's going on with why this merge button is not available I did a whole video tutorial series about unit testing and continuous integration and there's a live stream which already is online archived but the actual edited videos are prepared but haven't been released yet those will start coming out tomorrow morning okay alright yeah me I am so be is yeah so if I were doing this properly I would probably want to like check a bunch of these things locally but I'm just I'm living on the edge I'm doing this just through the get up interface but I could like pull the branch and have it local test it out run the tests myself and I really don't understand why this one is not merging but I'm going to come back to here updating transpose test so this is a pull request that came in about at the transpose test and I added some comments and requested those changes those changes have not come in yet so I'm going to leave this one alone added more transpose tests and let's see if I can let's run this update so it's running the tests now there's some music playing in the other room all right we got to wait for the test to finish I could go on to a different polar craft but I like just waiting like to see it just like by the way we could see the test I think under details yep let's watch the test going here it is running it oops sorry look they all passed all the tests passed so it should now say the test pass yep all right let's look at what this coach puts so this is looks like it's adding a test for a transpose it's checking a one by one matrix then it's checking a 2 by 3 to 3 by 2 checking a 3 by 2 to 2 by 3 this looks good at checking to 1 by 5 this is nice I love this test ok great I think this looks good to me we need tests for the tests and I again I should look this over more carefully but you know this is just an open source project for fun I'm so appreciative merge and then confirm merge and we have merged this for a fest thank you to Mikael Souza who submitted that poll request has now merged okay now map improvements oh this one I'm excited about map improvements and using map instead of two nested forloops oh another reason why I want to redo the XOR challenge is I was playing with the learning rate and it wasn't working the whole time because I had the wrong variable name and this pull request is gonna help us with that so I am now going to go to map improvements and so so let's do this so the let me look at this one okay so made the made map past the row and column to the callback function so this is really useful I have a map function in the library which I could pull up and the map function expects a callback function that it applies to every element and sometimes you want to know the column and row the row and column indices and I didn't implement that so this implements that it and then it also has a lot of a use of the es6 arrow notation so I wasn't sure about merging this just yet but now that I have the I have the original source code backed up let's take a look at this so first of all let's run the tests again because I'm sure it's oh we've got conflicts now oh so sad so unfortunately there's some conflicts here because some of the other merges changed the same so you get a merge conflict and I need to do a whole video about this now this is my list of my github series you need to do a merge couple all right let's do a video about it right now this is great this is going to now be a tutorial that will go in my github my github list alright we're gonna resolve this live have a new sponsor why do I have always sponsored by waters but this was like to to destroy the earth I have to stand over here and drink my Earth destroying water all right all right hello surprise it's a video about git git and github and this video is about resolving merge conflicts so I probably should be doing this video in my poem repository which I use for all of my intro to get and github videos but I happen to be here streaming live and working on this neural network library that I've been building in a bunch of other video tutorials so if you just watch those git and github videos all about using a poem to sort of demonstrate how git and github works there'll be some aspects of this that are confusing but hopefully this will be helpful anyway and I can always double back and make another video if this one doesn't work but let's just try it so what is a merge conflict first of all so a bird conflict is when you have let's say on git let's say this is a file in this case it's my file called matrix da chess so I have a file called matrix da chance and it has code in it now I had two people two separate people of the internet happened to be working on this file so we'll call one person a and one person B now any text file has lines in it so even over a poem it would have lines of the poem if it's a source code file has lines of the source code so we can think of the lines as like 1 2 3 4 5 6 now if person a makes a change and submits a pull request meaning hey hey you the library please pull my changes right I want to push my changes to you but I've asked him requesting that you pull my changes if this person just made changes to lines 5 & 6 and this person just made chiton this person is doing the same thing but made saintly changes aligned 2 & 3 the get system is smart enough to figure out how to pull both of these things then with no conflicts because there are no conflicts if I want to accept changes of lines 2 & 3 I can accept those at the same time one before the other Cylons you asleep can't review it simultaneously as lines 5 & 6 however if right here person B makes a change to line 4 in person a also makes a change the line 4 then we have what's known as a conflict and typically what will happen and what just happened to me right now is I merged this one I merged this one wasn't and thinking about it was done it's finished and it works fine it merged with no problems but now when I went to merge this one I got a message saying resolve conflicts now there are a variety of ways you can resolve conflicts and I think that I had some of my previous tutorials looked at working with git command line locally and I could have the text file there but what I'm gonna do is see if I could resolve the conflict just through the github interface itself so let's take a look at how that works now once again this isn't the best scenario and I might come back and do a followup with be nice to see kind of a trivial example that just where I can really know what the changes are but I'm just going to look and see there's a whole discussion here and we can see these are the files these are the files that have conflicts in them matrix touch s and matrix dot test Dutch ass so hopefully you can continue to watch this even if you don't understand what the code in those files is doing i I'm gonna look and see what are the conflicts are oh this is definitely good this is gonna go down to go down the tubes the internet tubes really quickly so I'm gonna click this resolve conflicts button and now it's look at this ooh okay all right oh I mean matrix Jas hmm okay I have to figure out what's going on here so we can see I look this is where the conflict is oh look I think I know how to resolve this okay so this is where the conflict is now what is it telling me here math improvements master equals equals goodygoody Eagles greater than greater than so what this is showing me is this is showing me through kind of like a visual interface of the text file that there are two proposed ways that this code could run one of the files had it this way and one of the files had it this way in fact the current master has it this way but the one that I'm trying to merge has it this way and why does this one have it this way this is a thing that I changed I wanted this so it's up to me now there's no right or wrong answer here as the kind of proprietor of this github repository I've got to decide if both pull requests worked on worked on if sorry if both pull requests worked on the same line I have to pick one which one do I want and I want I'm gonna take this one at the bottom so I'm going to delete delete this and I'm gonna delete this whoops what did I just do I'm gonna I'm gonna delete this now if only I knew how to use a computer I'm gonna delete this and now are there any other conflicts please be no other conflicts oh I'm so lucky I'm gonna now say mark as resolved now one thing you can do if you're the proprietor of a github repository is you could just write to the person spinning the progress I'm so sorry but some conflicts arose I love your pull requests do you think you could refactor it because you could leave this up to the contributor certainly but I'm here live on the internet I mean maybe I'm not live anymore recorded and so there we go Oh No okay uh so now I have this other file hmm let's look at this I might just quit while I'm ahead here but let's see if I can look at this other file so this this code might look very strange to you this is something called unit testing and actually related to this video series I have a video series that I will link to in this video's description about how you can run automated tests that make sure a change in your code doesn't actually break your code that's what this is doing here so there's map improvements that's the pull request and master you know what I think this is a very trivial change it looks to me like this was just added at the end and there was like a line break or something that caused a merge kind of like so this looks like something that I could actually just completely delete here and then delete here and this is just some new stuff that got added to the end as part of this pull request there was like an extra line break or something so github detected a conflict but it really was not a conflict so now I can go and I can click mark as and look at this huh commit merge so here's the thing mmmhmm where am i right now so I mmm I resolved all the conflicts do I want to do this I think this button if I'm right is not actually and look at the chat to see if anybody's complaining about what I've done is not actually merging the pull request I think this is the committing the resolution of the conflicts to conflicts to the pull request let's find out because I'm gonna just it's a green button when I see a green button it just makes me wanna click it quick so I think the pull request is still going to be live and active but it's taking a while yes all it did yeah all it did was fix the conflicts where can I find that that was done here yes that was this so this is me now there's a little note that I merged branch master into map improvements that's basically saying there were conflicts between master and map improvements this pull request was map improvements and there was me merging them together and resolving the conflicts and now I can actually go ahead the conflicts are resolved and I can merge the pull request nothing exciting is an avenue it really should it should like a Betty should explode confirm and look but I can make something happen okay so that was a video about resolving merge conflicts through the github interface there's sort of basic gist of it perhaps I missed something important and I will certainly make a followup video so let me know what I missed what questions you have in the comments and thanks for watching this video about merging resolving conflicts merging them with a pull request something something get github I don't know like search engine optimized keywords throw them in there okay bye bye alright what's wrong with is the mic does the mic performing poorly right now am I having sound issues because if it is I would like to fix those no sound issues okay great all right so now that we did that where am I add a neural network look I love how live while I'm streaming new pull requests are being open Thank You Adam Morris with that that's fantastic okay add a neural network learning rate Center thank you to Iris son Gwen Neddy but you know I really just need to work on pronouncing people's names let's look at this okay oh oh oh is this actually dare I say using so this adds a center I probably do want oh no a setter yeah so this is this actually using this thing that I don't really know about which is es6 getters and setters do I have a rainbow topics issue keeping track of that I kind of want to talk about that at some point soon where's my up hold on sorry I tripped some water on the trackpad then I pressed some button by accident rainbow topics where's that so yes six prototype you've oh mmm get her nope all right so we need to do es6 getters and setters I need to do a video on that at some point okay so now we're back here so I think this looks good to me there's some so this is this can happen a lot which is unfortunate if looks like in this pull request some extra whitespace was added here like other a tab or some spaces which may get think that these two lines are different this is a little bit of noise that if I were a real stickler I would kind of want to not be in here but I'm not a stickler as you can tell from you just merging stuff and so now I'm gonna say I'm gonna update the branch I'm gonna write thank you it's gonna be running its checks let's watch the checks run it's running npm install right now and now it's running the test perfect timing well half an hour has passed 315 boy I take wait longer to do anything than I think okay so now I think I finished yep Birds okay that has been merged back to the pull requests update readme link to okay now let's do this I think this is exactly what I think oh yeah perfect so this is great this is a nice link to this is a nice link that if anyone's looking for the original source code with the video they can find it and by the way if anybody else wants to do this pull request if you can go to this repo and add a link from here back to here that would be awesome it might already be there so let's merge this one tests are still running looks like it's finished now merge pull requests there we go I didn't it will hurt version pull request one more to go now create a todo list Oh outofdate let's update it and let's take a look at it okay we use semver for versioning we do I never even heard of that that's something I have to learn about semver for versioning so this is like some noise some line break noise that got added in here by accident this is now the todo list and they got removed from here which is great I will say that most of this to do list is done so probably I'm what I would do it but I'm just gonna I'll do this change myself is and this pages out of date refresh I'm gonna merge this and there's some music playing in the room next door that you guys can't hear but like in here I'm gonna go here now to the readme I'm gonna click Edit and where's the todo list where did that to do is to end up it wasn't in the readme oh yeah that's so funny I looked at that pull request it just assumed it went here where did that pull request go closed create todo list Oh separate to do dot MD file whoo okay there we go obviously I'm gonna go here I'm gonna edit this this whatever this is was done this was done I mean this is oulous is almost silly now but this was done this was not really done different activation functions X or coding challenge oh this is not done this is not done and I'll add some other things add support for multiple layers multiple hidden layers and I'll actually change this to support for different activation functions this is something I would like to do with this library and these could be issues but combined with ml 5 slash deep learn J s ok so let's add this and I'm gonna make a pull request my this repo is so protected that even if I'm just editing one of the markdown files and I have the administer of the repo I cannot merge make this Burch this change into master without these tests running so we'll see if these tests run ok they ran they passed I'm gonna merge alright we're in good shape now we are now able to do some coding and I really wish I had not closed the playlist because I'm gonna need that or this so now let me open up terminal let's go here open come on come finder you window there you are examples XOR so what thing I'm going to do is ya know I'm gonna leave this here it's fine git status git pull origin oh I'm standing in front of this so I want to get all those changes now to have them locally ooh what did I change here there's nothing there okay and then what I want to do oh I should do that I terms birth map should die and then let's just run the tests locally to make sure everything is kind of going well okay there's 20 tests now they all passed that's awesome and let's open this up in Adam let's run a local server let's go to the browser now this is the example I made before I'm gonna completely wipe this example and start over so let's do that okay please hold they need to type my shoe drink someone or to blow my nose I'm not a tissue oh no I have another one I will mute myself right now I'm not sure why I have this extra jacket on that just do the job for today okay here we go I think I think it's time to read just a few random numbers to get warmed up relax go into a sleepy slumbered state of neural network training thirtyeight thousand two hundred seventy one fifty four thousand nine hundred sixty seven fifty eight thousand and forty six really need progressives twenty two thousand nine hundred fifty this is actually how I read now or I do this 22950 ninety seven thousand five hundred thirty three sixty one thousand nine hundred and thirty to five thousand one hundred and ninety nine sixty five thousand nine hundred and sixty eight sixty nine thousand seven hundred and eighty four twenty five thousand six hundred and fifty nine seventy four thousand nine hundred and fifty four eleven thousand one hundred and thirty nine thirty two thousand three hundred and forty okay yeah I know I said I was going to leave at 330 but I like to say I'm gonna leave like way earlier then I absolutely need to leave because as you know I never as much I barely ever start on time let alone finish on time alright energy people energy places places we're about to get started with a coding challenge why is mine a bit from slack that someone said okay by the way I am committed to somehow most likely through the magic of artificial intelligence if I ever hit 1 million subscribers I will read all 1 million random digits in a video again though I have a feeling that that's gonna end up being a computer generated because the amount of time it would take is absurd I would love to do something I could do something it takes like 5 or 6 hours some kind of marathon thing but I think it would take me a week without sleeping which is very unrealistic and not good for my health okay so I'm looking at the chat let's see I know how many viewers I've lost hopefully a lot I've been looking for this for the longest time it's a sleeve by the way for this computer that goes here this is gonna blow your minds whoa look at my magic sleeve that doesn't fall down magic trick I'm like a regular internet video magician watch this okay amazing what a little green paper will do okay um it'd be great if I could warn you about a mistake by making your watch notify you when you're at the whiteboard it's impossible to get your attendant yes so the thing is I will actually get in slack if you at Schiffman me it will notify my phone which will often I usually turn it off I usually turn notifications off but I I did just have them on just now because I forgot about that and so I can get oh look Simon sent me a nice picture of how Gators and feathers work I could potentially Alka get a notification today you could try that if I really messed something up now I'm gonna I have a totally different way I'm gonna do this video right now okay hold on a second okay let's give this some time here and see if this will work itself out I'm I'm just waiting for the neural network to learn I'm gonna use this as a visual visual aid visual reference all right that's good enough hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm going to make a version of this wait a second do you guys see it is there like a smudge hold on is that just like what is that smudge from oh oh weird that's just like an artifact on my screen that was so weird did you see that oh my goodness all right starting over hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to it's gonna sound really weird solve X or with the neural network now why would anyone want to do this why would I want to do this well what this is actually this is a video in which I am going to test a neural network library I've been building in JavaScript and in fact if you want to follow along with that process of building it there was a giant playlist here starting with 10.1 introduction to neural networks and I start building that library actually around oops play the video around 10.4 so this video is a standalone video where I'm going to make use of that library in a coding challenge you don't have to have watched all those but if you want the background with a bit more to go deeper in how the internal mechanics of this neural network that I'm going to use works I would refer you to those videos now what is this crazy weird visualization going on over here so let's I'm going to come back to in a second but let's come over to the whiteboard so this an example a very beginning basic rather trivial example of machine learning and what do I mean by that I mean I'm going to draw a circle here and I'm going to write ml short for machine learning you can think of this as a place where there exists some machine learning recipe some algorithm you might have heard of K nearest neighbor or neural network fillintheblank support vector machines so fill in the blank with your machine learning algorithm there with a machine learning algorithm something goes into it data how you collect your data how you're thoughtful about that what the data is how you call them quote normalize your data there's so many questions ethical questions scientific questions that go into this piece I am not covering that piece in this video but there needs to be some data something that I want to analyze or learn with that's the data portion then that data goes into the magical machine learning recipe and out comes some output now what that output could be it could be a piece of music that I've generated it could be a classification of an image it could be the price of a house that I'm trying to predict based on some data so there's so much possibility here and this output doesn't have to be a single thing but can be multiple things the input obviously the data can be multiple things this is the idea of machine learning now I spent all this time building what is mostly like a toy neural network library it's written in JavaScript there's nothing about it that's optimized but just to kind of understand the pieces of how it works so what I want to do is have my recipe be in there be a neural network and I want to create some scenario where I have some training Dana so what I'm going to do this is going to be a demonstration also of the machine learning process called supervised learning supervised learning meaning I am the supervisor and I am going to teach this machine learning recipe to produce output that appropriate output for a given inputs now what well if I just know all the answers why would I even do this well likely there's a scenario machine learning is gonna be used with a scenario where I have a lot of labeled data I have a known data set that I can use to train this system so that if I give it some unknown data it will give me out cut to give me an output a relevant output the classic example of this of course is I have a whole bunch of images I'm gonna say here's a bunch of I'm gonna tell the recipe here's a bunch of cats here's a bunch of dogs now here's a new here's a bunch of cats here's a bunch of dogs now here's a new image which one is it and along with this process we will typically have training data this is labeled data for which we know the answer we will have testing data this is data that we know the labels for but we aren't using in the training set so that we can see is it working this does it actually give us good good outcomes with unknown data and then of course we have the actual unknown new data that we want to use okay so what's the scenario that I'm going to use the trivial realms rather ridiculous example that I'm going to use in this video is the xor xor stands for exclusive or it's a boolean operation that resolves to true only if so you can think of true and if true x or true is actually false i didn't finish my sentence it resolves to true only if one of the two boolean expressions value is true so false x or false also is false and if you go back to my video that's linked here about the perceptron the lib you'll see that this is this is a special problem because a single simple perceptron a single neuron machine learning system cannot solve this problem it is not linearly separable the solution space is not a space where you can just draw a line and see all the categories of one on one side and all the kind the other on the other side so you can dive into that deeper but this is where a neural network that involves a hidden layer can be used as the machine learning recipe so what I mean by this is I need my training set my training set is going to be 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 I'll have 4 elements in my training set and each one of these is labeled this is labeled with a 0 this is labeled with a 1 this is labeled with a 1 and this is labeled with a 0 this is the known data right again this is a sort of trivial you know I could build you could build a circuit right imagine what it would take to build a circuit with two switches and the LED only lights up if one switches on they're both on it doesn't light up if they're both off it doesn't lay it off think about how you might build that that's essentially going that that diagram of that circuit is essentially what we want the neural network to look like so the way that it's going to look and let me erase this here is we can see here in my labeled data set that there are two inputs and one output so the neural network structure has to have two inputs and one output I'm going to send in x1 and x2 these are true and true true and false false or true and somehow out of this I should get a why I should get a true or false so how you architect and structural a neural network system this is something that I've gone into much more depth in the other videos but the key to this problem is having what's known as a hidden layer so the inputs come in here I want to look at the output here but these neurons are going to exist in between so everything this is also what's known as a fully connected Network so as the inputs come here they both go into this hidden layer some math happens this is the math that I go over in a previous video it has to do with multiplying by weights these are all weighted connections then the then those go into this output layer we get the answer and then there is a training process we say try it with this what internally in the training process what it does is if I give it zero zero with a zero and it outputs a one it's like I tell it hey you got that wrong adjust all those weights to try to see if you could get it more correct so we're gonna do is over and over again to train it to see if we can then later we don't have a separate training and testing set in this scenario we're just going to say I'm gonna train it and see if you can start producing the correct answers for all of these numbers okay that's the background for XOR now I'm actually going to go and write the code to do all this it works okay so how's it going here I want to see did I miss anything kind of crucial there I'm gonna go into the code part now all right sounds pretty good to me okay good ringing endorsement okay so you might recall that I started the video I had this thing up here so this is actually an example that I made in the processing java based programming environment I probably like almost eight years ago at this point so it's not using the same code base but it's actually solved the XOR problem and what's interesting about this and I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to the whiteboard just for one more moment here let me find some room here if I draw a plane and I consider this to be zero zero and this to be 1 1 so this is 1 comma 0 and this is 0 comma 1 right notice that if I take this idea of XOR and map it to here I've got false here false here true here and true here and by the way that what I write are one there to here and true here this by the way is why it's not linearly separable you can't draw a line I could draw two lines like this or I can draw two lines like this and you're gonna see that result happen actually as I start to program this I hope if it works but what this this idea of a plane this is a plane that's describing the whole solution space for the problem and if you come back over here you'll see look at that those corners if I bring this over closer to me I can try to point to it these corners are the true quarters any more practice and these corners are the false corners and this plane is all the other solutions now this is a 3d rendering it's soon some fancy stuff I'm gonna create a simpler version of this so let's just actually start doing that so what you're going to need first of all is if you're writing this code along with me you're going to need to have the toy neural network Jas library it has really just two files that you need it has neural network J s and n n dot J's and matrix such as you could ignore this this is for testing that's something I cover in some other videos that you could probably find and you'll see that in my index.html file I am referencing those two JavaScript files I've got like a weird path thing going on but when I published the code I'll publish that all as one one thing okay so now I need to go over to sketch KS let's do some stuff here let's write us to have function let's write a draw function let's say let I'm gonna have a neural network variable I'm going to say create canvas 400 400 let's draw a background of 0 and let's let's go to the browser and see there we go there it is step 1 now what I want to do is create a neural network and I've written out how I want to create it I want two inputs two hidden neurons and one output so the neural network library the toy library that I've built expects those as arguments to the constructor so I guess a neural network equals a new neural network with two inputs two hidden neurons and one output neuron now I should mention that my socalled deep learning systems often have many many many hidden layers hundreds of hidden nodes big massive networks this is a very small simple one the library only supports networks with these two layers the input that well that you consider the input you can say three but really these were the layers they're hidden in the output plus the inputs three things okay now what do I do I need my training data so I'm going to say let training equal and I want to have it be in an array and each element of the array I want it to be an object and it's going to have the inputs which would be like this and the outputs now even though I only have one output right one output outputs can be an array they're also referred to as a vector so a list of numbers but in this case 0 0 gives me just a single Apple or I'd have single outputs when I put the array the library expects an array so I have that inputs out 0 0 I have 0 1 and 0 0 gives me a 0 not a one I have 0 1 which gives me a 1 I have 1 0 which gives me a 1 and then I also have what's the last one 1 1 which should give me a 0 so this is my training data now ordinarily this data might be in a spreadsheet it might come from an API it might be in a JSON file but I'm just hard coding the training data directly into my program just to demonstrate the idea now what do I want to do well in the draw function what I want to do is and now if you're look at how machine learning algorithms work typically you'll see something called you'll have a batch training process where you give it a large batch of data and then you adjust then you adjust the weights and do the training and then another batch I'm gonna do everything just one at a time and the way I'm going to do that is with a function called train that's in the in the neural network library so if I say neural network trained this expects two arguments what it expects to say train the neural network with this input and this expected output and so the easy thing here that I could do I could what it what it should look like is something like this train it with zero zero and with one oh right so this is what I'm saying these inputs should produce this output train yourself on that but I have so I have that all stored in an array what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say data equals random training and what did I call that up here I called it training I just called the training let's call it training underscore data training underscore data so the random function in p5 will pull a random element from that array and it will put it here in data so then I could just say train it with these inputs and expect these outputs it's only one output but outputs so this is the process this is the training process of course all of the work to adjust the weights of the neural network it's in the library and you can go and stop saying this refer to those videos that go through that process okay we've got that now I am going to let's just run this and see if I get any errors ah syntax error sketch dot J's line four oh look at this horrible my JavaScript object syntax is just completely off these are not semicolons you guys have all but everyone watching it's been screaming at the screen take two oh I have semicolons here these should be commas my syntax is completely wrong if you're watching this you were probably screaming at me or saying very nicely and sweetly to the computer okay there we go now let's run again all right it's running its training isn't working so now that here's the thing it's doing its thing let's actually see if it's working because one thing I can do right now is I can just test the output here in the console itself what is this weird graphics artifact going on here I'm going to ignore that I'm gonna say nn predict so the predict function is a function in the neural network library that doesn't take the inputs and the nut and a labeled output it just says here's some inputs tell me what you think tell me what the output is so if I give it zero zero shouldn't I get 1.0 ooh that's not good point four nine mmm that's not good point five one oh it's doing a little better it got a little higher that's closer to one point five one well no point four nine again so this is the thing I have done I have programmed this in such a way that first of all it needs to run these data points in thousands or possibly hundreds of thousands of times to be able to train itself and also this is a problem that with only two hidden nodes it can kind of get stuck right it could get stuck in the sort of inbetween state I was trying to think of how to I know I didn't want to cover the getting stuck thing let me just go again and hope that it does it's a time that it doesn't get stuck so this will get edited because I do want to cover the getting stuck thing because I think there's some things we can do to with my adjusting the learning rate and I'm mucking around with it but it just didn't want that to happen right now so just run it again it's running it's running so what I can do is right here in the console just to test it I can type and and dot and there's a function called predict and what predict expects in the neural network library is the input data with no output because it's not labeled training data it's just input data so let's see if we can get results that makes sense and hasn't trained for very long and I don't know but let's see let's just write predict 0 0 0.45 that's not right so I should be seeing 0.1 right it's changing 0.43 so my guess here is that we really needed to just train a lot more what I'm gonna do is just for right now is I'm gonna say I in the draw loop itself I'm gonna say I equals 0 I is less than a thousand I'm gonna have it do every time through draw a thousand a thousand of these training points so this will hopefully get us there a little faster and I can look at this now we can see ah whew now that's wrong right oh no that's correct no I should be getting I should be getting false yeah so that's right I didn't got it backwards for a second I shouldn't be getting true I should be getting a false 0 0 so let's try 1 0 and I've got something that's close to 1 so you can see that this work okay so the library is working but let's say I want to visualize it okay I want to visualize it I want to see it working I want to see it animating as it works so one way I could do that is I could basically let's create some variables like resolution I'm gonna make a grid of 10 by 10 pixels so the columns is the width of the canvas divided by the resolution and the rows is the the height of the canvas divided by the resolution then I am going to say x equals 0 X or I'm gonna use I I equals 0 I is less than the number of columns I plus plus and I'm gonna say J equals 0 it's less than the number of rows I'm gonna do a nice little nested loop here just to now I'm going to say fill random 255 and I'm gonna say rectangle I times resolution J times resolution resolution I shoulda picked a less long variable name resolution so with this should do is this is a nice little nested loop to just draw a grid of rectangles ten by ten and a little warning this will be kind of flashy so you can see all of these all these elements are flashing out with a random color but I don't want a random color what I want to do is I want to create some inputs so I'm going to say let x1 equal I divided by columns right from 0 to 1 let x2 equals J divided by rose and the inputs then is an array x1 x2 so what I want to do is I want to create a scenario let me just say no loop here so this stops I want to create a scenario where I am inputting in 0 0 here and at this corner 1 0 and 1 1 and 0 1 down here and all the numbers in between right so now and then I what I can do is I can say let y equal neural network predict and this should be an equals here it's this particular predict those inputs and then fill Y times 255 so I should get a brightness value out that's between I should get a Y value that's between 0 and 1 and I should get that a brightness value I can both my by 255 to get a brightness value okay let's run this boom so we can see now and let's let's let's be a little more thoughtful about this and say no stroke then I'm gonna refresh it and very quickly now ah so this I'm so glad this happened so here's the thing it works for me a bunch of times but actually here you can see it's totally getting stuck let's refresh it again and I got stuck in a slightly different way we hit refresh again whoa it's just like going around the Horde and getting stuck in every possible way now how it worked so here's the thing remember how I said neural network is an interconnected set of nodes which each connection being a weight so there's a couple important factors here what is those weights are initialized randomly and it there are thoughtful ways that you could initialize those weights but I kind of like initialize them in a certain way the problem is there's multiple solutions here so there's one solution here where there's white all the way along this way and if i refresh this a bunch of times you'll see there's another solution where there's black all the way down through the middle because honestly the only thing that's correct is the core is what's in the corners so I've run this a bunch of times isn't this the opposite of what we got before I can't remember so there's a bunch of different solutions here and it sometimes can get stuck in that middle so I might one thing I might be able to do is play with something called the learning rate so there is a variable in the the library called learning rate and I could say neural network learning rate equals there's a set function but I think timeout here does some just pause for a second just somebody who was watching this know if this has the this set learning rate does this mean I should do maybe this isn't using this getter setter in the es6 way does this mean I should call a function called set learning rate or does this mean I'm supposed to do the thing where I can actually say learning rate equals and it kind of automatically calls this function I'm waiting for like somebody to weigh in so I should call set learning rate the way that is written because there's some fancy getter setter thing you can do that's not an es6 setter okay so someday might might be an es6 center but it's not gonna be right now no setter okay should I make it a setter like should the library have a center would that be like a good thing to do this is me just waiting for the Internet to tell me which to do I mean I don't really need to be getting into this right now right it's only really useful if I want to get the learning rate okay okay let's not worry about that right now so I forgot the library actually has a function called set learning rate and so what I can do is I can set this to some value now what should that learning rate be the learning rate is like how big are these steps how big are these adjustments and so maybe what I'll do here is I will create a LR slider for learning rate slider and I'm going to say LR slider equals create slider and so I'm gonna have learning rates that go between 0 and 0.5 that's probably a ridiculous range with an incremental step oh it will start at 0.1 and an incremental step of 0.01 so this is a p5 Dom function create slider that creates an html5 slider puts it on the page and so now I could just say LR LR underscore slider dot value so this should if I'm right always set the learning rate according to this so let's see if I put it up here and I say neural network learning rate it's 0.5 and if I go down to here it is zero now I shouldn't let it be zero right so the lowest the learning rate should be is probably 0.01 so let's see if we can get it stuck now of course it well I'm gonna hit refresh a bunch okay it's stuck let's see if just like allow you to take bigger steps one way or the other we'll sort of fix the problem yeah it's still really stuck interesting now I guess what I could do is I could if it's stuck I could reset the neural network so neural network a random eye or is there a function of the neural network library to randomize the weights again yeah let me let me go from where I stopped with the slider though no that doesn't really work well one thing I could do is I could kind of like Reese we randomized the weights I could like that could be something I don't know oh the learning rate is only being applied after a sow no but it'll it'll come back cuz once it doesn't it doesn't get that's a good point in the chat something saying it's the learning rate is only being applied after a thousand iterations but it just has to wait for that 1,000 it's not like then it's back again the reason why I could get stuck is because there's two possible solutions and it I was gonna add forward in two hidden nodes and I think that will help it but I'm trying to think of I can't remember what I put into the neural network library like I guess to read to reset it okay I have an idea now okay let me let me let me try this again so let's try let's try now let's try lowering the learning rate that didn't really seem to fix it's really stuck here so one thing I could do is I could just like start it over like new neural network two to one and now I've just started it over and that's still stuck let's try it again well let's leave it at like point one so I could write this as an in a function to like if to like restart it a bunch of times and just get lucky with the first weights another thing I could try though just to see if this really helps the thing is I thought I probably need to do is be more thoughtful about how the weights are initialized which is something I would need to probably want to build into the neural network library but you're sort of curiosity let's add four hidden nodes so do we make the network smarter by giving it more things to learn about right so I'm adding in all of these whoops this goes to here right there are more connections more connections more possible things for it to learn about let's see what happens ooh look at this look at that it's nice and curvy it's sort of like learned it and slowly weed every way and I suspect that I'm gonna have a lot harder time having it get stuck now you can see that there's multiple protocol correct solutions to how the space looks but it's really able to figure it out now that's really the end of this video the point of this mostly was just to test the neural network library so it works I can use it I can give it data to learn I can try it with other day and I can visualize its result now so here's the thing you're watching this video what should you do next well first of all I'm gonna new another challenge which is the kind of classic hello world neural network machine learning example which is to recognize handwritten digits and they're so well known test set em nest that I will use hey kind of don't want to but I think it's worth me just doing that just to do it but that would be a think more interesting problem and then we can even make it so that if I draw a digit can the neural network detect what digit it is so anyway so that's coming but could you oneone come up with your own data set trying to train the neural network with your own data set and then how does it perform you also might think about visualizing this output using color in some way you know you could use 3d as I showed you with this process example which is no longer open so you could try a variety of different ways of visualizing this and maybe or animating it or changing the way you would yet build an interface to it there's so many possibilities so I encourage you to explore it I encourage you to dig in also to the neural network library code if you want to see how that works and check out those other videos as well so thanks for watching this coding challenge I think that's it that's it that's it I'm done I'm sorry it's interesting how like what kind of weird results we can get Oh try playing around the slider now I should have done that so actually one thing I should do is that I should really have done this because it's more interesting to watch it figure it out slowly over time but I guess this is not as exciting to watch let's try just with ten probably too slow to watch yeah I'm just trying to what's the sweet spot of like being el Tet it to slow it down but to also like yeah so this is probably better a hundred because you can kind of see it learning more slowly over time okay uh all right so I think I'm finished for today it's four o'clock oh it's because of the sigmoid I forgot yeah yeah that's interesting right there's no correct answer for this center spot really and so it can yeah I be interesting to just actually run this with a different activation function and to put that into the library but I'll have to come back to that later okay I don't know if this was better than the time that I did this before it probably took longer but yeah make it make it slow and play with the learning rate that's kind of interesting that's an interesting idea all right so let's do that let's make it slow like 10 let's up that learning rate see it's making big jumps they're too big and now I can lower it to refine oh yeah that's kind of interesting yeah so plain what the learning rate really does make a difference okay so I'm here I'm just about done but I do have a few minutes that take some questions it was really good okay thanks I just felt like I needed some space from what I made the library because I was in my own head of like what did I say before what that I didn't and so this is I hoped would kind of give an introduction you could kind of my goal for this was that you could watch it without having watched that other playlist but you could get more for watching the other playlist I don't know I can add a slider for the iterations that's a smart idea that's a very smart idea so let me talk for a little bit about what I want to do on Friday even though I'm so tempted to do some of it right now but I think I will do it on Friday let's so here actually let's go this is exciting let's do a live adding to the coded train website so I think if we go in here under streams we can see these are now there's so many more that need to get added here these are the markdown files for all of the live streams and so the live stream this Friday would be one well today is what today okay so let me go to my channel you know I don't want to go to youtube home coding train live what by the way it's so interesting to see that what like things that thinks I should watch based on because this is not my personal YouTube account this is like a random YouTube account that I set up just for live streaming I don't know why I think I should watch this football video but what I want to do is go to the coding train I'm subscribed to the coding train and Oh interesting okay um I sorry I always had some important messages but I will I will get back to those in a minute I shouldn't be looking at my messages we'll have live streaming I'm looking for playlists and actually I can just do this the last live stream was number 118 so today is 119 and this Friday I don't know what time I'm gonna do it this Friday probably in the morning actually this Friday so if I create a new file create new file 119 upcoming live stream dot MD create a scheduling Friday's live stream and I'm going to make that new file then I'm gonna go here and I am going to go look at another one I'm gonna look at this one called walks and I'm gonna look at how its I'm gonna do this because that's actually this one's not this is no longer an upcoming live stream but I'm gonna grab this and I'm going to edit this file I'm gonna paste this in so now the date for this Friday today is the 7th 8th 9th to 9 and the topics will be so this Friday what I want to do is M NIST coding challenge pendulum pendulum coding challenge spring coding challenge what I mean by spring is Hookes law and and double pendulum coding challenge now there might have been something else so I'm kind of doing double duty here in that I'm trying to push the neural network stuff further machine learning stuff but I also want to I'm this week in my course at ITP that I'm actually teaching this week was about oscillating motion so I wanted to look at Springs and pendulums and I've always wanted to program the double pendulum so but I feel like it's weird to do the double pendulum a challenge without having done the pendulum coding challenge let's just make sure I haven't done these videos already so one way to figure that out is Schiffman pendulum now I know I have video about a pendulum but I think in this video which is two years old first of all it's in processing I don't have any gray hair and I'm pretty sure I don't actually code the pendulum from scratch I'm just talking through an example so I don't see anything else about a pendulum so that's good what about Springs Springs toxic lives simple harmonic motion but again these are all the old ones ooh I do have a guest tutorial with Val head about a spring animation Oh wonderful and that's great so this you should check out maybe I don't maybe I won't do that because I'll just refer to I'll look at that and see if it's doing the same thing that I want to do and then I remember I use toxic lives for some stuff so I have this pendulum simulation so I think that's kind of my plan I'll probably let this spring go and focus just on the pendulum stuff if so now wait wait a second wait a second the reason why I was doing this mmm this doesn't look right could this possibly be right well if I did this correctly now if I go to the coding train comm I'm gonna check my email to make sure I didn't get like a build error I don't see one if I now go to streams and go to the bottom mmm so I probably did something wrong he's one I might have used a bat so let's look at one that's actually showing up so let's look at 104 104 let's go to edit oh yeah oh look at this no this is right let's look at this so this one's showing up so I'm just going to paste this in I think I did something wrong topics oh wait I know what the problem is topics yeah I think if I look at the format here title this should be under here and this should just say topics and maybe it's I want to do this so maybe I want it to be like this oh is the date format wrong I have an extra line break at the top is that the only problem but let's use this format let's use this format let's try this and then I can video I there's no video ID yet oh and this should say by the way I want this to say oh you know I wouldn't be surprised if this requires this February 9th yep that's right 400 p.m. let's try this and then here live stream okay oops more neural networks and also pendulums let's just put that there okay let's look at this how we doing here is this possibly correct let's try this let's does correcting live stream page let's do this this looks better like if formatted it and so now we have to wait for the page to build so I will take some questions maybe indent the topics check if there's a plugin for your editor does it show up on the home page I think one of the ideas was to have the upcoming next upcoming live stream always be here latest videos by the way also these are the links now so the patreon link merchandise link and then link to the Amazon shop is here let's go back to streams I'm sure just be screwing this up it's also possible that because getup pages can take so here let's be a little bit more thoughtful about this let's actually clone the repo so those of you are wondering what how does this even work let's go let's clone now this is probably gonna be a very long clone so let's just get the repo to the desktop this is gonna take a little while we'll have it pretty fast oh it's working for me I am Sabine made it work I was gonna just try running Jeckle locally oh maybe it's caching I'm gonna force a refresh is it on the homepage by the way there's also one thing I'm just realizing now there's no link back to the front page although may if I click here it is yes oh there we go look at that upcoming live stream ah that's why I probably want to put it okay there we go look there it is so now whenever I schedule one the upcoming live stream should be there now it has the wrong time I'm not sure why I thought I fixed that let's go back to streams let me do this locally let's go through this okay I've got it so I've cloned the repo if you want to work on it and understand and contribute to it locally if I go now to Rainbow code now I have no idea if Jekyll is installed it is apparently of course it just gave me a bunch of errors so let's say this is the problem is I have I've never used Jekyll or Ruby on this login to this computer so I hesitate to go get this all working right now but let's just Jekyll is a framework for building static web sites and I'm gonna just do this let's see if I can all right yeah so I've got to update Ruby the guest is really okay trying to decide if this is worth doing right now so let yeah let's look let me do I have so one thing that I use is our VM so let's use our VM so I'm gonna grab our VM which should let me do this here our VM is Ruby version manager so this should allow me to manage the versions of Ruby I have to start using our V and you need to run sort yeah so I need to do this so it's running okay our VM so I think to install with a certain version of Ruby what I want to do I really don't know what I'm doing here by the way is document I just want the installation yeah I've installed it I just want like a how do I install which version I'm using our VM our VM list our VM install okay our VM install and then what did it say on Jekyll I need to be using which Ruby Jekyll it's probably give me an error because or what does it say I can't believe I'm doing this on a live stream what I'd say requires Ruby 2 point two point five okay let's quit that our VM install this so now I'm installing Ruby 2 point two point five checking requirements error is not all right oh my goodness brew doctor yeah doctor doctor let's see if this works Oh permission denied pseudo brew doctor this okay okay okay how about pseudo RVM install two point two point five oh boy really oh oh okay let's install homebrew wow I I didn't realize that okay failed don't this is route Wow what is going on on this login could not set could not permission denied can I get rid of homebrew Wow Wow oh my goodness I can't believe this is where I am right now what was I trying to even remember us trying to do I was trying to show you how to run Jekyll I just a lot mmm I've been in this situation so many times could not lock in fig file permission denied am i all right let's that's alright let's let's go down this rabbit hole for 10 more minutes then I'm out of here okay Oh maybe if I just use I term I'd be fine let's try this yeah it's the same that's the same thing I was running before create an access token Wow well someone probably wrote in the comments here well what's the error that I'm getting again permission denied what did I do wrong I kind of want to okay how do I uninstall homebrew okay let's uninstall let's do this oops yes yes oh my goodness Commission's I for missions and I appreciate you may wish to me this is loads of fun okay let's brew update oh yeah okay I don't have it anymore that's good brew cleanup oh yeah I don't have it anymore okay all right oh yeah okay we're in business now come on why was this tonight oops no no why oh yeah this is definitely gonna do it this is the solution to all problems yet can you hear there's no sense it's not installed yet okay well if I got rid of homebrew can I use our VM now yeah does it need homebrew or our VM installed two point two point five it's all I wanted to do oh look at this about to install homebrew restart it's totally not gonna work but all right oh look at this this is promising we'll be nice to have Jekyll working because if I own show religion oh it's pouring it full pouring it you just pour we pour a little bit of that on poor OpenSSL extracting just mind if I check my email but that was totally just reading my email there I forgot that I was even livestreaming okay Wow as npj would say this is authentic programmer waiting wish I had some coffee coffee would be so good right now okay that finished I totally I don't even know what I'm doing anymore so now RV and used use I think I say two point if I want it to like I want to use that version okay now I'm using that version okay good good good now let's go back to Jekyll I should be able to say gem install Jekyll bundler and poopy two point two point five is old should I be using a more current one well why did I say two point two point five Wow I probably like have no room left on this computer's hard drive either it's like this I'm expecting this just to like ding ding ding ding ding ding oh what's the minimum should I really go and install uh that was the minimum oh wait okay well let's see if it works does it finish now okay and what was it called so okay so what I should be able to do now is say bundle exec Jekyll serve so if I had in this repository this is now the the coding train website repository cloned locally this computer if I say bundle exec Jekyll serve a bundle install have to install all the gems I forgot about that and we're back where am I what year is it am I still installing nokogiri control well there we go control l thank you very much so now let's try this again amazing amazing it still hasn't built yet though it's a big site with a lot of stuff very soon it will have built there we go so the server is now running so I can now grab this and I can go to the browser and we can see here is the coding train website and now here is the card which now has the upcoming livestream so now what I can do is I can be a bit more diligent about this and I can actually just try editing all this stuff locally so I want to go to streams and upcoming livestream 119 and actually what I want to do let's see I'm gonna actually take this out put this here and and when I hit save right we should see that I hit save it is now going to regenerate because I did save so it's regenerating the site it's not finished yet and it's done took 11 seconds and I should be able to refresh now and there we go so now you can see whoops that's there why oh I forgot that I left this stuff in here so I can get rid of this now it was just that line break at the top the whole problem stemmed from the fact that I had that way so now I can do this you can see actually you can see the syntax highlighting completely disappeared this is Yamma which stands for yeah markup language apparently and our young adult markup language maybe I'm not sure it stands for what else could why a be okay so now we can see this is hopefully now of livestreams still says 4 p.m. because I want this to be 10 and although now I'm wondering actually based on my schedule I thought I saw something in my email about something that had to happen on Friday morning so let me look back so I thought might might change it but I'll put it there for now so and then I can come back here and we can see here it is the upcoming live stream is here so you can always check if I've done my job you could check the website for the next upcoming live stream and this link should take you to and actually it took you here and there I am but actually it should take you to now this should be the URL because I have a new I got this new check mark URL Figgy from youtube and so so let's see if we could find where that is we're in this repo is user slash Schiffman lots of places video card it's in the includes now I don't want it to show no but I don't want where did it render the site oh that's hidden okay it's all ready so I think I want dare I like it first of all let's do this so let's let's add this commit so this is new live stream so I've committed that now what I'm going to do for probably against my better judgement is just replace this with now is it silly to put cap in the URL I don't like how that looks let me just make sure it works if I go to youtube.com the coding train live does that work yeah I feel like I'd rather have it be lowercase the Capitals kind of freaked me out so let's do that so let's change this to so this should be the coding train I'm gonna change that everywhere it appears yeah 11 times all over the place how bad could that be did I do it okay done done let's do git status so it got changed in a whole bunch of places which makes sense I guess what's in this folder here oh that's the includes in the layouts okay great git commits updating to new Jekyll I mean sorry new coding train URL and there's a website still working this takes me to coding train live subscribe on YouTube oh that's interesting this somehow is still going to and this should be a button that automatically subscribes you that's not crew this should really be this should subscribe there's a way to have the button automatically subscribe you to the channel which this is not doing so where does this showing up learn to code where's this content is it on landing page learn to yeah there it is Oh site links YouTube ah okay so this is a special case though because this should be a subscribe button YouTube channel I've lost the chat here oh oh well Oh am I gonna have a double slash double forward slash 56 new messages since I stopped looking at the chat double forward slash okay hold on let's search for let's search for the coding train maybe you guys can't see what I'm doing let's search for the coding train double slash oh yeah everywhere whoa it also oh yeah coding train double slash double slash double slash so let's fix that first of all replace all get and get commit fix double slash and this might not be the proper way to do it but somebody in the chat just gave me the subscribe so I think let's try this let's go to let's okay let's go to here still took me there that's fine that's weird wait where is that coming from then if it says hold on hold on I'm talkin to people the room next door this why is this still going to user slash Schiffman okay although we got to figure this out it's a landing page this is pulling this from site links dot YouTube so that must be in config right but it's psyched out links why didn't that not rebuild I guess that doesn't rebuild let's rebuild the whole site so I'm rebuilding the site I apparently have a wrong video number 119 and 116 yeah I've been pushed the site live yet that's correct okay so let's see if that fixed it yes this is now going to the coding train and so what I want is to have it on landing page B and then it's question mark sub confirmation 1 sub underscore confirmation equals 1 pretty sure that's gonna subscribe me so this hasn't I'm going to go here and I am going to unsubscribe I am unsubscribing from the coding train unsubscribed now we will go back to the website and I'm going to click on this link and are you sure you want to subscribe okay now I have subscribes I'm back up to my subscription number so that's good so I did that so add automatic subscription link okay now what was the other thing somebody was telling me I had the video numbers wrong Oh interesting I don't have to unsubscribe to get that okay so what was it that somebody was saying that I I have the video numbers wrong let me look back the reason why yes here's the thing Oh 118 is already more neural networks oh I'm totally wrong because today is 119 and also why is 116 what's I'm so confused but let me go to the let me look at the website here so oh it says 116 there yes yes I see and actually it shouldn't even be 119 119 because it should be 120 and so let me rename the file it should be 120 because it's the last one that is on YouTube is in fact 118 that beats today right now is 119 and Friday is 120 so so I change it to 120 and let me do get status so I'm gonna do get a a and I'm I did that capital a I don't know if needs to be capital because I deleted to file and so I want to make sure that delete gets pulled gets added as well Friday is 120 and then why not add one for today if I do I'm not gonna add one for today so this is the thing anybody watching this video wants to help there are look at this a live stream could be the markdown file could be added for all of you know it only starts here about 104 coding challenges I think whoops I think I'll have a markdown file for every coding challenge looks like I have a markdown file for every coding challenge but I'm missing so many markdown files for the courses and tutorials and also just generally speaking if you have ideas for how this site can be more navigable visually pleasing make more sense just you can clone it you can run Jekyll locally like I did you can make changes to it it's all HTML CSS markdown and some weird Jekyll stuff but play with it make fixes make changes I could use some unit tests for it like one thing would be good to have a unit test that checks to make sure the Jekyll build is right yes and yeah I would love help with that but right now I at least have successfully scheduled this Friday's livestream now one thing I should say this is my speculation I might change to the afternoon but I will try to update this if I do but this at least now is going to be a system for me being able to alert people of when the next livestream is it comes to see the latest videos and all this stuff all right I think that's all I've got to say for right now oh let me push it to live to the site so I've now pushed this live so you should now see this if I go to the coding training calm now you don't see it right now because these Jekyll builds can take a little while all right for coding challenge Friday or one of them well certainly my goal is to do all four I wouldn't be surprised if I only got to one or two or three but my goal is to do all four okay so I'm done for today I will happily take a few last questions for a sigmoid which 445 I really had a cow for a sigmoid should the outputs be negative 1 1 instead of 0 1 just thinking no the sigmoid function squashes any number to a range between 0 and 1 there's a function called tan H or a hyper tangent that's another activation function that is used with neural networks that gives you an output between negative 1 and 1 but sigmoid is doing out for between 0 and 1 and the most sort of the the activation function that's used most commonly now is called brand new or I like to say if a new and that actually just gives you a number between 0 and infinity ok do you have plans of teaching js4 embedded devices like Esprit no chess or puck Duchess I don't have any plans but that sounds like a great idea and that would probably be a good good territory for a guess tutorial hopefully I can get a little more handle on my schedule and have more guests are you going to carry on with neural networks convolution etc yes I'm going to keep Durrell networking and carrying on and but I do I'm not sure I don't think that I'm going to continue to build every style and flavor and architecture of neural network into this toy javascript library this I really meant to do like the sort of first beginning steps and then if I do stuff with say a convolutional neural network I'll do that with a ha deep learn yes and possibly this ml5 digest library when are you going to add splitting to the game agario no probably not for a while but that people have really requested that I follow up on that challenge so that's but are you interested in a coding train app yes you know the budget that I have for this channel is small and I do use the patreon funds for video editing and other production and design services and Apple could be something that I would potentially want to invest some funds and having somebody develop but I also wouldn't be opposed to having a community built app that somebody works on is for volunteer if you're interested in that please get in touch but I don't let you know the web site is kind of right now living in this sort of like volunteer its place but I'm not opposed to I don't know what I'm saying here but yeah I'm not opposed to an app that would be interesting can you teach us Python no I was planning to do Python because I was gonna use Python for all this neural networking machine learning stuff and then use a flask server to talk to my JavaScript and then it descended from the Google deep learned digest came out and that's really shifted my thinking into kind of really staying within the browser for this stuff but I do hope to add node and maybe electron to some of the stuff that I'm doing but a Python I would probably wanna have some guesses for coding trade app coding challenge okay oh the song ended okay thank you everybody for watching this was a bonus live stream I think that XOR was an improvement over my previous XOR challenge but I would let the wonderful math blanks matchy let me know what he thinks and so start tomorrow will come out the video series on unit testing and continuous integration with circle CI thank you to circle CI for sponsoring those videos I had to kind of I really like doing sponsored content it's a good way to make what I do more possible so if you're interested in sponsoring you can get in touch with me okay thanks everybody and Tetris so here's the thing I I need an idea if I go to coding challenges snakes and ladders was 91 so that XOR was 92 I'm getting close to coding challenge 100 I need a really good idea for that and a Tetris is kind of on possibility there so if you have ideas for what would what's the perfect like coding challenge to synthesize everything that I ever done on this channel let me know ok goodbye everybody I will see you in hopefully on Friday and if for some reason Frey doesn't work out I won't feel guilty because in a bonus stream this week ok good
