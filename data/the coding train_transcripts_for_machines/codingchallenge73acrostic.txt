hello welcome to another coding challenge this is a coding challenge as part of my programming with text stuff and I'm going to attempt to do something that I actually didn't I knew about this before but I'd forgotten about it someone in the chat during one of my live streams mentioned it so I'm going to attempt in this video to program what's called an acrostic I went to ten I like tying that with the zoom thing but that didn't really work so what is an acrostic an acrostic is a poem or other form of writing in which the first letter or syllable interesting enough of each line spells out a word message or the alphabet so what I want to do and I'm gonna just come over the whiteboard to explain this is like if we have a certain word like mango I can't believe I didn't use rainbow or blueberry blueberry rainbow or unicorn but then I want to have a poem where the first sentence is like my beautiful flower always smells nice and oh that's fine it starts I have no ability to be creative and think with words it's just not with me but you will do something better and plus we're gonna ask the computer do this anyway so now I think there's a lot of interesting questions about this what I want to do is create a webpage that has a text input box so the user could type in a word and then get the acrostic coming down now across it can be a lot of things it can we to work with syllables the the actual like letter could appear in the middle of each sentence it could be highlighted there's so many stylish interesting things you can do but I'm gonna try to do something really simple I'm just gonna create a little poem as one word per line and each word starts at that Leonard no it's not it seems like it's not a lot but I think we're gonna get some good JavaScript HTML Dom manipulation stuff maybe I'll use the word Nick API to find words that start with a certain letter and then you after watching this video can improve on this and make a more creative version that does something more style listicle animates are actually has think about ways that you might use oh I could have done something like a Markov chain I this Markov chain videos to like generate the text that starts with a given letter some kind of white there's a word I'm not allowed to say anymore because it makes everything crash its rhymes with machine burning but I can't say it's the topic that shall not be named but you could use that to like some kind of it rhymes with maccer n't rural wet work anyway on to the coding so you could read more about across dicks here obviously on the Wikipedia page you can see a nice example here and I already have open the word Nick developer API cuz I thought while ago that I was going to use it so let's get started the first thing we need to do and I've got some code here there's nothing in this what I want to do is first at least add I'm gonna cross stick a header in the HTML page then I want to make a little paragraph and I want to make what do you call this thing input word let's do it I can't even remember I haven't coded in so long I don't even remember what the stuff is but hopefully this is gonna be right let's look at our web page now there we go so the idea here is that I type in a word like mango or a unicorn who would be cool actually if it's constantly generating the acrostic as you're typing so it's like actually generating with each letter each letter you delete but let's not do that on the fly let's have a submit button and let's add a button and say submit button so now we have the submit button the idea here is that I'm gonna say unicorn and I'm gonna hit submit and I'm gonna see my across the cure that's very hard for you to see this tiny tiny tiny tiny stuff but now you can see that it's bigger okay so we've got the web page and of course you as the viewer of this video can make it much more beautiful and interesting interactive web page that gets the word in a different way but this is where I'll start next what I need to do is oh you know I'd be interested we could use the kit well we're not gonna use canvas I'm using the p5.js library as I often do but I'm not gonna use canvas so I'm gonna say it's for any kind of like drawing or animation but you might want to I'm gonna say no canvas no cameras no it's like oh that's very not very nice I like say yes whenever possible I like to say yes if you can say yes say yes what is this crazy do you guys see what's going on here the like there's some kind of like goes to the machine like that's really weird what is going on okay so Adam was going crazy I am now trying for the first time ever visual studio code which is an open source code editor I think by from Microsoft anyway you can look that up on your own I'm gonna give that a try and save this file I'm gonna hit and things are still working so what do I need to do I first need to get access to when a user clicks the button and when they click the button what word they've typed in okay so what is that I'm gonna do something really crazy for the first time ever on my youtube channel net button equals select submit so there's a couple things now I made a video tutorial about this new keyword in JavaScript yes six version of JavaScript called let I'll summarize it for you instead of bar type let now I'll get I'm gonna make another video which I will put a link to in the description of this video when I make it to talk about what is let why might you use instead of bar but right now let is bar bars let far as let let his bar bars let let his bar okay but what I'm doing is I want to select that's a mid button now this is a hash our pound submit means I need that submit button to actually have an ID submit and I want the input to have an ID I'll call that word let me just call it a word input and I'm gonna call this submit button just to be overly verbose so now I'm gonna select submit button and I'm gonna say let input equals select there's so much autocomplete but if this text ed there's word input I might have to turn that off at some point but okay so now I have my two elements that are on the HTML page that I can start to get information from for example when I press the button on the mouse I want to make an acrostic so I'm gonna write a function make a cross make make acrostic so this here in case you're wondering when I this is p5.js sent a function in p5 stages it's yes when I press the mouse on the button call the function make acrostic here's the function make acrostic the first thing I just want to do is say let word equals word input dot value there we go so I am getting whatever somebody typed in and I'm going to console dot log word now I'm gonna hit refresh and here we go oh my sound effect board died that's fine rainbow submit Oh word input dot value is not a function hmm so what did I get wrong select word ah I called my variable input and the ID was word input so that's just supposed to be input there's a mistake that I made good for me type in rainbow again hit submit and there we go and now what they going to do to make development a little bit easier is I'm just going to in the HTML I'm going to say a value equals rainbow so that way when I load the page up it actually just fills in rainbow for me and I'm going to do something else when I load the page up I'm actually just going to call the function make acrostic so I don't even have to my arms are still sore that's a long story and probably videos about but that's why I don't have to press the button every time I load the page I could just hit refresh and it's running that acrostic functions so now we're set up but now comes the actual harder part what I need to do is look at the each letter one at a time and start a new line of a poem with that letter so how do I iterate over each character of a string that's not so not something I can definitely manage a VAR Oh call the emergency es6 train for nut I equals 0 I is less than word dot length I plus plus now I'm going to say mmm what should I do let's make a div for each one I don't know there's lots of different ways I could think about creating each line I'm gonna just do it as a div creative word car at O so word yeah car at I so now if I do this we can see there is your concern I can move this over here so I'm not standing in front of it there is the beginning as my acrostic rainbow if I type in mango mango mango so really all I've done so far is have a text input field of button and I could then look at each letter one at a time and put them on a separate line because each one is a separate div okay now I'm gonna have to be a little bit clever probably about how I organize these lines and all that sort of thing but now here's what I want to do instead of just putting the letter what I want to do is go and make write a line of poetry that starts with that letter and again instead of a line of poetry I'm just gonna have one word that starts with that letter so how do I get a word that starts with that letter well there's any number of ways I could do that I could try it out writes an algorithm to make up a word I could load a text file and sort all the words in that text file in some kind of associative array Dictionary JavaScript object thing that keeps track of every word by letter and I've done that videos and that actually would be a good you should try that I'm gonna use the word Nick API word Nick is a API application programming interface a thing that your application can interface with via programming that's one way to think about it that has a lot of information about words it's like a big dictionary with lots of information that words and I can if I go to developer or Netcom and I go to Docs I can start to look at what are some of the things that I can ask word Nick one of the things that I can ask word Nick is give me some words and one of the ways I can ask for some words is by searching and one of the ways I can search is by search any words that start with a certain letter so I'm going to ask for words start with the letter R I'm going to I could say like only now so things could be interesting there this is interesting corpus count corpus count is a part of the word Nick API where to keeps this big corpus of lots of I think articles and books and things I could say well how common is the word like za would have a really high corpus count but fractional would have a lower corpus can't think of anything so I kind of actually want to have rare words I think it'll be more interesting so I'm gonna say somewhere the corpus count between 1 and 25 dictionaries may be a little bit different I don't have to read the documentation and minimum length let's not get one letter words let's at least have a six letter word and no maximum length and I don't really need to get ten words I'll just take whatever is first and I'm gonna now click try it out and I can see here I've got for our reiterate I don't know why it gave me a first search result with the letter R now if I do it again it doesn't seem to be random actually so maybe I do actually want giving it to me in some order or maybe there so let me ask for 10 and now I can get a bunch so I think I'm going to ask for a bunch and pick one random we provable rattlin roadbook rootage red beat these are some great words and I can also by the way start to do all sorts of things like then ask word Nick for a sentence that uses that word and information about the etymology of that word probably but I'm gonna leave that again those are exercises that you could use to further expand on this so how do I actually get this well look this request URL and I have a whole set of video tutorials about working with api's and request your rels and how you do this and you can go back and review those I'll link to that in this video's description but all we need to know for this video is this request URL I'm gonna grab it I am going to copy it and I'm going to put it in my code I am going to say let URL equal this and I think it's wrapping the text so we're looking at this but the thing is I actually don't want it this is the thing that I want to change I want to make this same request but for different letters I'm gonna do something kind of silly let url one equal all the stuff in this URL up to here and then I'm going to say let URL to equal all the rest of it and by the way I need an API key so I really should go and sign up for an API key and I have one and I might pause this and at this video in a second to put what a working one in there but when I used word mix website it gave me a temporary API key just so I could like play around and learn how to use it so I'm gonna see if that still works so this is now the second part of the URL and so now when I make for each one of these what I need to do whoo oh boy there's gonna be some tricky stuff here always tricky stuff let's just let's take a break from this algorithm for a second and just at the beginning let's say load JSON so load JSON is a function that allows me to load some data from API call a URL and I'm going to load the first half of the URL plus the letter R plus the second half of the URL I'm just getting you are now because what I want to do is this needs to eventually become dynamic like I need to get different letters yes okay okay okay let's edit that out perhaps so then when I load the data from the API I need to write a callback function to tell me when that's ready so I'm gonna write this function I'm gonna say data got data okay so now I'm gonna say got data and what I'm going to do with is I'm gonna write a function I'm gonna call it got data I'm gonna get some data and I'm just gonna say console.log data so I just want to see now that this works with word mnek it's gonna go back to here and I'm gonna hit refresh oh I have an error sketch digest line what's wrong here oh there's like an extra are here for no reason okay look total results 2308 search results here all the words are I don't know why r is one I guess it always gives you that first reentry he read Litton great so I got that and I got 10 there are two thousand three hundred eight possibilities so I should probably maybe I shouldn't give it a limit if I take the limit out maybe I'll just get all of them and I can pick a random one there might be a better way to do this there's probably way for me to ask for a random one through the way I form the query but let's do this anyway so now I got it just so lonely gave me ten I wonder if 10 is the maximum but I'll come back to that later maybe somebody in the chat will will tell me how to do this later I'm just going to get 10 and pick a random one okay so we know that works how's the thing I need to do this I need to do this load the JSON for every letter is every letter it is VAR o gonna load bar let letter equal word dot card at I then I want to create a div with that letter and then I want to load the JSON instead if the hardcoded R value I want to load the JSON with the letter so let's see how this goes and let's be a little let's be simpler here let's go to index of HTML and let's have it just do it for Bo Bo W let's just use it to it for three letters so look at this I got results now here's the thing did I get them in the order bo w this one is o so i got o first then i got w and ice can only assume the last one is b so here's the thing this is really key when working with api's and making multiple API calls everything in java is asynchronous meaning you don't your the code is gonna execute at some point later whenever the api has happened of return and that could happen in any given order no matter what order your ask for things in so i could do something where i asked for them ask for b and only when i get the results back then asked for o and only when i get the results at back then asked for w that's one option another option which i think i might like better is to instead keep track of what i'm asking for when it comes back just check what it was and then use that so this I think is what I'm gonna do alright actually one thing I should add to this is say skip equals one because what we know I noticed you that and thank you to the chat for helping with this word Nick is always returning just the single letters the first result which I might actually want to use to know which one came back but whatever I'm gonna put skip equal one so that I don't get it right now okay so now here's the thing let's make sure this still works okay got three results bo w now what I need to do is I want to keep track of this particular div so if I make this div let div equals create div then what I want to do is when this comes back I want to feed in the got data function which is up here and I'm gonna move this down now I'm gonna move this and just put it here so I can see it more clearly I want got data to know about this particular div and somehow say like div HTML and then you know something so I have to something out of the data so first let's get the date got data function to pick a random word so if I look at the actual data it's in a property called search results and it is a that's an array and I need to pick a random one so I'm gonna say VAR options equals data dot search results let let this is really really hard habit to break then I'm gonna say var let word equals random options so something nice that p5 does for you is with the random function you can pass in an array and I'll just pick a random one out of it and then console.log word so now if I hit refresh here mmm interesting I didn't do that CRO okay word okay so it's picking that is not an array of words it's an array of object each object has three properties one of which is actually the work the property of words so I'm gonna call this a selection and then let and then I'm going to say console.log selection dot word so now when i refresh this I get three words let's get rid of this it's saying we don't need console dot log acrostic and it's confusing that it's console logging buh let's get rid of that so I'm getting wo B I should get three different words each time some really interesting weird words that I've never heard of before okay oblige mint wolf tap barrenly okay so now we've got our words but I want those words to know which did to go into so they go in the right order and then eventually I'm gonna want to highlight the character and I you may need spans who knows what I'm gonna need but let's let's try this okay but I really haven't coded for like two months this is crazy okay I think what I need is a closure so what I want to do is I'm gonna say pick word and I'm gonna say div and then I'm gonna pass it the URL so I'm gonna write a separate function called pick word and I'm gonna pass that function the div and the URL which sort of lets me pair those two things together and they can always live together so that when the URL gets back gives back data it can go with the div bear with me and I have a couple videos about closures and doing this I'll reference those in this video's description so now I could take this load I can basically rename I could write a new function called pick word and what does it need it needs a div and maybe that shouldn't be added should be like an element I might not need to be a div later and it needs a URL the great comment came from the chat which it probably makes more sense for this pick word function actually to include the letter to just receive the letter and have this work of the URL formation happen in the pic word function so I'm gonna change that and then I'm gonna say let URL equal this and then I'm gonna say load JSON from the URL got data this is what I had before however what's new now is that the callback is enclosed is in a closure is enclosed inside this outer function so that instead of console logging selection dot word I can say div dot HTML it's that specific div that came into the pic were done div dot HTML selection worked so now here we go Volney Oh obscene or whimsical this breckel loose pours whimsical miss and I can try doing rainbow oops oh wait a second aah Oh No Oh interesting ooh I love that what's kind of fun about that is it was sort of accidental let's take out now the thing that does it automatically so I don't want to like have it do it automatically and it's kind of interesting to do it with a longer word so let's go back to my hold on I lost my here we go let's go back to putting in rainbow here now I actually have to submit take a look here do you see how it filled it in slowly because all those are having asynchronously it put me those letters there immediately now if I didn't want it to do that I could actually just create those divs as empty so I could create an empty div with no content so then I might see them fill in but I wouldn't see them fill in I mean you know I could retrieve I there's so many ways I could animate this or do it differently so here's the thing this is my acrostic coding challenge finished we're gonna read this poem roadbook i gret is prob nick not ticked lu copied Iseman Obachan wire rod here's what I would like any of you who are watching or interested to try to do share with me at Schiffman on twitter in the comments next time I do a live stream I'll share some of your results this code will get posted look at the digit for the code but a couple things do this so that the first letter is highlighted how can you make the first letter bold or capitalized to highlight it in some way how could you make this more poetic so that you get a full sentence here and it reads more like a poem and another thing you might think of as what if the acrostic isn't so simple and I'm gonna just Google acrostic for a second because I know an example will come up if I do this images maybe where the the letters don't necessarily have to be the first letter so how would you create something and line it up like this and I could always come back into a part two to this coding challenge if people are really interested but I'm gonna leave yeah I think I better close this window before I get something I don't want to see but this is the basic idea I get user input a word I know in the users hit a button I look at each letter individually I go out to an API but I could have used other data sources look up my Markov chain stuff to generate a contextfree grammar maybe parts of speech tagging read attach as tutorials are lots of other my programming with text tutorials to think about ways you can make this more poetic visualize in a different way and that sort of thing I'm being told in the chat that maybe the max limit for the word Nik API is 125 oh and there's a bug when I hit submit multiple times it's not really a bug it just does it again so that's something you could fix you can have an erase worth there before or put a nice break in between them or something like that okay thank you very much this is gonna be irrelevant in the future when we're all just like brains floating in some sort of goo but this has been the first coding challenge I've done after a long time after I had a broken elbow accident and it's great to be back thank you for watching so I probably was a little off my game here if you're actually still watching this and thank you and I appreciate it see you on the next coding train
