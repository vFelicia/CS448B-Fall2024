hi so I've got one last video here in this kind of section which has been all about objects in JavaScript in p5js and arrays you know I've been adding objects when you click the mouse I've been changing objects when you click the mouse on top of them been checking to see if the objects are overlapping each other deleting objects from the array been doing all these things and something that has come up quite a bit uh in the last week or two that I've heard this question is okay well what if so this example this kind of like bubbles example that I'm using over and over again what if I what if you want to display each one of these as an image an image that you're loading from a file rather than just drawing a circle and even more so what if you want each one of these to be a different image and each time you make one it like picks from a selection of images so I have this basic example all it's doing is an empty array every time you click the mouse it pushes an object into it and updates and displays all the objects so the main thing that I need to do Somehow Here is first load an image so I'm going to do this in the first sort of like simple GL mobile way in a way a way that's not going to solve the problem but will'll get us started so one thing I'll note is that I do already have this is the directory of this sketch notice there are two JavaScript files I've moved the bubble Constructor function into a separate Javascript file if you missed the previous video about how to do that you can go back and watch that um and then I added a directory called images and I put three flowers in it cuz I like flowers uh flower zero flower 1 flower 2 and I very specifically name them with numbers for reason which I'll get to in a little bit but for right now let's just say this first pink flower I want all the images to look like that flower so uh you know this is I'm kind of glossing over a few details here but to load an image into P5 what you need is first a variable to refer to that image and then strangely enough I'm going to add another event here so this is a larger discussion about callbacks and the Order of things and the browser and how things work and I I want to have that convers in a few videos from now or really in the next video when I start talking about uh the P5 Dom library and how you can sort of start handling different kinds of events on the page but for right now a simple thing you can do is add this preload function which says in the preload function you want to load any media to make sure it's available for the sketch when it really starts in the setup function so the sketch starts in setup but now there's this like secret function that you can call before setup and this is really only for loading images loading sounds and later as you also see loading data files so if you're loading a spreadsheet or a big body of text that you're going to analyze and visualize you can also put those kind of things in preload so here I can say image equals load image and then in between quotes I need to put the path of the image the path relative to this particular project so again if I open up whoops the finder when you can see this is the project my images are in a directory called images not at all required but I'm doing that out of convenience is to not sort of like pollute the the root directory with a lot of additional files if I had 100 images would sort of be hard to look at so here I have a separate directory images and I can go back to the code and just write images SL flower z. jpeg so other thing I'm going to do I'm going to leave the background at zero so now I have that image variable and where am I displaying the bubbles in the display function so all I need to do is go into that display function and instead of drawing a circle draw that image so here I can say oops I left something in here by accident instead of drawing a circle I can comment that out and I can just say image image I should have called it flower or something this.x this.y so the image is drawn at the object's XY location instead of drawing a circle draw that image and the fill and stroke are no longer relevant I could tint the image and there's other ways to change the image but that's not really relevant to the discussion here so now if I run this you can see that every time I click I get a flower now there's two things to note here number one is I get this white border images are rectangles they are rectangles they are rectangles they have pixels and columns and rows they're a rectangle now if you if I had been better about this and made this flower image as a PNG file type with transparency then I could have those pixels around the edges of the flowers be transparent in this case I might kind of just use a kind of little bit bit of a trick here and say background 255 and you know now it kind of looks right now if I put two on top of each other you can see that that edge is still there I'll let you when you make your own flowers make better flowers than me but you can see this is kind important to think about as you're starting to work with images in your sketch the other thing I'll note here is notice where I click right here I'm going can't right here I'm going to click where's the image I clicked in the corner the image popped up in the corner so just like a rectangle has its reference point in the top left corner an image does also and in this case I would prefer the reference point to be the center I don't know why but I would just prefer that and so something you can do also with images just like you could do with rectangles is say image mode Center so image mode Center is a P5 function that now each time I click you can see an image comes up in the center so we've got this working through the use of a global variable so here in the main sketch I lo the image into that Global variable then I access the global variable in the object but this does not solve our problem the problem that we have is every time we click we want to see a different flower image how do we do that each bubble has its own image each bubble has its own image I'll say it one more time each bubble has if I say three times the code for it appears it doesn't do that but would be nice wouldn't it I should make a system that does that so but the reason why I'm saying each bubble has its own image the answer that you should be thinking is that means each bubble needs an image property it needs its own variable it needs its own variable to store an image so the bubble should store an image so I don't know what this should be equal to yet but this is the idea somehow the bubble gets its own image and the bubbles own this do image not the global variable image not one image for all bubbles but each bubble with its own image that's the big distinction here now of course the question is how do we fill that image so there's a bunch of different ways you could do this but I'm going to suggest a way that I think is rather nice for this particular scenario notice how the bubble gets its X and Y initialized by an AR a parameter that comes in function bubble XY that X is like a handoff variable it gets filled and it gets passed to this.x the Y gets filled gets passed to this. Y so what is what is the bubbles XY initialized in the code here Mouse X Mouse y so what I would like to do and I'm going to change this just to make things make a little more sense I'm going to call this flower so I have one flower image and what I do is when I make the bubble I want to send that flower image to the bubble make the bubble at Mouse X Mouse y with this flower image make the bubble at this mouse X Mouse y with the flower image so this is calling the Constructor Mouse X Mouse Y and flower go into bubble. JS right here x y and what now I need a third parameter image which fills the bubbles this. image now this is a little bit confusing like it's kind of like oh I don't know if I should be doing it this way I it's so convenient though like this is called XY image and this is called XY image there's a big huge difference though between thisx and plain old X plain old X is just a parameter for the Constructor function to receive a value and pass it to this.x this.x it's the real deal it's the variable for that object's Exposition so you could call these like temporary X or temporary y or handoff X or handoff Y but it's convenient actually just to call them XY image and they get they get filled and then they pass the that value into this.x this. y this that image this is really going to give you a headache and I apologize for this if I could make all of this just make instant sense I I absolutely would so maybe you have a better an idea for how to think about this but this is one of the more confusing things but if we take that now I think if you look at it this way we get three arguments Mouse X Mouse y flower image and those come into the object so now here we go I've got the same sketch but I have a much more flexible object I can initialize that bubble with different flower images and how might I initialize that bubble with different flower images how about I have an array so let's go oops let's go back back to here I never and the nice thing is I don't have to touch this code again the bubble is now a generic bubble that can display any image you pass to it so now I just need a way of passing different images to it right there not just this one Global flower but different ones so what I'm going to say is flowers equals brackets and I'm going to say flowers index0 is flowers Z flowers index one is flower one I need to change that and flowers index 2 is flowers two look at this one two so now you can see I'm loading three images into an array load flower zero into the zero zero spot one into the one spot two into the two spot now down here what could I do I could say flowers zero let's just be crazy and say flowers one and I run this and you can see look at that I'm getting the red flowers if I say flowers two oops I'm getting the yellow flowers and if I say flowers zero I'm getting the pink flowers flowers flowers everywhere flowers so all I need to do is vary that value instead of me hardcoding in zero or one or two every time I don't know I could pick a random value I could or I could cycle through them let's cycle through them I like that idea ah let's pick the random one so if I say VAR R equals random what's the range of random values I want the array has three elements in it indices 0 through two so I want a random value between between 0 and three better yet I want a random value between zero and the length of the array now I don't know that I've mentioned this in a previous video but random will give you a decimal value so I'm getting 0.457 or 2.3 61 I want to get rid of that decimal value and there's a function in P5 which is comes from JavaScript called floor this is a little bit of a digression but I think it's worth mentioning if I have the number three 3967 I could floor that number and it's going to give me the value three I could ceiling that number and it's going to give me the value four so floor always takes off the decimal point and goes down to three ceiling takes off the decimal point and goes up to the next number and there's also round which whether it's above 3.5 or below 3.5 it'll go to either three or four so these are kind of important little mathematical helper functions in this case I want the floor function CU I want this to be a random value in the array I don't want I only want to get 0o one or two so if I put the floor function in there and now I put R here oh I think I just finished this uh except for one step I can run this and every time I click I will get a different flower randomly right there's only three flowers in the array but a random one is passed into every object I have as many objects as I want and they'll all refer to one of those uh images in the AR array now there's one last piece of this that I could improve which is if you look at the way I did this preload is it's very hardcoded Right Flowers index zero flowers index one flowers index 2 it would be much nicer if I could say for VAR I equals 0 I is less than 3 I ++ flowers index I equals load image something now what's the something what's the something that I put there so so I know I have i counting 012 so somehow I need this text to be dynamic images flower zero images flower 1 images are to it's dynamic as the index in the array also want the text to be dynamic and there's a trick that you can use to do this so uh you probably are familiar with this statement 2 + 2 equals say it with me I know you're just watching somewhere by yourself maybe at the gym on a treadmill it's weird to just say the number four but say the number four I don't you probably not have the JY on a treadmill but somebody once said to me I watch your videos at the gy so that's why I said that uh okay so uh 2 + 2 equal 4 right we're all comfortable with that but if I have the text like cow plus Bell this equals cow bell so the plus with text with characters between quotes means concatenation or join so plus with numbers is addition plus with text is join so we can use that fact here with a trick I can say what do I want to make I want to say images slfl whoops come back to me plus I right I want to always start images flower and then I either want a zero one or two and I is a zero one or two and then what do I want after that plus uh jpeg so you can see this is the full string that I want flower a number and jpeg FL power plus a number plus. jpeg not add those things together join those things together so if I do that I don't need this anymore I can get rid of these three lines of code and here we go I can now click and add random flowers with different images now of course up here like this depends on that you name the files this way this only works because I name the files flower zero flower 1 flower two the nice thing is here is I if I had a th000 flower images I could put those all in the directory it would take a while to load 1 th images but it would work so this is something I think you can really play with in terms of how you can load a whole bunch of images pick them either in sequence or randomly I try the in sequence thing might be interesting and put them and use those objects to display an image so hopefully this was helpful to you one thing I would like to say at just the end of this video is I need to do a much better job of linking to like download the code that I'm doing in these examples if I reference a previous video I should have a link to that previous video in the description if you could help me with that I would be super appreciative of of it uh so um so you can actually just put in the comments like so first of all if you're typing the code along and you have it you can email it to me um but you just like say like the code for this is missing where can I find it or you know what you reference this video here's a link to that video If you give me those things I will just like remember to add them uh to videos so uh if you have a chance to help with that I would certainly appreciate it and the next set of videos I'm going to make is about how to add things to a P5 sketch that aren't just the canvas how can you add other types of elements that might appear on a web page a header a button a paragraph of text how do you manipulate those things with code so I'm super excited about that topic because it's kind of a new thing for me and I think it'll really expand the possibilities of what you can do with JavaScript and the browser np5 and all this stuff so I will hopefully get to making those videos soon and see you in this way that I see you I feel that I see you you are there to me uh sometime okay goodbye uh I have to stop I'm still here by the way I could just stay here right this video could just go on and on just stay here and but I'm not I'm going to stop okay goodbye
