hello good afternoon good morning good evening uh this is the coding train with me Daniel oh I said Daniel sometimes I say Dan sometimes I say Daniel every once in a while somebody calls me Danny which I always kind of enjoy although that's never really been my name um it's a Thursday afternoon it is May it's May right uh May 25th it's around 420 p.m. eastern time I am live from New York City on the coding train and um this is a semiweekly sometimes whenever I have some time uh show thing stream internet television education space type thing where I uh do some coding tutorials and coding challenges and answer questions and a variety of other things that I end up feeling like doing while broadcasting Live on YouTube so welcome thank you for tuning in uh I am playing some lovely music by the great Adam Blau in the background I think I will fade it out now um as you know I enjoy having uh music sometimes in the background so if you have any suggestions or things that you're working on that you want to send my way uh please do okay so what's going to happen today um looks like um everybody is here and I'm not seeing any complaints about sound or visuals um so I am going to return today to my machine learning I don't I'm I'm trying to avoid using the word syllabus I feel like syllabus and YouTube do not go together let me try a different word I'm going to return to my machine learning list silly bus would actually work quite well s i l l ybos my machine learning Silly Bus um and uh let's let me figure out where I left off uh this course lended many weeks ago but I'm still trying to make video materials for it uh and I'm I think I'm here in uh week three so um the topic that I have for today is linear regression uh so um for those of you who are watching this late at night perhaps you're curled up with some candle light and some herbal tea and you have a nice book beside you and you're playing some soothing classical music music this will also put you to sleep almost definitely um but um what I want to do today is look at everything that I'm doing is leading up to uh building a neural network program from scratch in JavaScript and in processing which is Java one of these environments and so a I have some steps along the way that I want to do so um previously I looked at just kind of a overview of what machine learning is we looked at uh K near neighbor algorithm and how to do a similarity score between two data points and today I want to look at this idea of I have a data set and I want to fit a model what does it mean to fit a model to the data set for us for today that model is going to be a straight line and we're going to be able to calculate that model calculate where we should draw that straight line with maths um yes I'm an American who likes to say maths I don't know if that makes me pretentious or the opposite of pretentious but that's just who I am um so uh emra in the chat asks why JavaScript for a neural network uh I don't have a good reason for that in fact it's a terrible idea to program a neural network in JavaScript but I'm going to do that anyway because I like to run Demos in the browser and kind of get my hands in the code and JavaScript is a language that I am kind of working with I will however I do intend to do some tutorials as we dig down further if I keep going on my silly bus um that eventually I'm going to start once uh I'm going to start looking at uh something called tensorflow and something called Caris and those will require us to spin up some python code that I will then talk to from JavaScript and actually I guess my reason is one of the things that I'm trying to do is always have a visual uh animated or interactive component to what it is that I'm building um and and that's just sort of arbitrary constraint that I give myself in the hopes that people will take that and make all sorts of more creative and beautiful and interesting things from it okay um okay sing the audio by the way I I get this me I get this a lot my audio is out of sync so for whatever reason I think when the audio is out of sync it's not me it's you or it is me can I I'm trying to thow I can't throw I'm trying to throw my voice in a way that I could maybe make the Audio I can't do it audio out of think um and I hear that if you refresh the page sometimes that fixes it the good news is I am recording everything I'm doing to disk and um everything that I do today will be published separately as individual video tutorial chunks okay so uh the coding train is brought to you by wait a sec do I have it's not brought to you by anything brought to you by me but it is here with the support of the patrons so I would like to start by saying a thank you to the patrons of the coding train if you would like to join the patron program you can go to patreon com/ coding Trin and uh you can uh with a uh you can pledge and uh um with a pledge comes membership to a slack Channel and other rewards they'll send you a book or making tshirts and things like that you can also support the coding Train by going to storeen coding train. uh storenvy.com if you would like to buy some coding train merchandise okay uh got those things out of the way now um typically even though there's no typically because I'm kind of all over the place I like to do these live streams on Fridays I like to have an opening segments where I share work from the community or answer some questions that were posted on Reddit I'm not prepared for any of that stuff today so I think I'm just going to launch right into the material and start talking it through and making examples uh so um but if I I'm hoping that perhaps I will be back tomorrow on Friday at some point for a kind of regular coding Train episode where maybe I'll be able to do some sharing of work from the community and answering some questions um okay so I got okay uh Rick Van de Brock in the chat asks why won't you make more native JavaScript tutorials without p5js I have been getting this question a lot I'm trying to think I must I need something to help me think can I have some meditation music This is actually my new debugging music I'm debugging I'm I'm trying to to breathe deeply to think about why is it that I don't make vanilla JavaScript tutorials without p5js um I don't have a good answer to that question um I think there's a lot of value in uh writing code from without libraries and dependencies I think there's a lot of value in writing code with libraries and dependencies um and I am not not opposed uh to doing um tutorials in JavaScript without p5js and I I do periodically do stuff with node uh server side programming uh in JavaScript I'm using just plain old node and some node packages as well I suppose the you know the answer I have to that question is that p5js as part of the processing Foundation is a project that I'm just personally invested in uh it's a project it's a open source it's a piece of Open Source software that I care about that think hope is bringing good things to the world and I would like to support it and explore it and teach with it um it also I find it nice to be able to skip past some of the gobble deg that is uh dat of JavaScript and be able to in a more succinct way draw and animate and p5js I believe is a good platform for that but I do it that you know um there are areas where p5js does not have certain functionality and um I am not opposed to at some point trying looking at doing tutorials with Native JavaScript a better question a better question might be why aren't you programming using es6 syntax and then maybe you're thinking to yourself what is es6 syntax and I think I've talked about this before this is something that I need to come to grips with I'm looking something ominous why don't I program with es6 I think I need to I think it's time I think it's what people are using I think it's like already like 3 years old there's some parts of it that make me somewhat uncomfortable um like uh the fact that there's like an equal sign and greater than and that means function and there's some kind of like stuff um but I do think in particular that the class Syntax for doing objectoriented programming matches um classical objectoriented programming envir uh languages it's more a makes more sense it's a little less awkward I would like to start doing that and I am thinking about uh this fall starting over and doing all of my beginner learn to program from scratch in JavaScript tutorials uh using es6 syntax uh with possibly with P5 Jets this might be a this might be a great idea it might be a terrible idea I look forward to hearing your feedback uh but today I will be still using my old es5 syntax don't throw if only you could throw internet Tomatoes at me that would maybe I can build up some sort of like node.js socket connected catapult system by which you could be watching the live stream and pressing a button and tomatoes could be flung at me or candy popcorn no popcorn's not good I don't know flowers something or tomatoes whatever okay what's happening now I'm looking at the chat okay uh let's see here um I see some tomato emojis in the chat wonderful okay uh oh if you didn't see today um I released uh a compilation video of um I'm just going to oh look at this I'm live uh I encourage you to check out this uh video from itp's uh 2017 spring show I did a live stream where I interviewed students showed their projects ITP is the graduate program here at New York University where I teach fulltime and uh if you want to check out what students are doing here uh check out this video here I'm I'm like promoting my own videos in my video which is a little bit of a problem uh I did a most recently a mind sweeper coding challenge that was quite a bit of fun uh if you I've made a variation of Mind sweeper uh you should go to uh because maybe I can show some of these tomorrow uh or next week depending on when I come back next if you go to Rainbow code uh under coding challenges and then if I scroll down here all the way to the bottom uh to mind sweeper there is a read me here oh look there's already some so let's look at um this is oh I can't see this is just repository so I don't have demo uh and this is just ported to tight scripts look let's look at this one uh right here oh canvas uh let's look at this and we have look at this o I love it so some some color some new interface stuff ability to change the width and height a timer new game button and by the way one thing I really missed in my mind sweeper coding challenge which I'm so sad about was that the way that mind sweeper works is it's designed in such a way that you can never by accident click on a bomb as your first click and I I made this B sweeper click on a b to get stung um you can and the way that that's done is you click on a cell and then all the bees are placed and the part where you click is not included as a possibility so I should have done that um there okay so I think now we are ready to start getting into linear regression or linear regression yeah um all right so what do I want to do here let's put on Symphony 40 and let's get set up here so I need to so okay so let's think about this okay um mind sweeper will work let's put this oh no session three that's where we are I'm in session three uh and I'm going to grab this similarity score and we're going to say uh L regression and get R movies. Json we're going to open up the adom text editor uh Tom in the chat makes an excellent point which is this whole class thing in es6 is just syntactic this is very hard to say syntactic Sugar by the way that would be a good name for a song syntactic Sugar um there's a wonderful discussion going on okay I got to not look at the discussion it's sometimes very distracting okay so now what I need to do is open this up in the atom editor know why this always runs oh okay see what happens here okay all right so now I have some code running I need to run a server uh and I'm going to go to the desktop session three and I'm going to run a little web server so I can see my code in the browser um and come here and open up a console okay by the way I haven't programmed this before I did read an article an online article about linear aggression and look up the formul but that's you know I don't really know what I'm doing here so just be aware you're tuning into someone who's giving you a tutorial about stuff that he just looked at earlier this afternoon this is how I this is how I do it okay uh so I think we're ready this is definitely going to require some serious whiteboard time it's whiteboard time that work no here we go um okay so I'm just testing this out over here you can still see and hear me I am talking to you the people of the internet welcome and so now let me think about this on the one hand so what I'm going to do is use a statistical approach to calculate a linear aggression for a twodimensional data set um and the reason I'm doing this is to just look at the idea of how you you know what is machine learning it's sort of matching inputs to outputs um and then making a prediction based on an existing data so I'm really sort of setting the context and if we look at linear regression which is just in this sort of simple 2D space it'll give us give us a sort of framework for discussing systems with models with many many many many many many parameters and ultimately even though we can do linear regression with a statistical approach we could also do it with something called gradient descent so here are the videos what is linear linear regression and ordinary least squares and what is the math for it then make a simple code example that does that making a list here should I make this list um what is linear regression uh one is linear aggression uh and then we're also going to talk about ordinary least squares method then I also want to talk about model checking and other methods then we want to look at um Bo is this off the camera can can the camera see that it cannot wait I have a way of fixing this the camera can turn it's amazing um then I want to look at uh polynomial regression and for this I think I'm going to use a JS library and then we're going to get into a gradient descent so I question whether any of this is really uh necessary or worthwhile because in many ways I don't know I mean it's all interesting and learning is good and uh um but um you know it is important to say hydrated we do know that so the question is because ultimately I could just jump right into looking at a perceptron and I could use gadient descent with a perceptron but I think this will give us some language and some background and some Theory to help us have more of a foundation for when we get into some of the neural networkbased machine learning stuff do you agree I think that's the case so this is my list uh it is 440 p.m. um and I expect I would like to get through I would like to get through all of this by the end of tomorrow so this week being today and tomorrow I don't know exactly when is I'm to fit in time to come back to to stream live tomorrow but I'm hoping to and so I will get through some amount of this today hopefully at least the sort of first two possibly the first three uh any questions I just like to said so any questions or suggestions or thoughts before um before I get started uh okay yeah I'm just I'm just reading through the chat right now uh all right I'm just seeing um great okay so I didn't see any questions that I'm going to tackle at this very moment so um I expect that that this so if you haven't watched my live streams before what happens is I kind of fumble my way through a lot of stuff and um then uh later it gets edited down to a shorter tutorial video I expect that this these are going to involve quite a bit of editing because I think I'm going to have to like look stuff up and find things maybe a diagram an image kind of as I go and I'm happy to take uh from the chat the writing on the board is a little smaller than usual I thought I noticed that as well well um sorry let me check on that in a second so I might have to um so if you have suggestions or thoughts um uh please post them in the chat if you're a patron and are in the slack Channel um that's a little bit easier for me to follow so in particular if there a good point or question or thought from the YouTube chat if one of you who's in both could copy that into the slack chat that would be great okay uh let me look at the the is the writing smaller is my handwriting just smaller or is it actually smaller I wonder if I zoomed how how is this can you read that a bit too small I'm seeing from some folks it's pretty small it's a little small lots of opinions on the size of the writing now I I have a feeling that I I realized I haven't been in here since uh I think one of these is like a zoom look at that uh that is to I feel like that seems too zoomed in so let me zoom out a little more maybe that's a little bit better that just where it was at the beginning uh problem is you guys are 20 seconds behind me perfect out of is it out of focus that's just like the beginning write bigger oh what a novel idea I'm gonna just zoom in a little bit I'm going to try to get a little bit more there we go that's makes it a little bit bigger the question is the focus how's the focus okay perfect great uh all right everybody so here we go focus is fine rewrite it a bit big I don't that list isn't that important it's just sort of uh background for me when I draw and do diagrams and stuff I will definitely make it bigger okay here we go I don't know what I'm going to do by the way does any I so at some point um if anybody has a really good suggestion for a uh for a data set that I might use I think what I'm going to actually do is just make random points and do a regression of random points or I'm going to let the user click um and sort of add points and then fit the line to whatever if none of this makes any sense to you hopefully my explanation will make it make sense to you um but if anybody has an idea for a really you know the typical things that people do are like uh doing a linear regression for uh height value predicting a weight value based on height or predicting you know a height based on hand size or price of a house based on number of bedrooms you know something like that that is a very simple 2D relationship okay this is the invisible laptop you can see where it is if I stand behind it okay something on kaggle yeah exchange yeah but you know mostly um mostly what I'm uh what I would like is to do a very generic tutorial and have people find their own data and then and work with it so maybe that's what's better anyway okay here we go um let's get started uh okay hello welcome to another video in my series on machine learning I I don't know why I said that that way but sounds very Hest anyway um I'm going to talk about something called linear regression in this video uh and so in this video I'm really just going to talk about what linear regression is and why it's something related to the topic of machine learning now if you've been watching these videos in sequence you might have just watched some videos you might remember me from such other videos as nearest neighbor similarity score um and so uh the idea being that we're looking to create create a machine Learning System right there's some kind of quote unquote machine learning recipe and we have some type of input data that goes into the machine learning recipe and out the other side comes some sort of output so this can be any number of things you know the classic scenario example is you know inputs are uh Square can I just start this video it's been a while it's been a while since I've been here and I um I don't know I feel like off my game a little bit and I think that I'm recapping too much because it's been so long since I recorded these videos but if somebody were actually coming to this to experience it like a course they would would have really they they could have just watched this in sequence maybe a day or two ago or even a week ago as opposed to like three weeks ago so I'm gal um I'm going to I'm getting some great suggestions for data sets in the chat temperature versus Ice Cream sales I like that galton's original height data is a classic and is that uh K weekman who posted that in the um slack channel is that where the term is that the same I think it's galon French um where the term regression actually came from and anyway uh so just give me one Mulligan for today and I'm going to start over now it's very warm in here got to get this air situation worked out okay here we go Okay Hand ey coordination brain coordination not so good hand ey coordination is still still seems to work for me hello welcome to another video in my machine learning or artificial intelligence or something like that series I'm trying to figure all this stuff out okay so in this video I'm going to introduce the idea of linear regression what is linear regression and why is it something that's kind of relevant in terms of this sequence so the um this we're kind of on this train oh look train metaphor we're on this train along the tracks Trucking along getting towards this idea of looking at neural networkbased uh machine learning systems and so one of the things we need to do is start building up our vocabulary and our sort of sense of how pieces of how machine learning works I please bang my head against the wall for just a minute okay so uh how does machine learning system work the idea here is that we have some kind of machine learning recipe we have some kind of inputs and those inputs it's like a spreadsheet goes into the machine learning recipe it does some stuff to it and it comes out with some sort of output output and input so this is the idea we looked at uh nearest neighbor um classification and regression we talked I talked a bit about what classification is what regression is here is a time where I want to look at a particular recipe a machine learning recipe called linear regression linear regression is a useful technique when there is a linear relationship between the input data and the output data what is a linear relationship okay the idea here is that if we take some data set and we graph it this known as kind of like a SC known as a scatter plot we graph it this is the x axis this being the Y AIS so maybe we look at something as was just suggested to me in the live chat that's going on right now that the x axis represents temperature the Y AIS represents ice cream sales now I would like to also include sorbet in here I don't know why I put sorbet in quotes but you know the dairy it doesn't agree with me so much so but that's in as side that's not relevant or maybe oh my goodness I'm not even in the frame help me I am off screen the uneven sleeves are bothering people yeah that's really a problem see I nobody can see the board all right all right see okay hold on let me let me try this one more time okay all right uh all right all right you you guys are all very kind to watch you know I used to not do these live and when I didn't do them live I never actually got anything done because I just stopped and started over and over and over again you can see why I do that because I my sort of neurotic leads me to do that I'm going to have to make the same sorbet joke I'm just letting you know that was not planned that was spontaneous but now it won't be spontaneous anymore but I think it was a good one as a keeper I mean I could maybe I'm doing it the second time it's very hard with no actual live audience to feed off of I got to zoom out so I have a little more space I'm saving MAA from editing by um by uh just starting over okay so uh all right so this is going to be my last attempt I'm not allowed to start over again I'm doing it this time it's getting it is only getting hotter in here maybe I need to take off the hoodie but I thought I you know I did get the um some people had complained when these weren't even and I can totally understand that if they're not even now the sleeves also need to make sure they're both rolled up I think subscribers over time I think that's going down uh okay okay here we go everybody I need some welcome oh this is good I going to leave this in the background okay hello welcome to another video in my uh machine learning series and in this video I am going to talk about something called linear regression so I'm just actually going to move straight over to the Whiteboard going to just move along here um so why are we talking about linear regression so uh what what I'm leading towards and what I'm going to get to if you keep watching these videos they don't exist yet but I'm going to keep making them So eventually you might keep watching them is I'm going to get to neural networks and um neural networks are are useful and Powerful in the case of large data sets with many many variables many many inputs parameters that we almost can't figure out mathematically how to make sense of it maybe a neural network can do that in some almost magical way we're going to get into all the details of that but there are machine learning scenario where we can actually just calculate precisely using a statistical method the relationship between inputs and outputs right so if we were to review we have this idea of a machine learning recipe previously I looked at K nearest neighbor as a possible algorithm to make sense of input data and predict some sort of output whether it's classifying or predicting a price that type of thing so we have some sort of input we get some sort of out outut so let's take a very simple scenario pause this pause edit Point by the way this is going so much better so far but this marker kind of is terrible so let's try to find a better marker just gonna see here uh should have gotten some new ones that that and how's this one I'm just drawing over here oh you can actually see these let's try this one this is like a sort of fresh one so let's let's see I made it by the way really really small now uh uh mark on the board where I go out of frame if you past it that's a good um so let me I'm in the frame I'm in the frame so I shouldn't uh this is out of the frame so if I'm standing here I can actually see myself on a monitor there okay so let's take the simplest scenario of inputs related to outputs and um a simple scenario for this would be something like a twod dimensional data set okay so we could graph using something called a scatter plot a data set and we're going to make the data set bear with me here uh a temperature the x axis I want to think of as temperature so maybe uh I'm really sorry I'm going to do this in Fahrenheit I really just have to apologize for that I I'll happily say maths though anytime you want um zero degrees to uh 100° I guess it could be negative so in Fahrenheit and then the Y AIS will be ice cream sales and uh this was suggested uh in the chat um but I'm I'm going to add to this uh sorbet in quotes for no reason oh I'm really I'm oh I'm out the frame I'm out of the frame I'm back okay uh but you can see this right yes s i just not if I put my head in front of it okay so uh yeah just because you know Dairy doesn't really agree with me just in case you were wondering okay so I like survey okay so uh we could say like oh when it's uh you know 24° there only three ice creams are sold per day and then on another day it was uh 90° and there were 18 and you know another day that was 90° there were this many and then you know you could imagine if you were the owner the purveyor of an ice cream shopy that you could keep track of your sales as it relates to temperature and then what you could do is that you have all this data now somebody comes into your place of business and says okay tomorrow the weather's going to be 50 degrees what could you like could you make a guess as to how many ice creams you're going to sell and so we could look and say Here's you know 50° well there was some other day where I sold this much when was 50 some other day some other day how could we make a prediction well this is a scenario where it appears there is a linear relationship a linear relationship between temperature and sales the higher the temperature the more the sales the lower the temperature the less the fewer the fewer the Sals so the idea of a linear regression is to figure out how can we fit a line best fit a line to this data and I could look at this and hold on I'm going to be back in a second for some magic uh uh Sor I'm looking at Kelvin uh okay I'm back this is the by the way this is like a historic moment not really because that's be ridiculous this is the first time I'm ever using a marker with a different color on my YouTube channel maybe suddenly I'll just get so many subscribers because they'll be like I heard there's this Channel with tutorials and a whiteboard where they use multiple colors okay so um we could make a guess and I could say like look that looks like a line that kind of fits the data that's me just as a human being kind of eyeballing it so now if I wanted to say you know when the temperature is 95° I could just look at 95° find this and find the corresponding you know uh you know 200 ice creams or whatever sold so this is the idea of linear regression looking at a data set and fitting a line to that data set now how do you do this there are many different methods and we're I'm going to look at multiple methods in different videos in this video I would like to discuss the method called Ordinary least squares I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna write this down ordinary oh boy I got a little dizzy everything's going to be okay least squares what does that mean okay so if we look at this line we can compare uh every single this is the line that we've fit to the data you know by as a human being eyeballing it one thing that I can do is I can say look how different is each one of these data points from the line and I could see like I could essentially like look at its distance from the line and the idea of ordinary least squares is the least squares method is we want to find the line that minimizes all of these distances so what if we okay so if we could think of all of these as data points like uh you know x0 X1 X2 X3 x uh X4 right we could think of all of these distances as like d0 D1 D2 D3 D4 so if we took all of these distances and squared them D 0^ 2ar plus D1 2 plus D2 2 etc etc etc and added them all up together that's the sum of all the squares of all the differences we want to minimize this value so how do we calculate the for the how do we find a line that minimizes all those so you might be asking well why are you first of all why are you squaring the values well this is a common technique you know you'll notice that some points are below the line and some points are above the line so the difference could be positive or negative squaring it gets rid of that difference um okay so how do we do this um like I said there are a variety of methods and what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you a formula for this which I have written down it's another historic moment I prepared for today's video this was by preparation I wrote down the formula I could pretend that I memorized it by editing this out if this is still in this video then I did not pretend um okay so let's look at um so first of all what how do we represent mathematically this pinkish reddish line so the formula for a line is typically written as yal MX plus b i will point out however that if you look in uh statistics textbook you might see something like y = b 0 + B1 * X this is the same exact formula M refers to our B1 here as the slope and B 0 or B here is the quote unquote Y intercept which is the value where the line intersects the Y AIS so the slope this m value determines like which way does the line point and then the Y intercept is how high or low uh it you know where is that line relative to the X AIS so all we need to do is we need to both calculate m and b so here's the thing this is a you while we're looking at this you know most data sets that you might work with aren't just simple 2D data sets there might be you know there's temperature there's you know population of the city that the store is in maybe you know there's the hours that it's open I I don't know you could think of like all sorts of other data in puts that might relate to the sale of ice cream and this can actually be generalized much of you know this this could be y = b 0 + B1 * X1 + B2 * X2 so there could actually be multiple linear this is referred to as multiple linear regression and generally you know the the same math that I'm going to show to you applies to this scenario but it typically involves U Matrix based calculations maybe I'll do that in a different video but we're it's simpler to look at in just this context with just one input but we can extrapolate that uh and you could think about it is instead of you know in If instead of a line you know fitting this to a plane right if you had this as you know if there was just simply one other two two data two uh input pieces of data okay how we doing so far you still here okay so now let's look at this form look you can see I wrote it down on this piece of paper maybe I can auction this off on eBay or nobody will want this okay going to need that piece of paper okay so here's how we calculate M the slope we calculate it as the sum so I'm going to use this Greek letter Sigma looks like an e but it's not an e it's a sigma which means sum of x Min x with a line over it and I'll talk about what that means time y y with a line over it you could call that uh Y Bar I suppose divided by the sum of x minus x with a bar squared Okay so let's think about what this means so first of all xar or Y Bar this means the mean or the average so what this really is is it's all of the X values added up together divided by how many there are so you could think of xar as being the sum and sigma by the way means sum so I'm going to kind of unpack that a little bit but the sum of of every single X so X index I so X 0 X1 X2 where I goes from 0 to n n being the total so this is kind of mathematical notation to say add up all the X you can think of it as an array right an array of data points add them all up and then divide it by the total number there is divided by n so this is really what xar is it's just the average of all the X's Y Bar is the average of all the Y's so this means get that average and then take each x minus the average times each y minus the average and so this really is also these this Sigma should really also have I goes from zero to n and this is X index I this is y index I we have this from 0er to n this is X index I um as well so you can I'm not going to derive or prove this formula in this video maybe I can provide a resource to a page or a tutorial that does that in this video's description but you can almost kind of intuitively kind of understand why is this the slope of the line because what we're looking at is the sum of all the differences between the average X and the C current H multiplied by the average the differences between all the Y's and the average y's um so you um if we add all that stuff up together divided by the all of those X differences squared you can kind of intuitively understand how why that's going to be you know if all those values are equal we're just going to get the value one right so you you um I have to pause for a second because I lost my train of thought I'm going to uh um I'm just looking at the chat to see if I missed anything ah okay um I'm I'm looking at the chat to see uh to see what people are writing because hold on why is this opening here because I want to see what I'm I'm I'm missing here uh ice cream sales I should use all the colors of the rainbow are ordinary leas squares related to the leas squares regression this is from Alex plotting from linear algebra uh it's basically the same the ordinary distinguishes it from weighted least squares yes um okay how am I doing so far uh all right so I didn't make any horrific mistakes just yet I I got off a little on a little bit of a Tang there for a second because I was trying to like I was trying to explain why uh I was trying to explain this as like a having an intuitive understanding of why this formula works and I it didn't my explanation I think didn't really hold up so maybe I want to like go back and try to say that again but I want to think it through and maybe if anybody in slack has a good thought for me um so again let's think about let me let me talk this through for a second then maybe I'll explain it again think about if we had the scenario where X was equal to Y so the slope would be one right if x is equal to Y The Intercept could be Zero The Intercept is not relevant right now so if the if x is equal to Y the slope could be one because I'm looking in the chat to see for somebody to save me um if we had all the numbers we took the oh took the average that makes sense right because the average would be let's create a scenario where we have have just these points so the average X would be right here and the average y would also be right here ah right this makes sense because if X and Y are kind of have a equal relationship this times this okay this times this would be the equivalent of this squared that makes sense okay so maybe I can come back to talk about and if x if Y is growing faster as X it would point up this way if it's not growing up a point this way because if Y is so that this this is kind of solidifying in my head uh okay the numerator is basically the correlation thank you K weekman that is a much nicer way of putting it okay the slope basically defined um harsh gup the slope basally defines how much y changes with respect to x uh okay great thanks there's all these wonderful um uh comments in the chat I really appreciate it you guys know way more about this stuff than I do I should really stick with my like generative fractal tree rainbow colored stuff right don't you think I'm trying my best here uh okay so let me come back here and say so I'm not gonna derive or or prove this formula in this video although if I could find some supplemental information I'll link to it in this video's description or maybe in the comments you can offer a suggestion but you can kind of get a uh uh an intuitive kind of sense of why this formula works so first of all imagine if x equals y if the formula for the line were just yal X that would mean the slope would be one right the slope would be one if Y equals X well look at this if Y equals X then x xar * x xar would be like that squared so you could see how M would equal 1 if y equal x and then you could sort of say the numerator is essentially the correlation thank you to K week in the chat for typing it out like that because I think that's a good way of thinking about it you can see that you know if y grow you know is is y growing more uh as X grows or is X uh is y growing less as X grows you can sort of see how this relationship is going to uh between the numerator and the denom denominator is going to uh give you a fraction that describes the slope of this line so think about that hopefully it has some intuitive sense and I'm sure people in the comments will write some nice explanations that that help with that understanding so this is really it so what I want to do now in the ne I'm going to do this in the next video is I want to program this so I think what I'll do is I'll program it in such a way where a user can click and add data points and each time the user clicks I will I will implement this formula and draw the line of best fit um according to the ordinary least squares method um in canvas in the browser and after we do that I will talk about well what are some reasons why linear regression does it might not make sense for your data um but this is the idea this is just to just to kind of recap for a second the reason we're doing this is this is a model right the idea of a model the idea of a model is you try to fit it to the data we have known data training data temperature with actual Sals we want to fit our model our model just has two parameters the slope of the line and the Y intercept and once we solved for those parameters we can make new predictions and even though it's kind of overly simplistic here this is the exact same process that we will that I'll employ again and again once we look at a simple perceptron then a multilayered perceptron and then things like convolutional networks or recurrent all of this all this is laying the foundation for a more sophisticated robust machine learning based systems okay so I hope this was helpful and made sense if it ah uh okay let's okay okay so I hope this was helpful and made some sense to you and you have uh uh an idea of what linear regression is what the least squares method is and if you're inclined to continue just keep following to the next video and I will program this particular algorithm from scratch okay thanks very much see you there maybe uh uh okay how how we doing um exponential classic example exponential R log plots yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay so how did we do everybody I don't wonder how long that'll be that was probably like 15 minutes or something um so now what I'm going to do so uh if MAA if you're there I think what I think just what I think I'm going to do is not have this be coding challenge I don't know why um let me go look at the playlist here I mean that certainly was just an explanation I could make the second thing like a coding challenge but then it wouldn't have the explanation with it I wonder if if I look at my playlists where I'm thinking this would go is just as part of session two no are we in session two no no no we're in session three do I have a session 31 yet maybe I don't have a session 31 just yet did I do an introduction to session three I thought I did uh yeah I did I did so maybe I just didn't make that playlist so I think this can just go in um where are we here introduction session three what is machine learning and then it goes after these I kind of am so arbitrary about whether oh I need to speak about how to find B I forgot about that cuz that's such an easy part oops I got to go back we'll just splice this together in a weird out of order way hold on I gotta I mean b is sort of obvious once you have um yeah thank you I don't know why I forgot that uh okay I'm looking at the chat okay uh all right oops I forgot so for the formula of a the line Y = MX plus b the slope is the more complex calculation actually once we have that slope it's pretty easy to calculate the Y intercept where is B and the formula for that is b equals m time uh M * xar + Y Bar did I get that right oh no no no I totally did not get that right what am I saying let's just edit this back to where I get it correctly the uh formula is b = y barus m * xar and you could kind of see why this is the case right because remember y equal MX plus b so all I need to do is say uh b = y MX right and we could just use the average of all the X and all the Y to figure out where should that line be shifted so this is a this is the formula to calculate that Y intercept so we can do this with a statistical method we run through all the data we calculate the slope we calculate the Y intercept and we have that line that formula for the line for which we can make predictions for new data I hope you found this blah blah blah so now we can go back to that uh blah blah blah okay wait what else did I miss um it's so nice but it's really good that I have a live chat going because I clearly make so many mistakes uh also your sum should run from one not zero oh yes that's a good point I'm right or it would be zero to n minus one technically I guess if I'm using sort of array index thing so maybe maybe I'll addendum this okay good luck M editing this together okay this could come still before my finishing point one more thing as it was uh pointed out in the chat to me thank you to K weekman yes again again which is that who should really be just making these video tutorials because I just keep getting everything wrong but I'm so used to Counting from zero in the array index programming world that I live in uh there's five elements 0 1 2 3 four but in this case in this notation this should really be sum from I equals 1 all the way to n there's 10 elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we could think of them as 0 to 9 1 to 10 whatever it's the same idea but technically speaking I think my formulas are a bit off if this doesn't say I equals one so that's a good correction thank you very much now I hope blah blah blah so this could be or I could divide by n plus one is the average no no no I think my fixing explanation there was good okay uh okay I don't know why this musac stuff gives me such happiness no I did forget the formula for the Y intercept but then I uh got it in it okay did I miss anything else because now we can program it what time is it 520 okay I'm not seeing any major Corrections uh so we're going to program it now hello welcome to ah another video which is part two of my uh linear regression tutorial and in this video I am going to take this beautiful blank canvas that is the web browser and make linear regression happen in it is that a weird thing to say or do hopefully not anyway so how are we going to do this so first thing that I need is I need to boy this is always more complicated than you think I like oh it's G to be so simple one thing that I should do I should should probably hm hold on do I need to map the screen work work with me folks here do I need to map the pixel space to a more kind of traditional cartisian plane like where Z 0 is in the bottom left and kind of normalize it between zero and one and so I get a kind of less insane looking formula for the line or should I just live with the coordinate system the way it is is it's probably useful to map it because when you get data it's not going to have the pixelbased stuff okay I think I'm gonna have to map it okay okay I did some thinking there for a second and um wait I'm going to do a little more thinking can you see the wheels turning CU actually I was just kind of homing it there like I was thinking about you know what I was going to eat for dinner okay um so here's the thing that happens a lot in a machine learning and computer Graphics this thing that I've drawn over here is sort of has an arbitrary scale there's a temperature which I botched by doing it in Fahrenheit which is like the worst measuring system ever I I don't want to be insulting it's just you know and Fahrenheit you're wonderful too you have many good qualities just like Celsius I I love all my temperature systems equally anyway um but let's say I wanted to actually graph this data you know what do I have I have a canvas that I'm going to draw in the web browser which you know has like 0 to 600 pixels and 0 to 400 pixels z z in the top left it points down it points to the right I think I need to map my pixel space so what I mean by that is I want to have my pixel space represent Z being in the bottom left and I want the x axis to be kind of go from 0 to one and the y axis go from 0 to one so I need to have kind a scale the data scale and then the computer Graphics scale and I'm sort of making this up so it can be anything but when you go and apply this with real data you need some way of mapping from your data to pixels if you want to graph it you know in a lot of uh systems for doing data visualization if you're using r or D3 you know or some python graphic stuff it's not going to do this for you automatically but we're in JavaScript land we're going to use P5 we're going to do the maths ourselves okay okay so um so I'm going to first of all I'm gonna so I'm going to make a canvas and I'm going to make a canvas that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to draw the background uh with a a gray value of 51 okay whoa that's a giant canvas okay that's better so um I'm going to make it a square just to make things simpler right now um and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say uh Mouse pressed and whenever I press the mouse I'm going to create a new data point so I'm going to say x equals map Mouse X which goes between zero and width to a value between zero and one so this is me mapping the X values between zero and width to zero and one because the pretend data If This Were Real data I'd want to know what the actual range was I wouldn't be getting it from Mouse click but and I'm going to say VAR y equals math Mouse y from0 to height now however I'm going to say from one to zero because I want to have the bottom of the window be zero right if I come over here this is z 0 right over here so that's height which is zero zero is one okay so then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say VAR uh data equals create I'm going to use the P5 Vector object just to store both of these things and I'm I'm going to say Point call this a point and I'm going to make an array called data and I am going to say data. push point so what I've done here is every time I click I create a data point based on where the mouse is so what do I want to do in the draw function you know it's a little unnecessary to have an animation Loop here because I could potentially only redraw but whenever I have a new piece of data what I'm going to do here is I'm going to uh I'm going to iterate over all of the data uh so our I equals z i is less than data. length i++ and now what I need to do is do the reverse mapping so when I put the data into that array I want to map it to the the appropriate range and when I get it out I need to map it back to the pixel range so I'm going to say varx equals map data index I .x which has a range between 0 and one to between zero and width and I'm going to do the same thing for y map data doy which has a range between zero and one and map that to a range from height down to zero if you if you haven't seen this map function before I have a whole video just on what is map so you could go I'll link to that in the description as well then I'm going to draw an ellipse at X comma y That's you know 8 pixels by 8 pixels I'm going to say fill 255 and stroke 255 and now what we should see here is just the visuals that I want which is wherever I click I get a point so you know this would be a lot simpler without that mapping but the mapping is going to be useful for us as we start to try to compute the formula for the line with the with the least squares uh criteria okay um how we doing so far I think we're doing okay I mean I feel okay probably um all right so what's the next thing that I need to do oh we need to calculate m&b so when should we do that so let's make a global variable M let's call it I think I could call it m equals z and VAR b equals z and let's actually make m equal 1 so let's see if we have an m and a b right the formula for a line is y okay so let's let's uh um what are we gon to do okay I got it I got it I got it okay so here's the thing I want to draw that line so how am I going to do that well I could just take the x value here and then the x value at the end calculate the corresponding yv values for both of those points and then draw a line between them so let's do that so let's write a function called Draw line and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say VAR X Min equals zero VAR y Min uh sorry x max equals 1 then I'm going to say y Min equals m * X Min + B and Y Max you know what this is really just like X1 uh X2 y1 Y2 like I'm really trying to get two points X1 y1 and and X2 Y2 so in fact this would make more sense to write it this way y1 = M * X1 + B and Y2 = M * X2 + B and now all I need to do is say stroke 255 oh I could make it a different color just like I had two different color markers and I could say line X1 y1 X2 Y2 only I can't right what's the problem I calculated this line with my units my my scale my mapping of the data having this range between zero and one and so I need to unmap it to the pixel stuff so this is a little bit awkward but let's just do it this way let's say X1 equals math uh X1 which has a range between 0 and one to between Zer and width and by the way I could just multiply it by width but I'm keeping the map function in here because you might have a very different scale why uh y1 is the same thing but go from height down to zero and then we're going to do the same thing for X2 and Y2 are you asleep yet uh and now now we're going to draw so we're going to calculate those values map them to pixels and then draw the line and so let's uh in the draw function let's have draw a line so now oops a I have an error line 50 oops I got I guess I have an extra bracket somehow oops Y 2 is not defined a draw a line where did I mess up here uh oops this should be Y2 thank you very much there so you can see there's the line so I mean that's what the line is always going to be so now I know that if I have the m and the B for the formula for a line I can visually represent that line now all I need to do is use this formula here to calculate m and b based on the actual X and Y values let's do that okay so let's remind ourselves so let's do let's write a function and let's call it linear regression oh and I wanted to talk about where the term regression comes from this French thing and it's regression to the mean you can look it up um okay so uh what are we going to do well one thing we know we definitely know need to know if you so time out I forgot to mention in the beginning of this video I I forgot to mention in this uh I forgot to mention in this video that the beginning that you should watch the previous one how can I correct that we'll splice something in there somebody remind me at the end I'll record us me saying that for sentence and Mato will splice that in there okay okay so if we look at the formula and this I went through all of this from the previous uh in the previous video um where I talked about this formula something that I really need is xar and and Y Bar and xar is the mean or the average of all the X values and Y Bar is the mean of all the yv values so adding them all up together dividing by the total number so I might as well uh add those up I mean get calculate those first so the first thing I want to do is say uh X sum equals zero and we're going to go through all of the data we're going to iterate over all of the data uh y sum equals z we're going to say x sum plus equals data index i.x y sum plus equals data in that so we're adding up all of the X values and all the Y values and then we're going to say x mean equals x sum divided by data. length and the same thing for the y mean so this is for this is the average so we now have the average of all the X values and the average of all the Y values now what we need to do is we need to calculate the numerator and the denominator let's do the numerator first so the numerator is so first I need to I'm going to have to sum up some stuff here so uh what am I first I definitely need to Loop through all the data but we doing a lot of looping through all the data so I'm going to say numerator equals zero so the numerator is going to add up all together each data points x minus x mean times each data points and you know what I'm going to do I'm GNA just use some extra variables here which I think will make things a little cleaner uh just so we can look at the formula this is now the numerator right this is ex exactly this is in code right here exactly what's written in the formula here it's adding up all of the X's minus the average of x's and all the Y's minus the average of y's multiplied together okay so we've got that and now all we need to do is we also we might as well do the denominator at the same time why not right denominator can I say Deen for that we're going to add up the denominator is x x mean * x x mean it's just that added up squared and then m equals oh m equals uh numerator divided by denominator whoops denominator so let's think about this could we have an issue where the denominator is zero you know it's if there's this is only worth doing if there's more than one uh data point so I think we should say here in um so whereas in draw we're going to say if data. length is greater than one then calculate the linear regression and draw the line all right let's give this a try hey look at that that was amazing nothing ever works in the first try uh this kind of makes sense right you can see I can add a bunch of points and it's always fitting that line to the points this is linear regression interactive linear regression in the browser is probably not anything I should be too excited about but it's making me happy right now time out for a second um uh oh what's known as perfect colinearity the problem with when you guys write useful pieces of information in the chat is I see them like 30 seconds or a minute later because I'm in the future and I cannot I don't know what um what relates to what I'm G there's more that I need to talk about in this video I just want to take a break for a second if all the X values are zero then m equals z yeah okay um so now what I want to talk about is model checking this is really um uh this is a really useful K weekman also pointed this out to me so okay so which I want to talk about here uh when all the X's are equal that's perfect collinearity perfect collinearity uh yeah all right boy all these thing all this stuff o look at this you guys should be watching this YouTube video I'm sure it's much better than anything I could possibly ever make o what is an example of perfect multic colinearity uh okay maybe I shouldn't read stack Overflow during my live stream okay so the thing that I want to talk about now and I'm going to bring up um week. github.io ml what's the URL for um K weekman what's the URL for your um sandbox maybe it is yes linear regression great so I think I'm gonna just use this as a demonstration if you don't mind um I will of course credit you and put a link to it in the video description but um yeah uh okay all right okay so somehow I need to get back so I need to get back in to this video tutorial talking about does linear regression actually make sense and then uh and look at um talk about model checking and the term sort of residual plot is useful um and uh um and then um look at anscombs quartet and just kind of like finish up and give some people some ideas of things you could try and then I need to remember a meant to splice something in where I say something about watching the previous video uh sorry here's the um MAA is asking for this is if anyone can't find this is the URL someone wants to post this in the chat okay people are still talking about temperature I can't wait for the YouTube comments on my uh Fahrenheit versus Celsius Kelvin maybe I should just do everything in Kelvin is there like an esir equivalent of espiranto I guess maybe okay let me get out of this right now okay okay so this this video is really complete we see that I have this linear regression that's uh calculated now here's the thing what can you do with this so first of all you might think of some more interesting interactive ways of playing with the data whether it's being able to click move these points around drag and drop um randomize all the points I'm sure you could come up with some more interactive possibilities but one thing that I think is really important to talk about is whether it actually makes sense to use linear regression a linear regression model for your data and one way you know there's lots of reasons why this could be a why why you might not want to first of all um you know simple do I dare erase this and just come over here simple way to sort of talk about this is you know let's what if this is a plot of my data well you can see I could apply a linear regression to this and I'm going to get a line that maybe looks something like this forgot my multicolored marker and I'm off let me try that again I'm off I'm off I I said no more Mulligans but I'm gonna give myself a mulligan here except I I can't fake erase it continuity error put it back what's the chance oh it's got all the I'm trying to recreate my drawing which is kind of sad for a variety of reasons someone's gonna notice this oh yeah and it was like D I forgot that I had like x0 X X1 but I'm I'm too far gone now I I have to continue this d0 this should be like X1 D1 whatever okay D2 okay close enough no one will notice because I'm going to walk over and erase it momentarily uh okay let's try this again okay so let's look let's think about a scenario where you wouldn't um you where you wouldn't uh sorry here I am where you wouldn't want to use uh linear regression so what if your data happened to kind of look like this so I could fit this trying to get better at the multicolor I could fit this with a line and I might still get even like the same sort of line but actually if we really looked at this data I could see that ah you know what this data I could fit a curve to this data I could fit something like y = MX2 + b or even plus you know m0 x^2 + M1 * x + B and I'm probably using the wrong I should I should start using uh this is B 0 B1 B B2 right so you I could essentially create a polynomial formula a formula that has not just X but X squar and maybe X cubed or x to the 4th power and I'm actually going to look at that in a future video um U so I will do a video where I do polinomial regression I'm just going to use a Javas SCP library that hasn't built into it so just to sort of demonstrate the idea but this is something that I might want to do and what's interesting about linear regression and this um this has been demonstrated there's a famous data set whoops anscom oncome anybody know how to pronounce that uh um there's a wellknown famous data set called encom's quartet where let's look I'm going to look at these four graphs each one of these has the same exact linear regression line right you can see that with this data the line is the same but does this does this line really make sense well for this one it kind of does right you can see that it's a nice approximation of the data with this one it does but you can see it's kind of off because there's just an anomaly and maybe we should build something into our model to account for that anomaly or this one over here even though linear regression has that same line it's actually we you could figure out that we could use a polinomial function to estimate that and here we got some kind of like crazy nonsense where we have all the same X values so this is an important thing to realize that linear regression is not some kind of magic it's not a recipe for all data for all inputs and outputs but it is a simple model that will work for a lot of data data that is linear um one way to evaluate whether or not the linear model is useful for your uh data set is to look at something called the residuals and um uh uh coding train viewer extraordinary k weekman um you can go to kwon's GitHub kweek man. GitHub I'll include a link to this in the video description created a much more sophisticated demonstration this is the same exact idea I can move these points around um and I can kind of uh I can randomize them and I can see the same linear regression but what this is showing is a residual plot the residual plot shows the magnitude of the difference from the line to the data point for each and every data point and if and we can actually uh that the anscom uh data is built into this and you can see this makes sense if you have a kind of random residual plot that's a good sign if you have a highly patter pattern residual plot then it's most likely that some other model could be useful for your regression so something you might consider doing as an exercise is researching more about different data sets uh trying to implement I mean you could find K weekman code on GitHub as well but try to make your own residual plot from my scatter plot code um uh and what other types of interactive features for importing or using different data sets uh what other colorful and creative ways can you explore visual Iz in the process of linear regression okay so thanks for watching this video I'm going to do a couple more videos on this topic number uh I'm going to uh look at polinomial regression with a JavaScript library and then I'm going to use a different technique to calculate a linear aggression known as gradient descent and the main reason I want to do that is gradient descent as opposed to this least squares methodology I used here is a fundamental method for neural networkbased learning uh for a a learn learning method for neural network based systems so we're going to do that for linear regression which will set us up well for neural network stuff later um okay uh what what did I uh Miss I didn't say goodbye yet because I was sure I missed something how was that K weekman did I do did I did I get at the sort of essence of some of the stuff that you mentioned in the slack Channel earlier today that I about model checking and the residual plot um um I would love any feedback from anybody before I put a bow on this uh two video linear regression thing as always I always forget the this dot this do this I was off camera when I was drawing the polinomial but that was probably fine somebody can CGI me back in right how hard could that be somebody by the way said they wanted more green screen footage of me on Twitter the other day so uh here we go I don't know I don't know what I'm supposed to do but I I like it when I I'm yeah anyway okay there we go there uh okay come back here um all right uh indeed short and clear good you know this isn't a course on statistics I don't know what this is but it's the you know I'm trying to give some background and some basic steps so hopefully um uh people got the idea here okay so oh the Whiteboard content well let me look back oops was there some part over here that is not was not usable oh CU I drew down here no I think it was okay right so hopefully it's okay I was getting some messages that there was maybe a missing part but um okay uh somebody said once I start doing uh somebody made a YouTube comment that once I start doing es6 we have a whole new super super the super song never forget the super uh okay at the top oh that part is not visible I see it okay um yeah the hey Okay uh all right so what do we've got ah let me I don't know what this is going to do but um so this will get split somehow um so I'm just gonna say oh let's try this before I begin coding I just wanted to mention if you just jumped into this video I walk through a full explanation of what linear regression is and the formula that I'm about to use in the previous video so check this video's description to a link to that preious previous video otherwise keep watching I'm going to get started coding um will that work justplay thin I hope that does all right it is 550 p.m. so I let's let's review where I got to today I got through half of this I got through half of this um so tomorrow I think I'm going to do now I hope that I have some time tomorrow the schedule is a little bit tricky um but and it would if I were to live stream tomorrow it would be somewhere in the 2 to 500 p.m probably range I definitely have to be done by 5 and I probably can't start any earlier than two so somewhere in that range of time I'm going to try to live stream and I will cover these two last pieces okay so I have about uh 5 to 10 minutes before I have to go so I will try to see if I can answer a few questions um or um oh oh I know what I need to mention shoot I should have done this at the beginning always forget well better late than never um where am I going to find information about this let me go to the coding train Reddit um okay so there's all sorts of things on here there's a coding train oh the look maybe I can find some more questions here maybe I'll try to post another oh I'm in the wrong screen there's um uh okay so somebody set up uh a coding train Discord and because I'm old and out of it I have no idea what Discord is but I wonder if I should get used to it so I wanted to mention it I guess it is uh an unofficial chat talking platform for people who are interested um so you can click maybe I'll try to join it look at it I'm using slack for the uh people who support my channel through patreon but you know I'm always interested in other platforms especially if they're open source and flexible not that slack is but um anyway uh so I wanted to mention that that Discord server exists so please join that Community if you're interested or find that to be nice and interesting um I also trying to figure out a good way to uh receive questions so I was trying to make a question thread for each week which I did two weeks ago what's today but I didn't make one maybe I'll make one for tomorrow but let's see if there are any new questions on here um I think I answered some of these already yeah yeah I answered most of these already last time so maybe I'll try to make a new question thread and ah um okay but in the chat from G4 m34 G4 M3 m4n i4c in the slack Channel asks are you going to do some tensor flow yes so again if you want to know what's upcoming this summer uh everything is uh here so I've actually made all the examples and done quite a few and written up some readmes with supplemental links I intend to make videos for every single topic that's here and hopefully more and you can see that when I get to convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks I'm going to use tensor flow for that um I am however using currently in my examples um Caris which is a little bit which is a higher a layer on top of tensorflow to make it a bit easier higher level uh to so that's what I'm uh planning to use at the moment um I have no idea what cotlin is is there a thread to submit video IDE ideas yes and no I mean there is one um I've been using a GitHub repository oops um it's under the coding train GitHub rainbow topics and issues and what I do you can see people are suggesting um I think I'm going to do Tetris by the way I thought of somebody originally suggested Tetris and was like and I sort of thought that's kind of impossible then I saw siraj doing something with Tetris uh on his YouTube channel um and I was thinking oh I could do Tetris um so this summer my plan is to keep some momentum with the machine learning stuff but I would like to ALS also pepper in just kind of random coding challenges I want to do the dragon curve people have been suggesting other games like maybe Tetris so you know I might do sort of an every other week type thing like I'll do some machine learning stuff and then next week some just goofy generative art or game stuff and then come back to machine learning stuff and I'm also hoping to schedule a whole bunch of guests I need to get working on that uh okay uh let's see any other questions I'm going to play my goodbye song somebody could find this song on Sound no I think I got it off the it's very loud uh I think I got it off of um the uh I think I got it on like free music archive once when I searched for rainbow and like public domain uh Game of Life I do sodoku solver would be interesting game of life has been requested a lot I have a bunch of videos tutorials on Game of Life that I made sort of in uh processing back in the day guess I could do it again maybe that would be a good processing challenge um to do just to program it from scratch and just kind of do it I'd be happy to do that um I lowered the audio hopefully it's okay off the music yeah uh thank you guys I I I don't know why this it's really hard about doing these live streams and I used to feel more comfortable with this um and I think especially when I'm doing this more technical stuff mathbased stuff that's really almost like I'm supposed to be teaching something real rather than just like coding up something fun not that those two things need to be mutally exclusive I really feel a bit lost into how it's going so hopefully people found today useful um oh you know what I think we should do it's night time for a lot of you let's take a little break here for a second it's been a while since we read it's probably way too loud from the coding train story book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates previously on the coding train 5439 7,845 okay that was the previously now it's the now I don't know 75821 10,38 oh no no that's yeah yeah 59767 46323 61,800 an interesting random number 92 962 next week next time on the coding train oh my lby let's just try this music next time on the coding train we're going to read some gussian deviates 820 225 925 1. 514 2741 31 1.09 949 336 449 378 I just read one of the numbers will anybody ever know I'm on page 127 okay uh I feel like I could do all this nonsense at the end um something else that I wanted to read is um I thought that I would um try to read you guys some quotes from this book it's called in her own words uh red Burns was the uh founder uh of ITP um she was a mentor to me and she would open every year for all the students um here's a picture of red um a presentation in her class with uh and this book is um actually I'll just read this you most alumni remember the first day of the applications class Red's class because of the slides she showed to open the school year the words are an encapsulation of her philosophy and her hopes for ITP students they are words to live by and also words for us to all remember read here she is in her own words so I thought that periodically I would also read to you some quotes from this book maybe I would do one per week um even though I could just do all of them and they kind of are nice in sequence I could pick a random one or I could just just read you the first one we I'll read these in order so today's quote from Red is as you come together depend on each other okay so that's my word this episode was brought to you by the letter the quote anyway um so that's one quote I will come back tomorrow and I will read you another one and maybe someday somebody could splice the all of these things together um okay uh what else else do I need today let's just let's listen to the this dot song as always I always forget the this dot do do do see if there's any more questions do all right everybody thank you all for watching and um I I hopefully will be back tomorrow I'm not guaranteeing that at this point but it is a uh this is probably loud it is a plan that I hope to have I will certainly be back next week um over the summer um you know I'm kind of the commitment I've made is to try to do uh a live stream every week and you know there periods of time during the year this summer in particular where I'm going to be traveling for a week or two I'm traveling for a week in June two weeks in July two weeks in August so there will certainly be some weeks where I'm not U making videos but I'm I'm hoping that they're going to be because it's a summer and I'm not I don't have classes at NYU right now or there'll be some weeks that I live stream twice and um this is a week that I'm hoping to do that I'm hoping to be back tomorrow at least for another hour because I want to get through all of this stuff so that song ended already okay so thanks for watching um and I will see you guys maybe tomorrow in a future live stream I appreciate your support uh and your kind words and your constructive criticism and feedback always uh enjoy your coating also go outside give somebody a hug and enjoy some nature uh breathe in smell the flowers not don't get too close especially if you're allergic to anything that's like in the flower you know that sort of thing okay see you guys goodbye um uh this video this live stream will be available as an archive soon soon enough okay goodbye oh that doesn't turn off till I click this buttton
