hello welcome to a wrapup video for a session seven of programming from A to Z on this YouTube channel of mine that has an undefined name at the moment but someday it might have a defined name so what I'm asking for you to do as a homework exercise for this particular session on grammars specifically contextfree grammars is essentially to write a computer well there's a lot of things you could do but if you're looking for something have a computer program write your own story and write that story differently each time so you can see this one example that was written by up this is written by a five year old and an eight year old together collaboratively and you could and using the tracery grammar so that would that might be a first thing that you start find this example linked to in this video and modify the story um really I think one thing to think about is like how much variation can you can you embed into the grammar can the story sometimes only be one sentence long and sometimes be you know hundreds or thousands of words long so think about this sort of like how you might really explore variety and parameterize the Festiva know were to use the the the way that the grammar works how nested are unnecessary so you can think about writing a story the other thing that grammars are particularly good at contextfree grammars are generating text that fits into a very sort of prescriptive pattern so one of my favorite BOTS on Twitter is the art assignment bot and you can skip the exercise that I'm talking about and you can just do this one which is from 42 minutes ago construct a wood carving researching the history of embosses due on Thursday May 25th 2017 or build a photograph about tools due on Tuesday November 2nd so this you can see you can really I don't know that this is made with a contextfree grammar but you could imagine describing the grammar for this so if you were to create on you know a spell book I think it's a classic scenario that there are some tracery examples that do this creating a recipe book or what types of kind of statements defined statements the other thing that I think is you know what I've done in these two sessions is I've showed you Markov chains here's what a Markov chain is and here's what a Markov chain does here's what a contextfree grammar is and here's what a contextfree grammar does so on the one hand and exercises just take my exact examples and produce output but I think really the magic of project happens in the spaces in between so maybe a Markov chain is just a little piece of one word inside of some text you're generating and the contextfree grammar just creates an overall structure also you know interfaces with an API and so how is it that these could be a piece of the project and also really in thinking about what's your presentation so in the one hand if you look at any of my examples you know this is just generating little sentences but who is the character that's speaking you know what's the context is it a Twitter bot is it a web page there's a wonderful project in my class today that was looking at generating fake election ballots and so using the visual language of a system that you're trying to emulate to sort of spark the idea in the viewer in either a playful way or subversive way or to make a statement or just to tell a story I think there's a lot of possibilities in thinking about the context and the visual design elements that are surround how and where you're generating that text the other thing that I think is worth really noting here is that both with Markov chains and with contextfree grammars that words or characters what is it what's the sequence of the grim what is the grammar describing is it describing language is the language English is it an for another language or is it musical notes or is it designs is do you have a contextfree grammar that builds a design out of shapes and color how might you explore something like that so I encourage you to look at these examples try tracery try rita you know as an exercise you might try programming that recursive algorithm on your own and see what types of results you could get okay so I hope you enjoyed session 7 and you can share anything you make in the comments or at Schiffman on twitter and of course you know I always sort of plug that if you feel so inclined you can join the the patreon page and there's a slack channel too to discuss and ask questions ok so see you in a future session video whatever and talk to you soon
