hello this is another video in my series about Chrome extensions which you know right now I just want to say at the beginning of this video I hope to actually turn this playlist into something that's instead of saying Chrome extensions just say browser extensions because that is something that is quite possible beyond simply the browser Chrome but I'm gonna stick with Chrome right now as I work through all the details so what am I going to add in this particular video well as you can see here in my diagram I can't see over there anymore my monitor is now blocked by something else as you can see in my diagram here I have talked about content scripts and background scripts and what I'm going to add today is something called a popup so a popup is a page that you can launch that's essentially like an overlay of what's what's in the browser at the certain and a certain moment and I can launch it via a browser action for example clicking a button that I have in the top over here I can press that button and I can have some sort of popup come up so I could do things like I could have an interface where I could change colors or make selections or type in a word that I want to look up I could augment the browsing experience through a separate popup page that is that as part of my Chrome extension so that's what we're gonna make in this tutorial okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start with the code that I had at the end of my background script tutorial which if we look at already made a copy of it into a new folder which I'm calling popups which you can find a link to this code for this tutorial in the description as usual and what I'm what i have is that manifest.json file so i've already changed it to coding train extension 3 maybe I'll say you know all changes the coding train popup it is like the content script is available for all URLs in the background strip now interestingly enough I actually don't need a background script just have a popup like I might need a background script for something else that's going on in my extension but I don't need it just for the popup so I think just for simplicity in this particular tutorial I'm gonna take out the background script and I'm actually going to just delete the file that is the background actually you know what I'm gonna leave it there because eventually one thing that I'm gonna want to do is if you recall a way that I sent a message the way that I controlled the content script or made an event happen the contract script from the background script was sending a message and actually what I probably going to want to do now is send a message from the popup to the content script so the code that's in the background script is going to become useful for me because I can use that same code in the popup alright so but when there's a browser action I want there to be something more I want there to be a default popup no it's not written over there what I'm supposed to type right here I just looked over there because there was something interesting happening I'm putting notes over there and I want this to be now can I make that in another folder let's try this and I want to try to do is make the popup of entire Pete let's actually first just make it an HTML page so I'm gonna just call it popup HTML and I think I need to say oh I don't need to but I can say default I know and this will appear in like the tooltips like a popup will come here alright so I think that is now some stuff that I can add to now have a popup now what this means is there needs to be an HTML page called popup that HTML so I'm gonna make that file popup dot HTML and I'm just gonna I mean I should I don't really know you need all this stuff in the HTML page but let's just put basically like something really basic there right now just to say like hello I know uh choo choo okay so this is this page I want to see popup when I press that button in the browser okay here we go so now what do I need to do remember I need to load the code and to load that extension Oh five popups this is the one I'm gonna select a whole folder I'm gonna hit select no errors occurred in the loading of this extension so it should be fine now I can go to any page I just happen to be going to my coding train I mean my chrome extension tutorial page I'll go there now look I should be able to see this button right here this is my button the reason why it has that image is because I included the default icon to be this PNG file and if I click there look at that there's my popup it can't have a giant to chew right there and not use the train whistle all right so we see that the popups work now let's try to do something a little bit more interesting with the popup let me see if I can put an animation there something let's see if I can put a whole p5 sketch there so let's try that so what I want to do I mean I'll just work with the file system for a second like let me see if I can do I'm gonna make a folder called sketch and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to I'm gonna actually delete popup dot HTML we saw that that worked I'm going to pause for a second and come back in a second and I'm back now what I have done in that very long amount of time wait longer than should taken me is I have grabbed one of my previous examples from a coding challenge that generates a maze and I've put all of the code for that coding challenge in a folder called sketch so now what I want is for the popup to display that example let's just look at that example what that example does I've got that example also just running here in the browser let me just quickly go to that so this is the example it it generates a maze using a particular algorithm that I used a long time to go into challenge so what I want is when I click this the files not there anymore I want to see that means ok here we go we're gonna make this happen so what do I do what I have to do is this file doesn't exist anymore I deleted it what I need to do is here the default popup should be sketch slash index at HTML so the question is is that enough if I just point to that page that's in the sketch folder will it work or do I need to do something more to reference the different JavaScript files and libraries and things that I'm using let's find out and then I'm going to change oh let me just show you that here we should see we should say generate a maze that's going to be the message the little tooltip message when you hover over the button so I need to go and reload the Chrome extension and it doesn't actually really matter what page I'm on but I'm a stick on this page if I hover over here you should see right I'm getting that generate amazed message and then I worked so that was actually quite easy so you can see here I have the mais generating in the popup and interestingly enough let me press that but goes away is it gonna pause and continue from where it was before is it gonna start over had it already been running for a while when I first clicked it I'd even notice let's look again let's see this is interesting it started over so notice this is very important this is a page that's being loaded fresh each time every time you click it's not a page that's running and being hidden and then revealed it's actually a new page that's being loaded which brings up another question how do I debug something that's happening on the popup is there something here nope whoops so let's add a console dot log into the popup this is actually all of that code and I'm just going to say console dot log frame count so this is what I would log typically in a p5 sketch if I wanted to just see that it was running it should say 0 1 2 3 4 5 Counting every single frame so now I'm gonna reload the extension I'm going to refresh over here and I'm going to click the button so where is it logging that well let's look in the JavaScript console let's try clicking the button again it's / my console let me try again no so notice how this is not where the only the content script is playing a role in the actual content page this popup is just information so this video is about the end because I'm kind of at the end of it but I need to do something what I want to show is how you can have the content script send a message I'm sorry the popup send a message because ultimately maybe I want to build an interface there where I you know I made a Chrome extension where I do it along the page so maybe I can like pick a color or change the line thickness that type of thing so I'm gonna get to that in the next video but I at least want to figure out where I can debug this stuff if I look here this is where I would have a console log for a background script but I don't have a background script this is a popup I don't see it there where is it so actually thank you to the chat who clued me in on this I'm going to press this button here and I'm going to right click and if I right click I now see I have this option called inspect and I can select that and it's going to bring up another window I can go over to console so this is the JavaScript console for the popup there's a JavaScript console for the page content page there's a JavaScript console for the background script and now there's a JavaScript console for this particular popup okay so I've shown you how to add a popup you can do this anything that you can put on a web page can be in a popup you could start querying api's and drawing maps and doing anything in that popup so what I want to do in the next video is show you how to send a message from the popup to the content script and change something in the interface by what you're doing in the popup and I kind of have I have an idea for that
