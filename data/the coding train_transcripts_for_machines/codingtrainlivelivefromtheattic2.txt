so do do hello good afternoon this is just a quick sound check uh we'll be getting started in about two or three minutes let me know if you hear me and if the sound is coming through okay the music might be a little bit louder than my voice which right now is fine me hello and welcome to a saturday afternoon coding train episode without a train whistle or a bell because i've been spending all this time getting myself ready ready to be here live on the internet streaming and talking to you my friends my the people around the world who are for whatever reason i don't know why listening to me talk right now and usually i blow a train whistle or i ring a bell to start things off and i have no idea where i put those things which is kind of an interesting thing to note because yesterday which was friday today saturday i was actually in the tutorial recording studio where i make all of the sort of sequenced content that is on this channel and i did not have the bell when the train was still there either and yet um let me see if i can dig those up let me find them hold on we'll be right back i mean i won't be i'm gonna still be here i'm standing up as you can see this is an incredibly professional operation that i've got going here super prepared and organized i've got like a teleprompter there's like a production team of people all on the other side of this camera all working furiously to keep this show afloat no it's just me in the attic with my train whistle and my bell alright here we are i'm really excited about today and uh what the the the way that i'm doing the coding train now and so far my plan has been set into motion and it's working out well welcome to any new viewers this is a youtube channel that has both uh sequence tutorials about programming the computer as well as live streams from my attic of my home in brooklyn new york where i waste an incredible amount of time not being able to figure things out that i'm trying to figure out uh this show is incredibly high production value and super organized i've been planning it all week uh it's so much so that i now i have sponsors who i would like to just briefly shout out um thank you to brilliant uh brilliant is a wonderful website to help you stretch your mind and try all sorts of puzzles it's where i get actually many of my coding challenge ideas these days and also thank you to notion uh for uh sponsoring the coding train notion if you are a coding drain member and you received something in the mail recently you received it because i got myself organized on notion which is a productivity tool that you might want to check out um that you can check out at bitly notion coding train okay now back to my uh camera here what i'll come back and talk about those sponsors a little bit later a little bit more but what am i going to do today today my goal and i've literally done absolutely nothing to prepare for this i haven't even like i'm actually going to attempt to hang it on the wall behind me during this live stream that's how much i am going to attempt to program the everyday calendar now i have a bad feeling now the everyday calendar i have a bad feeling this is not going to work out and i'm doing something else but at least this is where i'm this is my starting idea and um an octopus member octopus do you have your own random number i don't recognize your name in the discord member chat um fortunately i've got my other camera right over here pointed at my random number digit book and just in case octopus if you don't have your random number i'm going to give you one right now thank you for being a member of the coding train as you know with your membership of the coding train you get your very whoa wait where's my buzzer look this is a camera over here that's frozen on an image of the millionaire legit book is it disconnected what happened here let me see if i can fix this uh i'm just going over here to my console here where's my i'm waiting because uh nothing is working music um let's see here how do i do this let's try this oh look here i am twice now if i put this back there we go a live picture of the book it is working again remember octopus your name is very clever it's a pun i think or else you just have misspelled octopus which would be fine because why why does it matter how you spell octopus i like to spell octopus so cute and once again i've got about five seconds to give you a random number which is 13957 that's your very own random number i'll probably give it to somebody else by accident because i can never remember these things but nonetheless thank you for your support of the coding train my way my family downstairs i can think they can hear me i think they've been completely lost yet none of them watched this if they did they already think that i'm completely nuts which i am now uh the other thing that i'm excited about is i've got my hue lights again um i at a minimum i should be able to control them from my telephonic device over here and no that's a wrong button and i'm going to go over here and i can make pretty colors and all sorts of things happen now i believe if somebody signs up to be a member i'm not suggesting that you need to do um that they will blink but we'll have to wait to find out all right now right right ah so but before i go and work on the project for today saturday by the way i'm calling this i need a theme song this is called saturday side projects with the coding training all my side projects in my live streams on saturdays before i start to work on the everyday calendar which is a beautiful uh piece of art i would say but um that's an extra calendar that uh has all sorts of wonderful features and qualities and is very unique that i'm going to show you in a minute and try to hang it on the wall behind me it's going to be really funny um it's made by simone yetch and uh simone's name last name she's swedish is spelled giertz and for what i understand it's pronounced yet so hopefully simone i'm pronouncing your name correctly thank you i mean i paid for this but thank you for making it it is beautiful it is bringing me much joy i'm gonna put it up over here and see if we can program it uh in a little bit before i get to that i like to start off every saturday side side project saturday it's kind of like wacky wednesday with a community contribution yes that's right your contributions to the coding train the things you've made with code can sometimes be featured right here by me on the internet now normally i'd have a green screen and i'd be floating in my laptop but because i want to play with the everyday calendar i don't have the green screen up right now let's bring up this web browser we're gonna go to i don't know where to find it oh i think if i go to the github repo there's an issue somewhere along here uh wheel wheel wheel link there we go all right so what this is uh thank you to gypsy dangerous from the coding train community who helped put this together um it is a wheel that i can spin and it will land it's b it's pulling all the different contributions that are on the website and i don't know if i need to explain this every single time i come live but if i go here to any given video on the coding train for example the marching squares video there are a whole bunch of projects and versions that people have made of their own uh and um you can add your own version and find information about how to do that i encourage you please it brings me such happiness and joy to see the things that you're making um and then they get populated into this wheel so let's look at at least two i should have another wheel which i first spin to determine how many to look at and then i spin the wheel to look at that many that's an idea all right here we go um and by the way anyone wants to contribute to this as ideas to improve this system that i have uh connect with um um david tripsy dangerous and um we'd love your contributions to the wheel as well hearing audio twice right now that's i believe that's only marcus's issue so hopefully it is let me know remove and view selected we have now i don't know about this the wheel is rigged that's what i meant to press david snyder the creator of the wheel a little suspicious i think that david snyder's contribution came up first today but i know i know the randomness of the wheel is pure as pure as my book i don't i don't know why i have those there i was just if i get really stuck i could just work on solving them uh my random number book um let's go back here let's take a look at david's floating point snake oh so this is from this particular coding challenge about forward kinematics um from quite some time ago let's take a look at it oh it's a video do you hear the audio i think you do let's let's enjoy this for a minute i hope i'm not gonna have an issue with the copyright of this music i turned the music off you're probably still here through the mic though this is wonderful thank you for sharing this um yeah you're right you might be hearing the music doubled unfortunately i didn't get it together usually i have an earpiece in where i can hear the music you're hearing instead it's actually just coming out of the speakers so in addition to coming out of it being actually sent to the live broadcast it's also coming out of the speakers into the mic although i haven't turned off right now now it's doubled um wonderful work and that is a really um lovely way to document it um uh thank you for that usually um i lo you know one of the things that can be tricky to do especially if you're creating a project that's not um interactive code running the browser keep it quiet down there emily's being very loud um hold on i gotta mute my mic brief intermission i'll be right back what i say about this professional operation that i've got going on here okay thank you david snyder um um you know that reminds me a lot i guess this is probably an obvious thing um uh about uh it reminds me of of the slither.io game which is uh quite a fun game to play thank you for that wonderful work let's go and find another one we'll look at one more or you can't see it i'm all messed up oh i'm not even in the picture oh i'm doing the worst job today number 68 okay let's see what it is this is interactive viewing angle starfield by aman ahmad ahmadi and i don't know if i pronounced your name correctly hopefully i did it is a beautiful name i love that your initials are aaa that's very wonderful and i know this starfield coding challenge because the starfilled coding challenge is actually the first one that i ever did and it is from um how do i get to it on youtube uh i thought there was a way i guess i can just i'm just curious i want to see the date of it this is from april 16 2016. look how young i am oh what a handsome young man boy you were back then sonny okay anyway uh different glasses i like these glasses better all right uh oh remember the days of the timer speaking of the timer no that was a disaster right okay let's take a look at um almonds uh version oh where did this where did this go this took me to almonds twitter uh oh oh i i because i linked i clicked on his name oh and now oh so sad oh i am so sad this brings me this brings me terrible sadness i think we might be able to actually find this um if anyone um if anyone wants to do any detective work to figure out if this link of this project is available um i would love to see it i kind of have a way but i just i don't want to bite that i might be able to see um no sketches hmm all right well i don't think i'm going to be able to find it we're going to have to spin that wheel again sorry amen uh please if you want to if you could resubmit your uh project to a new link that would be fantastic uh here we go let's spin that wheel again oh and i'm not even in the picture oh number 10. let's take a look at this project it is what is going on here something is rotten in the state of denmark and something strange is a foot at the circle k i i didn't we also look at this one i think we might have looked at this one last yeah didn't we look at this one too it's wonderful it's a nice uh um oh no i i mean i've looked at it but this is solving a maze with a star david snyder we've looked at too much of your wonderful work on this uh live stream today we're gonna move on and we're gonna spin one more time what's going on here yes um says no rotten here i know i know there is nothing rotten rot in the state of denmark for reals uh all right remove the number 23. let's see let's yeah this is going here all right oh this is a p5.js port of the rubik's cube coding challenge look at this uh whoa what is going i think the i just realized that the chroma keying is actually on uh filters chroma key okay i'll turn that off since there's no so now here is whoa what is going on filters ah my light fell down oh no everything is some everything is wrong everything is falling apart filters chroma key there we go i did not realize the chroma key was on here's the rubik's cube let's take a look at the p5.js port by zl25 drexel oh awesome this was by the way uh one of the more popular projects that i worked on it probably fits pretty well into like this new side project saturday thing that i'm trying to do it is also one of those projects that i've just left lingering in the wind uh you know the idea was to start working on solvers for it but really all i got to was the visualization of it at all um but and i have this idea that could i use a genetic algorithm to solve a rubik's cube and i actually worked on it on my own like in the middle of the night this was probably like a year or two ago like i don't remember when i originally did it but like months later and i actually started to get it to work and this is the technique that i did i didn't try to have a genetic algorithm solve the rubik's cube let me let me talk about this for a second this is kind of interesting and since i have rubik's cube here with me this camera is like frozen again like useless camera here i'll just uh i can just hold that up to you so what i did is i i know the beginner's method which is one method to solve the rubik's cube i don't know if i'm using the correct terminology but where you first maybe for me the first thing you do is oh my lights are blinking whoa welcome to lori hey with your coding train membership you have one a possibility of someday in the future getting a custom coding rubik's cube because it's a thing i really want to make and i think that i'm going to try send gifts once a year to people and i had this idea that that would be a fun thing to look into but really thank you so much for your support it means a lot and your random number is 39 350. okay yeah octopus is saying um oh um almonds project has been found so i'm gonna take a look thank you for uh david snyder for your detective work um i forgot what i was saying but um i really i should return to that project keep me on let's let's we'll get there someday we're gonna get there let's make 20 20 21 look 2020. i don't know if you've noticed it's kind of a crappy year i mean that's like the understatement of the century so let's hope that things improve in 2021 not that the world operates on a year by year basis but we've got to reset with if we can reset and and and bring some um togetherness and health and equity to the world in ways that don't exist right now that would be an excellent thing and maybe also we'll finish that rubik's cube project all right now what was i doing i want to go to these i think it's the star field challenge page so i'm going to go to coding challenges and scroll all the way down to the very bottom the very first one what's really sad is i oh you don't see that i haven't made a new one of these since um april march 2020 so there's actually only four years so 16 17 18 95 years i guess of um well i didn't do any really in 2020 but there's there's not the coding challenges have really been on hold i got to get back to that uh to the challenge let's look at the community contributions we're trying to find uh almonds how come i don't see it oh here we go interactive viewing angle star field uh let's click on that oh oh this was so worth it awesome so i guess the idea here is that i can move the mouse around and i can change sort of the view then it gives it kind of this parallax 3d like feeling to it now i recall when i did the challenge it was entirely done with 2d math so of course everything ultimately if you're displaying on a screen is twodimensional but 3d 3d rendering is just the illusion of threedimensional perspective using matrix math really so the question is when i say did i i didn't use a 3d renderer a builtin one i just computed some kind of math myself to make the things move out from the center in a way that gives it a 3d like quality and i believe if i switch this to full and i go to here we can see that the same is true here why am i not logged in as the coding train the same thing is true here and i know that because uh if i go down to create canvas there is no um the webgl renderer is not being referenced so wonderful work and look at this oh hey for each loop why is that not working low battery oh for each loop you are so beautiful you make elegant ways of iteration look look at that arrow it's an equals it's a greater than the p is the variable that just tosses itself into this little section between the brackets it is each one of the stars for each star i don't know why i can't get myself to use them 2021 the year of the 4h loop okay am i trying too hard i think i'm trying too hard um star flight plays right i think he has lost it i have news for you starflight i lost it a long time ago all right we've got to move on everybody we have got to move on everybody so thank you amen i'm glad we were able to find that i'm going to close a bunch of windows here and we are going to look up every day calendar it's four o'clock um so i got this through uh kickstarter um and here is uh i guess you can get one now this is just me this is not a sponsored or any type of collaboration or anything i mean i'm like a little tiny youtuber compared to the giant that is simone yetch um but this uh i guess i would encourage you if you want to have a little beauty in your life um and um enjoy creative and artistic uses of technology i would certainly encourage you to get one but you can also just kind of watch me fumble my way through trying to program it so let's take a look at it i unboxed it last week and right here if i hold this up to the camera let's see if it'll focus focus focus people you can't see there's a usb port and i believe there's some sort of arduino or something in it so project number one i can't believe i'm gonna do this on live stream is i'm gonna try to mount it to the wall like right about here right that way you can see it behind me as i'm trying to program it well it's a good idea i mean i could probably save the fact that it's gonna just like i could probably just like put it on the table and put the camera on it and save myself like an hour of pain because i meant to mount it this morning but it's a beautiful day i went to the park with the kids we did some bike riding played some catch uh kept good physical distance away from everybody else wore our masks and i didn't get back from that trip to the park until about uh 2 45 p.m about 45 minutes between i needed to start live streaming and my children they like to use this setup that i have here to play roblox so i had to like find all my equipment plug it all back in get the camera set up so i had no time none whatsoever but um apparently so apologies in advance but let's let's see if we can i i need your i need your support here like this is me doing the thing that i am most afraid of which sounds a little bit weird but coding is a thing that i'm comfortable with now i mean it's confusing it's tricky to have a hard time with it i am not good at mechanical physical things but it has these wonderful keyholes in them and i have this whole i found in my basement i went down to the basement um i'm a person with an attic and a basement there's also like a little bit of space to live in between those two things and i got where is it i have this i really should need to get this camera working hold on we're going to get this camera working uh we might not just have to do it again the silly thing that i for some reason keep having to do where i make it oh wait is it working no i make it first i make it this and then i put it back to this there you go so there's the calendar so i have these so i have some screws i have some anchors i also have a drill so first thing first though what's wonderful about this is it comes with your very own like guide and the guide has the keyhole spots and i even have a level a level of the thing so where's that level i saw it so what do i do now i get like a little like i got a sharpie do i poke my right little if i do this like what about here is this good let me go back to the larger camera like about here this is good now i should move it over i'm going to put it in the middle actually i'm going to put it here i mean i'm not going to measure centering it and then that's not level now that's about level now how do i write with a sharpie through the paper is that a thing you can do maybe i get something to poke it poke it there'll be a little mark in the wall oh but but but i can't reach anything because i'm holding it there oh i could get some tape i got an idea i have tape look at the level doesn't seem to be there anymore i have gaff tape oh no no no no no i moved it okay everything's gonna be okay people this is literally what you're watching just just maybe go go if if you live somewhere it's beautiful out and you have a mask and you can be appropriately distanced from people maybe go do that and come back about four or five hours i might have like got the screw in the wall possibly it's side project saturday here i should probably play some music while i'm doing this because what's hilarious is how i'm trying to make it level and yet i'm doing basically nothing else that any normal person would do okay that looks like a good spot now i could just get myself a piece of tape no i turned it okay okay maybe i shouldn't worry about it being level so much wait let me get the piece of tape first if we if we get the piece of tape first i could just screw through the hole marks that's such a good idea oh because i have a drill i'm gonna use a drill okay but first i need to tape it to the wall i want it to be level this is also just a temporary place for it because i don't think this is a good place to have it in my house um i'd rather have it somewhere where it could be seen more often although i guess it's nice to have it behind me if i'm live streaming but not if i brought up the green screen okay so now now let's do a little simulation this is known as one of the things i like to program are simulations and i'm now doing a simulation of me programming the everyday calendar and you can see it behind me there right so that should work okay we know that breaking breaking news breaking news breaking news straight from the discord chat cutting trade members simon said we know the kind of arduino it's an arduino pro or pro mini and i guess if i go to get lab um if i go to get lab.com simone yetch um this would be good because i've never used git lab and this will be a nice experiment to try to learn that as well um we'll be able to start to program it all right now i got to get my drill all right i need to have various emergency numbers available case anything goes wrong do i need anchors i don't know i thought i should put some anchors in the wall generic drill from generic unnamed nonsponsor company okay can you i assume you can still hear me even though i'm away from the microphone electricity okay now if i'm going to use where where is my where was that thing where i had the screws and the anchors where did i put that why can't i keep track of anything i just had it in my hands two seconds ago where did it go hmm literally headed my oh there it's on the floor okay all right so if this what do we think um maybe the me the middle one i think i'm gonna go for the middle one i mean i don't think i need something that huge right um oh this cam this is ridiculous this camera is like useless why do i even bother i wonder if so sad i don't know why i was having such a problem um the whole point of this setup that i had was to have this camera that was going to make it much more interesting and entertaining let's try it one more time this is very frustrating you can see my professional operation here as i mentioned um if i just like so i think what i'm going to use are one of these with this so i just need a hole in the wall like here and it goes in and then i screw the screw in yeah what do we think people now the question is what size drill bit maybe somebody can help me with this i literally never do something so not handy i aspire to be handy and i just am so not i can't i can't even open this okay hold on oh i by the way i've totally lost okay so these are the drill bits uh what do we think is that the right one no like more like this right or do i need to go bigger i have no idea how do i know well maybe i'll just try a smallish one like this it probably works right what do we think i like in the chat i'm noticing somebody saying talking about mongoose and javascript which is so far from what i'm doing right now okay so i'm going to put this drill bit in i think the way that i do that is i take this i put it in here and then i tighten this right this right okay um okay so now i'm going to try to make a hole shut anybody want to tell me to stop doesn't look very level to me at all believe this i still had time leveling it look i mean where's my left so i should have taped it on the edges clearly this is a temporary location so i'm not too worried use the leveling app in my phone that's interesting all right here we go there's no way this anchor is going to fit into that hole i'm going to need a much bigger uh drill bit or a smaller anchor i think i think that anchor is a good size so let's get a larger drill bit let's see what time you stop size of the bit should be written on the mounting things that's interesting this says 6x30 is that what it says oh you can't see that 6 x 36 i can't so let's get a larger drill bit and this says it has something written on i just can't see it 38 i think it says 38. so hard to read let's try it this really shouldn't take this long i was gonna do this this morning this is a great live stream i'm enjoying the chat all right let's try this i think that might be the right size it looks kind of like this could fit in there am i supposed to get like a hammer and like hammer it in probably i mean i guess i should take let me do the other hole okay two holes i do have a hammer this might be more of a hammer than i need 16 ounce rubber mallet is what this is i think i need a bigger hole i think my hole is not big enough i gotta go one more bigger or just like wiggle it around look at this which size is this so small let's try this one oh there's 410 people watching this and i i don't even have my camera set up in such a way that you can see me this is the everyday this is a very weird i like that uh uh three darius costa right this is a really weird coding challenge it certainly is you can see how how incompetent i am i'm gonna feel so accomplished if this actually is hung on the wall by the end of this live stream it should really just like slide right in there shouldn't it because then when you screw the screw in it expands so i i'm just afraid to like drill a huge hole where are the yes this is the home improvement show i'm sure my sponsors are going to be thrilled to have selected this episode um you know this is called incremental develop this is how i do software i incrementally make small changes like seriously all right we're just going we're going all in going all in here's the largest drill bit i have push it in push i'm supposed to push it in oh look at that marcos did some fancy like photoshop i think at this point i need to just really get it in there by pushing it in there we go got it anchors away all right anchor number one is in let's finish this hole something bad happened anchors away anchor number two is in there this is this is things are looking up people now i just need to put these screws in now should i be doing this with a screwdriver or should i get some sort of uh i have like the things that are the screw things that go on the drill i'm not really sure let's try doing it by hand first oh here's another here's a regular regular hammer here okay so now what i have are i really hope i get to the arduino part of this where's my screwdriver i don't know where i put it out here it is what are these things called these things have a name i have no idea what they're called they're like the thingies that go on the thingy top thingy um small drill i only that's the only drill i have so let's try let's look which size this is looks like that fits it well most these all seem to fit it i don't know what's best let's try this one i can't get it out there we go so i'm going to put this here and then used to go let's see all right now we are going to screw this in now how far out of the wall does it need to be in order for the thing to hang on it that's my question and i'll switch this so you can see not that you can see this really up close but like it's got to be sticking out right so it just stick out like a small bit i guess the amount that's on the calendar um whereas i put the calendar i can't find i didn't think that they i was too tall for the camera once i'm doing this i guess you know what here i can sit then you i can you can see me and i can just wheel my chair over here and i could talk to you in my home improvement show like this but it's a little bit harder to screw the wall from down here all right let's let's stop it there so it's about yay out of the wall and i need one more to go into uh now i need this one all right i have to stand up sorry people then i have a costume change because i actually got a tshirt also with the everyday calendar i feel like i should change into that tshirt to really go you know whole hog with this live stream do need to do my sponsor segment soon is it four four twenty two oh no no no i started at 3 30. i haven't hit an hour i was confused i thought four o'clock was the hour but i'm good okay so the question now is how far should these go in because when i get the calendar which i don't know how we put it over here right if we look at this oh you don't see that i bet you the camera's not gonna be working anymore i think every time i switch away from it yeah every time i switch away from the camera it like when i come back to it it's not working i don't know if this is an obs problem might be an obs problem um so i don't know how far in but let's just try it i have to take my hat off because i cannot see with my hat on where i'm putting it in monkey holes i can find you come on keyhole see you there we go oh it's a little bit out of the from the wall i think i did a pretty good job i think i might have done it i don't think it's gonna fall i think i got it all mounted on the wall huh oh my god oh i love it i feel like i feel like this i hope everybody's just sharing this haul on social media with simone yet i'm sure she's gonna be really thrilled uh okay all right uh here we go all right we're gonna start programming it we gotta start programming it i gotta clean up um give me a minute to uh clean up and enjoy the um polar cartesian song i'm gonna say once again here we go coordination wait i have to put the plug in and the usb cable should i've done that before i put it on the wall probably coordinates how about um as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop just stop i'm gonna leave this stop this stop this this stock stop get stopped this stock will stop i just stopped this dot this dot song never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i plugged it in oh oh that just lit up i don't know how much you can see that it just lit up um can you see this is another thing i didn't really think of which was why it'd be great to have this camera working but i have another camera hold on let's some um bruno is saying obs has an option deactivate when not showing i wonder if that's what has been selected so let's go to this um drawing view it's called drawing because that's what i uh look at and then if i go to the properties of the i piezo camera i don't see defaults deactivate and it's not a live picture right now configure i mean uh where is that property um oh whoa now that just going to the properties and then hitting okay reactivated it so that makes sense where is that property i don't know where that property is um but anyway uh what was i why was i oh because i could do this and it's upside down but potentially i could get a better view of it um like this you could see the uh the light the ring light reflecting in it that's not a thing that i thought about although you know i might prefer to have that off right now well i'm quite in the dark but it's better for seeing this why is it look like it's so not level okay let's see if i can do that that's better you can see it better and in fact what i could do here is continue to crop it even more um and then make that a little bit bigger for you so like for example like this there you go i can move myself like here and here we are okay so now the property should be under properties in the camera source and just under configure video should be a check box right there saying deactivate when not showing so i'm going to go to properties in the camera source and then just under configure video no deactivate when [ __ ] when not showing is not selected so i don't know why that's happening all right this is good my setup is pretty good it's a little bit i do have this light so if i want it to be a little brighter myself i suppose i could turn this light on and i could put it like here um that way there's a light on me oh it's kind of in the shot um there's a bit of a light on me but you're still able to see the calendar pretty well and i should be able to uh touch these so what's be wonderful about this is if you push and hold they turn on and off so the idea is that if there's something i want to do every single day oh god and of course the camera is not shoot i just rolled that over my foot why why camera why must you torture me it's so weird that update it no jeez this is making me crazy why does nothing ever work configure yeah then of course now i have to like do you think it's like a loose connection whoa and why oh i ain't just in a different place now i wonder if it's you know what i have an idea i have this plugged in through this usb hub and maybe the usb hub is a problem so i'm actually going to unplug this camera oh i don't think i can reach this cable is not long enough i do have usb extenders but the whole point of the usb extender so i was going to use it for the everyday calendar shoot do i have more than one usb extender i don't know that i do should have brought more than one usb extender um what's this oh this is a usb what else is plugged in here no okay i have an idea i have a good if you will bear with me what's plugged in here the microphone all right it's too much stuff plugged in everywhere let's just try a different usb port on this hub maybe this port is bad let's try unplugging this apologies for all this technical difficulty but i'm gonna hope now aim the light source at the ceiling oh i don't have i do have a white i have a tin i'm in an attic with a like angled tin ceiling if i had confidence in this camera i would show it to you um thank you for your lighting suggestions um let's see if this works i do have another webcam so i think what i'll do is if this continues to give me trouble i'll just use a different webcam but if you want to see the ceiling this is i'm in an attic and that's the tin ceiling of the attic uh i would show you the rest of this attic but it's such a mess it's all just piles of stuff everywhere all right now here we are so what i should be able to do now is this usb cable you know what i don't necessarily need the extender it's pretty long although i i that's kind of awkward to wrap it around like me like this so let me get the extender so that we don't have a crisis oh and oh it's four it's four three i gotta take my sponsor break in a minute um i don't even have arduino installed on this computer so this should be interesting to see what happens now i've got this usb cable so i'm going to take a short break and then we're going to have the rest of the time to really program this thing but let me at least get it plugged in and see if we can see that it shows up i'll try to get that much through okay so now what can i do here to be super fancy with my setup so if i go to here right this is me and i think what i'm going to do now look at this add the um add video capture device that's what i'm adding right the this webcam and then now i can uh crop around it what layout magic is this so hopefully now you see me here that's the camera that's it by i guess i could have put it i didn't need to put it behind me i could have put it on the wall over there if i'm just gonna like but i like that it's behind me okay all right coffee coffee time checking the chat uh this is really really fun i'm so excited about this um i'm gonna have to take a quick break in a second let me make sure these properly show up it's not working here we go course my stream deck is no longer working so strange yeah everything has to break all at once um let me just move this o back down here um there we go that's what i was trying to check all right i'm going to do this stuff manually all right so now what do i need to do connecting the everyday okay so first i need to get this to download the firmware and schematic files run the following command so this i know how to do because it's stuff that i do all the time i'm in the software phase where i'm a bit more confident than all of this hardware and hanging stuff so let's go to the desktop let's clone that repo what oh let's clone that repo and there it is now let's open up my desktop and i've got it let's go to um and let's uh open it up in visual studio code so i can see what's there so there's all sorts of images and there's the schematics which is really these are pdfs so there's the license and the readme and firmware sketches so it looks like there are various things that i can test running on it but i'm going to want to program my own stuff for it my goal by the way is to be able to walk in front of it and have it be a mirror of me so as i like move my body around i'll see myself reflected a la um danny rosen's wooden mirror if you're not familiar with this is a piece by danny rosen from 1999 um which has a whole bunch of wood uh chips that uh move on servo motor motors down and up down and up and right there in the center is the camera although now he uses a connect a depth sensor with it um and it reflects when they're pointed up there's a light pointed down it reflects the light when they're pointed down they're dark so i want to do something similar and i think dare i say i know who this person is but anyway um moving along okay open the arduino ide what's the chance that i have arduino installed on this computer nope so uh arduino little known fact the arduino ide is based on the processing ide so what do i do get the oh am i supposed to use arduino create now is that something new or um there's a web editor can't maybe i just want the i'm afraid to use the web editor can i still get the downloadable what's the what's happening these days let me go to idb.nyu this is the program where i teach there's a physical computing class uh let's see what they're supposed to do in this class uh syllabus lessons let's do class one um say i'm break board i don't know if there's an arduino yet uh class two microcontrollers the basics uh yeah microchips microchips arduino adreno arduino there we go arduino adreno am i supposed to use the web thingy does that not exist anymore the ide that you download and run i'm looking at the chat now uh we're discussing whether you should arduino create or the arduino app um i don't i don't know that i need to do a poll i just want to use i want to use the app because i feel like i'm more going to be more comfortable with that but i don't see where i get that downloads okay sorry it's really obvious i should just get it here i'm gonna download this um i i i do think it's meaningful to contribute but i'm not going to right now uh later okay this is downloading all right 42 seconds left i can work on my rubik's cube a little bit while i'm waiting first you make the daisy that's my favorite part because daisy is a pretty flower then i make the cross somehow i made the daisy perfectly without not intentionally then i do the edges do the download nope can i can i uh can i manage to solve this before um before it finishes downloading probably not oh there we go do love a good rubik's cube um now i'm going to do the second layer the download it's still downloading more of the second layer won't be winning any competitions anytime soon other than the coolest dad award and here we go still working on the second layer have i downloaded all right we'll come back to this rubik's cube i've got you i've got i've got gotten pretty far here but gotta get back to this arduino stuff um now let's open up the arduino did i mention my mug has math formulas on it uh there we go i'm gonna use the app god this ipad that has all my music and sound effects on it is about to die um let's see so now uh what do i do open this up oh i did that already maybe put this in applications maybe put the arduino as like a thing here that i could click on and run it all right arduino is an app download from the internet are you sure you want to open it yes so now this is what's based on the processing id i mean it looks quite similar let's make the font size a little bit bigger that's way too big let's try with 24. okay so all right pausing for a minute here let's say you're kind of new to this and you're lost just new to this being new to this live stream i have something called the everyday calendar it is a a beautiful calendar made and built by simon yetch you can order it online i got mine through kickstarter you can still get them it has a it is it is an amazing feat of engineering and design that i won't go into and you can learn more about it but it has an arduino in an arduino is a microcontroller you know a miniature computer essentially has a bunch of pins and things it gets electricity it sends electricity in and out you can write code that runs on it and the code that you run on it is c code so this might be a momentous occasion it could possibly be the first time that i'm writing c code on the coding train ever i don't know if that's true the coding train historians is there a coding trait historian there's a opening coding train historian uh so uh next uh simon is giving me thankfully some tips here next up so anyway so what i want to attempt to do is write some code that i will then put onto the arduino board in there to make my own patterns or run my own software on there and i'm about to take a short break just because i've been streaming for about an hour and 15 minutes so far um and then i've got then i'll come back and spend another hour i might spend quite a while trying to get this to work so that's where i am um and here we go open uh what do i do now tools what am i looking for board arduino uno select the board okay board is arduino pro pro mini so i have to select that i don't see that as an option is it auto detecting it by any chance well let's look at the instructions because there were nice instructions select the board arduino pro is right there prower pro mini okay okay tools serial monitor sketch tools board how come i don't see it board manager do i have to get more oh this is like a thing that i like add other boards i'm so lost i've never done this this looks like by the way the web one maybe i should go back to the web one because i'm not seeing it show up here my mouse was right over it the whole time i'm looking at it i see it i see it by the way i'm known in my family as the person who can't find anything like i'll literally be like where are my keys where are my keys i can't let my keys they're like right in front of my face i give by the keys so apparently this happens also here you know you're live streaming it's a hard thing it's very awkward you feel like stupid all the time arduino pro or pro mini got it finished next step configure the processor and clock speed to atmega328p all right i have no idea what that means processor oh it looks like it's already set to that oh no wait i don't remember what it was thr at mega328p 3.38 3.3 v 8 it's this one so configure it to that okay got that installing arduino's library is copy the contents of this repository's firmware to the library's directory on your computer's arduino libraries folder okay so what i'm looking for is in here this folder needs to go to documents arduino libraries so this looks like uh all the libraries that are here i need to install them here so now oh except i don't wanna i don't want a folder called libraries inside of libraries i just want this so i'm gonna move this back get rid of this it's a good sign okay done that to test and see if the custom libraries are working can run our sample code provided in the firmware sketches directory simply upload one of the sample code files into the calendar using the arduino ide open the serial monitor and set the baud rate to 9600. all right you ready for this you ready for this okay uh here we go um so arduino open desktop uh everyday calendar sketches which one do i which one do i run our sample code upload one of the sample code files everyday calendar let's do that one i guess i kind of want to run this one that's called test i feel like that feels like that's useful let's run the test one so this is the test one uh it does some stuff oh you can set an led based on the month and the day to true or false oh well if there's like an api for doing this i might actually be able to succeed here let's see if this works so then i need to open the serial monitor is that a thing tools because that's going to show me like board at null is not available that's not a good sign how do i know if the board is actually being detected that's a bad sign it's plugged in right this is plugged in this is plugged in oh boy this is going to be really sad what happens if i just do this verify okay so that verified the code but this is like the upload serial port oh no wonder i gotta select the serial port there we go so there we go did it just do a test pattern i sort of thought maybe it did something wait no that's just like a shadow whenever i turn my head all right hold on let's go to the serial monitor there we go oh error uh okay hold on wait what am i what's going on here i don't understand how any of this stuff works but let's do this oh something's happening it's doing stuff yes that was cool all the lights are on except for the 30th interesting how the 30th is all off do i have a defective one or is that a mistake in the code um let's how do i do it again i don't want this serial output is like feels like i don't necessarily need to see it this feels much more important to me so if i were to run it again i it's uploading it uploading it's just running is it let's try it again all right i'm uploading the code it's a feature says dave how long does it take for it to get there there's a lot of waiting involved with this arduino programming upload i know that upload sends it to the board so conceivably there would be a way right i can see sketch started and it said sketch setup started program touch controllers now it's doing some stuff and then it's turning on all the lights except for 30 and awesome okay so let's try let's just try one more um test we're gonna try um you know actually i'm gonna program the game of life on this let's start with that that's what i should really do programming test what's that rear test there's a rear so what does this do oh this is just kind of like a basic beginner let's let's go to um there's programming tests uh front test let's try this one let's see what this does this must be the actual i was assuming this was the software let's fade them honey drip start up animation whoa this is wild okay let's verify this okay let's upload it there's a reset button on the board okay oh there we go awesome and then fades out awesome all right oh awesome this is great this should this i can work with why do i see what's this error message like why is this error message showing up just over and over again after it finishes doing what it did i wonder all right all right everybody this was a good first half of this live stream i'm gonna do something that i have never done before or maybe i've done it once um i have two sponsors to thank uh for today's uh coding train um episode um and let me get myself set up to do that it's going to give me i'm going to take about a few minutes to do that then i'm going to take about a five minute break and i'm going to come back to with the calendar so let me start with and if you'll give me a second here i muted myself for a second to shout downstairs okay so um first i want to tell you about notion um notion is a productivity software software that breaks the mold by combining all essential work tools notes docs databases tasks and more in one place so you get more done now i actually started using notion recently um it's it's kind of actually amazing as even just a publishing platform but most notably and hopefully late in the future i'll get to sort of play around with the apis you can create databases in it and so um let me just show you some of the notion stuff this is what the notion desktop software looks like but what i've been using it for is keeping track of a database of everybody who joins the coding train so you see sort of like i have everybody's name what level they are whether they've received their stickers or not and various things like that so it's finally getting me to keep organized it's a great way to collaborate you can have a team um personal plans used to be five dollars a month but now you can get a personal plan for free forever and free users will be able to add as many blocks as they like to their personal notion database one of the things that's kind of amazing about notion that i've also recently discovered is that tens of thousands of students are using it for class notes managing tasks organizing job applications you know i'm a teacher and so it's sort of interesting always for me to follow what kind of tools are helpful for teaching and for studying and for notetaking you can find out more at notion.so students it's also great for the office it's been used by the wall street journal verizon and even pixar wow you can create a company wiki answer questions at scale on board new employees track every project catalog there's a lot of templates in there that are designed specifically for students and educators so this is probably most of the audience that you might be interested in and you can all be added to your workspace with one click when you hit duplicate at the top right corner i also want to quickly show you um what it looks like on mobile i end up checking on mobile a lot like well i don't ride the subway too much anymore because we're in a global pandemic but when i was riding the subway i would always be like checking like well what's the latest thing what do i need to do helps keep me organized as i kind of commute to and from um different places so it's really got a nice um elegant app so again i uh would encourage you to check it out um you can go right to bitly notion coding train if you sign up there let's let me know you know that you found the coding train helps me out a little bit thank you very much it's definitely appreciated um and i'd love to hear what you think of it so that is notion thank you so much to notion for sponsoring the coding train it really makes all this like weird nonsense stuff that i do possible i also today's live stream is also sponsored by brilliant so brilliant um as you've probably noticed before on the channel i've referred to on many an occasion i've kind of like looked up stuff in there i've tried their puzzles i've done coding challenges that have some same content um so many things that i've done with brilliant it's like it's really nice like if you want to learn something new um brilliant is the place to do it it's a website and an app it makes learning accessible and fun it's all problemsolving it's all interactive so rather than this thing that i do which is these kind of like sequence tutorials where i'm talking at you and showing things this is a thing that you can really kind of do at your own pace and interact with um one of my favorite they have a whole lot of like daily puzzles and challenges but they also have all these courses and so my one of my favorite courses on there is the one on neural networks um i always look at this and review it before i teach neural networks in my class uh just kind of go through and kind of look at and just some of the ways that the interactivity and the visualizations has been designed are really just um super effective and and clear so the other thing that i should mention is that they have a brand new course um on infiniti and i started this course last week on the live stream um so reckoning with infinity is one of the major accomplishments of mathematics it's like you know basic counting if you try to count a lot you'll not get to infinity but you'll be working your way up to there and there's many types of infinity and the profundity of cantorus theorem is a thing that you can kind of discover the stunning beauty of fractals tessellations in hyperbolic space if you're interested in any of these kinds of things this course um goes through and covers quite a bit of it so i really would encourage you and again i i always have so much fun one of my favorite things and simon pointed that out to me is that show explanation button um i really love to try to figure something out with and brilliant i often get it wrong and then i can click the show explanation and there's you know usually something sort of official by maybe somebody on the brilliant staff but also just a ton of uh community contributions to um different things there as well so i hope you consider um checking out brilliant um you can sign up for free at if i can get this right um what no all these buttons uh come on buttons no here button there we go you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um and then you'll be access to a lot of the features in the daily puzzles but if you want to unlock everything that brilliant has to offer all of its courses um you can sign up for a premium subscription if you go through this link you will get um 20 offer at least the first 200 people who do through that link will get 20 off i also think it's a really nice gift not the holiday season just yet but it's something that i've been considering is giving people like a year membership to brilliant as a gift which i think um you know we all have too much stuff and we all use screens too much and this is like something in the middle it's a it's a using screens in an educational way and it's not like stuff that you have to then throw away later so um i hope you check that out notion and brilliant thank you mwah for sponsoring the coding train a train whistle for both of you um if you want to check those out i'm going to take a five minute break you can go sign up at those links and i'll be back trying to write this actual arduino code for the everyday calendar in about five minutes oh no oh no we've got a problem houston we have a problem can you still hear me um here's the problem uh this ipad which i usually um play my music on the battery died you do have a usb cable uh charger question is and i like to play oh you know what i can do i got an idea so let's let me unplug it from this oh oh that might have given you some awful sound in your ear apologies in advance let me plug this in to charge it i really am a mess today total mess but if we can if we can get game of life running on this i'm gonna be just so happy the tricky thing will be like how do i know what's who's neighbor it's not like a obvious pixel grid i guess i can think of the months as the rows the columns sorry in the days that's the column so actually this might not be as hard as i think um so what was i doing i'm charging up the music and then what i can do is i can just play the music directly from uh coding train uh soundcloud there it is so this is random this is noise noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all i'm thinking numbers seven six one nine four eight nine two one three let's take another lot of problems few minute break with curling noise i might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six well this is like pearl and noise performance art performance seven five six seven five purling noise that is pearly noise so this is hurling noise that is pearly noise this is this is hurling noise that is pearly noise so this is hurling noise that is pearly noise that is pearly noise so this is hurling noise that is pearl this is this is i might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stock this stock i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop this dot this dot this never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me firework is not defined in line six uh yep as always i always forget that this stock this stock this stuff i'm going to do this this dot this dot this this dot song never forget to this dot somebody composed that song for me uh okay is all right i'm back sorry about the um loud uh noises there uh the loud sound um i didn't want to take too long of a break because i really want to get going with this and see if i can manage to is this live oh it's still now now it's actually working okay if i can get this to really do what i want it to do all right so i assume that some of you out there much more experience with the arduino that i did than i do um and but i'm just gonna do my best i'm gonna try to i think what i'll first do let me just see if i can individually address every single one of the dates and turn it on and off on my own um so that way i'll like understand if i can really work with this so it looks like i'm importing i'm guessing this is c code where i'm importing importing these libraries um oh you're not seeing that so let me go back to here so um looks like and i think i can i guess i'm just i'm just working in arduino now so let me move this over um and why why why this is camera no no no this way i want you to see it perfectly there we go all right i'm going to now do save as and i'm going to save this as test pattern everyday calendar so looks like oh first what i do to talk to it is set up serial begin 9600 this runs some initialize led functionality begin let's keep the startup animation that's useful to see and this is fading them out i guess this does all the lights so a way to address all the lights is through set brightness so but i'm going to take that out right now i don't want to do that i'm not going to worry about the touch functionality because i think i can work with that later this is fading them in and that's uh yeah so now what i want to do boy this is like caltouch x boy is there maybe there's some documentation that i can read here in the library uh or am i just meant to figure this out um okay so let's actually let me just do something i don't want to worry about the button stuff now so i'm going to get rid of all that forget about the button stuff let's forget all about that for a second uh this look cal light set led month adjusted day month day offset what the what is that is this like how many extra days there are in each month or how many fewer days fewer days in february oh that's kind of cool okay so this is doing them one at a time turning all the leds on so i do month day and true just turns it on so if i were to do something like you know what i want to just make my own startup animation is the point here so let me think about how i would do this um let me just try i just want to turn on one forget about the startup animation um and what happens if i just run this right now does this actually turn them on let's see like if i initialize the functionality i guess i need the serial monitor open to see what's being printed out sketch started sketch setup complete how can i get it so that you can see this effectively i think i'll just put this over here that's fine you can kind of see that oh that's not good can i do this this is kind of the best i can do right now so now let me just see can i do cal lights set led um month adjusted day true so if i said set led month i'm going to do gen is month j is zero or one zero so i wanna do i'm gonna do i'm gonna do my birthday which would be july which would be july 29th so july is seven but i assume it's six because january is zero true so if i run this then like serial print line happy birthday let me just make sure it's actually going the light go on oh yeah no oh july 30 it's june is that june july 30th is on can you see that it's on but it's so it's the 28th so let's try that again this is i don't think it's going to be nearly as hard as i thought it was going to be there we go it's on beautiful okay i know how to turn one on now if i do like delay a thousand that would be one second and then if i do false that's going to turn it off so it should be on just for one second we're watching did you see that let me show you that again that was so exciting the 29 is going to go on and it's going to go off i can do anything i want there's nothing i can't program here i could make a server that talks serially to the arduino i put the arduino on the internet and like i have people type things into the chat there's so much i could do i have a twitter bot oh my goodness discord chat bot so many possibilities all right let's start small so to do the camera interaction i would need a processing sketch and have processing talk serially to the arduino so i think that's uh let me that that i got to save for later i don't know if i'll be able to do that of today um the game of life is definitely possible is there a simpler well first actually what i want to check is can i set the brightness of an individual led where do i find the like api docs for this do they exist i mean i'm fine with just turning them on and off but i would love to know if um i suppose i could just look here like this is what i'm looking at lights like if i look in the dot h file with is that kind of like self documenting in a way set led toggle led set brightness so i don't think doesn't look like i can set oh toggle is great it doesn't look like i can set all an individual brightness i can only set the brightness of all of them like so for example this set brightness is 200 the highest 200. i assume that's the highest can i make it higher let's turn it to 11 1100 what's gonna happen dvd logo bouncing that's pretty great let's do a bouncing ball let's just think of it as a pixel grid yeah let's do bouncing just so i understand let's do so that um well i can't tell if that's it i'm assuming 200 is the brightest so i think i can only set the brightness globally but i can turn them on and off and we have this point i don't understand how do i make can i make a so then or do i this do i do this how do i do i don't know how to program on the arduino in c uh uh do i do that it has an x and a y how do i make how do i use structures in c oh this is so embarrassing it's not embarrassing structure in c structure structure structure yeah so show me how to make one struct books book and then i copied something into it that's weird int book book id okay great i see so it looks like i can just use it almost like an object so i can say do i do it where can i make that struct point um oh i'm not showing my screen thank you everybody ah i should just i'm gonna leave it here apologies i'm gonna leave it here i'm so sorry so sorry um all right struct point uh ball ball dot x equals zero ball and then hold on then it's i'm gonna say ball dot x equals zero ball dot y equals 0 and in loop i'm going to i think i also need i'm going to need the previous location i mean it would make sense ultimately for me to just make a generic arduino sketch that p5 can just send it an x a y and a um an estate and then um because i can do so much more coding in p5 in terms of algorithms but this is good let me explore learning how to write some of these algorithms just in arduino and then actually like it doesn't have to be tethered the game of life is going to be awesome i think on it so but let's do the bouncing ball first just as practice so now what i want to do is i want to take this and i want to let's take this out so we're going to do in loop we're going to always set previous x previous y to false and then ball x and ball y to true and then can i just say ball previous equals ball or that's going to load it's going to be like pointer issues so i think i just need to say previous x equals ball x previous y equals ball y and i'm just going to do right now ball dot x plus plus so this should be like a little animation of the of just going across the top like it should start at the top left and should go across to the right and eventually die okay point after struct that's not how you do it so i have to sneeze so what did i do wrong here about how i um how i declared my struct can i just do this yeah i guess i just do that is it it's going like super fast because i didn't put a delay in like loop like if i wanted to be like a 30 frames per second animation then like uh 30 frames per second um would be um what's the delay uh between frames we want to get in one second we want 30 of them so like do a delay of like 33 milliseconds is that what i want it's still gonna be super fast yeah it went across did you see it okay so now i need a speed oh why is speed highlighting um that seems weird let's just use like velocity and we'll say velocity.x equals one velocity.y equals one i should make these floats how do can i just do this this float a thing um and then i can actually have like smaller numbers and then i can say i'm like remaking the nature of code here um and then what i i can convert these to like an integer right so that should work let's see what happens here let's see what i get did you see that it went sort of like jiggling down so now if um if ball dot x is greater than equal to 12 or ball dot y ball dot y is less than or equal to zero no sorry ball dot x then velocity dot x times equals negative one and then y let's just let's just say 30 and have that so i'm gonna bounce it off the edges and let's see if this works okay no match for oh you can't that's not or how do i do or in c or in c operators or logical logical or yeah what did i do do i need like the parentheses around everything it like just want more parentheses yeah i guess that's it i think it just it's not as flexible as javascript let's try this i don't think it bounced wait hold on expected oh whoops see if it starts bouncing [Laughter] it's kind of fun so it doesn't really care if i try to give it spots that don't exist so i could do the game of life and just consider this a total square uh yeah but yes i see that i've already i'm uh the problem is the chat's like 30 seconds behind me but thank you for correcting me i don't know what if this light is making it should be darker here for you to see it i guess this light is fine on me um cool okay now let's just go full on game of life okay uh this is dedicated to the mathematician john conway who famously hated the game of life but who created the game of life let's just um let's just get that to work so i think what i'm going to do is just grab my processing code for so let me do save as um and i'm going to call this game of life oh my god i have a brilliant idea i can add the touch stuff so you can like put on a pattern and have it go up there's a cat there might be a cat appearing soon in this live stream okay um all right so let's now so let me look for my game of life coding challenge um let's go to here and let's look at the you know i should look at the processing code because the processing code is going to be closer um to what i'm doing here so what good news is i don't need to worry about this resolution thing so this is stuff that i need so if you don't know what the game of life is i probably should take a minute to explain it uh for those of you who are watching let me go to this version this is a p5.js sketch running this particular pattern it's known as a cellular automata which i always say wrong and everybody's told me a million times come here well the cat ran away um and um what it is is it's a system where of a it's a grid much like the calendar is a grid and every cell of the grid is on or off in this case the on or off or alive or dead is visualized with a white square versus a black square and whether it's on or off uh is determined by the configuration of its neighbors in a previous moment in time so the idea is cells that are surrounded by life come to life cells that are not surrounded by life die out but if there's too much life around it it's overpopulated and it also dies out so basically you're looking for cells that have two you know two or three there's exact rules for it and i have those in the code all right they're not um so basically if i we can see them right here if i am a cell that state is zero i'm dead and i have exactly three neighbors alive then i turn on if i am alive or my state is one and i have less than two too few neighbors or more than three too many i turn myself off otherwise i stay with what i was before so in many ways this code should translate right over to arduino so let's go back to here and i just don't know how to do like twodimensional arrays and all that stuff in c but let's see if i can get it going now this is interesting to me am i supposed to when working with arduino really specify the kind of integer i want to use like into 16 is not like a 16bit integer or something it's not something that i usually think of let's get rid of the this stuff and let's see like 2d array in c 2d oh so this is easy not easy but i'm going to say int grid and the grid has 12 across and 31 and i'm just going to do the calculations as if there were spots for all months went to 31 and they just won't light up i assume um but i think that'll work the cat is no i the cat is like got a string and i really don't think the cat should eat that string oops sorry because if the cat eats that string then i might have to i could be very dangerous no no kitty don't eat the string okay oh there's another usb um hub okay sorry about that we've got to save the life of a cat it's very important arthur is saying i prefer to use pointers all right well i'll come back to that all right so now um so in the number of columns i mean can i do this i don't know um all right so now i need to if i go back to my processing code what i want to do is initialize them randomly to on or off so uh let's get rid of all this stuff now a lot of the api in arduino is the same as in processing so i'm kind of hoping this is just going to work and then i should be able to say and i shouldn't have deleted that because i want this whoops what did i just do ah where's my code that's right let me just keep this let me grab this and why not just try doing this these should be oh these should actually be boolean can i just do that i'll leave them as integers because then i could just set it to its state here well i'm gonna be ridiculous everyone's gonna hate me for this but i'm a little stubborn i'm gonna do it this way don't eat that string evie you're the most beautiful this is the most beautiful cat she's a calico cat she never comes out i don't think i've ever had her on a stream but now she's leaving the attic um let's see what this does array bound is not an integer constant so these have to be constants like that constant in maybe will that work ball was not declared oh i don't need any of this stuff now and i don't even need this let's try this so i should see just randomly that i've got a 50 chance of being on or off there we go perfect okay so that's my initial game of life state this isn't going to take very long awesome now let's go back and i've got the algorithm worked out here so basically oh and i need to have next all right so i need to swap so i also need to have next columns rows and in draw let's just grab the full processing code i apologize for well i don't apologize i think this is the way to do it you can watch the coding challenge if you want to see me code this all the way through so basically um i don't need this i'm going through all the columns i'm checking the state i need this count neighbors function which is just counting all the neighbors whether they're on or off i don't need this honey drip um oh this is this is this is different i need to do this i should probably be using pointers because then i can swap i'm not doing this right but let me just let me just try to get it to work and then i'll think about this can i do it like this oh this is weird uh grid equals net um temp equals grid can i do this grid equals next next equals grid this is like a swapping algorithm i need to swap them because i need to have the previous state and the earlier state and i want them to just swap those back and forth i have no idea if this is going to work and then i need the count neighbors function which i feel like i guess i would do this again this seems weird um it's got to be something seriously wrong here um yeah i should probably do this with pointers but let's see if this works i mean what error am i going to get all right invalid array assignment i mean another thing i could do is i could do what i was doing is just create a new one every time oh no no no no oh because this is written well let's try doing whoa what is going on how did i do this in processing i did this in such a weird way i draw all the grid that i make next i compute it based off of the grid got it and then i say grid equals next all right let's try that this is absurd but let's see if it'll let me do i mean this is like terrible memory management and on the arduino this actually matters like what if i were to just make a new array called next every time in loop which is a terrible idea and then i would say i would initialize all those values and then grid would just become next or should i copy it over next equals temp not next equals grid oh right of course so that but but let me try this weird silly way first no you can't just assign one of these to another you could copy i think i need to use pointers oh if i need a lesson in pointers mem copy int next okay right i got an idea i got an idea what if i do this and then i just say initialize them all to zero which i'm not sure is necessary then uh i take the grid and i do this and then i do this like i make this a pointer temp temp it points to grid next is going to be temp and then can i not do this grid becomes next this is what i feel like i want to do cannot convert int 31 to n should just be one star i don't know how to do pointers i've done this in so long int and reference okay people are telling me ptrh this is getting boring it's not like the old days it was bor it wasn't boring i have to copy uh try using a for loop to copy each yeah yeah that's what i think i would do not common in c because c is not a language made for it c doesn't have a deep copy all right i'm going to do it a very silly way because it's very little data and i'm just going to make three of them and i pre so i probably should just make it a single array and then compute the index but let's just initialize them all like this okay and then we're going to do this where we calculate what next is based on it and then i'm going to write a function copy next into temp grid uh hold on so what was i doing before if next is what i want next is the next state so i need to copy grid into temp and then actually i don't care i don't need to swap because i'm going to calculate it every value so i can just say copy next into grid that's it i don't even need temp why do i need temp i don't need temp am i wrong about that let's get rid of temp and then let's write a function called uh i'm going to just call it copy array copy array well what do i put as the arguments well i guess i'll just do it manually here so i don't have to make it into a function this is so silly right all i need to do now is say next i j a grid i j equals next i j and then it's and up here i just need to get rid of this and set all the lights based on based on whether it's on or off this should work let's see what happens low memory available stabilizability problems may occur global variables use 98 of dynamic memory i can use mem copy next grid rows dot columns that makes sense uh have i killed the arduino let's try this is it getting to here i'm a little concerned about this low memory static what does that do all right so i you know one d or i shouldn't use a 2d array this is very silly what i'm doing yeah i agree with violet um why am i not getting anything i don't see an error ooh i don't think i'm getting to i guess it's just not working all right oh okay well one thing is this is ridiculous i'm using like a huge integer to store a zero or one so i should go back to using a boolean right that's definitely one thing i should do and then also um so let's do a couple things one is let's make these onedimensional arrays is that how you make a onedimensional array in c and let's get rid of this let's not worry about loop right now let's take this let's let's i guess i have to think about memory on an arduino which i never have to do okay so now i'm making a onedimensional array i'm going to pick a random number there's got to be a correct way of doing this but um um equals true uh so let's do it this way so let's see if this works um all right let's see if this works this is going to make much more sense i'm only using 44 of memory that's good that's an improvement there we go got a random configuration again awesome so now i can make another array and first let me go through and set all of the lights to grid i plus j times columns let's make sure let's make sure this works and i see that it's looping oh do i have my columns and rows mixed up i plus j times columns no i'm doing it correctly looping okay now let's try figuring out equals state equals grid i plus j times columns this is not being used by the way count neighbors grid i j so i'll deal with that function if state uh if not state and neighbors is 3 it's true if state and neighbors is either of these then it's false otherwise it stays as state this should be the same copy it all over and then now count neighbors columns time rows xy column row no plus i can't add booleans so uh so if it's true sum plus plus and then i'm always taking out itself shoot um can i give it the state like what it's i must have it state yeah so then i can say after this if state sum minus minus because i don't want to count its own this loop counts everything and it also wraps around yeah it's like i'm doing some crazy stuff here to wrap around i forgot about that um you can add booleans true and false or just type defs for one and zero oh i did not know that well too late now cannot convert boolean to int star for where was that um do i know what line of code that is can i do the verify thing 88 where are the line numbers oh count neighbors grid ij state oh whoops there's some extra junk here so you're saying i can do this like this is something that i can do but let's not do it right now oh cannot convert boolean to oh no int int boolean ah there we go what am i doing wrong here violet says just use mem copy to copy the array yeah turn on line numbers and settings display line numbers okay thank you oh whoops 63 this is columns not rows okay uh 55 oh i have so many places where i'm still doing this okay cannot convert boolean aka bull to end i'm so confused about this argument here you know what all right let's get rid of this i don't need to pass in this state this is that's just lazy because i can just look up the state at x and y if grid x plus y times columns that should be the same thing right count neighbors sum is zero argument one to end count neighbors grid i i mean i could just do this up here i don't need a function grid is boolean thank you it's been this all along there we go tada all right i got it everybody there we go game of life on the everyday calendar i think it's the game of life looks right can we tell if this is right i should have given you a closer view of it i think that's right um i'm running it again it's not as visually apparent as i thought it might be i guess the grid the way the grid is laid out they're not like there's like a strange sort of spacing thing going on um let's see here i'm starting to get kind of tired it's almost six o'clock oh he's sleepy um let's see 12 31 i was thinking about this i think it's actually running i just do i still have a delay in loop oh i don't have the delay in loop anymore oh yeah it looks nice there because it's sort of smaller further away so what i would love to do is be able to touch it and then like effect one of the things and then it'll keep going turn down the other lights in my room okay turn this down i'm turning all the lights off in here um is it actually better like this where are um where's my phone because uh let's see here i'm gonna turn all the lights off in here okay everything's off now there's sunlight coming in here because it's still light outside so anything i can do with this that turns the light on that's interesting whoa did not mean to do that i probably could just see if i can make this look better darker yeah that's maybe a little better what's this one focus af lock i don't know what that does um all right let us now run it again i think if i kind of come back it'll focus more on me there we go john conway's game of life on the everyday calendar i mean if i just go to here no there's too much glare on it um i'm gonna block out the windows uh all right remove the print statement in the loop yeah i definitely need to do that is that slowing it down a lot the calendar also has a brightness setting i know i think i set it to the most to as bright as possible though 200. well there's nothing i can't have it do here the question is what and why should i have it too i want to get the touch thing working uh apparently random isn't random in arduino and you have to use random seed yeah draw the car there are no curtains i don't think i can change the led color but i can add the touch interface which i would really like to do so let's try that maybe there's a better pattern that i should have done but i think this is pretty good um but i don't know what this i need to like random seed like if i do that or something i'll get a different pattern snake game right i can definitely play a game right i'll make yeah enable a delay after the touch so you can touch several at a time yes that's exactly what i was thinking of doing uh says dave all right let's work on the touch um so let me go back to simone's code and let's go to the everyday calendar and basically i want to now add the touch aspect so if i say touch configure touch begin i don't care about the memory so i'm not going to worry about that let's add in in the configuration starting starting touch configuration uh and then i don't care about this do i need this delay or is that just to like i think that's okay i don't need that so point previously held oh boy handle a button touch if touch why do i care about all this i just want to know there's like a debounce counter interesting like i feel like the api should handle this for me uh so let's let's just try this like i just wanna i just wanna try something do i do this in draw like in loop like i always check this is in loop okay so handle touch interaction if touch like let's just let me just sort of see like if i can just say if touch let me just reset the whole board if there's a touch i'm going to reset the whole board otherwise otherwise i'm going to do the what you're going to call it the game of life algorithm so like if i just touch anything like what if i just touch anything um let's run this which will reset the whole board is that gonna work six o'clock people all right running this low memory why am i using more am i using more and more memory every time i upload it like is it is there a way i can clear it okay so it's running the game of life now in theory if i come over it by the way it's so beautiful in person i'm a little bit sad that you that i don't have a good camera shot of it um i'm gonna touch it so if i touch anything it's resetting it so that works don't use early don't else use early return this will make it slow um stop printing things people don't like me to print things all right fine uh all right so now if i touch x oh these are like specific things that you can touch to do things what if i don't care about a d bounce like what if i just do um like i turn the one i'm on and then i also say is it grid that i want to set here yeah grid touch dot x plus touch dot y times the number of columns equals true like what if i just do this let's see if this works oops request for remember y and touch which is oh that's not how i get cow touch it's called cal touch let's just try this i'm not worrying about debouncing it okay it's doing the game of i'm gonna let it sort of settle into usually the game of life will ultimately settle into a fixed state it could take quite a while actually instead of a delay try to make it start if you touch the first spot then you will have more control all right so it's really sad to be that you can't see this well um sun sunset uh all right yeah there we go look at that that is cool i mean if i just press once it's going to disappear so i think whoever suggested that i build in a delay makes a lot of sense um let's see could i just if i just even just add a delay here like if i just say hey wait like a second so i could press two maybe it's always doing the same pattern you're right how do i what's wrong with my random let's look at uh arduino brandon min max analog reads zero ah is it always an integer this is what's not clear to me long okay let's try that and then uh i don't think i need that floret does it need to be long let's try this okay that's a different pattern right have you memorized the pattern that it was before i have another webcam and i'm sort of tempted you know i could also just just out of curiosity like whoops not audio recording like what does the webcam here look like that's not really that's definitely not any better okay so now it has ended up in a sort of fixed configuration so i should be able to whoa what happened did this camera go off or it's just super dark what just happened did i lose this camera again yeah it looks like i did whoa oh i moved it around i guess um it's upside down isn't it flip does it help if i turn this light on all right let me go over here now i'm going to try to uh oh that what is wrong with this camera so annoying it's just like dying again sorry everybody i should really just get my other webcam nope wrong one and flip there we go all right hopefully it's going to stay so now i'm going to try pressing buttons on it i want to see if i can get two with the delay stop stop yeah so i'm not it i should really force it to wait um like a certain amount of time um or i could just like have one of these buttons down here always be like stop and start i think i have a i have an idea i have a sort of weird idea of the way that i want to handle this i don't know if this is a smart way of doing it but i hate having this delay here so i'm going to create a variable called interaction and it's false then i'm going to get a i'm going to create a variable that's like called now so if you touch it interaction is true if you touch it or interaction interaction is true and now is um if not interaction so the first time you touch it then we set the time now equals the current millis and then basically if millies minus now is greater than let's say like so i want to give myself like five five seconds i'm gonna give myself a lot of time five seconds then i can say uh interaction is false so this should allow me to continuously touch it as long and then if i haven't touched one for five seconds it should go and in fact let's see if this is true by actually having them all start well no let me just run it i was gonna have them all start off but let's see i don't know if i made any mistakes in there uh i definitely did millies minus now expected primary expression oh there's like an extra parenthesis there on line 59. okay all right let's try this let's see um and then i want to see if i can kind of get the lighting better in here uh all right so the game of life is going and i'm now gonna walk over to it ah it's so gorgeous oh and of course those cameras why why torturing me so ah i don't understand i i i hate this camera i i have a whole nother webcam i should try that other webcam and see what kind of picture i get from it because that would be better all right let's walk over to it now as lo if i touch one oh no it started going immediately it shouldn't have been able to go for five seconds and if this camera is just dead all right hold on i'm getting another webcam have another webcam here let's try where do not have a very long if i could get the code to work actually then i could get my usb extender um and i could i should just like hold it up but hold on let me try to get this to work i'm dealing with too many things right now um i do want the camera to work though so let's just go over here and uh fix that real quick interestingly you know what i should just do this is what i'm going to do excuse me for a second well i'm going to put this back i have i have an interesting idea here bear with me all right so what i actually want to do is just hide this and i want to go to video capture device and i just want to add this camera again so what i'm going to do especially if i'm sitting over here is i could turn off auto focus on the camera and then it won't be focused on me whoops what is this oh that's the live pole thing uh i mean this is kind of silly what i'm doing because it is the same view just blown up and the focus is not focused on it but at least you will now see it that's not really better anyway okay um is there a way i could get it to focus back there i mean i could turn off the autofocus all right let me get this to work why didn't this work so if interaction is true then don't do any of this calculation stuff and it's the first time we come in here an interaction is false we get the current time and then set interaction to true so any other time that we were here as long as it hasn't been five seconds interaction still has to be true i mean this doesn't have to be here this could always be checking uh i am wondering why i've got this wrong like was five seconds not like what if i did this like it shouldn't be able to get down here shouldn't be able to do this for at least 50 seconds if touch and interaction yeah but i don't know i don't know if touch when touch gets set to false so i appreciate that octopus um that is a very good suggestion anyway i gave myself 50 seconds now right so i should be able to touch it it shouldn't be able to do anything for 50 seconds yeah okay now it's working 50 seconds is a long time was five seconds just not enough i wish it wasn't so glarey i need like um i'm gonna work on i'm gonna move the k i'm gonna i'm gonna work on the camera stuff in a bit is millie's not correct it should start going at some point after has it been 50 seconds yet what did i just do by the way that made it super yeah if i stand like here i like i give it i just need to like oh i just need to put up it's the wind the sun coming in the window over here now it's going again so i think my code was right where how can i uh there we go i'm holding up okay yeah i'm blocking the uh the window now now minus millies so people are saying that if state means to check for now minus millies rather than millies minus now i don't believe that's true but i do believe that it should be unsigned long because those numbers can get really high um because oh and now interaction is false i don't think i need i'm never gonna get here um so i think this is good let's give myself let's go back to five seconds again and give myself another chance i do see how anytime touch is true this should get reset even if interaction is not false so that might be separating these two things out might be useful yeah actually here we go sorry i i this is like this or here is a problem so this is really what i want to do as long and this is just like as long as it's not interaction you can do all this stuff which is actually what i want to say else if interaction yeah this makes more sense so this makes more sense i think now because what i'm doing is i'm saying um if i if i touch it like that's a new moment so get the current time interaction is true if i'm not touching it like if it's been five seconds i haven't touched it then interaction can be false and then i can go on and do the animation i think this is better i think this is gonna be better let's give this a try i really have to go i don't want to turn this off because i want to do so many more things but um we've got a blinking light here thank you for the super chat jay it is getting darker finally so i feel like the good news of me taking a while to like finish streaming right so let's see so now i should be able to touch it and i've stopped it yep so if i'm touching it it's stopped one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand five one thousand all right now we are going to not have it be random we are going to start it with it off um what's better i need to get a better um view of it okay so it's everything's off i'm going to walk over here so now i should be able to add a specific pattern and then let that pattern go you can't see that let me do it down here you can see down here better so this pattern in the game of life will oscillate between those two states uh now i don't have a toggle that's unfortunate so there's no way for me to ever turn these off but i think if i put like something near it i might be able to like give it something that would cause it to like just fade away so i probably i should add a toggle possibly that so that'll fade away so i know i can do this and that's gonna fade away let's look for um patterns in let's go i believe there are you know what would be really nice is actually do the wolfram cas because those go scroll down so um there are very specific patterns like this one but i really just want to do the glider gun which i don't like right so here's some patterns there we go um will you stop animating so i can look at you for a second beacon so i should be able to do any of these now um let's try blinker worked right i did the blinker um let's try this uh this one so if i could just freeze this for a second it's making me crazy so i can like look at it i think i sort of know what it is but let's just try to create this so let me zoom in on this here so i'm going to make this on the calendar so i need to do down down down down and over here so it should be let's let's give it over here one two one two and then this is that right let's see what happens uh oh is my game of life uh is my game of oh i did it wrong i did it wrong awesome wait let's let's see this will probably make it disappear i totally did it wrong it's so funny oh and you can't see it too up there can i just get a sheet and hang it oh wait there is a curtain i never use this curtain hold on we might have a cure to all of our problems a little afraid to do this i'm trying to block out the sun which is not a thing that i should normally do is it looking better and blocked out the sun everything's okay everybody okay i'm in the dark here okay this should be better now now let me let me let me do it correctly there we go that was the correct pattern i think there we go there it is game of life on the everyday calendar oh this is very satisfying right now still the wrong um all right all right well now this is great all right let's have some fun let's have some fun okay uh i am going to reset it so i should probably have a reset button but um i can always just since it's connected to the arduino so i could just unplug the arduino right this thing is always running on it this is the amazing thing about microcontrollers okay um let's let's draw a heart i can't draw a heart oh this is terrible what am i doing i did not have a plan that's the worst heart ever i wasn't actually so bad if i had just gone up and now we've got the game of life going why is it super slow like what am i doing here in the code that has it running so slow anyone have any ideas like i don't have a delay i have no i don't think i have a delay anywhere i i mean i guess it's just these like nested loops are really slow on an arduino anybody have any ideas off by one cell i think it's just the looping over all the cells which i'm doing multiple times so is there a way i could make this more efficient i suppose i don't need two loops because so this might make it more efficient right if i put this here i don't need this extra loop and then i'm also oh this probably is mem copy is mem copy do a column of 10 cells what's the serial stuff that's just all in the beginning though so i think that's fine oh like i don't need any of this i don't need this because i don't need to print stuff anymore because i know it works okay how did i since when did i oh that's from the oh can i use a bull instead is that better should i be using a bull let's try this let's see what happens here oh you can't see the code i did it again sorry everybody i'm the worst all right so this is what i did i'm so sorry i um i changed from boolean to bull and i'm so sorry and what i did is i got rid of that extra loop in loop on the worst where uh where i was setting the states because if i'm calculating the next state i could just set them here i know i know i know i know it i'm gonna fix it in a second the chat's going a little nuts i i know well it would actually not be so hard to set up an alert where you blink these uh led lights for me that now have fallen to the floor um let's see is this going to be faster not really a little bit maybe can't tell maybe all the debouncing in simone's code is just for the um the calendar where it wants you to do like a long press whereas i don't really need that for this i don't feel like it's going any faster in fact it looks like it's going slow it's oh weirdly you see it updating like in ripples so now actually this is kind of a problem because by moving this here it's kind of like updating as it's doing all these slower calculations so i don't actually know if that really was such a good idea like it might have been better to do this all at once what's so slow here is like calling this function and everything slow like does that have a big overhead is this is mem copy would that be better um it was faster um yeah you could see the looping i sort of think i want i don't want to do that because that seemed weird to me so i'm going to put this back um but i wonder if there's like a lot of overhead in calling this function i mean this is silly for me to like really try to obsessively optimize this right now um so uh and i really uh okay violet's typing i'm gonna wait for a vile i i think i need to stop because it's 6 30 i've been streaming for three hours um i will definitely be sharing the source code um and i'm trying to think of what the the thing is now that i have this working like it's it's so tempting to just like try a different algorithm because um but i think i need to need to um let myself off the hook here but i wanted to just see um if mem copy was better i don't know how to use mem copy well that that seems like maybe i don't want to try that right now what was i want oh what i wanted to do is not call this function so what if i just took this and did that right here so this would become j this would become k this is also right having this extra loop is kind of nuts i could just manually check each neighbor but i guess because i'm doing the wrap around that would get tricky i don't think so though like this i'm sure this could be improved but let's just see if i don't call don't put this in a separate function i just count the neighbors right here let's see what happens let's set it back to random at the beginning because uh that way it'll just do something immediately whoops oh i don't have the state anymore so this needs to be here and then we'll let's i'm going to add the mem cop i'm just going to see if this sum was not declared 114 oh i don't need this function anymore let's see if this x plus y huh oh oh my god i j i'm losing my mind i j k n that doesn't make any sense i'm losing my mind here oh i'm just gonna use n well this is awful this is i oh these could be x x y i'll do that x y x y this is i plus x this is j plus y and then this is grid i and j again and let's see what happens there oh my god okay oh calling functions is more than fast enough on the arduino okay yeah i think it's just like slow math it's it's great that it's getting dark out now and it's looking so much nicer and the blur the fact that it's not in focus is actually kind of great um so what was the last thing i was going to try was mem copy so maybe if i do mem copy grid next rows times columns let's see if that works and improves the speed k and l i use j twice but i think i fixed that by now right yeah okay i think this is the final version uh it would be good to be able to toggle so this turns it on how do i get the state of one of them can i query it because it would be called good to call the toggle but i if i toggle it off i have to be able to change it in the grid hmm do we know if uh in the uh in the code here let's look at the um let's look at the library and let's look at the lights oh sorry look at the dot h file see i don't can't query it i can toggle it but it doesn't tell me what it is so i'm gonna have to keep track of it myself all right i'm just gonna leave it you have the state in the grid don't you i don't know what that means but yeah i think that means this you can just do that i don't know how much more efficient that will be but let's do it no so i know how i can toggle it myself i just wanted um i guess i know i guess i'm keeping it perfectly in sync so why not do this and then set it all right do i trust myself hold on let me just save it in a variable because this is very hard to read so this is me manually toggling it so if i get the state of wherever i touched if i've if my array is accurate then i can toggle it in my array and set the led to match it yeah that should work okay why not i'm going to run this let me actually uh turn off they set them all to zero again or why not i'll let it run all right so now i'm gonna see if i can manually toggle stop oh you know what the problem is i don't debouncing it now i know why simone had the debounce code i have to debounce it you know i could just be happy with like doing like quick taps good enough for me but it's not great i have to make sure you haven't touched it in a while so it needs i'm just going to add that as a to do i'm just going to add that as a todo uh where is that here um in touch there this will be let me let me put this code somewhere um so let's go to i mean should i make a gitlab account i'm just gonna i'm gonna go to codingtrain and let's make a repo called everyday coding train um public a code for simone yetch is every day calendar experiments um add a readme i will leave this to be mit license create this repo and then let's add where did i put this documents arduino interesting where did i save this sketches for oh the every desktop there i saved it in the desktop okay um all right desktop i am exhausted but this was i can't believe this was actually successful i didn't do what i set out to do which was have uh be able to like make it into a mirror but you know i could do that next live stream i might need to move on to something else uh sketches game of life so i did i make my bouncing yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna upload the bouncing ball too um all right let's add this here anybody who's actually watching this actually have an everyday calendar i'm curious and i would really love to flesh this out to make sure it links to all the appropriate simone yetches things um and i guess i should i could start let's let's let's since it's like dark now and starting to look really nice all right people are asking for to see this one go so let me toggle all these no debounce so this is awful terrible interaction boy software is so like screen based stuff is so easy compared to hardware okay so let me put in the that should soak we do the can we think of something else called beside gun glider gliding sled call it something different there it goes um and let's um just because why not let's um take a look at the bouncing ball which i called this let me just rename it here i think that was this test pattern i call this bouncing ball i kind of want to add gravity to it like have it be like a nice like gravity thing uh slider um i don't think simone is watching but uh if she was i would be like giddy because i'm a very big huge fan [Laughter] uh let's open up this one let's make this a little bit nicer to like have it be so goodbye game of life um this is just the glider oh it's not the glider gun because the gun is the thing that launches gliders so i could just say glider perfectly i just made the glider okay now let's upload this one just to see if it still works there we go so let's make this more physicsy oh boy i'm going to lose my mind i want to like touch it and add them to it i'm going to add let's add gravity to this okay uh point gravity um so can i make a random floating point or no gravity dot x equals zero gravity dot gravity.y equals let's just do this um and then we let me just get rid of all this stuff and now i want to say velocity dot x equals velocity.x gravity.x velocity dot y equal plus equals gravity dot y it's very funny to be coding in the dark here uh we're setting the led um and then we're checking the edges now here's the thing i'm gonna be really gonna overdo this just because i don't want it to get stuck and we're going to check it doesn't need to be left greater than equal 2 is less than 0 equals 0. if it's going down i can just check y along the bottom and i'm going to let it go to 31 like i'm just going to consider the bottom 31 then it and we're going to reverse it so let's see when i actually put a delay in this one this one is so fast that i'm actually controlling the frame rate okay let's add some gravity here oops what do i got here extra parentheses um let's see what happens i can't tell did the new one go in there it doesn't seem to have any gra hold on i mean i haven't thought about how do i know when it's reset okay tetris somebody already did tetris on this i don't think my gravity is working it's also bouncing off the top which it shouldn't do because i took that out i feel like my code is not making it there i can't stop doing this oh thank you for your uh thank you bartos diver um let's just see it's a gravity oh oh cool well i guess we'll keep going in case simone wants to come say hello um that's exciting i compiled it i did not upload it i do need to feed my children dinner at some point like uh all right oh there you go that gravity is a little bit nuts okay okay let's make the gravity a little bit smaller i just wanna uh look okay oh i'm just verifying it that's what okay i'm checking my power is off in five minutes to save energy no no don't don't i don't want to say i mean i want to save energy yes no disable automatic standby yes okay automatic standby i don't know my monitor might go off is the gravity working now it's too little it's too little gravity let's make it a little bit bigger so how could i make it that every time i touch the screen i add another one all right let's do this when it hits the bottom let's uh have it lose a little speed it's a very low resolution display i'm realizing uh but let's have it lose a little speed because that will help us it's going off the screen here we go this is lovely okay so i need to make an array of these can you do that how do you make a re can you make a is it a vector how do i do the equivalent of like an arraylist in processing somebody in my family is going to come up and tell me i have to stop at some point the dog needs to go for a walk but now like i'm checking my twitter too much is going on um all right i this is pretty cool an array is a vector yeah okay let me i'm going to save this i'm going to call this now save as bouncing balls so if i already have this as a struct i can make can i make something like this which is a particle can i do this uh can i do this oh all of my physics simulations i can do all of a sudden go feed your children no no no i'm doing this the children they can eat tomorrow [Laughter] so now if i just make a particle p how do i do this can i say p dot pause dot x i just want to make sure this works first is there a previous i need a previous i'm just going to call it pre so they all have the same number of letters as that makes me so happy will this work and then pause pause i hope i'm doing this right i really don't know how to program in c arduino uh pause and this is acceleration now if this works i should be able to make an array and i could just add to it whenever i touch the thing right can i do object oriented programming this is very meditative i'm quite enjoying this all right oh the honey drip is still here let's get rid of the honey drip and the clear animation that's much too sophisticated for me did i get everything let's see what happens uh oh what expected oh this needs like that particle is no member named gravity so this is acceleration previous was not declared in the scope okay here we go what do i do verify okay upload come on little bouncing ball i turn my the light on myself by the way all right so i got the bouncing ball and i can still be in the dark um uh okay all right so now um how do i make like arduino vector it's in the reference read the documentation huh okay well i could just make an array with a lot of them and recycle them i'll just make an array with a lot of them that's fine and keep track so how do i do that i can now say how do i make arrays again how do i make an array and see type array name array size okay uh particle particles like what if i let myself have like a hundred of them is that gonna be it can do i have enough memory for that will that be a problem let's just start with like 10. it's got to be able to do 10 right and so now for do i just do like a regular loop let's just make 10. can i get a random float this is a you know what i'm just gonna do i can't just do like random like i do in uh like if i do this or something do i have like columns and rows can i do something like this this is like crazy i'm like i don't understand how this works all right let's just do like three of them they should each be doing exactly the same thing but starting in a different spot total does not name a type p was not declared in the scope oh so now i need to say oh yeah okay a particle p equals particles index i i need to do that here too i swear i'm gonna be done soon okay i know i don't need to i was verifying just to check and then okay let's see that doesn't look good floor random calls no i don't think so not all the rows have a link i know but i'm just i have a pretend world where every month has 31. um um what if i can i do will this show me what i want to see uh serial monitor whoops okay oh oh that that makes sense so that worked line 36 mistake no that's fine p is a copy not a reference oh right do i need to do like this or something i don't know c or do i just paste this everywhere oh okay ah could that be the problem why do i only see one should there be ten not three no i changed it to three let's get rid of all of this for a second i should at least see three i should at least see three different ones right zero ampersand oh i do this i haven't done this in so long okay okay okay yeah i have to like dereference the pointer and then i do this i'm gonna be done soon i swear poor children okay i just this is i'm so close though article it's i used to know this stuff so well um like i really studied the sea stuff and i haven't done it since like probably 95 i'm not um since like 2003. um does this have to like also no but i i just want to see the three there i should see three different ones i'm only getting at zero zero so see what i'm getting here like i should see point a four point eight four point eight four no so i'm not doing it right no why because i got different values here oh same thing here same thing here i made copies oh okay this is so confusing this is why i just need to do this in p5 and then um some i guess i can do a lesson on pointers another time okay great there's my three okay awesome so now i know um let's have them all start in like at least the first four rows um let's have their x velocity also be random um and um so like negative 0.5 plus this and the gravity will be the same okay and now i should be able to put all this back and can i do p dot pause replace with this and then i'm just going to do them one at a time it was just sort of silly because i'm afraid of just okay and then what am i missing that's this this should be here okay i think this is going to work oh whoa cool except i somehow the un turning it off is not happening this is the next oh i'm confused uh why did i not turn it off so i need to turn the previous one off uh do i save it here previous is the pause and i move yeah i think actually it needs to be up here i think i was just in a weird place there we go there we go it's like juggling did i just verify it i keep doing that now i really feel like i need to add the thing where when you touch it you add i'm going to do that then i'm done then i'm done oh and there's 10 there's some okay yeah all right so i'm going to do this i just want to know like memory wise can it handle not enough memory not enough memory so 15. it can handle 15. so now i just need to get the touch stuff um and then i'm really going to be done i'm so addicted to doing this i have to stop um okay is this my code no no this wrong thing okay okay i'm so close this is just going to be just this is the last thing i'm going to do i swear last thing uh how do i get to my repositories just need the touch stuff um repositories i don't want the pin ones i want the most recent one recent one uh what did i call it did i put it under shiftmen every day coding train where's that code i just need to find it uh oh i put it in shiffman whoops i meant to move this in coding i'll move this into coding train later let me just get the um touch stuff so all i need is this then if touch um and then i get cal touch x i'm just going to grab this if touch i'm not um particle part par par how do i initialize one i just do it like the way i was going to do it up here okay let's try this it's a very silly way of doing it r.x equals cal touch dot x right par dot y equals cal touch dot y and then par dot o par.pause dot x and then same with par dot pre and then so this makes a new particle so when i touch it i get a new particle and then particles counter can i do this do i need some kind of like do i need some kind of pointery stuff there will this work especially if i have a counter set to zero then as soon as i do this i say counter plus plus and then i just only go through the counter and then i can say actually counter equals counter plus one mod modulo total right what's the chance i've gotten this right here's some of this stuff all right what do we think people verify total was not declared where's the total uh error component one counter multiple definition of counter that's probably like a built in word uh p index oh this is a problem though uh if it gets to be oh let's just do it this way it's fine we'll it'll just restart i don't mind i don't care it'll restart once you get to 15. okay all right everybody this is the last thing i'm going to do somebody wants to like gift this if it works make a gif recording of me doing this and you can capture it for like social media yeah right i touch it and i add one it seems to be running kind of slow let's get rid of that delay oh i've got like what's going on here oh boy i'm accessing some some place that doesn't exist anybody know what would i be getting this uh i don't yeah what did i do wrong well can i turn off just the serial print and i'll let it like access the bad memory and see if that speeds it up p index equals min total minus one oh that's a great idea no but i can't do it p index i got to do another inval variable so i can do thank you for that though which is here which is saying like int end equals minimum p index total minus one i think n is the built in np let's call it that right that should work set to zero all right par that no all right let's see there is a decay it's just very little so especially now that i'm doing it i should put a bigger decay on them and i really gotta stop when this is insane this is like a four hour livestream now i did not mean to do this let's get rid of this delay to see if it runs faster i'm not to fix the memory issue um it's so unbelievably dark down here let me just turn a little light on the opposite problem is true and i gotta get my ipad i was charging so i can play some music again i can't see anything i'll turn on this light just for a second and that's going to be a shock because i'm about to finish up i'll let this go all right let's see here the children and the children are out hunting for food with the dog oh the poor dog this is not the record but it is approaching it i'm sure there's been longer ones okay there we go a little physics in the everyday calendar let's see if i can all right this is going to be my does it look nicer if i do this and then you can kind of yeah let's just or should i leave i just want to like make a nice little well that doesn't make any sense to do i guess it's nice having the code there um let's do this um i just want to leave you all with a nice visual so let's put this here and let's upload it again i don't know i don't know what i'm doing anymore with my with my myself lost my mind all right just go back to here oh let's go back to here okay ready uh this is it this is gonna say goodbye everyone um put on some nice quiet music uh all right goodbye everybody i can't even like answer questions or do anything else i just have to go and i'm gonna put on this welcome to passengers perfect timing oh but look what happened when i get to 15. i don't know what happened there all right everybody uh have a wonderful day i kind of want to leave you with this um but i don't really know how to do that let's just let me just i'm going to go to just just bear with me i'm going to go to this end screen and i'm going to add i'm going to do something very unorthodox here so i'm going to add a camera source um i've never i can't believe what's happened to me here okay um is this oh this this is not an active camera that's plugged into anything uh interesting uh wow this really looks all right let's try this what is that what's this okay um this will be our little goodbye screen and you can watch this go anybody wants to capture a nice gif of this to share once i get it really going um you're welcome to i have a little bit of light so you can kind of see it no how about if i just who suggested i bounce the light off the ceiling ah there we go it's kind of nice just curious like what does it look like here now oh that's really nice i could have been doing this the whole time oh well what's wrong with me all right everybody um have a wonderful evening i'm muting my microphone i am signing off i'm gonna play some music and i'm gonna let it bounce around uh please enjoy um and i hope you have a wonderful uh rest of your weekend and all that stuff and oh let me let me just upload it fresh get ready to capture you've got an exciting moment to capture in three two one mute my microphone as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop just stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this dot this never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay the kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes no
