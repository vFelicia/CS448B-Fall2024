hello and welcome to another Q&A video so this question was submitted by McClinton Justin on github and the question is how to use p5 or processing as a background for a website okay so this is a very broad question because it's gonna mean a lot of things like well what are you what's your p5 GS or process the thing doing and what is your website so I'm gonna boil this down to a specific scenario and then as I show you a demonstration of this scenario that I'm thinking in my head I'll talk about other possible scenarios that might fit into this and other avenues that you might think about kind of combining animated sketch or dynamic JavaScript thing with quoteunquote website um so I have a website that I made it's about unicorns and rainbows I found that image of a unicorn on the Internet and I wrote a little header and then I pulled a quote from Wikipedia so this so well on the one hand here's one scenario you have a website that you've made perhaps it's your blog perhaps it's your own website however you made it ultimately it's just sitting there and it's a page of content and that content is you know kind of hardcoded or written content perhaps via whatever mechanism you're using and you can see where I have that here I have this just written into an HTML file index dot HTML now if this is has a reference to p5 libraries in it as well but it just has like the header a paragraph with an image in it and a paragraph with like a quote from Wikipedia so let's just say here's here's one possible scenario what if you what you want what what what you want is to have this website that you could suddenly draw over it so you could kind of like annotate it and you could imagine this eventually becoming something like a Chrome extension which any page that you're on you could press the button and through this like Chrome extension what does a Chrome extension you might be asking that's ok if you're asking that but the idea of a layer on top of any website that you're browsing to augment that experience so and I'm gonna do that in the future video for sure but let's just kind of make it work with the website of my own making here so what I'm gonna do is I have a p5 sketch and I'm going to say create canvas and I'm going to just say create canvas 400 by 400 and then I'm gonna say background zero just so we see it there so what happened this adds a canvas to the bottom so in the one hand I'm kind of combining some JavaScript code with some prewritten HTML code and by default p5 will just place that canvas at the bottom so another thing that I could do here is I could say well I could use the Dom library and I could store a reference to the canvas in a variable and I could then use something called absolute positioning and I could say position that canvas at 00 so now you can see uh the canvas is there but it's covering over covering the page well this is this might be what you want it might not be what you want but let's say that's not what you want well a trick to keeping track of the order of elements kind of the layers of elements is to use a CSS property known as Z index Z index kind of like of the like the z axis like our things in front or behind so I am going to now say canvas dot style Z index and I'm gonna give it a zindex of negative 1 because probably all the other things just have a default Z index of 0 I think that's the case so now you can see it's sitting behind the page now because it's black I can't see the text so I'm gonna say 220 just to get it you can see on let's let's make it 175 you can see there's the canvas now what if I want the canvas to kind of be the background of the entire page so instead of saying 400 by 400 I can say window width I think this is right window height these are builtin variables in p5 that dynamically detect the width and height of that browser page and and create the canvas at that size so you can see there we go now one thing you'll notice if I resize it's not actually changing so I'm gonna I'm going to fix that in a second but let's at least add some sort of animation I wish let's say just because what I was doing in a previous video is I'm gonna connect to my microphone so oh I don't have this sounds library I this is I'm gonna connect to the microphone and I'm gonna say Mike dot start and now I'm just gonna give me a volume which is Mike get level and I'm gonna draw an ellipse in the center of the canvas with a size of volume times 100 so let's see if this works and I know that I'm getting an error because this is the error I'm getting because I didn't actually import the sounds library so I'm going to add p5 sound j/s here and now you should say okay so now I have a web page with it's responding to my voice kind of with this like canvas in the background and just to be clear about this I'm gonna multiply it by you know like 5 the width of the window so now we can see that this circle is always going to be there behind the page now what I want to do is as I resize the browser right I want that circle to always sort of stay in the center and the canvas to resize itself so here is where I need to focus on a particular event what I want to do is add an event and that event is window resize I think I think that's the event so p5 has a global function you can write just like you can write a global mouse press function for whenever a mouse clicks anywhere on the page let's just see I'm gonna just console.log the word resize to see if this is correct yeah so you can see that whenever I change the size of the window this particular this this particular event is being triggered so what I can do actually in here is I can call a p5 function called resize canvas resize canvas will recreate that same canvas with a new window width and window height so I can give it this sort of currently updated window within window height I think this is correct and I'm gonna do this and you can see it's continuing to work so now I have this idea of a p5 sketch and the reason why the thing about it is a p5 sketch isn't just a canvas right you can do so much a p5 sketch is a sketch that allows you to control the behavior of a webpage in a much more generic sense so I could be manipulating the Dom elements and moving that Unicorn picture around and doing so much more but now at least you see this idea of the canvas a p5 canvas as the background of a particular sketch and being able to manipulative as the as the browser is being manipulated so now there's a couple more things that I want to add to this you know so there's another scenario that might be relevant to you for example what if what I want to do and I don't know if this is gonna I'm gonna comment out the mic stuff and the ellipse and I'm actually gonna put background in setup and I'm going to say if Mouse press oh if mouse is pressed I want to draw a line from P Mouse X to P and P Mouse Y to Mouse X and mouse Y if you're wondering what P Mouse X and P Mouse why are there the previous Mouse position why am i doing this is because what I want is to be able to do this so this is something you might think about which is sort of like this ability to annotate a page now in this case remember I've done all this effort like putting the canvas behind right because if I don't call this the index thing then the canvas is actually in front of all that content however there's no and even if if I do this however you can see there's it actually works so a canvas by default is actually transparent so you only have this issue is if you want to draw a background and in fact I thought I was going to have to do this but I'll show you I could add mousepressed and add the clear function here so the clear function here is a function that clears the canvas leaving it transparent so in other words I could do something like this where it's like you know oh I'm gonna add a little smiley on to the unicorn and give it like some wings and oh and then oh mouse press clears it I didn't even realize that so I could instead say like keep rest or something because I want to be able to draw a well you get the point I want to like augment this unicorn by giving it I don't know what I'm drawing now and then in case the spacebar and I could clear it so this is a possible these are a couple possible creative applications of combining canvas and drawing with existing web content what is that existing web content is in a page you've made is it something on your blog is it some is it like newspaper website and through a Chrome extension you're gonna modify there's a lot of possibilities here that I'll hopefully show you in future videos but hopefully this video I've at least shown you some tricks for how to use p5.js as a background for a web page and by that I really mean a canvas sitting there as the background of the web page okay thanks for watching you can ask your questions in the comments or ask me at Schiffman on twitter and i will see you in a future video thanks you
