morning this is a quick sound check how's my audio let me know we'll be starting in just a minute or two hello good morning and welcome to the coding trade with me your host Dan that's my name and we as we do usually on the coding train we begin with the numbers I actually only noticed that about a minute and a half ago I was using it as a prop in one of the courses that I teach physically in person here at New York University where I am live broadcasting to you from so I forgot to bring it into this room where I recorded so I don't have random numbers 3 maybe you could help me and actually this has to do with a little idea that I have that I might pursue in the future which is that maybe let's just as a quick experiment you're about 30 seconds behind me in real time because there's a bit of a lag in the live stream but if you could start putting random numbers into the chat this is how I will read random numbers you will experiment with can we create a pseudorandom number generator just from the viewers of the coding drain and while you are waiting those 30 seconds I will quickly while I'm waiting this 30 seconds let me quickly thank Oh wrong button but you can see that let me quickly thank dashlane the sponsor of today's coding train dash line which is a password manager that you will probably see me use as I log in and out of various things during this live stream you can get try a 30 day free trial of dashlane premium if you go to link comm slash coding train and if you do like the service and want to get it then you'll get 10% off as well if you choose to purchase lien premium all right I'll talk about Lane again a little bit later let me take this off and aha whoa whoa whoa I cannot read these 126 8650 for 1150 about five thousand five and forty six six thousand 4.99 twenty thirty thousand nine to thirty one oh this is very friend usually the point of the random number readings you could stop now that's good we're good we're good is for it to be relaxing and soothing I don't remember what music I was recently playing with the random numbers there was the lullaby music like you know who knows um alright so let's begin let's let's not let's skip all of this mumbo jumbo where I talk about 5 million things about different websites that you could find out more and buy things and look at things and download code and contribute code and all that stuff let's just you the viewer and me right now let's get into it but before that please please with the random members oh they're in the discord this is this is much more effective I can actually manage to read these this is a really good one we've got 65 million seven hundred twenty seven thousand three hundred eighty two a little bit afraid that there are some encoded secret messages all right before I get into today's topic which will be the topic for the next several months probably if I'm being perfectly honest let me briefly mention to you that I will be appearing again on Monday if you cannot possibly get enough of me on the youtubes you can get some more of me on the Twitch's with mpj and fun fun function which is a wonderful streaming show thingamabob on the internet with mpj and who i've met in person exactly i think i don't know a couple times and and and formally talked to him on the internet and it's really perfect timing because the topic today i am going to launch my live streams will be filled with me recording short video tutorials to redo all the nature of code materials for 2020 we could get the numbers I have to look away and but it's good timing because I'm going to begin that process today and talk to you about vectors in p5.js and Creed the create vector function and then on Monday I'm going to attempt to teach essentially the same thing to MP J with through the lens of an example about gravitational attraction so that's what's happening a couple things I can sort of like update you on and maybe tease out tease a little bit well David's asking a really good question hold on hold that thought is that what's he gonna say I have yes so you as you might recall the topic that I was kind of going through bit by bit by bit over the fallen into January was this playlist beginner's guide to machine learning in JavaScript so I hope after today starting next week there will be one of these that says the nature of code and there will be you know nine or ten chapters and I'll start filling them all in over the next several weeks but is not finished in fact this is where I left off in the last session I started doing some tutorials about convolutional neural networks and there are two more in the I mean there you can find all that content in the previous live stream but the edited versions of them are waiting to be finished and will they're two that will appear here in the next week probably but I'm just gonna leave that to the side because I really need to do this nature of like a variety of reasons that I'm happy to answer questions about but that's that's what's happening and I will return to this david also asks will you have other coding challenges while you are doing the nature of code series and Cabana videos so I'd well I have something that I am excited to tease for you let's see if I can manage to just do a little something just to hold this hold your hope well hold the train stop the train why why am I not logged in if only I had something like a password manager like dashlane on my device here where I could look up and you might be wondering why am I not using the laying on this laptop it's because I have a sort of dummy lay an account because I don't want it to show all my personal stuff so I am looking it up now on my phone Google coding training oh boy this is taking way too long for this little thing don't worry I'm getting somewhere wrong wrong wrong this is gonna be good just this is gonna be good okay ready I'm going to bring my computer back in just a moment so the next coating in the Cabana video on the hilbert curve will premiere hopefully tomorrow Saturday so I feel like the coding of Cabana is a kind of video to release over a weekend it's like you're just there and it's snowing outside and all of that stuff and so there's this so this is the Jason headland who does a lot of all of the illustrations for the coding train created this lovely scene and also if I open up the browser I think I had it open too this is the springtime scene so this is the more standard coding in the Cabana scene but now this is the winter time theme so so that's coming tomorrow so bad I'm gonna leave this up here just cuz it's sort of like nice to have but let me get back to David's question so my focus my primary focus will be nature of code and to be honest if I was really if I was my I really want to update the book text so what I probably should do which I'm not gonna do is just say like hey no YouTube videos for the next three months sorry I have to work on the book text so I'm gonna try to do them simultaneously that's what my real primary focus is updating the book and I actually looking for contributions for that and potentially to hire a few people two additional people to help me with that which maybe I have to do some more thinking about that but I will I will post you could pro you could join the discord leave like a button to like bring up the discord but someone please post the discord invite link to the chat if you can but the discord is where I will is where we're kind of like organizing and talking about things coding challenges we'll see I mean those are the the lifeblood of the channel in a way those are by far and away all the most watched videos they're what bringing people in there what people seem to enjoy the most so I shouldn't I don't want to stop doing them but I just have this mission to just get this through all this nature of code stuff and get out there again in a way that's more digestible and accessible so that's what my focus will be but you know I kind of hope that I can figure out a way to like livestream a couple times a week easier said than done because there's also a lot of weeks where I'm traveling and I'll actually be taking those weeks off so we'll see Juan Flores in the chat asks I haven't seen most of the nature of code playlist should I wait for the new videos to come out up to you there's nothing wrong with the old nature of code playlist the main the main issues with them is that the the video quality is quite poor as I made them many years ago some of them actually in 2012 I look much younger but the video quality is not so great and so so that means that I would like to improve and then they're using processing which I still use and plan to keep all of the examples in and use in projects and have part of the nature of code materials but since a lot of my teaching now is in on the web in JavaScript I want to create videos that use JavaScript okay all right I think I'm gonna be have to be the one to link the discord link so let me do that real quick I don't want to plug the coding trade memberships even though that's what I'm doing right now but I do have this new bit but somebody joy and said I don't be am so he really loves so anybody joints could do my do bit I think you know what it is well agent last night useful links discord invite a copy link paste and enter okay oh and now let me just mention I know I said I wasn't gonna be like plugging all this stuff but let me just briefly mention the new coding terrain store I'm really uh in the a one thing you'll like about the new coding in the Cabana video is I don't use that chalkboard so the new coding the Cabana video will not have two chalkboard instead I actually am drawing in one of these coding training notebooks and I have this one of these like overhead cameras that you can see just like over over the notebook so there's actually a really interesting fun fact about the drawing in the notebook that I will see if anybody notices and then I'll come back well I will talk about it next week on the live stream so but I really think that I'm plugging is the hoodies because I ordered a bunch of gifts for people and I ordered one for myself and because they're they have to be made in batches they'll only get made if enough people buy sound is on the low side if it's manageable then I would prefer to keep it as is because I'm noticing it get all the way into the yellow right up to the red in open broadcast studio and I prefer uh to be able to turn it up on their own and use headphones okay okay okay okay okay oh okay all right I mentioned Monday stay tuned well now what oh it's just I don't have the nature of code like I won't bought that domain but it's here okay all right all right so here's how this worked here's how this is gonna work um so I don't know if you've all seen this but YouTube has a new feature called YouTube learning playlist so I'm gonna be filling that out with content and I have actually you know by accident in a way made a lot of the videos already so what I need to do today is just do like a quick intro then and then I think just sort of like talk about the introduction and is there like let me try to get the table of contents hold on a sec I'm just going to do this for a second hold on oh whoops I'm not logged into the nature of code they log into my light here we go ohho factor excellent oh no no no factor authenticator I wanted to pull up the table of contents everybody always wants this background music I don't know that it exists anywhere on the Internet the song is called Tori the dog that's what the song is called and it's by a composer named Adam Blau ad am b Lau I think Adams on Twitter at Adam Blau if he wants to release this in somewhat sublicense more widely welcome to but he was something he happened to have his archive library of stuff that never got used and I I love that and I started using it now everybody asks Metro writes nothing happened for the last 50 minutes welcome to the coding train where nothing happens for a way longer than 15 minutes you have won by watching the coding train ah lucky la Lama with the super chat has won 15 to 20 more minutes of person on the internet with a messy beard dancing and doing nothing shoot I lost track of what I was doing I yes okay here we go so I have with me what time is it ten o'clock just so everybody knows so in about a half an hour 45 minutes I will take a short break there's look like to take a break in the middle of my long session and then at noon I will be you believe it so I have a lot to stuff this afternoon planned so I've got to get out of here at noon Arnab asks is CNN on a hold by CNN we're talking about convolutional neural networks somewhat yes yes they answer this yes I talked a bit more about that earlier so you can scroll back in time if you want to find me talking about that okay so I think I have this I have the table of contents here which I'm gonna need and I have this all right and Oh hold on so how do I find I don't think I have it here we go and I have this okay so some of this stuff will just like make its way back into the playlist cuz I I have done updated physics library videos and updated genetic algorithms live videos and that sort of thing oh I'm not in the shoot I am NOT in this chat anymore okay I was not in the discord live supporter chat but now I am oh okay everybody let's just take a minute to relax Oh match you're probably not watching but I got to get the coating in the Cabana music that we use to have here this is what I always imagined it is it's not well I I wonder if it's that I have a larger viewership this morning than usual and I wonder if it's the topic or the time that's interesting to note okay all right I got everything I want to talk about so this first thing so okay so if you haven't watched me before it's a little bit of a strange thing that I do which is that these live sessions in many cases are what I what are recording sessions for things that will get edited and chunked into playlists and various other formats on the coding train so I do have a lot of redundant content and in some sense you might say to yourself I don't want to watch this person goof off and waste a lot of time and try things multiple times you could just wait for the edited content that would be my suggestion but this this is gonna be a bit maybe a bit more of even of an extreme version of that in the sense that I'm gonna try it like for example this first thing that I want to do is just record a video that's really no more than one minute long and I don't have a script or anything so I might try it a couple times which will be just sort of like a quick introduction to how I'm rebooting the nature of code playlist then I'm gonna look at the table of contents and figure out do I want to just go straight to making tutorials actually for chapter one but I just want to like take a quick peek at the table of contents to see if there's some stuff that I actually already have from the introduction that I can also do something with all right good morning all here we go let me go I want to get one more thing up cadenzas a code okay I will also call this up because I should acknowledge this but to some extent what I am doing is partially also available here you can't have too much nature of code in your life shouldn't be called the code of nature I think there's something already called that oh look at my Google power and actually even almost comes up I mean it comes up first this is an ad right or no this is some kind of like what it thinks we want to feature it snippet okay published Daniel I think it's spelled incorrectly I'm pretty sure it's sh ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii f and ay ay ay ay HH HH HH HH HH guess and proper spelling of my name just write write that down to get the number of e's right it's very important I can do this I think this is a nice I think I like the idea of like starting this with but you don't match yeah you we can replace the background so I'm actually not even gonna worry about that okay happy 2020 it is I me the person hello and happy 2020 it is me Dan from coding train here to launch a new learning playlist on YouTube called the nature of code that's what it says right here so this is not new content at all in fact this playlist that I'm about to embark upon is based on material that I started working on probably in 2008 and then published a book about which you can find online at nature of code calm in 2012 the book here that you're seeing is all is was written then and has largely not been updated uses processing which is a Java based creative coding environment and I am going to redo REI Mari in the process of rewriting the book to update things for 2020 as well as port a lot of detects all of the text and examples to JavaScript with p5.js so that's part of what I want to say so it's my dream that by the time you're watching this this will look totally different but this is where it is right now as I'm recording this in terms of what's already on the YouTube channel these are all of the videos most of these were actually recorded between 5 & 8 years ago the quality is is a little bit lower not good oh it's the best ever now but it's it's improved and so you can go back and watch these but largely what I'm going to do is go through a lot of these topics and redo these videos with new ways of thinking and new ideas and also JavaScript I should mention that some of the stuff I did update more recently like genetic algorithms and neural networks and physics libraries and little bits and pieces in here so there will be if you're following through this playlist there will be something like forward and backward in time of how things that when things have been recorded but hopefully it will all piece together with a nice narrative if you want to follow if you want to follow the work in progress as it's happening on if you want to follow the work if you want to follow the book being updated and the examples being updated as it's happening I'll refer you to the nature of code on github so here are all of the open source repositories for all of the raw material of the book so the book itself is an NOC book there's a whole section there about the build process of the book which I'm really looking for help with if you're watching this please jump on in and help me out um there's the syllabus which is for course that I'm teaching at ITP New York University to school the arts there's the code for the website there's the processing examples there's the p5 just examples and there's even some Python examples as well and so all of this is stuff that I'm going to be working on and my goal is that sometime by the end of 2020 all of this will be complete this video series that is there in front of you will have be all filled out and we can all just have a little dance and be merry go merrily on our way let me also give a mention of cadenza which produced which I participated in producing an online course called the nature of code years ago a bunch of years ago as well that has a lot of video tutorials a lot of similar content this is also a nice resource a compliment to what I'm doing here as well so I probably should have mentioned what this is about hmm that's fine I'm trying to think look I didn't really bleed off of what this is about but that's fine well could I could redo this or we could edit it in a different order or or I could just do it right now introduction I probably should have mentioned what this is all about so this book is about looking at the world around us the natural world being inspired by it and trying to create software experiences interactive experiences inspired and based on those things so the table of contents has physics simulation so the first bit of advice that I might give you here in the words of George Washington Carver is go take a walk outside experience the world around you draw on that for how for when you build software and write code and they you know think about your humanity in our I'm trying to be profound not really working so the first bit of advice that I might give you like drawing on my cell face what's funny is like all my old videos just had all this stuff in them and I guess it's here on the live stream we really did enjoy that and edit all this stuff out but what can you do the first bit of advice I might have for you is I'm gonna get through this sentence the first bit of advice I might have for you and you know thinking of the words of George Washington Carver go take a walk outside experience the world around you be with people be with human beings enjoy nature and that might help really give you ideas an inspiration for what you might want to create when you sit down to code and that's really what this book is about for me you know fractal cellar automata autonomous agents of physics simulation genetic algorithms neural networks this happens to be a list of things that I'm going to go through step by step by step throughout this series but really there's so much more to the world that we live in than just that into outer space and beyond it's universe so I hope that as you watch this series you think beyond just what I have here create stuff and also share it with so stay tuned look in this video's description there's lots of ways if you're watching these videos that you can share projects you've made mostly on the coding train comm where I think that's where I'm gonna put stuff but there's just check the video description all that will be ironed out I gotta end this because this is really just a rambling introduction I want to get into the content I'm gonna come back and redo this anyway once all the videos are so hopefully this is like now you're watching this sometime in the future is like an interesting like historical footnote but thanks I've come with me on this journey nature of code and I can't I hope you enjoy it I'm gonna enjoy making it I know because I do enjoy this kind of stuff and I can't wait to see what you do good bye alright okay um so that's gonna be what I got for that okay so next so I think what I'm going to do since I have a lot of videos already is let me do a quick a quick hopefully not even 30 seconds a quick 30 seconds just about the introduction and then the playlist is just going to have in it Perlin noise video and random walk videos and then I'll move on to vectors okay did you stick with me so now you're in the first section of the nature of code learning playlist and that section is the introduction so what's actually going to happen now if you keep watching is the next videos that pop up into your feed our videos that I made in the last several years about Perlin noise the history of perla noise and something called open simplex noise as well as random walks so this is really just meant to be a warmup a way to get your like sort of like dip your toe into the water maybe I haven't programmed in p5.js with JavaScript or objectoriented programming in a while and so this will get you give you a bit of a sense of a little bit of a warmup before I move on to the next chapter vectors so that's where I will be where inventors I'll be wearing these clothes because at this moment right now I have recordings going to next go talk about vectors but before I before you see me then oh this is so the space cut nature of code is really disrupting the spacetime continuum before you see those you'll see a bunch of videos about perla noise and random walks which you can draw upon I think as a starting point for how you might want to start working with vectors this is working right oh boy hmm I don't know I'll come free do all this next week now okay I want to go back and look in my channel to see what all the videos I already have they can go in that playlist but I guess I'll do that on my own time not with you right here and so I can actually get into some real stuff here so the very first video and as my whiteboard operational is this camera crooked how crooked is it you're a crooked camera I have a have a level yeah it's pretty off so I needs to you think I would check these things before I start recording that's a little better I think I made it I don't know if I made it better or worse worse worse but worse the other way yeah oh this is good this is good that looks level okay okay where are we timewise 1015 the nice thing about this stuff is I think something will I mean I shouldn't say this now because famous last words but unlike with a lot of machine learning stuff and some of the coding challenges where I can get you stuck for hours I know this material fairly well so I think I'm actually gonna be able to move through it fairly quickly but we'll see we'll see if that really holds true okay being told to brush my teeth brush my eye bruh shhhhht my teeth I brush my teeth mmm just maybe I had a little spinach in my breakfast which is healthy and maybe that a little piece but you really should be telling me to do is trim my beard and go get a haircut that's what my mother would say uhhuh all right what am i doing all right oh thank you this is actually David wrote I liked how these intros came out really pleases me because I feel very confused how to do this all right let me I want to open up an example actually I want to get the random Walker example okay let's go I have an idea I'm going to go to the random walk web editor so this is the code from and let me I'm gonna this is the code from the random walk challenge and if you will oblige I'm gonna just make this object oriented person object oriented you know what maybe I'm not gonna make it object oriented maybe I will leave it as such okay that's fine because this is where it left off ah I saved over it hold on I think it should be okay now duplicate know how to name these okay I'll leave this up anymore actually just out of curiosity how did I do this before vectors P vector class vector math vector math to acceleration yeah all right I mean that's probably what I'm going to do again okay welcome to nature of code chapter 1 vectors so the poor purpose the pointless welcome to nature of code chapter 1 vectors so the purpose of this first video is just to explain what a vector is what is a vector as well as look at what it means to use the concept of a vector with p5.js hold on a sec now if you watched now if you watch some of the videos in the introduction section one of the examples I went through is a random walk this is a single point x and y in this example I have two variables x and y together they make up a position in the canvas and then every cycle through draw every frame of animation I pick a random number 0 1 2 & 3 and move it either to the right the left up or down this is using vectors so the concept of a vector is something you're probably using all the time in your programming without realizing it but maybe you're not actually getting full power out of vectors because you're not yet using p5 dot vector so that's really where I'm leading here but let's zoom back out and talk about what a vector is so first let me use another term for you scalar so scalar might sound like some scary math terminology that you seems unfamiliar to you but this is actually saying you have definitely been using all along for example here is an example of a scalar value 6 oh I've got another one for you 14 zero point three one nine two two two two that's my favorite scalar so a scalar is a numeric value a single value it is a magnitude so the concept here is something is a is something that has a magnitude for example the my height is a scalar value my weight is a scalar value you know I want to use height and weight as an example so for example the really stuck here so for example the length of this marker is a scalar value the weight of this marker is a scalar value anything that you can measure in a magnitude in a single number is a scalar a vector is something that has is a vector is an entity that has not just magnitude but also direction this is the idea of a vector now I should preface all of this by saying that vectors are things oh this I should prep I should preface this by saying that the concept of a vector extends into many many many dimensionality yeah oh I shouldn't say wait oh I should have said wait I have to go all the way back I have to go all the way back I should have said wait thank you thank you thank you I'm so glad I'm doing this live that was like the worst thing I could have possibly done thank you thank you thank you chat Thank You chat Thank You chat I owe you my life I owe you the fact that I will not eventually have to see ten thousand comments and remake all these videos forever and ever and ever don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait wait don't say wait what are some other good examples the length of something the volume of something oh the number of you know the like I could I could like count like the number of things I have in a pile what are some other good examples the chat is too far behind me size area volume okay yeah area is good distance oh thank you distance distance it's such a good thing all right I thank you Oh time that's good okay examples of a scalar value are things that you can I lost my home momentum here but that's my temperature that's good thank you thank you chat examples of things that are scaler are things that you can measure like the the length of this marker the distance between me and you wherever you are all are in the world is a that's a scaler but like I you could also make it a vector it's not distance isn't about your distance is a scaler I've got to get back I've gotta get going back into this examples of scalar quantities are things like the length of this marker the volume of the area area is good Oh use my coding train oh examples examples of things that are scalar quantities are like oh the length of this marker maybe the surface area of this beautiful coding training notebook temperature how many what is it what how hot it is how hot is it outside whether it's Fahrenheit or Celsius or Kelvin that's a scalar quantity the distance between two points how far away in the world are you from me right now that's a scalar quantity anything that you can measure as a single magnitude that is a scalar a vector is something that is both magnitude not both not both a distances yeah displacement distances of distances a scalar now we can think of how I will get I'll kind of clarify that a vector however has not just magnitude nann dude but also directions this is the idea of a vector it's a quantity an entity that has both a magnitude and a direction one thing that's important for me to say is vectors can exist in many kinds of dimensional spaces two dimensional space three dimensional space four dimensional dimensional we can keep going but this it and and you might have heard me say the term vector in other videos that I made maybe about machine learning and data but what I'm going to do in this series is constrain myself restrict myself to talking about vectors in a two dimensional space this is because I am working with them in a p5.js canvas and that happens to be a two dimensional space you might want to use the concept of vector in three dimensions because you might choose and I might do some examples that look at vectors in three dimensions and in fact p5 vectors do support three dimensions 3d graphics or a thing but my focus and trying to explain all of this and look at the math will be sticking in two dimensions yeah the typical way a vector is tip the typical way a vector is what am I trying to say visualized or 1030 15 minutes I'm taking a break I'm trying to stick to my schedule represented that's the word I'm looking for the typical way a vector is represented is by an arrow so let me return back to this random walk example and look at this I had an X and a Y and then X and Y is moving randomly drawing its trail how could I think of that x and y as a vector I had two variables x and y they represent a point in space two dimensional space x and y I could think of these this x and y together as a vector that provides instructions for how to get from the origin point zero zero all the way to that x and y so this is the idea of thinking in terms of vectors this entity this this entity this entity this vector has both a magnitude that is its length how long is the vector this entity this vector has both a magnitude what is the magnitude it is the length of this arrow and a direction what is the direction it's the way the arrow is pointing and I could think of that in different ways but one way of thinking about that is as an angle often represented with the Greek letter theta so I could think of a vector as the length of an arrow as well as what direction is it's pointing as an angle relative to you know the origin point I know some people in that chatter saying a coordinate is a vector well so there's a couple things I want to say about this now probably this were now probably the canonical example of a vector is the concept of velocity the velocity of an object yeah so maybe I don't want to address that right now because I want to get I'm gonna get into this in a little bit I will mention this thing about is a coordinate really a vector I will give you my take on that I don't want to give so conceptually so conceptually I'm talking about this vector as this arrow and the arrow has both the length magnitude and the direction let me take a minute to redo this diagram in a more traditional math way because canvases are a little strange in that the origin is in the topleft and that Y points down but a more typical Cartesian plane a 2dimensional plane cartesian named for a guy named a the mathematician might have an XY coordinate right here and i could represent and the origin right here and i could draw an arrow between these two so conceptually the vector has the magnitude which is this particular length and the direction which represented by this angle relative to the horizontal axis however I am conflating a little bit two concepts which is this idea of a coordinate or a position and a vector this idea of this vector itself the concept of this vector is just this arrow it doesn't represent any specific location in twodimensional space it just represents instructions for how to get from one position to another position and in the case that I'm talking about those instructions are from the origin to the position X Y so in a moment I'm gonna start talking about velocity which is going to be used in our code to describe well if this is my thing at this X Y it's gonna go here then it's gonna go here then it's gonna go here then it's gonna go here I might have a bunch of velocity vectors giving it a path this idea of the vector itself is really a concept of the arrow not the specific location but a position in a p5 sketch can be thought of as a vector with instructions from how to get to the origin to that XY location itself and in that sense it really is relative because if I use the translate function to move the origin around that vector is going to kind of move around with that so hopefully that addresses it Simon is saying is that actually a quote from an actual three blue one brown video or are you Simon just reminisce is is giving me is writing in the discord chat about different ways to describe a vector with physics computer science and machine learning and with just sort of like more theoretical math now interestingly enough even though I am talking about vectors as part with this core idea of magnitude in fluently oddly enough even though I am starting this discussion off about vectors focusing on these core concepts magnitude and direction the actual values stored in the p5 vector object which I really haven't shown you yet but I'm going to get to are not the magnitude and direction but rather the components of a vector what do I mean by components well that I actually mean these this.x and this.y because in fact look at this arrow here I can make this into a little bit of a triangle and imagine the y equals three right the Y value is three go up by three the x value is four go across by four x equals four y equals 3 the vector the vector is actually 4 comma 3 the data stored with the vector are actually these numbers 43 and I could choose to write them in different ways I could say 4 comma 3 or I could write these sort of brackets and write 4 3 like that so in many cases more generically a vector is actually just a list of numbers it's a list of components and if I were in two dimensions I would have two numbers three dimensions three numbers four dimensions four numbers etc etc and this again comes up more in machine learning and data science but in the concept of physics I'm really thinking about this twodimensional space with just an X and a Y and incidentally I will ask you the question what is the magnitude of this vector think about that for a second maybe you've heard of a 3 4 5 triangle right if one side of a right triangle with a 90 degree angle is 3 the other side is 4 the hypotenuse of that triangle is 5 so one of the things you'll discover as I do more videos about different vector math is a lot of the math with vectors particularly in twodimensional space that is relates to trigonometry and trigonometry and all the same math associated with right triangles Oh so three blue one brown has a video called vectors what even are they essence of linear algebra chapter one got it okay so we are moving along here I'm almost done with this video oh I don't have it there's nothing in here I take it that means it's time for me to take a break I lost had all these viewers all left once I started talking about vectors what's going on or do people just have to go to work or something or go to sleep I feel like nobodynobody in my time zone watch just these videos it's either people are watching them because it's early in the morning for them or the late at night for them okay Oh Alicia ray writes I'm in linear algebra this semester I might go check that out you definitely should if you're looking for if you are if you are looking for helpful videos about mathematics I find the three blue one Brown Channel I mean okay I didn't weigh like I feel like oh my God all I ever do on the coding train is talk about three so and in fact my hilbert curve video comes out I'm talking about three blue one brown but it's really hard to find a better resource for understanding really calm sophisticated topics in mathematics in a delightful visual way it might not be the way that everybody learns but for me and I think a lot of people those kinds of explanations are just amazing okay thank you for assignment for clarifying on that all right and and David writes ndimensional vector math is mostly trig expanded into the n dimension which is true Kevin from Baltimore go o's next years the year yes Baltimore in the house okay any video Farhan I do have a video on a star okay I got it got off track I'm gonna finish this off and then take a short break reference I'm just gonna hit a create vector whoa this is not oh it is that is so weird I think this okay so this is fine but I would suggest I've never noticed this maybe there's a good reason that I'm not thinking of this seems like a really weird example to have as the thing that pops up on the create vector reference page like it's the second argument of the point light function that's creating a victor based off of sign of Millie's hoof I don't know if anybody wants to file an issue about this or to probably be five website repo I guess but I kind of actually I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm gonna move to a different page let's just try let's try this one yes so frankly I would suggest this just go on the create vector page Euclidian ah that's good okay my a star was buggy welcome to the coding train where you have one an example code with lots of bugs in it have fun when you apply it to your project the bugs will still be there and as part of your learning experience you can fix those bugs alright here we go so first returning back to the random walker example we can look at this once again no not once again returning back to the random walker example we can look at this again the God again again for the first time now for the first time return returning back to the random walker example we can look at this with a new lens with a new view on outlook on life well like that outlook on life returning back to this random walker example we can look at with a new outlook on life and that is vectors instead of having and this is really the first thing when you're starting to program with p5 vector you're already this is already using the concept of vectors in the way that I described it to you but I want to rewrite this now with p5 vector so here's the reference page for p5 vector I encourage you to click over and check it out and read through it p f o actually yeah so many things I want to do so many things I want to do in this video so I'm thinking about the order of this but so here I need to go ate some water I got like a frog in my throat but I don't I want to finish this before I take a break there's nothing left in this okay okay here is the reference page on the p5 website for p5 dot vector now it's a little strange that there's this thing called p5 dot vector maybe I can return back to that in a moment a little bit but what I want to highlight for you is this right here create vector the function create vector is what makes an object in p5 that is a vector object a p5 dr. and when you create a vector you give it two values an x and a y it also can optionally take a third for an XYZ but again I'm not making use of the third dimension right now so the first thing beyond all the fun interesting new vector math that I will explore is just replacing my old XY variables with one variable that is a p5 vector going into the code I'll comment this out and I will say I'm gonna say pause for position and then here and set up I'm going to say position equals create vector and the X is with divided by 2 the Y is height divided by 2 I want to draw that point at pause dot X and pause da and while this random walker and while this code this random Walker code is is based on the sort of core idea of a random walker that can only go in four different directions up down left and right I want to instead simplify this and just let X&Y change by any random floatingpoint number between negative 1 and 1 as well so to do that I'll say Paz dot x equals positive x plus random negative 1 1 same for y wait sorry same for y and I'm gonna run the sketch weird where does that error come from oh whoops and I'm gonna run this sketch so step one of working with vectors in p5 is go and find something you once made that had separate X and y variables and see if you could use create vector instead for them yeah go ahead do that now I'll wait step two I would say is that I want to start building a foundation for a physics engine ultimately through all of these chapter 1 videos and chapter 2 videos by the end of all of them I'm going to have a very rudimentary physics engine that I can build a lot more projects on top of it will also serve as a kind of foundation of knowledge and understanding to use more sophisticated and robust physics engines from other libraries that's kind of the point of where this all is going but in order to do that I want to make heavy use of objectoriented programming so if you've never done objectoriented programming before or worked with classes in JavaScript a class being a template for creating an object then I might refer you to go back to my beginner coding videos where there's a whole section on objectoriented programming but for right now just to kind of recap that I'm going to very quickly create a walker object so instead of having a position variable that's just in the global space I'm going to make a walker class and create a walker object that is in the global space so also to keep things organized and this is just sort of my style I'm gonna make a separate JavaScript file for Walker then I'll write it as a class with a constructor function that will receive an x and a y it will have one variable a position so this is where I'm starting the Walker is essentially a rapper a rapper so this is where I'm beginning the Walker is essentially an object that stores that one vector position and I've got to use that this dot syntax because the position is the the Walker class has one piece of data associated with it the position vector and I use the this dot sequence so that the position is an instance variable that's part of the Walker object itself what does the Walker do it walks so I could call that step or walk or update I'm gonna use the the name update I'm gonna write a function and I'm gonna grab the code that I have here bring it in to Walker J s and what am I missing now that I have the position vector as part of the Walker class I need to refer to the position as this dot position which at some point is going to create some messy looking not missing which at some point is going to create some awkward looking longer winded code but we're gonna live with that and then I think I'm gonna have a show function for drawing the Walker I will grab this code that draws the point this dot and now I have my Walker class complete it the constructor creates a position vector the update function updates the X&Y position and the show function draws the position back into sketch I'm going to make the variable now called Walker in setup call the constructor with with / with with an initial position with an initial position of 200 200 and then in draw update and I think I forgot the stroke and all of that as part of its show function put that back in and now oops what do I have wrong oh I forgot to reference Walker J s in index.html and there we go I have exactly the same random Walker so this brings me to the end of this first video about what is a vector and using p5 vector in your code in your JavaScript code in p5.js but I have really barely scratched the surface I'm not doing anything other than thinking of this p5 vector as a place to hold the X&Y variable I really want to start thinking about this concept of a vector more I really want to start thinking about this concept of a vector more formally and start to think well if I have a position to erase all this I really want to start thinking about this concept of a vector more formally and if I have a position represented as a vector pointing from the origin to the XY location where I'm drawing something then couldn't that object that has that position also have a velocity representing as an arrow that's moving its current position to its next position in my animation and maybe I could have also something called an acceleration which is a vector that which in the same which in the same way that velocity is changing the position over time the acceleration is changing the velocity over time and I've heard about this thing called a force maybe there's something like Newton's laws and physics and motion and things that are at rest and they stay at rest and all that stuff could I somehow take this concept of a force maybe you've heard of this equation force equals mass times acceleration could that play a role in how acceleration is calculated which changes velocity which changes position and so these are the foundational elements of a physics engine and I am going to build all of those slowly bit by pit while talking about different mathematical operations with vectors and that's what you'll see in the next few videos in the next few videos all throughout chapter one and chapter two so if you're interested just keep on I don't know if they're there right now but when they're there they'll be there and you can watch them I'm making them in these clothes or a different clothes depending which day and recording them goodbye alright alright everyone so that is who I've kicked this off oh I'm so happy I'm getting I'm getting some momentum here because I feel like if I can get some momentum I might go just like pop into the studio and just like oh I have an hour free let me just do the next one and the next one some of those by the way I will probably do as memberonly livestreams just cuz but as a as a benefit for members all the edited content will of course make its way out to the channel but but yeah so I'm not done for today I have another hour left but I'm gonna take a short break and talk to you about briefly also thank my friends over at dashlane who are the sponsor of today's coding train Kony train would not really be possible all of the people who work on editing and everything and all the stuff that I'm putting out there it cost money and having sponsors is a really wonderful thing that I can't have the opportunity for to help me keep this project going and dashlane is a password manager and so if you'll I have something to show you which is this so if you have you know if your life feels very inconvenient and you can't manage all these passwords I mean how many things have I had to log into just on this livestream alone the web editor github I had to log in to a whole lot of stuff that I had to turn my screen off because I didn't want all this other private stuff showing up and so I I'm I having a password manager I can actually have different passwords for absolutely everything you can also store credit card information and so Biggs checking out and paying stuff online so much so much easier and so you know there are solutions like keychain and chrome have this but you get locked into a single system and all of your passwords are trapped in one place you know you have to watch out for other solutions like log in with Facebook with that that you know you might be at risk of your data being misused and sold so Lee never has access to your personal data and won't trick you into subscribing there's no credit card to sign up Layne cannot see your data and it is an adfree product so if you can fill out forms fast with oneclick logins and auto fills and here's the other thing that I really love about using a password manager is that it works across all devices so I'm always logging the stuff on my phone or a tablet or the laptop or then I'm on this treatmen computer and this computer so I can have basically everything stored in a way that I can log in and then when I'm you know when I'm somewhere at a public computer and I need my password I can just pull out my phone and grab it so that particular is really useful it is used by 11 million users in 180 countries endorsed by The Wall Street Journal New York Times Fast Company Forbes Wired and more top rated on the iOS App Store and a recommended app by both Apple and Google so if you are interested in giving it a try you can go to late comm slash coding training that lets them know that you found out about it from here you can sign up for free this will give you a 30 day free trial of the premium features and then you can also 'if you were to choose to purchase that get 10% off so I'm gonna take a short break a little intermission and if you feel so inclined you can use that time to sign up for Lane otherwise we'll be back in about five minutes with more I'm gonna do just like probably one or two more quick tutorials about p5 vectors okay how do I do this I go to my intromission button I put on this music and I mute my microphone and go get some water and breathe in some oxygen see you soon sorry I just had the mic muted I'm all messed up now it says intermission excellent okay see you soon I always forget this star this star the star this starts I'll never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me okay here I am back thank you again to lean and I'm ready to continue this vector stuff come back in full energy oh no no no no for very low energy I actually do feel quite a bit tired in a way like I do feel like maybe what might make sense I'm not really prepared to do this right now and I and I and since I have a kind of I have to be finished at noon I don't think I'm gonna do this but I could imagine a world where I if I do a two and A two to twoandahalf hour live stream where the first hour is the nature of code tutorials and then the second hour is a coding challenge so maybe that's something that I can consider I know a lot of people especially David have helped with this wheel spinning thing I've been working on I just haven't been able to get rid spin the wheel though for the next coding in the Cabana video since that's coming out tomorrow maybe I can do that is the noise suppression gone the noise suppression was never on so I don't know why that's something it would have changed it might just be louder in here there's like the air is kind of come on stronger okay go have a walk all right but I'm I do have so I lost my momentum by taking a break I feel kind of tired but I can get it back I regularly teach three hour classes so I don't know why and regularly and not regularly but I have done longer live streams but here we go okay so I think what I want to cover next is I don't know if I really want to do a general video about just vector math I feel like I'd rather have it come up as I build the examples so I think that's what I'm gonna keep going yeah oh all right all right I just see the last comment of the chat so let's get to it already it doesn't really motivate me to get started okay Adrian asks have you ever drank energy drinks I don't think that I should be having energy drinks I think my regular level of energy you know a little caffeine never hurts I like I enjoy caffeine just as much as the next person but any other amount of anything that's going to boost energy is just gonna cause me to there's like a little like teetering teetering teetering and I don't want to take another step oh maybe I could do a quick example the dot product projection Oh Joseph Clayton I am not that far along yet that is definitely part of this whole discussion but that that that I think is above and beyond where I am currently in terms of this material there okay I need to what I do need to do on if I'm live starting the morning is eat a bigger breakfast exactly marchello says dangerous just call me don't call me thank you to random hamster with your donation you have won me talking about vector addition all right we're how to begin this all right I know what to do I got it welcome back to the second video in Chapter 1 about vectors in p5.js hi so I could go in a number of different directions here and I'm still sort of figuring out what direction was good right now but ostensibly if you're looking following the nature of codebook along with these videos the next topic is really looking at vector math what are the kinds of operations that you might be used to doing with scalar quantities five plus two equals seven five minus two equals three x square root power of three all of these kinds of mathematical operations those mathematical operations exist for vectors as well and a lot of times it's as simple as vector addition is the same as scalar addition but you just add the X's and you add the Y's and that's really where I'm gonna start but what I think I prefer to do is rather than go through a laundry list which is how the book does this to a bit more extent of of vector math one at a time I'm going to take the next step in the random Locker example and discover what kinds of vector math I need as I'm going and start to talk about the different functions vector math functions I need as I get to them so but you might want to look and sort of wonder like what are all the things that I can do with vectors and one of the reasons to use the p5 vector class beyond just your own x and y variables is that all of these common operations exist as functions in the p5 vector class itself like add subtract multiply divide magnitude magnitude squared dot product cross product distance normalized limit heading rotate so many so many things so I expect that over the course of many many videos throughout this whole series I will get to a lot of these but you also might just take a moment to pause and click through and look at some of these yourself okay all right I'm sorry I'm just enjoying the chat I'm reading it but not reading it loud I'm just enjoying it to myself I want to show you my hilbert Dilbert curb thing that I made before I leave I'll show you a little a little teaser little teaser of the hilbert curve video that's coming out tomorrow one thing I like about doing these coding in the Cabana videos is I love all the stuff that I do and but sometimes it feels a little bit like okay Here I am releasing a new video that's the same thing that I did two weeks ago livestream so I do like the fact that it's like it hasn't no one's seen it yet and if you're thinking about joining as a member I will share it hopefully you know we're kind of like getting into the it's gonna be like up it's gonna be ready like a bit lastminute but I try to I would actually I definitely want to share it with the members first in case there's like a glaring error in it which none of us Swift's or working on and have caught okay do I like corn cakes no but I do Stan the king cake baby and if you happen to know what I'm talking about the fact that I stand the king cake baby as you know that reference you know you can at me Gen X here I'm really really really doing a good job okay so in the random Walker example there happens to be some vector math going on I am taking the X component of the position vector the Y component of the position vector and adding a random number to it so let's start by discussing vector addition let's say I have two vectors and often in a let's say have two vectors and in math textbook scenario often vectors are written as ya let's say that I have two vectors we'll call them U and V actually you know that's a very the U and V the way I write U and V it always looks too similar let's just call them a and b vector a and vector B and vector notation that you might see in a your math textbook often uses the arrow on top of the letter to say this this represents the vector a this represents the vector B and let's say the vector a is 3 comma 4 and let's say the vector B is I don't know 2 comma negative 1 I want to examine what do I mean when I say vector A plus vector B so this is actually a really simple operation to do because the answer if this was C actually just involves adding the components together so this would be 5 comma 3 because 3 plus 2 is 5 and 4 plus negative 100 4 minus 1 is 3 incidentally while we're here I'll just say that a minus B vector subtraction is also what you probably imagined it would be the X component minus the X component the Y component minus the Y component and this would extend into any dimensional space if my vector had 10 numbers in it it would be the same thing so this would be 1 comma 4 minus negative 1 is 4 plus 1 which is 5 so these are how these operations actually work however while this is so incredibly simple I think it's worth taking a moment to actually look at how this appears in a diagram because this really relates to how we're using vectors in a 2d p5 canvas so let's stick with our upsidedown p5 space there's no demi Gorgons here we'll be fine that reference is totally not gonna matter um so at some point in the future this is zero zero and I'm suggesting that a a we're oh wait how do I want to do this no no no no no never mind I don't want to get into position and velocity just yet the Debbie Gorgon reference will not make it into the edited video go back well maybe it will maybe I'll add it back in uhhuh let's think about our Cartesian space the one where Y points up not the upsidedown one with that Demi Gorgon in it and we have the vector a which I can think of as I'm not gonna draw let's think about our carts two dimensional Cartesian space the one where Y points up and X points to the right so not the upsidedown one what would be Gorgon in it no Demi gordon's here and so the vector three comma four would be one two three whoops one two three four so this is vector a and vector B is 1 2 and negative 1 so this is vector B so a and B adding vectors the resulting vector C which is a plus B is the vector that point that that results from putting these two end to end so it doesn't matter which one I do first but I'll start with any and then I'm going to put B on the end and B was 2 negative 1 so like this that's B that means this vector here is C this is the resulting vector that you get from a plus B incidentally the vector you get from a minus B would be just take be the same B and put it in the negative direction because this is like representing minus B and then the result of a minus B would be this vector so in that case which vector goes on the end of which is quite important because a minus B is quite different than B minus a or is a plus B and P plus a are the same the reason why I mention this is because now if we go to our upsidedown world the world of P 5 and I have this idea of a position the position vector which gives us instructions of how to get from the origin to some location in the canvas and what I want to do is have this thing move animate live in a physics world and respond to forces that's where I'm going with this I want to add to the concept of position I want to add the concept of velocity and if this happened to be velocity then the neck if I take velocity and add it to position then and restore that back into position then I have a new position and then I do it again I take that velocity and add it again and then I have a new position so the object the Walker so to speak is moving from position to position position while adding the velocity over and over again now if that velocity should ever change that's gonna make things much more interesting but let's just start with this concept okay so I am going to add to my walker a variable called ve L for velocity I'm going to say create vector and I'm just gonna hard code something in it just to see that right now I'm gonna say 1 comma 0 then now what I'm essentially saying is that these numbers these random numbers that I was picking in the random Walker example that I was adding to position out x position not Y those are the equivalent of the components of the velocity vector so if I add put replace those with the x and y components of this dive velocity now I have what do I have I have a dot that's moving to the right I should probably change it from a dot so it's a little easier to see to an ellipse and let's run this sketch oh and let me know how also erase the background because ultimately the random the idea of the trail of the Ren Walker was where I was before that example but now I'm moving into a body that's going to hopefully eventually respond to physics and I think this visually makes more sense with background and draw there we go this object is moving this circle is moving by its velocity this circles this circles position is changing according to its velocity every cycle through draw I'm gonna change this now to 1 comma negative 1 and can you imagine which direction it's gonna go when I hit play think about it did you say up and to the right if you did you're right I could make it random and so I could put like some random numbers in here but ah this is a nice boat oh wait no no this is not where I want to go next it's not where I want to go next what time is it 1126 okay oh how I am missing something so important here though the whole point of where I started all this discussion was looking at the reference and talking about vector math and how they're all these functions for common vector math operations like the ad function but I'm not using the add function why aren't I using the add function well here is the most confusing aspect of this looking at this you see this dot paws dot x equals itself plus this dot velocity X it's just like x equals x plus speed maybe as a next step comment these out and just say this dot paws equals this dot paws plus this dot velocity ultimately this is what I'm doing right to add the velocity to the position yeah the components together but I don't care about the components I just want to add this vector to this vector so just add those vectors together let's run the code why not let's see what happens isn't it nice how JavaScript just like does it give you any errors like I don't know you try to do something whatever I couldn't do it I just won't draw anything I wish I had an error here because the error I would want it to give me would say I don't know how to use the plus operator with p5 dot vector I wish that I did and I personally need to hand wishes that JavaScript there was a way for me to tell it how to use the plot plus operator with p5 dot vector and some programming languages do allow you to overload what the operators do I think C++ is one maybe but javascript is not one it knows no more how to add these two vectors together that it would two fonts or two p v dot images and so in order to add them together we need to instead of using the plus operator I don't know why I'm coming over here but we need to use the add function and all of the vector math operations that I use over and over again probably throughout these videos I need to find a function in there that does that operation breaking news I'm being told that Python also allows you to overload the operator so instead of this so instead of this so instead of this I will say this dot pause dot add this dot velocity it's a bit of a mouthful it's kind of a lot of dots here but let's just take a moment to breathe this in ultimately if you forget about the this dots for a little bit I'm saying a dot add be right back to this example of two vectors a and B I've got a not add B add B to a add B to a add this object's velocity to this object's position and now when I run it we've got what we had before I can delete all this extra code and here we are [Laughter] Zachary McArthur writes forget about the dis dot there's a whole song about never forgetting that this dots indeed indeed there is okay what else do I want to say here I know what I want to do I mean I really could be done like this is the end here and the next I mean the things that I need let's make a list of the things I need to talk about if I go to the chapter it could be a good reference did subtraction I mean I should ah yes okay I mean I definitely want to talk about magnitude and normalize and then addict celebration in this is the thing that I'm trying to figure out when I want to talk about so I think I want to do a whole separate video about the static and nonstatic things so that's not gonna come up now I guess guess what I'll do is do a little bit of an aside about getting a random vector I mean where that could be yeah I think there's this really nice thing that I want to show which is how it's different to pick a rant a vector that has the X and y between negative 1 1 and actually picking a random vector of length 1 so that I can show that I can do with like bolt that I can use like multiply and talk about normalize with so does that like a separate video I'm so confused because this is okay I think this is gonna I think I should wrap this one up go and sleep when will you talk about cross and dot product 2021 that's probably about how much time it'll take me to get to it unless I quit all the other things I'm doing in my life and just make these videos every day then I'll be then I'll be talking about it next Wednesday all right okay okay no no I'm gonna just like yeah I'm gonna just blip this in here all right okay one thing you might be asking yourself right now before I'm anyway I'm pretty much finished with this but one thing you might be asking yourself right now anything it's worth sort of like tacking this on here no no no I'm gonna do this in a separate video I think should be short they should have the thing in and they want I'm not putting ads on them so it doesn't matter if there's like five videos in a row that's opposed to just one so that's what I'm gonna do so this ends so this is the end of this piece in the sense that I've talked about what vector math is it's taking a mathematical operation and applying it to vectors ad being a primary example or at least our first example of that and the concept of velocity as being a vector that changes the position over time one question you might be asking yourself is well what if I wanted to go back to that random walk and have the velocity be random every frame like how would I go about doing that and I think I want it like that's what and I think I want to cover that in a separate video because there's actually a really interesting thing that happens when you pick random vectors as opposed to picking random an x and y values separately and I want to show that in a video on its own so I'm gonna do that next and then once I finish with that I will come back and start looking at and once I finish with that I will come back and start looking at other vector math operations magnitude normalize multiply in the context of setting and acceleration for our random Walker so it doesn't just have a position and a velocity but it also has an acceleration so I'll see you there okay Raphael Alfaro says my cousin is a student at ITP trying to think of who your cousin could be alright do I have time yes I'm gonna do the next one this is gonna be a separate sketch for a second come on Internet don't fail me now Oh No Oh No did this save mmhmm I mean this was pretty easy to recreate it's a temporary glitch oh boy this is like um snow day it's equivalent of snow day p5 web editor down somewhere in the depths of my computer I have the keys to reboot the server but I think it's really down you know what happened did I break it did we break it somebody watching it strolling this channel crashing the server and purpose that would be very sad for everybody all around do I get to go home early today if if it doesn't come back I'm gonna show you the hilbert curve and get going I mean I could do this obviously without the p5 web editor but I don't want to the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is that to whose quote is that can I show you guys I should show you guys mice my son is learning scratch and him and my daughter is also learning scratch she's a little bit younger so she hasn't really she just started where he's been doing it for quite a while he made this game which was really cool but I don't have the link to it all right first of all did you know that there's an alpha version of processing for and Albert Hilbert render let's see what is in these so this is the example that decoding in the Cabana video goes through I just want to change something I'm gonna zoom way in here you can see what it's drawing here this continuous path this is called a spacefilling curve this is one single continuous line I can see it going and going and going we can just watch it Mizzou back out and actually what I'm sorry one thing I was working on that we're trying to decide whether it should actually go in the video because it's very hard to see this at the end when I finish it shoot how do I just give me a second here because this is gonna oh this is actually another thing I was trying to do who has an error well shoot I wanted to show you this thing p5 editors back ok oops p5 editors back I wanted to show you this other thing but oh so I'm really excited for the hilbert curve because i think it's a really good project for people to make their own oh yeah that's back to make their own I'm just gonna copy paste this yeah I'm gonna have to leave the site it's a really good project for people to make their own variations of let's try so one thing is if you haven't joined the discord please join the discord because we're planning to kind of organize around the hilbert curve there and have people make lots of art projects and creative variations of it so join for that I don't know why I can't get the editor back I'm gonna restart my browser oh and gone again yeah oh that was interesting let's log in Lane oops wrong button get it the right button well well well well not not good you know what's going on processing foundation does has very very limited resources to main maintain these free and open source tools and so I would encourage you to support the processing foundation which you can do to do on the support website I believe also this is still active if I go to the coding train and go here I think I you at at I created a YouTube fundraiser for the processing foundation I should just put it on all high videos frankly but at least on this one if I click on it oh where is the fundraiser how come it doesn't show usually the fundraiser shows up here did it end maybe am i zoomed in I don't know why I don't see the front click no joy no subscribed I don't know why the fundraiser isn't there I wonder if it speak like by accident this like member thing is overlaying it but anyway but hopefully you could find that YouTube fundraiser processing foundation wait ah look you came back right okay alright I got ten minutes before I gotta go oh I just want to see is this where it was yeah that's where it was okay great so I want to make a new sketch and we call this random vectors and let's just say sorry I'm thinking about how I want to do this actually this could be the video both about static functions and not static functions but give me a second here oh there's a lot that I could do by doing this example so just give me a second here line okay alright that kind of threw me for a little bit of a loop there cuz I don't have a ton of time but let me see what I can do here okay don't want to call this I'm doing the random thing and the static thing it's kind of like two topics should I do them separately I'm making them separately okay all right okay hi so this is another video about working with p5 dot vector and create vector and p5 Jess hi so this is another video about working with p5 dot vector and creep it let's say you think why do I want to change this thing hi so this is another video about working with vectors in p5.js so I want to demonstrate something in this video which is about picking random vectors no no hello welcome to another video about working with vectors in p5 GS so the topic of this one is I want to just look at what it means to create a random vector and some things that come up with that I in the way I'm opening up a bit a bit of a can of vector e workers but I think this is gonna veer off into a bunch of different math functions I might need it also is gonna veer into the territory of talking about something called a static function but I'm gonna try to just shoot but I'm gonna try to take this slow and just look at creating a random vector for a moment so looking at this this deep breath I'm gonna start this discussion by looking at this example that has two vectors a vector called I need Simon is telling me that I didn't do vector multiplication exactly that's exactly what I'm going to end up needing to do and magnitude all this is gonna come up this is how I'm doing it okay it's not cold in here it's warm the example that I'm going to work with starts with just two variables v1 and v2 and they're two vectors one with X&Y of 200 200 one with X&Y of 100 zero so what I'm doing in this is I'm drawing a line between the location opposite I'm drawing the line between the position v1 x v1 dot y and the result of adding v1 and v2 together well well let me just start this whole thing over Oh I can't do this without this the static thing is making me crazy I really just need to I think I need to do the I you know anything through the static one first or I should just be less crazy about this you know what I got it I got it everybody oh I'm such a doodoo doodoo face I know what I'm gonna do I have a much simpler way of doing this I got it I want to do the other thing but I need to talk about static functions that's why it was okay there we go okay hello so this is another video on working with vectors and p5.js and in this video I really just want to talk about what it means to make a random vector which seems like why is there even a whole video about that but I have a point to this which I will get to um it also was I think useful because it's kind of opening up this can of worms vector e worms which I want to open up because I'm gonna end up looking at some other math functions that I need it's gonna lead me to something about static functions but that'll be in the next video right now I just want to look at this example that I have and what I have here is first of all notice I'm translating the coordinate space to the center of the canvas this is very important because I want to treat just for this visual demonstration I want to treat zero zero as the center of this canvas then I'm making a vector with an X component of 100 and a Y component of zero and I'm representing the vector as a line from zero zero to the x and y so it would be nice if I could draw a little hat on the end so it looks like an arrow but that's gonna be too much work I could change these numbers you know negative 150 and you can see there's my line so let's just think about first what would it mean to pick a random vector well the first instinct might be this which is a very reasonable instinct let's make a vector that has between negative 100 and 100 as it's X and this is gonna start getting very long I'm gonna have to drag this way over negative 100 as it's y that's like the range of stuff that I'm picking and if I run the sketch you know every single frame it is picking a new value for x and y and I'm seeing that line point often in directions so this is a random vector generator in a way and but I want to show you something a little bit odd which is that if I take background 0 and put it into setup what do you expect to see I'm going to see collect over time every single vector that points from anywhere from 0 0 to what something with an x and y minimum maximum between negative 100 100 let's run this I'm gonna let this play out for a little bit look at that result I am seeing all of the vectors fill up a square it's the worst drawn square ever write any vector this vector this vector this vector this vector right because minimum maximum this is you know this is zero zero in many cases when working with vectors however it's quite common that you want to pick a vector with a random direction but a fixed magnitude what do I mean by that here the direction and the magnitude it's all random and the magnitude even has kind of this arbitrary range because this is the longest vector possible but if I go to extend to here this one is actually shorter what would it mean for me to pick vectors that fill out a circle well there is something in that there is something called a unit vector and a unit vector is a kind of vector which really just a unit vector is a vector that talks about that the unit vector is a vector of length one that's the unit with any with with any direction so it's a kind of vector that you use when you only really want to talk about the direction then the magnet doesn't matter let's just pick one as a standard and let's now pick a direction so what if I wanted to pick any unit vector any vector of length one but in any direction whoops so I could start to look into some trigonometry math to do this and I will come to that soon enough but instead of instead of had you know but one of the benefits of working with vectors in p5.js is there's a function that'll pick a random unit vector for you and that function is just called random 2d because I want a random 2d vector V equals P v dot vector dot random 2d now there's something really odd about this which is I'm calling this function random 2d p v dot vector dot random 2d la what is all that so this is veering off into this other topic about static functions and I'm gonna talk about that and cover that in the next video but for right now let's just understand this as a function that returns a random unit vector so now if I were to run this Oh what's going on here oh look at all those random unit vectors they're all of length one well I can't really visually see what's going on because one pixel isn't very much I could use a scale I could try using the scale function to kind of blow things up but this is a really nice opportunity for me to talk about another vector math function multiply where we timewise all the good is they gotta go I'm gonna finish this out I think I had this by the way something like this remember when I had vectors a and B and I said a plus B is add the X's together add the Y's together and I'll get eight comma three that's dessert the numbers I used before but I think this math is correct now and and and the function in p5 to do this was added now what if I wanted to use the idea of multiplication with vectors oh my goodness could I say a times B I kind of can but vector multiplication the vector product is a whole other topic that I'll cover eventually but you might have heard of things like the dot product or the cross product or the hard meru how what's that called the hat miroux the heart no that's Hadamard product or even something called the Hadamard product but I'm not covering those now when I say vector multiplication I'm talking about scaling a vector well when I say multiplication when I'm referring to this function in p5 called mult for multiply I'm talking about scaling the vector multiplying the vector by a scalar quantity so in other words I'm talking about saying a times not another vector but like the number 2 and what do I mean when I say that if I have a vector that's pointing in a given direction with a given magnitude like 3 so let's actually make it 5 because I'm gonna use the 3 4 5 triangle if I multiply it by 2 now I have that same vector so it's sorry no I have a different vector but it's the same direction with lengths twice as much so the length of this vector is 10 and the way that this works is if it's a three four five if the components are three and four because it's a 3 4 5 triangle then all I have to do is multiply each component so if I want to take a and multiply it by 2 the vector I would get is 6 comma 8 3 times 2 4.com times 2 so in this case after I picked this random unit vector which has length 1 I can scale it to any quantity by saying V multiplied 100 and think about what's gonna happen now I'm gonna run this sketch and I get any vector always of length 100 pointing in any direction this opens up incidentally a lot of possible just like visual possibilities just from this alone and certainly I could change this and say Oh any vector between 50 and 100 and I should probably give this some alpha to sort of see and we can see now I have any vector it's a minimum length 50 maximum length 100 and just from that I'm getting this sort of like nice visualization that would be harder to do without these builtin functions in vectors but so this though there's a lot more to this I might return back it might be useful now to return back to this random Walker example and I can see now I'm sorry before I move on let's just quickly move back to this Walker example and see that I could now say this top velocity equals P 5 vector random 2d and this would now be a way of taking a Walker and every time I run the sketch it's going to go in a random direction the speed the magnitude of the velocity is always going to be one so I could also randomize that to some value between like zero and three whoops this dot velocity dot multiplied whoops and now you're seeing just another way of thinking about how you might initialize something with randomness and maybe Perlin noise could play a role here is there some way you can create an array of all these walkers with initial velocities according to Perlin noise if you go back and look at my Perlin noise videos that might create some interesting trails you could consider but i'm but but i'm going to stop here and let you do some variations on this now that you see about how random 2d works and multiply works there is another aspect to this though that I want to unpack which is what does it mean to call a function like dot multiply which is on a vector V versus a function like random 2d which is not on a specific vector but on the type of thing itself P v dot vector so I'm gonna come back and that's what that's called a static function I'm gonna cover that in a separate video and then after that we'll be ready to start looking at acceleration and all the other good stuff magnitude and normalize and all that sort of stuff ok so thanks for watching this one and I'll see you in the next one bye okay alright everyone I've got to go thank you for tuning in I don't know why I don't hear that oh I hear it now um Oh Valentine's Day coding challenge oh no I know I'm gonna get give me an idea huh shoot all right I've got to go thank you for watching I can try to answer a question or two time assign me to spin the wheel for the command I'm not prepared to do that today so I'll have to do that another time I don't think I have the I don't remember what's on the list I don't have a link to the wheel we need but someday we'll have all sorts of systems like this so these will come out as edited videos okay you know it might take out some time stay tuned you know but I don't I I know I said the videos the hilbert curve Cabana video will be released tomorrow that's the plan but you know let me just say by Monday at the latest sometime this weekend heart curve I did the heart curve last year Marcos you have a good nice weekend also I've got a lot of things going on today what else what sweaters like reminders you can check out the new coding train store as standard TV slash coding train you can add your contributions to your projects you make on the coding train website please join the discord the stay tuned by the way one thing I'll show you is working on some new thumbnails these are sort of in progress when I say I on this were designed by Simon who designs thumbnails for standard although I'm making some tweaks with Jason who did these illustrations but this is the these are the two that I did so far and the hilbert curve should be here very soon what else I think that's it can you do oh I'll be a processing community day tomorrow if any of you are going to prosecute a in New York there's also just sort of like more generally there's community to a worldwide which I'm in the wrong place yes so if you're interested in attending an event where you can meet people in real life take a look at all these community days happen all over the world projectile motion coding challenge that's a great idea so that could be interesting to do some once I get through a lot of these basics to pick sort of a topic that could be a coding challenge that's based on those I like that idea somebody to remind you that have you seen in Twitter I mentioned doing a nice tweet where a I cannot recognize optical illusion between a hare and a duck Alexi I did not see that I'll have to try to take a look for that all right thanks everybody goodbye have a wonderful weekend and I will see you next week hopefully is next week the week that I'm away yes but I'm not leaving till Friday so next week Thursday or Friday there'll be a live stream okay hopefully this is the ending animation autotuned and the internet will fix that unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it does not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do I'm really getting something I need my sound that was invalid syntax I forgot generation analysis things so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven this is like Perlin noise performance part like birthing noise performance apart with curling noise I might pick numbers like this by purling noise that is early noise so this is hurling noise that is Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no so this is Hurley noise this is but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this like I always forget to do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista somebody composed that song for me
