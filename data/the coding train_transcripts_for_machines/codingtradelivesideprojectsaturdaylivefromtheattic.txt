good morning check one two check one two let me pause the music and how's my audio there is a fan blowing which i might turn off but it'll be a little bit of noise because of that but let me know how the audio is going and see you all in a minute me good morning oh my head is cut off uh hello my watch band matches my hat and that's what i have to say to you today on this side project saturday on the coding train i hope everyone's doing well we reach over here and grab this well i'm awake it is a saturday it is a beautiful day outside and i'm here in the attic in brooklyn new york to talk to you the people the passengers of the train about code and other types of things and update on the the what's the news today in creative coding is there any perhaps any wait a second this just in um the coding train news desk where are my papers to russell uh i got nothing um i do have some new videos coming out soon on the coding train i said this one last week a video on object detection using the ml5.js library that will be coming out as well as three new uh videos uh tutorials about how to make your own discord bot i just want to make a little plug here as i begin uh about the coding train discord first of all while i'm here let me also thank the sponsor of today's coding train brilliant uh brilliant is a interactive website for learning and boy do they have a lot of stuff there that's good for ideas for creative coding and a lot of related content to the coding train so check out um brilliant uh the website brilliant.org um sign up for an account for free at brilliant.org codingtrain and if you want to unlock all the premium content all the courses everything there's a lot you can do for free but all the premium stuff um if you use that you'll get a 20 off uh coupon on a premium subscription for at least the first 200 people who sign up all right what i wanted to mention about the discord um is that i am running a bot the choo choo bot and if i type in the words choo choo right here it's going to reply to me ding oops we could try another one oh and it gave me some nice emojis so um that's coming soon i'm um hoping to launch a brand new series a sequence set of tutorials about how to make your own discord bot um in the coding train discord server itself um there is the disk stream bot which i encourage you to check out maybe somebody who's watching can put the website for disstream chat which is a chat manager tool for live streaming that's some coding trained viewers have put together and you can support their patreon i'm planning some possible ideas to use that in a future live stream so i will come back to that but i do want to plug the discord because i am really trying to build the discord community um i find it just to be such a uh a great place for getting help on your code discussion around code for me to engage with the community oh oh mini jimmy in a second i'm in the wrong place mini jimmy welcome to being a passenger on the coding train today is october 10th that's 10 10 20 20 an auspicious day with a bunch of numbers in it that all add up and relate to each other and work very well with our decimal system but you as a member of the coding train now new member have won your very own random number and it is wait someone's keeping track of this right is there by the way um hiring new position available for the coding train random number keeper kind of like gamekeeper or um other sorts of various keeper like positions uh 73 935 mini jimmy minnie jimmy i recognize your name oh my goodness welcome ah darsh bhutan you are a brand new member of the cody train which means that at some point in the future you might receive in the mail some stickers yes that's right stickers there are pieces of paper that are sticky on the back and you will put them onto something like maybe your laptop or your new poster with your own random number on it which is 37 hundred and thirty one and also i should mention you know there's a lot of stuff for everybody on the discord i don't i don't really love the idea of exclusive spaces but um in the discord um there are some uh channels for um coding trained members where we have a few extra things and um i do often uh live stream for members when i'm recording a tutorial uh as well so if you want to tune in to some of the behind the scenes coding stream stuff uh you can join as a member um but one of the things that i've been wanting to get is discord partnership status um i don't know why i want that i just want it because it's a thing you can have and i don't have it uh but i've applied a bunch of times and most recently i looked and one of the thresholds i don't meet uh the coding train discord does not meet is first week member retention so i don't know if that means just like somebody signs up i don't think it's how many people keep their account after they signed up it must be how many people return back to the discord the coding trained discord and you have to be above 20 and currently the last week my number was around 16 so if there's any new folks here i'm going to press my discord button which will put a link to the invite to the discord in the chat um please join and uh then stay for a week then you can go then you could go then you could go but a week come back every day for a week decide if you like it and then you can go lots of fun stuff happening in the discord it's a great place to share your work um chat with fellow community members i would like to mention what's very important a little bit confusing is if and when you join there is the readme channel which has the code of conduct and lots of extra information about the different roles and rules and how things work and then you will not have access to the coding train uh discord server uh all the rest of the channels until you react with an emoji i'm like pointing as if i have much more space to point but i only can point to here unless you react with an emoji to the code of contact itself to indicate that you've read it don't just react read it okay there we go here we are oh it's so nice to be with you all what am i gonna do today well one of the things i like to begin with is community contributions yes right here on the coding train you as a watcher of the coding train can make your own creative code projects and share them with the community and sometimes i'll spin a wheel to pick your project and feature it right here on saturday's live stream so um boy this is really loud in my ear i don't know how loud it is for all of you uh so let's see let me find the wheel i'm gonna go over here to uh issues this is how i find the wheel we all know i can't possibly use something like a bookmark or a napkin or some way i've just gotta find the issue that's open here that says is it not in the topics oh it's in the website repo oh my god here we go going to the website repo oh i should talk about hacktoberfest oh so by the way um if hacktoberfest is something that you're interested in participating please read this issue here we are a github repo that is participating in oktoberfest because of a lot of the spam problems with hacktoberfest um you now as a an open source project have to opt into it and i really like to participate in these things that welcome new people into open source even though it caught there's a bit of uh extra layers of work involved in sort of managing what what is spam um um i think it's worth it um and so what is hacktoberfest you're asking i it's i think it's put on by digitalocean not a sponsor but hey i'm here digitalocean i used you i have some droplets i run my bots on your droplets how many people can say that to you with love um so uh and i believe if you uh i don't don't quote me on this i'm not an official representative but i believe if you get four poll requests accepted into open source projects that are participating they will send you a tshirt or plant a tree um and it's a nice thing to participate in but i would really encourage you to read this um github issue uh thank you to violet craze who uh put this together and other contributors who added it who um um and you can see here here are all the here are a lot of the sort of like probably most of these are some of this sort of more spammy and they're not necessarily spam and then with malicious intent just people are trying we we can't accept your pull request really if it's just like changing one word or kind of messing up the site in some other way but the the best thing for you to do is make a community contribution and if i go over here to contribute and go to this community contribution guide you can find out more so let's get to that wheel um if i could just find it oh right issues uh we'll link there it is thank you to gypsy dangerous for putting together this wheel and i am now going to spin that wheel all right what are we going to see today everybody number ooh 13 13 whoo spooky by the way this might be the first year that i actually do a halloween special because halloween is on a saturday october 31st i'm just gonna be at home because hey we're all staying at home these days my costume will be a masked person i don't know maybe i'll have something else um oh we'll do something fun for halloween maybe remind me about that manta gets closer uh 13 let's see remove and view selected ah we have selected koji version oh this is going to be fun so this is based on it would seem the um angry birds coding challenge where i use mater.js which is a physics library to create uh an uh sort of like simplified version of an angry birds game in p5.js um then i'm going to go here and click on it so i i don't i it seems like it's probably unlikely just through the law of probabilities that um dissolve dissolvement is not here in the chat but if you happen to believe please hit me with some siren emojis so i can see that you're here and um maybe ask you some questions about your project so let's go here angry birds oh okay fun angry birds with koji oh wait koji must be some kind of like other live library or create interactive posts so with koji i do not know what this is we build software that evolves hey wait a second i'm now having a memory i think i have some emails and i was supposed to have a call with the folks from koji um let's look at about um uh uh i i have a memory of having a bunch of emails about this and talking with them i'm trying to see if i can recognize a name who knows or maybe i'm just imagining it okay but anyway this was made with koji let's try playing it oh and i'm in the way here we go i think i can get all three i'm gonna try to get all three here we go do i get it back do i get another try i want another try please no i just have to refresh the page all right here we go i think maybe if i go for the bottom one the top two will fall over all right here we go i'm so bad at this okay regret all right i'm this is this time when you get it okay can't can't defeat me angry dot here we go yes sort of kind of all right that was awesome um great so this looks to me like it's pretty much identical to the actual coding challenge itself but ported into a different environment which i always love to see and that is in particular something quite great for the community um and if you want to learn more about this angry birds coding challenge and see other i i assume it will sort of come up uh here is the first link um so we can see there there are actually only two only two community contributions to the angry birds coding challenge that's kind of a surprise i would have thought that would be a more popular one oh you versus texas college football version okay i i have my sports fandom but it is not college football so i know nothing about this uh but i'm kind of curious to see so this is oh you and that must that's that like texas longhorns is that what they're called something like that all right this is great uh that's fun to see um you know the sort of theming it with uh some some a particular i can't seem to hit anything uh something you're passionate or excited about come on let me at least get a couple of these oh you you're not doing very well there we go awesome uh all right let's go back to our wheel see if we can get another one here everybody and swift potato in the chat is saying um i love to port these to vanilla javascript and that's great and that's that's particularly wonderful because one of the requests that i get most often in the comments is why do you use people i don't know why i'm imitating the voice of a youtube here's my voice of youtube commenter why don't you use p5js but really you're all wonderful nice people you're just asking friendly questions like why don't why do you oh wait no no that's not the end of the question it's uh i wish you would uh do your tutorials in vanilla javascript i wish you wouldn't use frameworks you know that's just i get it sometimes it feels um there's a reason for wanting to sort of learn from the sort of like base default api javascript browser api but i am a person who really likes to use frameworks and use them for particular reasons and p5.js i could go on and on about lots of reasons why i choose to use it but um it's wonderful when people from the community can can contribute a version that helps me help me and others see ah these are other ways to look at the same problem or we can learn more about how p5.js works by looking underneath the hood at vanilla or native javascript all right number 53 is um oh gram scan algorithm using a generator function oh this is going to make simon tiger simon tiger's gonna is watching is gonna be so happy simon has been asking me to do a video tutorial on generator functions and use generator function guess what i have something to admit to you i i kind of loosely maybe understand the concept of generator function but i i couldn't you you could like come up here and be like here's my suitcase full of a million dollars if you can read generator function right now it's yours i don't think i'd be getting that suitcase any time soon so it's something that i really should look into i have been wanting to do more just quick new features in javascript videos um and so maybe that's something that could go add to a side project saturday to kind of learn generator functions um but let's take a look at the original challenge uh which was the gift wrapping um challenge this was one day back of days days in more innocent times before i i mean maybe this is in 2020 but if it was it was much earlier in 2020 when i thought i was going to make a lot of computational geometry coding challenges i would still like to do that um and i did a sort of like a first start with this gift wrapping challenge which is finding the uh convex hull or the contours around an enclosed set of dots um and let's take a look let's just see what the example looks like like what my example looks like i'm not logged in here we can see this is animating this particular algorithm that's finding it's called the gift wrapping algorithm and i should log in by the way let me just do that so that that is done and then let's go back here and see a gram scan algorithm cool so now i'm trying to remember i remember researching this and i um and and looking at gram scan and looking at gift wrapping and then there were some other particular algorithms i can't i don't recall um and i should let this finish sorry wonderful so first of all what one thing that i particularly i have an affinity for that i really love are uh projects that animate the process of an algorithm and this is actually quite hard to do right it's typically at least in my experience much easier to implement an algorithm and show the final result which is generally what you need you want to use an algorithm to achieve a particular result but for artistic purposes for educational purposes it's often worth sort of peeling back and and and peeling the layers of the onions so to speak and dividing them into different layers of the onion so that you can watch one layer of the onion at a time in an animation is this metaphor working probably not but um this is something that i really like to do to watch the process of an algorithm unfold for um all sorts of various reasons so i appreciate seeing that with this um example um and let me look up because i want to um remind myself about this algorithm so maybe somebody can tell me this is a method of finding a convex whole of a finite set of points we can see it animating right over here the time complexity is o and long n oh oh i feel like i should go get my ukulele because i feel like we should write a song about o n log n it just it just yells out to me like i'm i'm a song it's named after ronald graham who published the original algorithm in 1972 the year before i was born thank you very much yes yes i know i know i'm old although really it's all time is relative um and it uses a stack to detect and remove concavities in the boundary efficiency so this is different than what i did right gift wrapping algorithm what i did was the gift wrapping algorithm which was published in 1973 all right tate jarvis r.a jarvis get with it graham scan 1972 year ahead of you 1973 the year that i was born um and it has o and h time complexity so is that where n is the number of points and h is the number of uh wait which is which is faster n log n or n h i would assume n log n is faster right but um these are two different algorithms so um that's great to see what are some other convex hole algorithms that you could do if they don't uh um algorithms uh convex whole algorithms let's see if we've got a list here uh is there a gram scan gram scan um gift wrapping jarvis march hey wait a second yeah uh gift wrapping o n h gram scan o n log n n log n is faster everybody's saying the chat thank you for confirming that for me i could have done that math in my head but i'm really concentrating on putting words next to each other coming out of my mouth to speak to you you know i'm just a person in a room here and i've got to keep talking or else there's dead air oh you know i need a cricket or a tumbleweed sound effect somebody get on that simon's sending me um simon sending me a generator function card okay let's explore this i want to understand a little bit let's try let's explore generator functions a little bit right now um because that is if i go back to where was i where is my using a generator function so let's look at the code um so one thing this is totally fine i prefer people when they share it to share the um in the p5 web editor not the present view the full view it's kind of silly and you certainly don't have to but that way um if i'm in this view i can quickly get to well where is it oh i think i'm my browser is just off that's weird usually there's oh this is a bug somebody should uh file this for the p5 web editor um in the high contrast view the link in the full view high contrast full view the link to the source code is like black characters on very dark gray so it's really hard to see but i can click there and now i see the code so where is the gem so this is what it means to have a generator function if you put a star this i know if you put a star you get that is a generator function and and then you use this term yield so these are the new things let's let's make my own sketch by the way if you've wondered what side project saturday is it's just me here thinking of random things to do with no logic to them whatsoever although i do have two things on my agenda today that i really do want to get to uh which just to say is one is the live poll continuing the live poll application and two is i want to um augment my object detection example to have some debouncing in it i'll talk about what that means because i want to show that in the video tutorial that is still being put together okay but um generator function ardia said okay boomer which i can only assume is referring to me uh i got one thing to say to you forget the mustard it's karate time what was i saying also we are the city um i have a proclamation i've got some inside jokes that none of you know about and i'm just waiting for the crossover to eventually happen which probably would be a very bad idea so uh all right generator function so if i write a function and i put a star next to it and i said call it choo choo and then i can say something like yield 10 i have no idea what i'm doing here i mean i will look up what a generator function is and i'm sure simon will send me lots more messages explaining it i'm going to write now choo choo can you all see this code um let me move it over a tiny bit and um make it a little bit bigger and let's say console let val equals choo choo console.log now let's just see constructor object so i got an object with nothing admit so i guess a constructor of a generator function gives me back an object yield 10 oh okay okay okay i see i see val equals choo choo then if i say console.log val.next i'm getting an object with the value of 10 so i can do this i got 10. now if i say yield and today is 10 10 20 20. so let's do that 10 10 20 20. if i do this twice i get this is me like sequencing so a generator function is this is like a return value but i can sequence the return values so could i do something weird like this i mean maybe this is not at all how you would ever use a generator function but can i say something like i times 10 and then oh yeah and then and then if i had the draw loop oh i see why you might want to use this with animation because now i can say background val.next.value no all right i'll just say choo choo dot next dot value and then can i give it an argument well i mean that's it and then i can just say i is less than 255 yield i what happens when i get to the end so this should if i'm right show me i've cr i've just written i see why you would use a generator function this is making sense to me now if i have an algorithm that i want to animate but i don't want to have to figure out how to sequence the different steps of the algorithm i can just yield something from the algorithm itself and then ask sort of and ask for uh whatever it's yielding one bit at a time can i put other code after this well we'll find let's see if this works so this should slowly animate to from black to white i would think it's not really working is it hmm i think i did something wrong oh because i made a new i have to have i'm making a new generator each time so it's always starting with zero got it a generator uh i'm this is creating an object that is a generator object so i still need to have something like i would say like um i'll call this looper and i mean the variable names are not making any sense looper equals choo choo and i guess i don't need to like do that in setup i could probably do but i'm just gonna and then i would say looper.next.value right i can't remake the generator object every time through draw because every time then it's gonna give me a zero let's see if this works i'm just turning off my camera for a second because i have to get a tissue oh i i have a new video tutorial that i definitely want to make at some point um whoops okay so that worked but i definitely got an error at a certain point because object arguments is not a valid color so at some point it gives when it gets to the end of the loop what does it return undefined there's no nothing more to yield what did it return undefined so i guess what i would say is uh if b and i probably could say something like while does this a thing you can do while b equals no like this it doesn't like this expected a conditional expression while how do i make this while b is this something you do i guess we'll be able to i don't know i don't know how to do this in one i mean i could certainly say like if b uh and i can do this this would solve the problem for me but this isn't particularly elegant somebody in the chat will tell me a more elegant way of doing this but look at that oh while it has a done field the next has a done or but if uh double equals i think yeah no i know double equals but it won't do the assignment um so someone's telling me that i can say something like like if looper is not done oh oh oh maybe i can say i'm trying to figure out how i say this while true i know uh while result oh oh the looper.next not while though i want to do an if yeah i don't know an if not a while the whole point of this is i'm doing them one at a time in draw and the generator function is the thing that's looping really um yeah um anyway i'm happy with i don't mind having an extra if statement in there i'm just i'm just trying to figure add while true yield 255. oh that's interesting um but that this seems like a bad idea is this actually like that like it seems like such a bad idea is this a time when an infinite loop is okay let me just save this as exploring because is it really not is it building up a big stack first and then peeling them like does it run all this first and then it gives me the values one at a time or does it actually somehow only step through this each time i call next that would be the question looper.next.done i know but um all right so i guess i could say if looper but i don't so i guess i could say something like next equals looper.next if next is not done is this like sort of more proper now uh background next dot value i feel like the lighting in here just changed did somebody have hacked my network all right um i'm gonna take this out for a second here are you looking for this okay here you go this gloria pickle all right don't knock that over okay um it's lazy so it pauses the code every time it gets to a yield statement imagine the generator to have user input it doesn't build it calculates one at a time so marcos and simon and kobe are all telling me this so this is actually totally legitimate um and my um this is the kind this is the time of season when my allergies kick in time of year and it's a lot of anxiety around any small symptoms but i think i'm fine a little runny nose is i can i can tolerate okay wait i just want to see let's run this code i want to move on in a second but this was super interesting to do if next.done is not a function it's a property no unexpected token oh whoops we need a parenthesis there all right this looks good excellent and now what everybody's telling me is this is actually okay for me to say oh i'm scared i'm scared let's play this sound we're gonna write it in for the loop we're gonna run it and we're gonna like it looking good i can even comment this is now irrelevant because it will do that forever let's see if we get an error message now it's never going to be done generator functions all right so i i think there's a lot more that i could do with this um and simon writes the way i normally use a generator function is if i have code that i want to pause at some point then i put that code in a generator function and i put a yield statement every time i want to pause it that's interesting um and kobe writes imagine the generator to have user input so um this is super helpful okay so um i i think that i this is actually terrific um and what i like about this is one of the things i was worried about with generator functions i thought oh maybe i shouldn't really use that with animation because i don't like to have two asynchronous threads going on and one is doing the drawing and i don't know if the value is updating in the right order but this is not a separate asynchronous thread really this is about me being able to write some code that i can sort of like pause and step through almost like a debugger like go to the next line go to the next line um so and then draw can just always call next and animate oh this is amazing this is going to change my life this is a lifechanging moment on the coding train this is historic are you all here for this oh my god does this exist in like java like is there an equivalent uh java generator function i mean i don't generate a function could mean so many different things generator function equivalent in java iterator that is a generator a thing in python is that where it comes from yield yeah uh looks like there's a stack overflow post i'll have to look into this a little more but once again you know the beauty and wonder of javascript in its sort of like simplicity of syntax which can lead you very astray admittedly as soon as you start to look at it in java it's kind of like oh my god i feel a little sick even though i do i love i need my love sound effect for i love java can someone write a little i love java i like coffee i like tea i like the java jive and it loves me that was pathetic and really out of tune and not melody python has it says um says the chat uh ruby two says uh essay mcqueen mcquenzy um yeah all right um we've gotta move on we're almost at the middle of the live stream we've got 20 minutes till the middle of the live stream where i'll take a break um thank you for uh those two community contributions i would like to look at more i will i'm going to save this code um and if i can remember and someone will help remind me i want to make sure i add this to the description for this video it's a little kind of generator example um all right let's um let's take a moment to relax and read some random numbers no no no no i just got to delete my old lullaby sound all right good morning everyone we've been here on the coding train smooth ride not so bumpy for about 40 minutes what have i done i'm not really sure i can barely remember anything but i would like to read some random numbers helps me wake up in the morning helps me think about what i want to code today and here we are uh you know what hey let's start on page one eventually we'll get through this whole book i'm gonna this is this is a this is another historic moment i'm gonna bookmark where we are i'm gonna read this whole book to you someone will later then edit it all together it's gonna be wonderful page one line one it's actually line zero ten thousand ninety seven thirty two thousand five hundred and thirty three seventy six thousand five hundred and twenty thirteen thousand five hundred and eighty six thirty four thousand six hundred and seventy three fifty four thousand eight hundred and seventy six eighty thousand nine hundred and fifty nine nine thousand one hundred and seventeen oh there's a minute left of this song thirty nine thousand two hundred and ninety two by the way what i love about doing this is i have right on my dashboard concurrent viewers and i just want to i assume that as soon as i start this the viewers are just going to go down and down and down 74 945 all of you watching from all around the world where it's night time and you're saying good night bishwest this is oddly soothing thirty seven thousand five hundred and forty two four thousand eight hundred and five sixty four thousand eight hundred and ninety four seventy four thousand two hundred and ninety six twenty four thousand eight hundred and five twenty four thousand and thirty seven twenty thousand six hundred and thirty six ten thousand four hundred and two eight hundred and twenty two ninety one thousand six hundred and sixty five and that was random number asmr with your host daniel shiffman on a saturday all right i don't do i dare fold over the page i i just got through line zero and line one on page one that's where we are we've got a million numbers to go and each line has 10 numbers we've read 20 numbers you do the math of what percentage completion this is i'm gonna get through this whole book one issue is there's a page missing in my copy uh it's i have to find it i put it somewhere else like so i have to uh i should check eventually at some point i'm gonna get to a missing page um but there we go uh how do i uh i need like a web application that helps me keep track of which random number i'm on so this was line one number uh ten i should count from zero so this is if we're if the book is a two dimensional array i'm at index one nine index row one column nine so really nine one if somebody could just quickly build that for me i could do that as my side project oh and i should use my everyday calendar uh have i read uh have i read random numbers today my everyday calendar is behind the green screen so i don't know maybe i won't do that right now okay so we'll work on that later all right ryan writes i felt like i just went to church for numbers yes hallelujah the random numbers have spoken that is my religion randomness that's that i think that is what has led me to be here with you today drinking from this high clear castle mug with lights pointed at me in an attic in brooklyn new york watching this number called concurrent viewers typing on a computer broadcasting on youtube it's all because of what randomness all right or maybe so this is random this is noise purlin noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm um all right what are we going to do today um i want to work on the live poll application and i want to debounce my um object detection ml5 example i think i'm gonna start with that first because i really need that um so let me save this and let me open up here go to file open and let's go to ml5 uh object detection okay oh this is the hmm wait a second here right this is the example that uses a static image with gloria and greta and let's make sure it works i guess it's loading the model it's taking a while the concurrent viewers went way down during that segment that's so funny all right uh and then now let me open up what i mean to open up which is ml5 object detection webcam okay so we can see by the way a little behind the scenes here i am in an attic there's the ceiling uh the top of the green screen is back there uh and we can see that what um the ml5 object detector does is it is a pretrained model trained off of the coco image data set it's called coco ssd this is a model available from tensorflow.js um it actually only recognizes 80 things and i could pull up that list um if someone wants to find it and put it in the chat it is uh the the coco classes um there's 80 of them um i doubt a train whistle is one of them but you can see a toothbrush is it a baseball bat um i suspect this mug would get recognized oh it's white so i can't see the label it says cup um so um that's this is a good one for me to try to use so what the thing that i want to do and it's a little unfortunate oh you know what i'm gonna do i have an idea this is probably a bad idea i have a separate webcam here and i wonder i kind of want to put this here let's see if i can you'll see what i'm trying to do for a moment by the way look at this great scar i've got on my elbow remember that from a few years ago feeling strong okay um let's see uh what do i want to do let's go to just open up quicktime player for a second and do new uh movie recording and uh okay uh there's the obs virtual camera there's the facetime camera and now this camera this is the new camera i've added the reason why i want to do this should be careful about what i'm showing here facetime i want it to default to the hd pro webcam this is a useful trick by the way um you can write javascript code to select the camera oh the mic is out okay the mic is back um what you're looking for you need the plug yes well you can say yes an outlet that would work with that you're going to have to find one downstairs somewhere okay i don't have one up here uh it's a mic back so by the way this is the actual one time where in discord those who just heard please tag me when you tag me it actually makes a notification sound in my ear i finally set that up but um writing the messages uh uh yeah so and and and uh otherwise and uh this is maybe mostly for simon thank you for your enthusiasm but tagging me less uh for just like little notes is um would be my suggestion so really try to use the tagging me um sparingly because otherwise i'll ignore it um but hopefully it's back now um how um when did that go when did the mic go out anyway i don't know when it went out but what i was talking about is this is very useful there is a way to write javascript code to pick the camera that you want but i find just going into the browser settings and selecting the camera is often uh a great a an easier thing to do because now if i go back to here i should have great this camera so look it recognizes my hand as a person and the cup and it gets person too interesting all right so what i want to do is i want to eliminate the fact you know what i realize i've done this before and i'm going to make this i don't want to make this so super complicated um when i opened the webcam 10 40 10 the time doesn't help me i wouldn't know what i was saying but that's okay uh all right um you know david says tagging me for emergencies only i think there's somewhere in between there like it doesn't have to just be emergencies like it could be that i you know but i don't know what the threshold is but um it can be a little bit lower than emergencies um all right now or maybe we can figure out a way to have a specific like keyword that plays a sound from discord um but um anyway somebody just tagged me except it wasn't in the live chat somebody maybe sent me a message somewhere else because it could be like the problem is there's any discord anywhere so i probably should set up a particular bot or something that listens for a certain thing and then plays a sound effect for me anyway moving on um what i want to do is i want to build uh something quickly here where when i move the cup in and out uh first of all it's sort of like interpolates a little bit so it's smoother and then if it disappears if it loses it for a second it keeps it and i actually now i'm realizing i have done this face detection uh shiftmen let's see uh i i made this example i don't know how to find it so i'm doing it again um let's see here okay so detections hmm this is interesting i have a weird idea uh i'm gonna say i'm gonna change this to an object oh this is exciting this is gonna be an object now when i get the results i'm going to loop through them this is everything that's detected and i am going to say uh the label is results index i dot label believe that's um dot label then i'm going to say if detections dot label now like this so i'm going to make this an object basically the idea of this object is i'm going to do something like this it's going to have a cup array a person array i'm this detections object is going to be a lookup table of all the things that it currently has that it thinks is in the scene and they're all organized by label um so um so if it already exists then i want to basically look at the current list of existing objects and so the current object that i'm looking at is results index i so the label is object.label and then the existing ones are detection.label so now i want to determine i mean this would be much simpler if i knew i only ever was going to have one cup so maybe i should restrict myself to that but if i want to make this totally generic then i could have multiple cups i want to find the per cup that's there that's been there the longest so one thing i could say is if existing dot length is equal to zero then i want to say existing dot push that object so basically if there's nothing there push that object into it the other thing that i want to do this is a little bit weird is i want to add a new property to the object and i'm just going to give i'm going to call this timer because basically i want an object to be able to exist for a certain amount of time then um so i'm going to leave that code there for right now then in draw i am no longer looping through all the detections i want to get all the labels let's do this is object.keys of the detections then for all of the objects of no all of the label of labels loop through all of the labels label oh this is ridiculous no no no detections label okay uh detection objects equals detections label and then i'm going to stop for a second to explain what i'm doing but just give me a second all right basically what i've done now is i have all of the detections organized by label so first i need instead of just looping through all the detections whatever the labels might be i need to get what are all the labels that exist and then for every label what are what are the objects associated with that label and then draw those so this should give me the and it's it's actually only the i have a theory of what's going to happen think to yourself as soon as i put this cup here oh boy i got nothing all right that's weird what did i what did i forget so detections is an object results well let's console.log label here oh did i delete my call back to no no it's detector.detect is still there all right let's see what happens here weird oh results dot length i don't know where i i missed this results.length that's the issue oh it's almost 11. i'm gonna take my break soon see if i can finish this okay cup person cut person so this is a little this is interesting so oh if it doesn't exist if it doesn't exist then existing equals detections label no that's if it does exist so confused oh but if it doesn't exist and the length is zero or i also need to do this right if it doesn't exist um if it doesn't exist i also want to add it so the two times i want to add it is if it exists but the length of the array is zero then i definitely want to put it in there or if it doesn't exist at all then i want to oh i want to say detections label and again wherever my i will refactor this later song is it absolutely needs that um it's an empty array is the mic really loud uh let me know somebody is saying that in the chat all right existing is not defined oh okay so guess what i could do is this right so if it doesn't exist make it an array with that object in it i'm gonna i'm gonna get there people don't worry okay yeah so the first time it happens it detects it and it puts it there so that's good now i want to implement the timer so always the uh for every object its timer should decrement and i'm gonna have a decrement by 10 and i'm going to say if object object.timer is less than zero now i need to remove it so if it ever gets below zero i want to delete that object from the object's array objects splice i1 i want to just get rid of it now if i'm doing splice i technically i should be going through the array backwards and again i'll just play the refactor song over and over again but um because i if i'm taking things out i've i've covered this in countless uh videos and there are other ways of approaching this but so now um let's see this and i want to say fill and let's give it uh some alpha that is the timer so let's see if this works so now what i'm doing is as soon as it detects an object right it fades it out and then it finds the new one let's this is happening so fast let's have the timer just go down by one so now i move this over here it's going to fade out and then it's going to catch the new one it's going to catch the new one so what i want to do now is match dining table i now the next thing i need to do is account for the situation when there's already a cup in the scene so just update the cup that was there with the new bounding box of the cup so in order to do that if existing length is not zero then the algorithm here that i need to implement is find oh and interesting copper france is saying you can do splice i minus minus 1 in normal order find the object that closest so the record distance is um infinity look through um all of the what do i i'm gonna call them options option of detections oh existing candidate let's call them candidates candidate of existing and then the distance and i could use width and height to like do but i'm just going to very very simply look for the distance between candidate x candidate y and object x object y if dist oh and then record dis okay i need an if statement here because if closest equals uh no if distance is less than the record distance the record distance is the new distance and the closest is the candidate then i also want to say candidate.taken equals true so in other words it's very important that i don't assign an existing object to 2 to two new things that it's detected i'm really making this super complicated and uh i will refactor this song and i will take your suggestions but um but but i won't but let me keep going down this road um and see where we go sorry i saw a heart emoji in the chat and from aaron i started out from your videos learning.js and i've recently been learning how to code deep learning machine learning models thank you so much for your tutorials appreciate it a lot thank you aaron so nice of you to say all right uh candidate taken and then um closest so now i would say closest okay so i'm i'm gonna do something a little um copy x y with height so i'm gonna just say uh the candidates no closest equals candidate yeah the closest x should be the object's x there we go and i'm going to use lerp in a moment the closest y is i'm going to update it closest w is the object's width closest height is the object site so when i found the closest one i update it with the new values and then also um no i don't do this here closest taken is true now i say it's taken and also its timer can be reset back to 100. so its timer can be reset back to 100 and then so after i do all of this no no no no sorry everybody this doesn't happen in the loop when i finish going through all the candidates if if there is one that it found is closest and so now i can also say and candidate is not taken right when i'm going if there's multiple objects uh if then i can say if closest otherwise i'm also then once again going to push it in it's a new otherwise it's a new object and let's add it oh this has really become kind of a mess let's review all this logic i don't know if this is right let's review this logic uh i really should this is where i wish i i should have set up my overhand camera with a diagram but i think i can talk through this so what are the various possibilities it detects the cut and let me let me turn the camera off first it detects a cup if it detects this cup it's either totally new cup because there are no cups there or all the other cups are already taken so it either has to like add it as a new cup or match it with something that was there in the previous frame i didn't do a good job explaining that let's try let me just see if i'm sure there's something wrong here let me just see if this even works i'm not resetting taken anywhere very good point so when i get to the point of drawing them all at the end i guess in the beginning um right before i found all the results i guess right here there's got to be a better way to do this but um let me use this loop right here at the beginning right before i'm about to do this evaluation um i want to and boy are there some like higher order one line of code things i could write but i just want to uh right before i start everything existing is not taken right for all the labels and all the objects that are there there none of them are taken so that now um all the candidates are available and they'll only be set to take in there okay let's see if this works all right it is now when i remove the cup it's there and it disappears now look what happens when i remove the cup again if i bring it back it knows it's the same cup so i could actually give everything an id also by the way that would be kind of interesting let's give everything an id i can't believe this worked let's give everything an id uh id count equals zero and whenever i make a new oh boy i make a new object in so many different places so this is why i need to refactor this which i might even do right now and i know i've got to move on but i'm so i this is like so helpful for me to take care of this example right now and maybe i should make this a video um this is like a sort of persistence um and i haven't really tested this so well like what if i have two cups but i'll come i'll i'll try to do that maybe with this mug would this also be a cup cell phone i could probably get two cell phones going um what was i looking for anytime i make a new object this is a new object this is a new object those are the only places if i say push existing push or also this is a new object so for example object dot id equals id count and then increment it so again this is if it's new right only if i'm updating it i don't give it a new id and then also this is if it's new so in theory let me see here when i'm drawing it i should be able to say add the id let me not make this white right now let me make this bigger um let's see what happens here let's see if this works okay cup zero person one so i take my cup away and if i bring it back it's still cup zero but if i take it away and for a long enough time it fades out and is gone should be cup two so i could uh the idea is a unique idea across all of them so it's not cup two it's cup one but there was a person there so and then how can i get another cup let's see will this ever be a cup it's so many things bars three remote and by the way that timer of a hundred is much too long so i think now i can have the timer uh run out much faster like the point is it's just a debounce like if it's you know briefly blips away um so you can see like now if it's gone it's gonna like fade out much more quickly uh new cup new cup now the other thing i want to do is i want to interpolate because it's very it can be very jittery so the last piece of this is is to use the lerp function so i'm going to use the lerp function which is linear interpolation and you can find my video on linear interpolation if you're wondering about that uh and let's just add lerp here i want to learn between object x and closest x and closest y and closest w and closest uh h and then how much do i want to lerp some amount i will talk about what this means in one second let me just finish typing this all right so the idea here is if the cup moves uh and like changes its size kind of uh drastically and this cup is pretty stable actually so i should my hand is much more unstable in the sort of person detecting trying to make it you can see that how it like kind of jumps around a lot what i want to do is have it smoothly interpolate between values and so the i'm going i'm taking the current value and the new value and not assigning directly to the new value but sort of averaging those two so even if i just put 0.5 oh and sorry i should just make amount a variable if i put set amount to be 0.5 and run it again is there a name for this algorithm that i'm implementing by the way i would like to know um and now so now if i do this you know you can see it's a little bit smoother but if my amount stays much more true to the cur the previous location which is the object location so if i say something like 0.9 whoops point let's just do like nine five for example let's make this really high like nine nine which is going to be way too high whoops oh rock rock of is suggesting i should use the word not set instead of taken but um well hold on it's very hard so it's like two like you can see that it's much too smooth like i don't want it to be that slow and updating so really what i probably want is something like point nine ninety percent let's just see what it looks like with the mug oh put it with you can see how it's so that's even pretty slow like how it's like it's way too much lag i just want to smooth it out a little bit so let's make it more like uh 0.75 because it is actually pretty smooth in the first place and i don't know the this is now up to you to like tune how you want it but um you can see here um if i go just be more directly in the frame right it's actually not detecting that's weird did i do something wrong there must be a bug object x y with height no that's weird gone person six why i mean the person tracking is so bad uh let's person now the problem is my hand um let's use this uh thermos bottle yeah no it's working it's just a lot of and also you know maybe i shouldn't add an object until it's been there for like a bit like so i don't get the noisiness but i'm not sure how much i like the the luring all right so the last thing i need to do is um this is done uh maybe i've there's a bug the first kept the first rectangle is kept instead of updated um xx can you say more the first rectangle is kept instead of updated yeah like something is definitely weird about this but it's hard for me to know like if i just make this amount zero that's just setting it equal to or one no zero would be setting it equal to closest i'm doing something wrong i'm or i guess the person that's really getting my shoulder how come i can't get it to like is it just the person detection that's weird yeah it's just the person i i think me trying to debug it with person detection is bad because the person detection is not it's meant for me to be like much further it's just i still am confused but i guess it's just not accurate right the x coordinate for the person but i i can only imagine that that's i'm losing my mind here maybe use lerp for small movements but go instantly if the new position is larger than a delta that's a that's a yeah it doesn't seem to change dimensions is that the issue are the dimensions not changing object but i'm oh it's with it's not w and h no wonder there's the bug my shorthand is not it's actually it's width and height there's no w in h i've just like created a false shorthand oh javascript javascript lets you do way too much all right now we should see there we go okay that was the problem that was the problem ah so now let me put the lerp back in and i'll just leave it at 0.5 just to like i don't need it to be much more smooth you can see it's a little bit more smooth i should probably have it fade in but i'm not going to worry about that um having it fade in and then fade out would be a good thing i'll let somebody else do that and let me just make the lerp i'm going to go back to point 75 and now uh i need to uh just keep this i just want to see all right so this is good this is now following the object and it's not noisy and you can see that here with the person and then if i leave so what are some other i know that it i had a scissors here uh great i know that scissors is one of the objects so let's see if i can create a short clip with scissors and cup i wish you know what i want to do just for creating a clip of this so this is going to show up in my um in the video is like an extra example so i think what i want to do is not draw a person so i want to say i want to ignore person so how do i do where should i do that um i guess i'll just do it in the drawing as long as object label is not equal to per to person um oh this is real i just want to like yeah don't do the drawing you can still do all the other stuff because i think this will make the demonstration much better and now actually i can use my other camera because uh so let me just make sure this works um i kind of wanted to skip it detecting person so i don't want the ids to go up but i guess i could actually just do it up here and label does not equal a person let's do that um and now let me switch back i'm just going to unplug this camera sense and i'm actually going to hit start record i'm going to record this to disk because um actually you know what i'm not going to record it to disk i'll do that i could also screen record um a new screen recording just because i want to use this um record entire screen i found this on the web uh record entire screen record am i recording yeah all right so uh let's make this wider so we can the code can be in there a little bit just in case um and now hopefully where are the scissors oh crap where was that setting i don't know why i plugged it because that didn't help camera uh camera uh facetime camera okay okay so now um scissors whoa 189 what what's it detecting that's i thought i took out the person like it shouldn't be able to add it something is wrong with this i thought this would as long as it doesn't equal person do all this stuff if you can't add it let me take this off uh yeah so scissors i guess the timer should be a little longer so let me make the timer a little longer because it is um unless it was detecting two of them i should also use the confidence score but all that said i gotta stop uh i'm just gonna have the timer fade out a little bit shorter okay all right last time okay scissors toothbrush just trying to get a clip all right this will be a good demonstration all right i think that's enough footage i recorded enough screen capture that mattia can use that for the video and let me save this as object detection um all right that example is done um any questions about that i mean i got to move on um this is a pretty complicated example um and i know i didn't like fully explain it um so um i uh uh and my brain is hurting now because that was like hard to think through i'd be glad if there was interest to kind of redo that in a video tutorial or kind of like talk through it a bit more but i think i want to leave it there because i want to break and i want to get to the live poll application um so first of all um if people don't know what i'm using um i'm actually using this ml5.js library um and the the uh the the functionality the model that i'm using is something called the object detector but guess what it's not here so the object detector is actually in the current version of ml5 but it has not been sort of updated or placed into the documentation yet but there is a new release coming out soon um and so there'll be documentation for that and uh hopefully by the end of this weekend i'll have finished editing together the video tutorial it's about 20 minutes about using the object detector and um whereas and this is just sort of like an additional exercise example that'll go along with that okay um now uh let's give me a second here oh all right i'm going to take a break in a moment and then come back and do the live poll application but before i do that i want to take a moment to thank today's sponsor brilliant so do you want to learn something new you do probably if you're watching the coding train brilliant is the place to do it it's a website and app that makes learning accessible and fun you know what this year of 2020 a lot of us are doing a lot of home learning um and so i i do think that if you're looking for something for yourself or your family or a friends um learning about programming and science and physics and all sorts of things you the brilliant website is uh an app is a wonderful place to do so there's no tests no grades there's a whole lot of courses pick what you're interested in get started if you make a mistake no big deal in fact one of the things i love about brilliant is when i get it wrong and then i can read through various community contributed answers and explanations and it really helps me with the process of learning there's algebra programming cuttingedge topics just like the coding train like neural networks watching those videos and learning the code or running the examples is not the full story so going through something like their course on neural networks itself really has a bunch of like interactive visualizations and examples that help you sort of like see how the neural network is working there's also one of my favorite courses if i can pull this up here if this is going to work is the course on infinity um um this is like there's just like the beauty and wonder of infinity the paradoxes of infinity um you know this is like a major aspect of mathematics so the the course starts with basic counting and works its way up to many types of infinity culminating in the profundity of cantor's theorem and here you're seeing the uh i can never say it i want to just say coke but i don't think that's how it's prone i like to say koch also but um the correct there is a correct pronunciation that i'm sure all of you will tell me about in the chat um but this particular snowflake fractal i have a coding challenge that makes exactly this and brilliant is a really wonderful complement to a lot of the coding um coding challenges i have um what i think i want to do um you know so let me coming back to uh here for a second uh briefly is that so you know i encourage you to sign up um you can sign up for free at uh you just took that down brilliant.org coding train i'll take a few minute break in a moment and you can use that time to sign up um play around with the site there's lots of tons of stuff you can do there for free and if uh you know lets them know that you found brilliant through me which is helping out the coding train a bit and also if you decide you want to unlock everything that's there or i'll notice right there i have a premium subscription which you can see right up here you know the holiday season is coming up uh what can i do what can i need a gift for somebody gifting somebody a premium subscription is also a wonderful thing to consider by the way i should also mention that brilliant told me that they're doing a lot of redesign uh so some logo and design of the website and app all that's changing coming soon so stay tuned i assume hopefully i'll have the chance to show that to you when it happens if brilliant continues to sponsor the coding trade let's one of the i noticed today i didn't actually uh solve this but i quickly read through one of the my favorite things about brilliant is the um daily challenges um so i want to go to this one that's called the interplanetary goo ball games and the reason why i want to go to this and i'll let me do uh read keep reading is that one of my favorite things about brilliant is the interactive visualizations and animations about problems so this is a i'm gonna paraphrase the longer explanation here this is a game where you throw a ball of goo at another space ball it's a blob of goo and the blob sticks perfectly to the spaceball and based on the mass and the velocity of that ball it will push it in a given direction so if i set the velocity of the left guess i can't set the left blob to 0.5 and the right bob to negative 0.5 so the red blob is going to go super fast and the left blob is going to go slow you know imagine what's going to happen whoa wait that was a bug well we just found a bug hold on that's so crazy let's do it the other way around let's let it finish i think we found a bug in the brilliant website there we go that's what it should do right that fast one's coming at the slow one slows it down a tiny bit so what are the equations there's actual equations for how you calculate the final velocity the mass of the ball plus the mass of the blob uh oh and you know momentum is a concept here the total momentum the conservation of momentum so there's a lot of concepts here and it really relates the reason why i was like excited to see this i was like oh this is like exactly everything that's in my nature of code book about forces and uh newton's laws so there's a lot of uh there's a strong relationship here but what i let's look at the actual let's look at the actual question okay and see if we can answer it in this round of blaster ball the earthling allstars are given an advantage and let me get the chat back up here because i i put it away for a second um the launch speed of the earthling sticky blobs so earthling or the blue is meters per second the launch speed of mercury re united is a hundred meters per second the blobs are both one kilograms 0.1 kilograms each and the ball is .4 kilograms oh i should i really should just set up my overhead camera with my diagram stuff every day so apologies for that every not every day but every saturday i'll do that next time i don't have it today um and the ball is stationary to begin with okay so if we were to just send one from each if this is going 115 milliseconds per second and this is going 100 this one's going to hit first and it's going to end up it's going to overpower this one because it's going to hit first moving faster at the end of the round oh the earthlings have made seven hits and the mercury you know and you murky renaissance made eight which direction is the ball going so i believe the formula uh for an uh and if you read about that i care about is mass times velocity times the number of balls now the mass of both is the same so actually don't if i'm trying to decide which way it's going to go that evens out right and obviously the mass of the blob the so the mass of the blobs are the same and the mass of the ball is important too but again i just want to compare like i don't need the mass of the ball or the mass of the blobs because they're they're equivalent so i think seven earthlings what's 7 times 115 8 times 100 is 800 meters per second well yeah 8 times 100 is 800 7 times 115 what's 7 times 15 70 plus 7 times 5 is 305 right so that's 805 did i do that right 805 is bigger than 800 so the ball is going to go towards mercury i really i really need pen and paper here i've learned my lesson so the answer is toward mercury united the earthlings win all right does every before i select this think about this have i gotten it right have i gotten it wrong i'm gonna pick this and i'm gonna hit submit in a second yay one of these days my streak's gonna be higher than one day i have gotten many a higher streak than one day but i've never been live streaming when i was like in an existing streak so that is a life goal for me right now um but again what i really like about this is the um explanations oh look at this to 805 100 times 8 is 800 um and um here it looks like here is the full story which the number times the mass times the velocity um and oh look at this i need a new usb cable what it is is this cable is loose i'll show you is loose and it keeps like i can wiggle it and i'll mess up the mic probably but um so sorry about that uh i gotta fix that some tape or something okay oh wow and also that is super loud it goes way into the red anyway um what i was saying i think when i got muted is uh let's create a channel in the discord to talk about the brilliant challenges and if anybody creates a p5.js demonstration or writes an explanation here please share it with me so i can check that out later so i'm going to take a five minute break um and if you feel so inclined please sign up for brilliant.org codingtrain uh write your own explanation for this challenge and i will see you in about five minutes oh i forgot my intermission because i was doing the live poll actually has i'm gonna just take that out it has a little bit of a browser uh so weird um as part of my screen showing i'll take that off and see you in a couple minutes so do do do do do all right everyone i am back about 100 of you left when i took the break boy maybe you'll come back it's good it's good there's plenty of you left thank you for sticking around for the rest of this live stream we've probably got about 45 minutes at the most um i want to mention something so i don't know if kobe who's one of the um discord uh manager moderators is and i meant to i mean it's not a big deal but i meant to close this um is um i don't know if kobe is still watching but i quickly created a channel called live links that might not be the right emoji or the right name for it or the right place for it but i'm pretty sure that any channels here only i can post to the reason why i created that is because i realized that um sometimes what i want to do is keep track of links that i am share things quickly with people who are watching the live stream and i could certainly paste something into the youtube chat but that chat scrolls by very fast and i don't actually have it open on this laptop so um i just want to do things like whoops nope that's not getting pasted there like for example like here's the link to the code um so this is like ml5.js object detector with persistence like i can just put this here and so i've got the link to that there there was something else that i wanted to share but also um if any admins or moderators if there's ever a thing like share something that i need to copy paste with me that this could be used for that potentially so um maybe there's a better system for that um but i'll let i'll let everybody sort of work that out but i'm gonna use that for right now so if you're in the discord you should be able to get the code that i just wrote by going over here and let me also get the generator function code also this is useful because i want to add these things to the youtube video description later and so this is a reminder of things for me to add to the you the the the um the description layer so this is the generator function example um so let me go back to discord uh general and yes you can react with emojis here you should be able to generator function uh example um there we go there's that so other things that come up that i'm showing are referring to um i will uh put there okay um yeah the live category oh this is also yes definitely it should go here perfect uh sure i think it's the same permissions and maybe actually what i want to do is make this i'm obsessed with uh the correct emoji and i could just call this links um and then now uh we've got the schedule by the way this is where i post um this is where i post um announcements about the schedule although for once in my life i've got something um i seem to have a regular schedule which is every saturday morning 10 a.m eastern time uh with some exceptions obviously but if you want to get updates i don't use the at everyone tag maybe i should but i use something called at notifications so also if you're in the discord you should go i think um to i think you say how do you how do you subscribe to the notifications what's the command uh there's a command for subscribing to the notifications somebody will tell me in a moment that um okay yeah mr salvation come in the discord i'm really trying to get the discord going um it's just a chat tool that i've been using more and more um it really seems to work well for engaging with the community for people getting help with their code i would say like my two favorite channels are introductions so please introduce yourself there um i just love to scroll through and read these um and learn about the community as well as pets so please share your pets uh same asia isn't he a cutie patootie oh yes qt patootie where's my cutie patootie sound effect all right uh but uh let's go back to uh the safety of this lynx and channel it's uh exclamation point subscribe so just to show you if i do exclamation point subscribe um the bot is going to this stream bot is going giving me the role notifications so please when you join the two big most important steps are read me read the readme react with an emoji to get all the channels unlocked and then i suppose probably the appropriate place to do this is in bot talk do i mean i just did it over here just for reference um exclamation point subscribe unless you don't want the notifications it's very reasonable to not want the notifications we're kind of doing opt in uh we don't uh i i have used at every one i used it once for something i really wanted some help or engagement with and mostly i just got flamed with a lot of people complaining that i'd used it so i do want to reserve the right to use it but um just for weekly schedule updates um just the exclamation point subscribe and if you're wondering how to make your own discord bot stay tuned um certainly you can check the collaboration i did with uh coding garden with cj that's the archive of that is on youtube i think if you search coding garden coding train discord bot you'll find that but i'm soon to be releasing a sequence instead of tutorials okay um one of the things by the way that i finally figured out i don't like having this sidebar shown while i'm live streaming because it shows direct messages and other channels that i'm subscribed to there's nothing necessarily private about that but you know i i'm not you know people who direct message me on discord aren't like opting in to having me show their like profile picture on a live stream so i figured out how to get rid of that by doing command option i which opens up the job this is just a web page inside the app and it opens up the console of course you know you want to be careful about what you paste there and the discord has a nice message but i was able to figure out that um i can hide it by using like some native javascript like document get elements by tag name the navigation bar index zero style.visibility um equals hidden so that's a useful little trick um discord option command i uh pulls that up all right what's next the live poll application so i have about a half an hour to work on this a little bit more and one of the thing that i want to start with is there have been a bunch of pull requests and comments posted so let's take a look at those and see what we can um kind of merge in and add and what's the thing that i should i should if i i should also add this to hacktoberfest um what is the thing i need to add a topic is that what i do um somebody will tell me i think somewhere under where are the topics sometimes oh yeah uh topics is it just this hacktoberfest if i just add this topic um then it will these will be valid so let me do that let me go to the pull request let's go in reverse order i made some css that makes it coding train themed all right so i like this the only issue i have with this is that and did i write this the background has to stay transparent for it to be an overlay um so change change the background color so resolve conflicts there's some conflicts i guess oh i wanted it to be green um so and this added a css file so i'm gonna i'll i'll just alter this myself so let's let's keep let's get rid of let's keep that and get rid of my style which was all this stuff yep so that should resolve the conflict um we oh we had a conflict uh giggy oh g you and me were in a tense battle it's uh very very very stressful to be in this conflict but i'm gonna resolve it i'm gonna resolve this conflict we will all feel that we are happy now as i resolve the merge conflict i commit that merge and i understand that i'm updating maine and we all feel good about things and this is my merge conflict resolve music i'm gonna go to your files changed and i'm gonna suggest um i'm gonna suggest that you change the background to green um one thing i love about these uh github suggestions is as the maintainer of the repo i can actually make a suggestion to somebody's pull request that they can accept in the interest of time i'm just going to go ahead and make the suggestion and accept it myself because i don't want to wait for the back and forth while i'm live streaming but um this is for the chroma key overlay i'll just right here and normally i might start a review and have a bunch of different suggestions and comment but i'm kind of moving quickly here i'm just going to make this a single comment um you can see now that the suggestion is there you know i would normally wait for the discussion to happen with ggog but i'm just going to go ahead and commit those changes and then i am going to um merge this pull request all right we're taking this coding stream coding train themed pull request um so thank you for that um and prob let's get back to um the console here and i believe it's just on my desktop and i forgot how this works but i think if i just run it i will see what i have so far at localhost 3000 so this is the current uh poll which you can't vote in right now because i'm not running the server and i haven't made an interface for voting all those things have to come but let's just pull in those new so what i probably should do is check out a different branch and look at the pull request before i merged it but you know me i'm loosely goosey here now i can grab those updates that were already merged uh run it again and take a look at what we've got and there we go i love this change all right coding train live poll so there's a lot of room for improvement here anybody wants to contribute with design uh you know right now the contributions are small enough that i can kind of go through them as i'm working on this project but i i you know i'm if if this stuff if more people want to contribute i might need more of a process for like you know who's actually doing the design or maintaining the design but um if you have some ideas so there we go there um let's go to the next pull request train bogey oh right represent the percentages as train bogies that's indian english i'm not i'm not familiar with that term using emojis i do like this idea now let's see we're i'm almost certain we're going to have some conflicts so oh no we've got to resolve these merge conflicts oh we're in it oh no that's not it we're in a tense battle between train bogie in maine the conflict oh it's a deep dark historical conflict of epic proportions we need to resolve it to feel happy oh this is gonna be this is gonna be hard um so what do i want okay i think i want to keep the font face i'm so confused i'm so confused here what the reason why i'm confused is i feel like this came from maine why is it oh it is saying it's from maine like is this saying it's that's the above stuff is main and then this is from train bogey yes um and i should use a tissue not my shirt that was kind of disgusting i apologies for that can we edit that out of this live stream i think i might need these glasses for a moment here to figure this out okay um by the way one of my side projects is to whenever i put these glasses on trigger a like party theme that's like just like starts as an overlay all over the screen it's a new side project somebody add that to my list of side projects um all right so i think i kind of want to take everything here in that uh i want all of this that's the body i want to keep the font face um and then here i think this is get i think this is everything i think this is resolved now i think we're resolved we're at peace we're at peace our merge conflict has been resolved and we can take a deep breath and relax with the combined css of train bogie and maine let's mark it as resolved and again um what i probably would want to do here is um i probably would want to check it first but that's not how i roll uh oh gypsy dangerous requested my review thank you for that um and let's merge it we're gonna go ahead and merge it i need to merge we've merged uh and now i can grab that and run it again and let's see what we've got all right yes we're really cooking with gas now this is awesome okay back to the pull requests let's take a look at true oh oh oh no this is oh that's the issues let's go back to the pull request moved validation to back end instead of client oh this is thank you for this fantastic so um and and simon is telling me some suggestions here also let's take a look let's do a little review here okay so what's being changed can you see this um we are first getting the port from an environment variable which will be necessary for when it's deployed that's good um i'll take that as a reasonable change and then why is it not scrolling why can i not get this to scroll when i'm zoomed in there we go um then also if there's no poll send a status error invalid poll id okay like that if object keys poll filter oh i have no idea what this is doing okay the glasses have to come off for this uh all right let's see um if if okay i'm getting the array of poles and if it doesn't have an id ah if it doesn't include the choice ah i see then invalid choice so last week people put in like little up messages to me in the database so that's good i like this i mean i'm assuming that's working correctly i'm having a hard time unpacking this in my brain like what is this doing that it's i'm giving us the array of all the poles right we found the pole and then filtering it and if it's not an invalid choice i'm just gonna trust this i can't unpack i can't unpack it can somebody face give you like an explanation of what this is doing i could write it in like multiple lines but i'm really having trouble unpacking it but i can see i'm gonna sort of trust this um you know this is just a fun project i can fix it later if it doesn't work um but i like the idea of filtering it here um and then uh this is creating a new poll uh it's response is sending the votes this is doing something creates a new object votes which doesn't have the id property okay i like that um and i always forget i have to do i have to learn what this means it is taking the choice from the request params and making sure an existing entry exists with that choice got it okay uh thank you for that um and then in the client the check is no longer needed so that's just a comment there i'll comment that out okay great i like this it's much better for that filtering to happen here so i'm going to merge this i'm happy with this let's go ahead and merge this pull request all right now uh let's pull from the origin and let's run it and let's make sure our polling app is still working i still see the same results no errors on the server the question now is if i go to oh and this is the bot or something else let me hold on i have to remove my laptop for a second because i'm i'm gonna there's some other code examples open which are going to um they have a spot token in it which i don't want to show um now i should be able to go back to here and by the way i can also go over here how about that huh let's go over here for a second uh how's that for fancy uh let's open up the code i believe that if i go into database.db i think i want to clear this let me clear database.db uh oh it's already running let me go back to here great uh syntax error unexpected end of json input at count votes did i not add oh i think i think i have it like create new poll is just sort of like commented out right so right now my cr there is no i want to create a endpoint for creating a poll but right now i just have to like manually create a poll so let me do that just to see okay uh cannot access database okay well clearly this has to happen after okay so now i'm still getting that error um sketch.js line five what broke here vote count votes count votes oh because i hardcoded in the id boy there's a lot of problems a lot of things to fix that i maybe today is just like getting organized and adding some issues and letting other people do pull requests to fix individual issues but i suppose just to like let me put this id oh this is terrible uh i'll hard code that in there there we go okay we're back up and running um so yeah this leaves a lot to be desired but i i at least want to see if i can add the voting interface today before i go so i'm going to move but i'm glad i've merged these two pull requests this um all right refactor to utilize es6 destructuring and update a database call to use one less query on increment i like this idea like this idea oh no oh no oh no boom i need that sound effect uh do i have any of my scary music uh maybe it's this one oh hey dance battle we gotta resolve our conflicts all right let's let's take a look at this i i really appreciate this um love the stream yesterday so i figured i would improve on the rest endpoints to use destructuring for the request parameters and update the database call but i don't to increment on update rather than searching and then updating okay that i really wanted help with so let's take a look at the files changed first to understand so this we've also got ah this was already in somebody else's so uh that's probably where a conflict is um this is getting the is doing oh this is how you do the update thing await database update id increment choice by one return updated doc so this is what i was looking for i couldn't figure out how to get this like increment thing to work not that i fully understand this right now but that looks awesome and then response send await database find one the update function accepts a return updated docs so it still can be accomplished in one call let's look at this uh update options okay yeah return updated docs the return promise will resolve with an object or with an array of objects okay this is cool so let's look at the conflicts this looks like something i can accept um but i've gotta i've gotta deal with the conflicts time to resolve these conflicts uh these look the same i like the fact that i like this so let's i like also how this is written in one line though so let's grab this and put it in here and then we'll take this oh we'll take this these are the same so i need this so this is what i want now i want to get the port oh and i should move myself back oops to here i want to get the port um zoom in a little bit here i want to get the port from the environment variable i want to say it's running at local host port uh static and now here so this oh okay so here's my confusion can i still how do i integrate these two hmm oh boy what's up with the music at schwarzer so this is going to be hard because this does the incrementation in one call so definitely i want if no pull i don't know how to integrate this i'm gonna need some help i'm gonna need somebody else to resolve the merge conflicts so i'm actually not going to do this right now um can i'm just going to what i'm going to do is this um i'm not going to resolve these how do i get that i'm just going to go back and hit leave i'm also i'm going to just do a quick review so let's go here files changed let's do a quick review i just want to change this to um add a suggestion oh i can do multiline suggestions now right uh cancel yes so i think if i do this if i do multiline yep no there's a way to do a multiline suggestion i don't remember how to do that this is so not important yes how do you do that does anybody know seen that ah there we go look there we go multiline suggestion so i'm gonna suggest this change this to a oneliner and put this in here um oh oh this is so silly of me what am i doing this is a needle this um this doesn't need this doesn't need to be changed i'm changing the code to be on one line on very unnecessary here i'm not going to worry about that all right um um let's see here um so i'm gonna just do a review um so i'm just gonna comment this is terrific i really like the new database calls but um um but um there were some other changes related to um checking to validation um that need um resolution that need to be integrated with these changes can you help resolve the conflicts then i will merge okay so let me submit that and i assume that um drc is maybe not watching right now um but um if if you are you could do this uh live right now and i'll merge it but i think anything that i'm to implement right now is not going to affect this so i can move along um and then this can be merged later i mean i want to wait and kind of merge things during the live stream but this i might just go ahead and merge now that we've reviewed it before next saturday so let's look just there was one more pull request oh there's two oh simon pull request seven minutes ago okay um let's create a branch with simple sequel light 3 for consideration oh boy okay this is oh super interesting so i don't know how to make this decision but because i'm using this any db that is a kind of very hello world sort of style get started with the database system and this is using sql lite which is really really interesting to see this would be a major change right now i don't really know sequel light so i'm a little hesitant to just uh merge this in certainly also now it's going to conflict with all the other stuff but i do like the idea of having the database stuff in a separate file and then having various functions like create poll so let's make our first poll like related to what database system to use i don't know that could be something we could try um but i do like this i'm so i'm i'm interested in trying this let's i'll get a little further with functionality and design and we can swap out and we can consider swapping out the back end on a future stream if you want to uh if you want to keep this in sync if you want to keep this in sync with me okay so i'm gonna write that comment there so we'll leave this as to be considered uh for later uh we can check out uh simon's pull request you create an interface but for now you can create a piece of software called insomnia to make post requests that's interesting so you're oh interesting you're changing it into a post to uh receive the votes so i that thank you for that i think i'm gonna leave it as is because i do i do want to build my own interface um and i think it'll be a little simpler with just the voting to keep it with the get requests but i do appreciate this and i will take a look at it more late later if we want to um and hacktoberfest optin ah there's been a recent update where individuals have voluntary right so i need to add a topic that's just hacktoberfest great so i did that so this is now done this is now done we can close this issue and go through the issues real quick um um there there has been progress but happy for more design uh ideas uh one limitation is keep the background green for chroma keying so i'll just note this here so this can stay open um back to issues glitch info uh how do i push code so i'll look at this way i'm not i decided not to go with the sort of like syncing it with glitch but that's useful information i'll come back to that and then this was the database discussion um where we had some nice suggestions here any db is fine to use oh i like this so um i definitely want uh i definitely like the idea of having the pole object be more sophisticated so let's uh thumbs this up um oh and simon made so this i would love if one if there's like a database system that one of you is making that's just very basic and you're gonna maintain it that's definitely something we could use so that's great thanks for sharing that um where and then sequel light might be a good option and crunchy pie uh added that sql light interface so this is definitely a heart and this is definitely also a heart and i'm just going to reply to dj pamson um i don't know why i can't mention dj pamson here but i oh no it's not dj it's di i call you hey hey dj pamson can you spin up some tunes for me uh d.i pamson um would gladly accept a pull request star emoji all right thank you for all this all right now 12 20. boy we're really out of coffee it's getting close to lunchtime um paw is insomnia if you're on mac okay postman is greater than insomnia all of you are giving me interesting things no let's make the voting interface so let's do that now so um this is under public there's index.html so i don't know to what extent i want to make this into like a website with multiple let's just put the voting on this right now so how do you make what do i want to make radio buttons is that a thing how do you do that radio buttons uh oh and there's that's in p5 there is a p5 thing for it uh create radio maybe i'll just do that create radio um so let's try this so what if i just in my p5 code call this is tarot again once again uh things that need to be done to do uh you know this page should be for a specific poll and i should make these separate issues and another to do is to do create a poll creation page uh another to do is uh like different pages for voting oh yeah i definitely want different voting viewing and uh poll creation like that i might want at some point but just for simple simpleness right now um a b c and d let's see what this gets me okay why is it all the way down there because there's a canvas i don't need the canvas anymore well i'm not using the canvas for anything am i huh i'm so confused like because is this oh this is canvas but it doesn't need to be hold on let's not let's just do this for a second just so i can see aha i see so let's uh just do this there we go that's better again there's no reason for me to use canvas for the visualization but why not um all right so let's uh and why is this like in this weird thing like that but i'll take it and then i want to make a button so let's make a vote button and a vote equals create button vote and then vote vote button submit mouse pressed submit vote okay submit vote and then i need a function called submit vote which let me just console log the radio is it choice i don't know is that like a property of the p5 radio object radio button object let's look text radio.value okay radio.value um and so uh let's see how let's see what this does all right a d okay we're this is looking good b all right now we've got a voting interface this is amazing uh oops and now i want to not just do that but submit to the server so vote poll id choice that's what i want to call and let's make this function uh submit vote let's make this an async function so i can say uh let response equal fetch and then i just going to what am i going to um vote poll id choice and once again i'm card coding in the poll id uh select poll id somehow uh vote poll id and then radio dot value and maybe i should put that into a variable and i'm i'm yeah you guys can fix my es6 whatever later choice equals radio dot value um all we need is radio go go radio gaga and then i can put choice in here okay then um let's uh let uh i want to just what is it what do i send back let us i don't know status equals response dot json oh wait oh and this has to be a weight i don't want these parentheses here i don't need that and then console dot log status all right let's see how this goes whoa why did i get so many there oh is it like because it's like normalizing it oh it's normalizing it so i don't know what i feel about the emojis not a lot of detail there can i give myself more width like um i like the emojis but the normalizing is a little bit uh suspect um width divided by 10 width is max vote 100 so how much space do i have 400 let's say i think i have 300 probably so whoa so five i don't have let's um let's make that a little bit less there we go a little bit more can i fit more there we go okay now here we are voting oh nothing is selected so if the value i you have i don't think i should like have something selected by default that's putting the thumb on the scale too much but i should not submit it as long as like as long as there is a choice uh you can do this otherwise no choice selected what's going on here wait what happened to my auto format on save did i like turn that off hold on uh format no format file on save do i have like a syntax error why is it not formatting on save does anybody know i won't worry about that okay uh how's everything going um okay let's see here refresh and now what if i refresh and don't no choice selected okay and if i click a for quite a bit a goes up all right this is working the live poll is happening uh one thing i well all right um now uh let's create a branch here for what we're doing get branch uh whoops get branch uh crude interface get checkout crude interface uh all right and let's if anybody wants to check this out i'm sending it up to github with this crude interface and now i think i want to clear i think i need some admin tool way of clearing the database oh i forgot about how it doesn't how uh any db works but i think couldn't i do something like if i just delete it in the server like if it creates the database create new poll like couldn't oh no but then i don't have the id all right whatever i'm just gonna very crudely i'm gonna do a horrible thing which is um manually edit the database and set these all to be zeros so obviously i want to well let's make a real let's make a real poll and i should also these these votes the options should come from the names in the poll all right people will pull request that stuff to me i can't do it right now so what should the poll be i need some suggestions as a force compression what's the function for the force compression i can call i should be scaled only after a number of votes i agree except for the fact that as soon as i release this the number of votes are gonna like go like crazy so that's a good feature somebody can submit a pull request for that um but um let's run the server and let's refresh and let's vote there we go okay so it's still working um what should the poll be i mean with four options i mean i was sort of curious like we could say we could do something about database like should i replace the database i mean this is not going to be scientific also i'm not i'm not like uh storing anybody's ip address or anything to like reduce to like enforce single voting so i know i'll do um we'll do a poll a nonscientific poll um i'm gonna go jogging today should i do my two mile route my 2.5 mile route my three mile route for my four mile route these are my typical routes that i do so you can vote which route you think i do probably d is gonna win everyone's gonna want me to go for a longer jog right this is kind of ridiculous but this is the bowl that we're gonna do so i need to run ngrok i forgot how to do this do i have it not found i didn't went through this last week why is ngrok oh oh right i need to put it in the path how do i let's fix this um so where is where is um where is end where did i put it wait oh someone tagged me uh all right simon's just suggesting about the emojis that does not rise to the threshold of emergency uh okay um ngrok there it is it's just right here i just put it on the desktop all right fine i'm gonna do it that way so at some point i should add ngrok to my path so i can just type ngrok wherever i am maybe i should do that where would i put it like user var local bin or something like that but i'm just going to type it so i need to do ngrok http 80. uh oh but i need to do it from within i forget how this works eventually i'm going to remember so ngrok http 3000 is oh yeah so if i'm serving it i think it actually is if i'm already serving on port 3000 and from ngrok i do ngrok http 3000 that means now if you go to this url you've got the poll so you can go to i will now put this in discord under here so this should be now the link to the poll application so people should be voting now let's see is this going to ch live update or is it broken or something okay great people are voting ah you were 30 seconds behind me that's why remember we're voting for this but let's make this an overlay oh but and so uh how do i get i need the ngrok link can someone post the ngrok link just in the um uh discord live chat i'm gonna pull this up and oh thank you gaytan um and let me go to here properties and i need the ngrok.io link please oh fine i'll go get it myself under links uh copy link let's put it in here paste okay and then i should be seeing it oh there it is oh we don't need that so here we are we've got a live poll overlay happening right now live on the cutting train this is so cool come on people let's let's do an exercise here uh everyone's voting for um the uh c which is my three mile route that's actually my favorite um favorite route to jog the three mile one i once when i was doing the marathon training i jogged all the way out to coney island which is um and back i think which was like a half marathon route um so yeah you should be able can somebody post the ngrok link into i can do it why am i asking for somebody else to do it i will just do it this is the link to vote um try not to hack my home network uh and let's see can let's just as an exercise can everybody vote for a for a moment i don't know let's um i mean this is i'm wrapping up the live stream for sure now it's 12 40. this has been fun i'm so thrilled to have this working oh hold on a second everybody laura weber welcome to the coding train members program at the end for your coding trade membership what i'm very very tired after streaming for two and a half hours message for me saying thank you uh please log into discord to get your membership integration and here is your random number 91 340 your very own personal random number ah let's get a little further in the book why not while people are voting where were we i need somebody remember someone can create the web application that tracks where i am in the random number book but i remember where i was i was like uh row one column nine so i'm starting off of row two eight thousand four hundred and twenty two sixty eight thousand nine hundred fifty 953 19645 9000 9303 23 209. five hundred sixty fifty thousand nine hundred fifty three thirty four thousand seven hundred sixty four thirty five thousand eighty thirty three thousand six hundred and six ninety nine thousand and 12 529 9376 it's a long slot 70 715. all right everybody a is up let's make d happen where was i huh thirty eight thousand three hundred and eleven thirty one thousand one hundred and sixty five eighty eight thousand six hundred and seventy six seventy four thousand three hundred and ninety seven four thousand four hundred and thirty six twenty seven thousand six hundred and fifty nine and that's just when you think the song is ending it actually has a minute left transitioning into the next phase 12 807 99 970 80 157 36 147 64 032 36 653 98 951 thousand eight hundred and seventy seven twelve thousand one hundred and seventy one seventy six thousand

number i just read 34 072 so i have finished on row five column zero one two so i'm on row five column three row five column three how am i gonna remember that who's making me the thing that tells me what to read on p row five column three that's where i need to pick up next time on the coding train um let's uh finish the day by solving this uh ruby's cube um i know how i can what that's what i can use this camera for let's try this for a second to figure out a good use for this camera i plug it in here and i say oh boy what's going on okay uh if i go new video capture device um do i have this logitech 2 is that it logitech 2 logitech 2 properties uh game capture nope uh whoops um there we go uh okay it's pointed at the ceiling so now i have my rubik's cube here put it up here okay um i really should just stop like i was in the middle of solving this a few weeks ago uh let's see where is the piece that i need it's so weird what's going on oh it's in the wrong place oh i guess looking at it from the bottom is like really the wrong way to look at me solving the rubik's cube let's try looking at it from well i'm really going off my rocker here oh boy what just happened what happened oh here i am uh camera only that what did i hit there we go oh you're seeing my legs and the mess oh no wait ah stop is this better okay here we go 80s music is appropriate this is the last thing i'm going to do to finish off the day two layers done oh oh there we go top side two layers what do i do here i forgot completely forgotten oh my god i've completely forgotten the algorithm for this last part so i forgot how to solve the ruby tube everybody it's been so long oh i completely messed it up that was sad plus my camera is like well this is what i need to do there we go okay we're gonna solve this people it's been so long since i solved one of these why am i getting myself into this this is really sort of pointless oh you can't even see now that'll hold it lower how much i messed it up okay oh amount of practice people i really have to go i don't know why i'm doing this right now i was like waiting for the poll to finish and i thought i'll do this real quick um how's it going oh is there a cat this will be much more interesting let me just show the cat you want to bring me a cat okay here's the cat we'll solve the rubik's cube later all right everybody uh thank you for tuning in uh it's time for me to go what's happening today what's happening this afternoon but i should stop live streaming right yeah okay all right time to go see you later greta she does not want to be with me um i will uh next week i will solve the rubik's cube um thanks everyone for tuning in uh play this uh goodbye song um i hope you enjoyed this live stream today with various stuff uh please join the discord uh if you join the discord um what are the things i'm supposed to say are you just um join the discord uh read the readme stay for at least one week so i can get above that 20 threshold um stay tuned for the new video tutorials that are hopefully coming out soon and uh please submit your issues and pull requests to the coding train live poll and i will see you all next week on side project saturday on the coding train all right good bye everyone always i always forget that this stop this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stock this stop i just stopped this dot song never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here coordinate song autotune
