I've made a coded challenge to draw a fractal tree I've made a short to show you how to draw that fractal Tree in less than a minute let's see what you got shot GPT can you write the code for a fractal Tree in p5.js sure here's some sample code for a fractal Tree in p5.js let's take a look paste it in hey wait a second here you've drawn the tree but the angle is zero let's see what chat GPT thinks of my comment that it doesn't really look like a tree yes I am correct oh I feel so validated the angle variable set to zero which means that the branches of the tree will grow straight out from the trunk to make the tree look more like a realtor you could try setting the angle to a value other than zero good work what about having the angle controlled by the mouse okay you can use the mouse X and mouse y variables provided by p5.js whoa this is quite sophisticated here's a really hard thing to do let's see if chat GPT could do it can you draw leaves at the end of the tree this is a tricky challenge internal server error oh well
