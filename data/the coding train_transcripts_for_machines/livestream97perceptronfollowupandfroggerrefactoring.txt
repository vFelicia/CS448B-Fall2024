hello welcome to a special Monday edition of the coding train I'm Dan your host and coder person to Monday it's not my usual time the reason I'm here today is not because I want to be more like fun fun function although how many funds are there in fun fun function I think I got it right three right but rather that I have just a conflict for later this week typically I like to livestream on a Thursday or a Friday sometimes in the morning so does in the afternoon you're all over the world your time is a completely different time but this week I won't be here later this week so I am here today to make sure I it's my goal at least this summer to have a live stream every week although I could say for certain when that's not going to happen in July and August when I'll be away but anyway here I am and I've got a bunch of things to do I'm looking at the chat and so far no one's complain that my volume is too low or it's too high so everything seems to be rolling along okay so what's going to happen today I got to think about this for a second first let me say it perhaps this is your first time watching if it is welcome thank you for tuning in I hear that there's like a another live stream maybe the e3 live stream is going on right maybe simultaneously you probably should go watch that this will be archived you can watch it at 2x speed or fastforward through it later but okay so if this is your first time watching what I do is I typically livestream today will be the same for about two hours I definitely have to leave two hours from now for an appointment so I'll be here for about two hours I make a lot of mistakes I try to code a bunch of things explain a bunch of things and then after the live stream is finished it is archived and also most of the time various portions of live streams were then edited separately into tutorial videos which are uploaded later if you would which I will mention by the way while I'm here since I'm here if I go to youtube.com slash Schiffman that uh okay so what you will see here is that the most recent videos are my perceptron coding challenge which I'm going to do a followup on today and the Frogger livestream which I'm also going to do a followup on today so that's what's happening today but I will say if you go here into coding challenges but you might notice if you scroll all the way down to the bottom o load more all the way ah look at this coding challenge seventy three point one point two in part three Frogger apart one two and three are actually available so often I'm just saying this because people always ask and also for you the live viewers to give you a little extra tidbit here that I what I when the when the edited versions of the videos are ready and available they are often uploaded and part of the playlists but are listed on YouTube and are not made public this is because I tend to make one public per day most people are most of the viewers are not the live viewers but are the ones who are just kind of clicking home link as they get alerts so I like just kind of roll out the videos more slowly over time maybe that's a bad idea I don't know some YouTube certified consultant could maybe tell me the best way to approach this but that's kind of my approach right now okay Oh welcome Vic who says Wow the first time I'm here I am glad that you are here live I don't know if this experience is more enjoyable or less enjoyable live but I'm pleased nonetheless that you're here as you just as you saw I do try to keep a corner of my eye on the YouTube chat this is very hard for me to follow it because I got to think about a lot of different things it's also on a screen that's like way over here so I have to like look and kind of look over here and then come back and look here so I will try to take a peek at it I do keep a closer eye on a slack channel which if you would like to support the work that I'm doing patreon.com slash coding train it is a patreon is a crowdfunding service for content creators and if you would like to join that you will get it tation to our slack channel which I also keep an eye on and most most recent messages in dislike channel CPP about people like finishing up their lunch real quick or skipping eating just to watch the watch live scene I really don't recommend that first of all as we all know on the coding the sound effect for this it is very important not one that's going to make me feel like I just have to go pee but it's very important to stay hydrated is everybody watching staying hydrated I don't want anyone feeling woozy especially myself stay hydrated I have my purple canteen of water here I also recommend that you eat lunch go your lunch you can watch why you eat lunch alright uh Gregory in the YouTube says I need to go to a dancing lesson oh my goodness wait a second isn't this channel really Jess I mean it's if there's no lessons involved but I would like this to be a dancing channel unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I that's an it for right now I know whenever I start to pull a muscle in my neck we know it's a problem I'm actually been watching the world of dance which is a great show I don't know if it's a great show but I've been enjoying it lots of great dancers on there okay uh uh I am clearly not gonna be on the world of dance anytime soon but you know I have this YouTube channel I guess that's something I don't know why it's doing this anymore but I'm here okay wait so I was talking about patreon and I looked at the chat and got distracted okay so patreon I said I think I always plug my the two other things I like to plug I should do this in the opposite order are coding train Storenvy calm for some merchandise and also processing foundation.org processing foundation is a nonforprofit 501 C 3 corporation here in the United States we our mission is to do a lot of different things around code and education processing foundation maintains processing p5.js processing dot pi python mode and also does a lot of community and education and diversity initiatives you can read all about processing on the website and I encourage you to become a processing foundation member and I encourage you to do that before you do my patreon okay so um I know the Simon in the chat rightz come on I don't know if that means skip with all the dancing and just get to the card yep but you know some of the people they tune in know does anybody tune in for the dancing I don't think so every once a while somebody says that they tune in for the dancing okay uh does processing have a separate library if you say want to use the libraries in Eclipse I'm so glad that this question was asked by Jimmy in the chat oh and also before I get to don't let me forget about this Eclipse tech nerd people hope the fidgets better video tech nerd asks about discord I'm kind of old I guess relatively you know I'm young I'm young in many ways young at heart and youthful but I'm kind of like not so up on the current stuff you know I do have mom up on fidget spinners and Pokemon does that count no okay uh anyway um but what was I talking about discord there is a coding train discord I guess it's unofficial I don't know anything's official or unofficial and the reason there's also a coding train reddit reddit comm slash are slash coding train which I was really like I used it one week and then okay but down here we can go to coding train discord if discord is something that I should consider using as a platform I love to be able to expand and make ways for people in this community to to I'm reading I'm reading the check oh my gosh so which is the can't read see this is why I can't read the chat veritable ttest but you could you could check this out so I don't know I've this the slack channel has worked well for me for this patreon community the YouTube chat works well for the live sessions okay so the discord you can just find it here someone post this in the chat for those who are interested and maybe I'll try to check it out sometime okay I noticed by the way that I say okay okay okay okay okay a lot maybe that's the next one okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so I think that is all of my introductory stuff am I forgetting anything important what do you think soon the camera will shut off and off to go press that button so next up so what oh this is a setting on show later this is by K week man who is a contributor to coding train community and does a lot of greats has been making a lot of great machine learning examples I'm going to show this a little later I think what so that here are the things that I want to do today in the time that I am looking at my watch I want to do a followup video on the perceptron which was a coding challenge and it was finished this is the example running here this is a simple perceptron that's being trained to recognize points on one side of a line versus the other so I want to add some features to this and talk a bit more about it as well as talk about what the limitations of the perceptron are and why a multilayered perceptron a neural network so to speak of many printer connected perceptrons expands the possibilities of what you can do with neural network based machine learning so that's kind of I'm not going to build the fully connected Network the multilayer perceptron today but I want to leave myself with everything finished so the next time I come into a live session we can really start to build the neural network library I would also like feedback I guess not right now maybe I'll do a strawpoll or something I made this neural network library in JavaScript for some p5.js examples and I don't know if I should rebuild it from scratch as the tutorial videos or just do a processing version after think about that okay um nose touch yep this will be the okay song suggested by alka ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok my nervous habit apparently is touching my nose I can tell that I'm getting like stressed out and figuring out the code stuff so that's item number one is to follow up on the perceptron coding challenge item number two is to follow up on the froggy frog Frogger coding challenge I have two things that I want to do I don't I won't be definitely be able to do both today the first thing is I want to do just a refactoring video so I want to look at there was so much spaghetti and kind of mess in that example that I made that I want to do a fourth part which just refactor zit and the major thing will be adding a Lane object the lane object storing a number of carves or logs and I probably also we realized that the cars and logs actually can beat not there goes can be the same object so I might rename that to obstacle this was suggested by me I am so me and so that's the other thing that I want to do I think I have time to do both those things I was thinking you know my coding challenges where I do a particular game all in one video tend to actually be viewed more so I thought I might try an experiment which is and I guess I won't do the same so we remind me which is I did the Frogger challenge in processing and it's in three parts it'll now be in four parts and I thought I would try to do like sort of a speed version of it since I've done it once already it might have an easier time of coding the whole thing from scratch in one video and then I would do that in JavaScript so that is that is that okay processing fidgets I know there's the the fidget spinner idea is very polarizing cuz you know it's kind of like come on really you're going to do a fidget spinner YouTube video at to coding tracking at the same time hey you're gonna sleep in her video that sounds interesting but there is a lot there is something there in terms of looking at angular motion some interactivity there's a really interested in thing that you might not think about which is that when you click on something and want to drag it around you've got to know where you clicked relative to where it is and this and with something spinning it all has to do with angles so there's actually a few interesting kind of graphics and math maths tidbits okay alright so I'm looking at the chat oh discord bot making thingy a tutorial on a discord bot I said I would do that so apparently I said I would do that oh it might have okay okay I'm so selfconscious I have a I have a selfconsciousness problem let us begin it's been a while since we read from the coding train storybook a million digits a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal deviants now you might remember last time where we left off was four hundred and forty two thousand two hundred and two fifty two thousand seven hundred seventy six twenty one thousand three hundred and nineteen seventy four thousand one hundred and thirtyfive three thousand three hundred twenty nine thousand seven hundred and two ten thousand eight hundred and forty seven eighteen thousand seven hundred sixtythree nine thousand one hundred and seventy seven eightyfive thousand two hundred eighty nine 27 thousand thirty one good night children don't let the bed bed but the bite the bed I was gonna make some sort of bites bits the bed bits bite don't let the bed bits bite alright then something I also like to do not let me I'll do this at the end I'll do my red Burns quote before I leave okay I know there's look you're 11 watched this before okay now we're really going to get started so with this perceptron video perceptron example let me think of what I want to do I want to make it a bit more interesting visually I think the two things that I can do is number one is right now this is just where do I create the training points right the training points are dividing points whether on one side of a line or another and that line is just y equals x so what I want to do is have a more flexible line I also want to reorient it so that I think about the screen is having zero zero maybe in the bottom left or in the center so I want to like map all the points I think would be good and then I want to visualize where the perceptron thinks the line is and where it actually should where it actually should be so I'll do that and then I also would love to actually visualize the perceptron itself the weights the inputs coming in that sort thing so um so that's what I'm gonna do okay what I say that I say okay a lot cuz now it's all I can ever think about Oh Calgon take me away I don't know if anyone will get that reference if that is a reference to get so this will be I think this will be coding I I somewhat regret making the perceptron a coding challenge because it's really more of a bunch it's really part of more of a tutorial series although I did like the idea of like hey let's make a perceptron it's a coding challenge maybe these followups should be this one will be just coding coding challenge perceptron followup that's what it'll be alright so here we go hello welcome to a followup on my previous perceptron coding challenge so if you happen to watch the previous one if you hadn't you probably should go back and watch it link in the description i created a simple perceptron as' perceptron is a model of a single neuron that receives inputs and then produces an output and this is a very simple scenario where the output is only trying to guess whether a point is on one side of the line or the other is it above this line or below this line so in this followup video what I would like to do is really just refine this example nothing really about the mechanics on the perceptron itself but make this example a bit more sophisticated and allow for some more hopefully some possibly some more creative possibilities so um first thing I got a bunch of things I'm going to do I would list them all but I can't remember theirs I'm just going to tell you what the first thing is the first thing is I would like to and let me come over here to the whiteboard ah the whiteboard is black take two let me come over here to the whiteboard so what I did with the first perceptron was just used the raw pixel coordinates of the processing window I can't remember sighs it was but you know it's like a 640 by 480 window and zero zeros over here and you know this turned out to be the line and I was looking for points over here but the idea of using a neural network based system is typically to get some kind of data input that's not based on pixels so what I think that I want to do here is just redo this example and consider a Cartesian plane with zero zero in the center and why pointing up so where as this is 0 and this is 480 down here you know 480 would be kind of up here so I would like to just redo this whole example and then the line y equal X we should see as appearing like this the reason why I want to do this is the next thing I'm going to do is create a perceptron that will learn any division of data points so it doesn't just have to be a date division that's slicing it right down the middle so first let's make that change okay so how do I make that change hmm well where do I make the points I think I had this I had this point object and the point object makes a random point a random point with a random xvalue and a random yvalue what I'm going to do and I think you know I'm going to just make these now random values between negative 1 and 1 negative 1 and 1 okay so the random values are between negative 1 and 1 in some ways that's it done aha but now right before I show them what I want to do is I'm going to say px for like pixel X and I'm going to map X which has a range between negative 1 and 1 to 0 and width map is a builtin function in processing that takes a value with 1 range and maps it to another it's very simple math and actually have a whole other video which I will try to link to that goes over the map function and why I could do the same exact thing so let's look at this except for with Y right what I want is why when the Y value is high I want it to be low in terms of when it's high I want it to be it's flipped right 0 0 instead of positive pointing down and points up so I want to reverse that mapping and the map function does that for you by saying hey when Y is negative 1 it should be at the bottom and when y is 1 that's a nicer way to say it should be at the top 0 okay now what happens if I were just to run this it kind of looks like a whole lot of nonsense right didn't seem to work well first of all I forgot I forgot a major thing I did the mapping but I'm still drawing the ellipse at those knit at those values let me say P X P Y ok good look at this there are all the points and you can see how they're divided but the line is drawn in the wrong place so where do I draw that line I draw that line right here okay so you know time out for a second I realized I forgot something else I wanted to add this I'm going to edit this out or macho's get this out but which is a comment and I should have opened with that but that's fine I'll come back to it there seems to be a lot of nonsense going on in the chat so I need to not look at that because it's very distracting to me okay right because I'm going to change the coming back so I'm just going to change the coordinates I'm bit of hard code new coordinates for the line we'll deal with that later but so I'm going to say zero comma height with comma zero and we should see there we go there are all the points now what's going on before I had this thing in it in this program where I would draw a red or green ellipse whether or not the perceptron had guessed correctly and that's not working anymore because I am NOT doing the mapping anymore so I need to also just take this same exact math and probably I should package that into a function or make it part or you know what I should do I should make aha the point object should just have a function that's called get a get pixel X is a little bit of an awkward naming get pixel Y let's just call it forget about pixel X and pixel Y so I'm just going to calculate these on the fly whenever I need them and pixel X will do this return that mapping and pixel Y will return that other mapping there we go and then I could just get those values here and get those values here this should be the same but at least I took that mapping and put it into its separate function that way when I need it here I can say PT pixel X and point pixel y so rather than draw the ellipse at that point x and y I can trigger those pixel X if it's a Y functions like that it was a nice little like little addition I had there okay so now we have exactly the same program nothing is different only the nothing is different only the I looked at the chat again and it is out sorry met you edit point whenever I look at the chat I could hide the good come on people be nice to each other the chat you probably are and I just see the one word that makes it appear like you might not be nice to each other Oh me me Mom I've been doing vocal exercises I had a lot of sore throat throat issues this year they've all gone away vocal exercises are really helping all right back into the video what was I saying this is exactly the same program the only thing that's different is the points now live in a sort of traditional Cartesian plane and then I'm mapping those points on into the pixel space what I want to draw them great so let's step one of this follow up video complete let's do step two so what is step two I want to change what I want to change here is this if X is greater than Y I want to be able to have let's come over here any particular function so I could say y equals 3x plus you know plus two right that would mean if X is zero then if X is zero then Y is going to be at two if X is 1 Y is going to be at 5 so you can see this is that particular line so I want to be able to train the perceptron to recognize this versus this and I want to be able to change this formula I can make it negative two X minus three point seven I want to be able to have any generic formula for a line work with this example so let's add that into the code so I think the easiest thing for me to do and I'm just going to put it in this tab is to write a function I'm going to call it it's going to return a float I'm actually gonna call it f is that like a terrible thing to do f of X being the function for I think I'll call this like lying and whatever I'm gonna call it f of X and I'm going to say return what did I say three at three times X plus two so this function basically represents the formula for the line and I'm going to say y equals M MX plus B right that's the formula for a line we've seen this in other so funny how all these examples have this like two dimensional space with a line in it cuz this is the simplest way to start working with data and visualizing that data but ultimately as I get further along these machine learning examples we're gonna have these you know n dimensional spaces that we can't even fathom or visualize okay okay so now the one thing that's a little bit of an issue with this is my mapping is between negative 1 and 1 and negative 1 and 1 I want to make sure the line isn't kind of off and out of our view so what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to have this be zero point three times X plus your opponent again I could have changed the mapping to between negative 10 and 10 but I kind of like this idea between negative 1 1 for every Z so I'm going to change it to that and now what I'm going to do at least just want to draw that line so I'm actually not going to change any of the code in this example I'm just going to see can I draw that line so this is where I previously drew the line so what I want to do is I want to draw a line from neck what up from where I want to draw I want to get the Y value for when x is 0 when X is negative 1 and the Y value for when X is 1 and then I can draw a line between those two points so ok so I'm going to say negative 1 F so let's I'm just going to say x equals negative 1 y equals f of X this is x1 y1 and then the second point is x equals positive 1 and y equals F of x2 y2 is f of so I'm going to draw a line from x1y1 to x2y2 and you know this is a perhaps a very longwinded way of writing this but just to see what I'm using is that formula for a line to get the corresponding corresponding Y to a certain X but can we run this ooh what's wrong with this function oh whoops I should say float X I I lifted JavaScript land for a second I must set the type for that variable probably everybody in the chat was probably shouting me about that okay where's the line I don't see it why don't I see that line ah guess what guess what I forgot I have to do that napping hmm all right all right everybody settle down I'm going to do it I'm going to really I would never use that pixel Y so I'm going to say point p1 equals a new point which is at negative one F of negative one I'm going to do I'm going to write this in a bit of a crazy way p2 is a new point ah new point between at one F of one okay and then I'm going to draw the line from p1 pixel X can I please type today P 1 pixel X PFS word this part I'm typing here p1 pick the Y and then p2 pixel x p2 pixel Y but look at this why am I getting an error here I want to make a point at a specific X&Y what is point do what is the point object I can make a point at a random point but I can't seem to make one at a specific point well guess what guess what in Java processing is Java you can do something called overloading just so happens so I'm going to cover overloading constructor overloading in this case I could say I want to have another way of creating a point and I'm going to use the underscore kind of ugly underscore notation but what I want to do is pass some arguments to the constructor I don't want to call them XY because the point objects variables are X and y I'll call them an X underscore and that's going to be a way that I can do this I could also figure out the label but I'm not going to worry about the label in this case because I'm not using I'm not labeling these points I'm using them just to draw the line okay so now that went away and I should be able to there's that line so there's the like oh this is a lot of work just to draw that one line and you can see though I can change the formula for the line if I'd say you know minus negative point two now the line is further down if I say minus 0.3 you down the line is pointing the other direction so I can now create any formula for the line and visualize that in the window time out new constructor don't forget about controlling at this the chat Simon and alka are both pointing out all the things I missed while I'm doing it but I got them I did okay right how am i doing so far timewise I'm taking a little pause here this will get edited out and I'm going to the next thing I'm going to do is now I have to add that formula into the into calculating the label fourteen minutes or so okay um wonder how many different parts I should do equation parser Oh an equation parser and allow a string to make any equation work ooh I like this everybody's requesting sup in the chat that whatever I used processing everywhere in the chat says can we use Java Script can we use javascript then I'm telling using Java Script how come so processing huggers are processing I can't kick keep it all together folks trying I'm trying okay um alright I'm coming back into the video okay so now what's going on here this is now so now that I have this formula for the line I need to change this no longer do I want to check just is X grade why how do I determine and I'm looking for my eraser how do I determine whether a given point is above or below align so let's say I have this line and the line is y equals 3x plus 2 I know it should be all right let me try to be more accurate about this I'm going to point it up more and I have some points so let's say I have the this is the Cartesian plane here I'm kind of drawing this as a mess ok so let's say I have the point X X comma X is 3 so if X is 3 then this point is 3 comma 11 right I think because 3 times 3 is 9 plus 2 is 11 so if I had the point 3 12 it's above if the Y is greater than the Y that would be on the line and if I have the point like 3 comma 3 it's below if the Y is less than the Y that would be on the line so I can do that for any value of x so if I take any value of x all you do is calculate the point that's on the line and do whether it's greater than or less than so let's add that into the code so here what I want to do is I want to say a lot I'm going to say line y equals f of X all right I'm going to calculate the actual Y value for this particular X on the line then all I need to do is ask is the Y value above it then it's a 1 or is it below it then it's a negative 1 so hey that was easy that's done now and there we go so we should be able to see this perceptron over time learning to figure out whether points are above or below that line it's a little bit stuck right now you can see that it's and this probably has to do with learning rate and you know how it started how the initial weights were started but so I want to kind of figure out like why is it kind of stuck so there's another thing I really like to do here which is visualize what the perceptron currently thinks is the line and let's just so what do I mean by what the perceptron currently thinks well remember the perceptron is oh did I not add the bias to this oh whoops oh whoops oops no wonder it can't do it did I talk about the but does anybody remember does anybody remember last time did I think I talked about the bias but I don't think it's in the edited video that was published right oh sorry Topher Jay you lost power at the office I talked about the bias in the live stream but I didn't so I have to fix that all right we're gonna fix this you talked about it but didn't ends Bennett yeah but the question is did I talk about it in the edited version of the video that's published it's one thing to talk about on the stream but people later don't watch the very few people watch the archive stream they generally watch the edited versions so if I go I'm talking about what's in this particular video here which is 45 minutes hey no extra ads no extra ads what happy big yeah okay right leg towards the end here I can't watch myself this is very uncomfortable oh god I sell I'm really oh yes can you guys really stand listening to me oh my god I don't see anything about the bias in here oh wait no no it's there I must have talked about it right I must have talked about it right yeah I did in the edited video because it's there okay yeah there we go okay I'm touching my nose and listening to myself I'm saying okay okay okay all the nervous tics are coming out yeah so why is this getting one reason reason why this is getting stuck and I mentioned it in the previous coding challenge and I completely forgot about it until now the bias so let's talk about why does there need to be a bias here's the thing let's consider the point two zero zero when I say well this is the point zero zero y equals zero times X plus two the corresponding Y value is 2 so zero is below the line here's the thing with my perceptron as I send in the x value and the y value if I send in zero zero no matter what these weights are if I multiply the inputs by the weights in something I'm always going to get a zero coming out which can't be right and this actually in this formula for a line y equals n X plus B these weights are actually just describing the rise in the run those are the right terms of the line the slope the numerator and the denominator you can almost think of this as I think weight 1 divided by weight 2 times X plus B for bias the bias being the yintercept of that line where is it so what the bias is in a perceptron is another input that always has the value of 1 but has a different has its own weight called the bias weight and now you can think of this formula as y equals wait for Y / wait for X or is it the other way around somebody's going to tell me in the chat plot times X plus wait for the bias times 1 so hard this is sort of times X does this make sense so this is really what the perceptron is learning we know the formula for the line and we could do all this with maths however we can train a neural network system a perceptron to figure out the formula for this function the idea of neural networks are to solve solve a function on how's the best way to say this time out for a second I need some wording example formula I'm looking at the chat yeah this is just the beginning of using neural networks we are using a neural network a simple perceptron to figure out the formula for a line the function to get a Y with a given to get an output with a given set of inputs but what if those inputs are you know there's a thousand inputs and we can't figure out what should really we don't have the math formula for a line but we'll be able to use a neural network in the same way to solve to to solve that function that's not the right way to say it either I like losing my confidence here I'm gonna try this one more time neural net we're saying that can make its own functions that's what I'm trying to say Universal function approximator thank you roll this back back roll the tape back and this slope with increasing value of X what is the value of coordinate Y we're going to we're going to find out this is right okay a neural network is often referred to as a universal function approximator thank you to the chat who just posted that terminology right we with a simple like twodimensional space and a formula for a line we can do the math directly but here you can imagine once our data input set guess which we have all this data with lots and lots of inputs beyond that are in ndimensional space we want to be able to walk approximate a function to work with that data and and this is we're seeing this beginnings of that here okay so let's go now and implement the bias in the code and I heard the camera just shut off so I'm going to press that alright so for the bias there's a couple things I want to do number one is I'm just going to add that to the point I'm going to say it has float b4 bias which is call it bias and bias is always equal to 1 so every point is going to have an x and y and a bias and then the perceptron now needs to have three weights needs to have the weights for the two inputs the X and y and the bias and one thing I might do is give the perceptron constructor a number of arguments so that we could have a sort of more generic Piet perceptron and I can say weights equals new float N and then when I create the perceptron I want to say perceptron three and then here oh this was just something I had just to test the code now the inputs should always be an array of three things and is there another here training should always make sure to include that bias and I think did I miss it anywhere else I hope I didn't let's find out does it have is it is it working so here's the here's the other thing I can't really tell if it's working or not it does still seem to be stuck so I probably missed something and I you know I should go through and debug this but I think everything is actually alright because the inputs I is still the bias which is one um hold on timeout I'm just this is going to be added down just thinking for a second this is bothering me um I think what I want yeah I just got unlucky it just didn't I just got unlucky the last time so it actually is working a lot all right let me come back so I'm going to go back to where I just changed that I think I was able to get all of the and so let's run this again we can see that it's still a little bit stuck I'm pretty sure that I have the correct code now but here's a way that I'm going to be able to determine whether it's working or not what I want to do now is also visualize what the perceptron currently thinks is the line so remember this is where I drew the the actual line the correct formula for the line what I want to do now is let me I think I could do this with the perceptron so I can say point P 1 equals new point negative 1 and I'm going to say what did I call the perceptron brain brain dot guess why negative 1 so I'm going to ask the and p2 is one brain dot guess why and then I'm going to draw the line oh let's call this P 3 and P 4 so I am going to attempt to draw the virginal line that the perceptron thinks and this should be one so now if I go into the perceptron and I say I already have a function called guess guess why a little bit awkward here naming wise guess why and I have an x value the formula for the line so the slope should be weights index 0 / weights index 1 and the yintercept should be weights index 2 so I should return X M times X plus B so something's happening here but I think I'm off right maybe what I meant to say was weights 1 / weight 0 so this is the line trying to learn boy it's really not doing a very good job let's run this again it's getting stuck right I have to but annealing means crowd is asking about the reducing the learning rate over time which I was thinking of doing let me let me step out of the tutorial for a second and give myself a lower learning rate yeah I think I have some I definitely have something off hold on I've got two let's look at my I kind of want to look at the let's think about this thinking here I'm looking way to get the chat for by converting to pixel space I think I am yes right um let's look at what those let me go back to we go back to this way this is like where I need to play this music my debug is using money because it looks like correct there but just flipped right W 1 divided by 0 times X and I not yeah I did that W it should be W 1 I knew that's what should be I'm looking at the channel oh yeah I know I need to cry there's so many things I want to add to this I was just trying to get this one I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna do what I didn't want to do but there's no reason there's no reason not to I'm just going to go look at my example that I made a long time ago and see what I did there so this is my example from a long time ago that you can see that it's behaving more like you would expect so let's see let's look at some of this so I also in this example I made X min x max I made a coordinate space that has oh I have this like tiny learning rate three training K same sort of deal here and I draw the line now get the weights and what's going on here with this because I'm trying to probably convert it to pixels here this is the right idea 0/1 so this one I did 0/1 oh yeah formula is there's a way to figure this out of course all of these should add up to zero right let me take a little break here right whoops all of these weights zero times X plus weight one times y plus weights two times B all of this I know I'm off you can't see it more equals zero sorry about that now let me turn the camera and so I can say let me just write this way weight 1 times X zero times X plus weight 1 times y plus way 2 times B all this should equal 0 so y equals oh yeah look at this Oh something I'm gonna put this in the video because this is where my mistake is happening all right we minimize this all right so so I think I need to take a closer look at this and figure out what's if this is really right I was just kind of trying to guess so there's a way we can actually do the math for that properly remember the perceptron right the X is multiplied by a weight the Y is multiplied by a weight the bias is multiplied by a weight all those are summed so before we left for the line that it's learning is actually the zero weight times X plus weight index one times y plus weight index two times B all of this should equal zero so that means weight index 1 times y should be weight next 2 times B minus weight index zero times X and then Y should equal weight to divide it by weight 1 times B minus wait zero divided by weight 1 times X I think that's right it's pretty different than what I have let's take a look Oh Oh there's a major error here even before I got to this thank you to Ethan Elliot in the chat I forgot to initialize the bias in this constructor what a disaster so probably do save me from myself I'm just going to initialize it up there wonder if that's really good so I never actually even had a bias so I think this is actually working but I'm not visualizing this line perhaps correctly so let's go back now and let's see where do I want to do that I'm going to say y equals so let me let me use the formula that I just used return so let me do this I'm just going to create some shorter variable names to make this easier to look at and I'm going to say return looking over here at that formula I wrote over here I'm going to say return ww2 divided by W 1 times B times sorry times bias o times 1 the vise is always 1 so W 2 divided divided by 1 plus W 0 divided by W 1 times that x value now let's take a look and see now if things are working as they perhaps should I think you could see that it's actually I flipped somewhere am I missing a negative oh this should be negative ha ha ha that's why and w I'm just curious here I take this out I'm just bear with me this could be edited out this part here hold on let me go back and look negative wait wait zero times X so why did I all right what hold on should this be negative that should be negative to know well clearly it should be why is that negative also this is where I left liftoff or you can see that it's in the wrong place but it's learning my first two equations on the whiteboard weren't equivalent oh oh this should be negative I'm making a lot of mistakes today it's very hard to do this live on YouTube although I'm sure lots of other people wouldn't make as many mistakes as me it's because I'm only having tea all right matcha I am so sorry if you need to go way back to where I switch this to negative this looks very close but it's kind of off right thank you to the chat somebody in the chat just told me that my equations are wrong and they are this should be negative right because this all of these had up to zero so I need to take if to make this equivalent y1 times y equals negative Y W to W 1 times y equals negative W 2 minus negative W 0 X that's going to fix it ok so now I'm going to say negative here and we're going to run this and we're going to watch the perceptron overtime and you can see as it's correcting all those circles are turning green with this learning rate slowly over time the line is converging to the correct spot but I perceptron learning line so um you know if there's going to be a part three in a part four to this because I think I'm gonna wrap up this particular video there's some other things that I wanted to add to this but at least now in this video I've added the bias I've made it so that I have a Cartesian space I can work with and I can work with any formula for a line as you can see life is just one big refactoring and there's so many things I could do to refactor this and visually I still don't necessarily love what I have here in terms of explaining what's going on but at least now let's just before I go let's make a new formula shout out your numbers to me nobody can shout out to me eight nine times X plus point two or let's do minus point two minus 0.1 let's just have a different formula for a line and see that this again works we can also probably have a much better sense of what learning rate is doing like look what happens if I make the learning rate point two right now you can see how it makes these very large movements so it gets to the correct answer very quickly but it can't kind of do the fine detail to really find the correct spot and if I make the learning rate really ridiculously small you know you can't even see mean it is in theory this line is moving it's so small that I can't even see it let's not be so crazy let's do that all right I can't even find the line the line currently isn't even in the space because remember it it starts with something random let's run this again so this line is moving but it's just really really really slow so it's all about finding and that learning rate can change over time I could start with a large learning rate I should make a slider to adjust the learning rate I could start with a large learning rate so it gets close so look at that it just pop locked right in and then I could lower the learning rate for those refined motion movements okay so a couple things I want to do I think I'm going to make a couple followup videos on this they'll appear at some point but there was a great comment in the original first version of the coding challenge about adding data that is not part of the training set which of course is very important in machine learning so I'm going to do that in the next followup to this perceptron coding challenge thanks for continuing to watch okay yeah get a discord and you can shout at me alright yeah you could change the boy not that I really yes follow up on the follow up videos alright so what am i doing how am I giving timewise um I used up my first hour so I wonder if I should move to my Frogger refactoring let me show you what this comment was I pinned it if I go back to the perceptron what happens if I google perceptron Schiffman what's the chance there it is what is this 2006 whoa is this really gonna come up this is from over ten years ago oh my god you were just destined to repeat yourself every 10 years with new languages and frameworks long overdue this is from 2006 apparently I've started working on a series of processing examples that implement neural networks yes I spent some quality time with artificial intelligence by George Luger I've used that book I suppose look at this I originally did these Oh Erin steeds website what's this lean this artificial intelligence libraries for processing or Java ah Wow this still exists this is amazing okay uh Ola I will take my little tour through creative coding history later I think that I should try to do the Frogger refactoring let me sorry I got sidetracked um I wanted to get to the perceptron I wanted to show so too much to do let me get to this so I pinned this comment only got another ad who would seize that why do I put ads on my videos so what makes it money off of them anyway okay how do I beat this how there we go okay I should click on the animate two cents or whatever alright so let me uh let me read this comment one thing you should definitely do is try your perceptron with new data you can create another hundred points exclude these points from training and test the perceptron with these points a cool way to test is add a point to click on the mouse and let it label it from the perceptron and then some nice feedback so I wanted to do this is the next thing I wanted to do of course this could be a great exercise for anybody watching I'm just getting ad blocker no I don't kick it an ad blocker because I support and I don't know what okay and so our YouTube bread actually I should sign up for YouTube bread that I should do because I like to support people on YouTube I'm trying to do stuff look here's another okay oh yeah look at these suggested videos like which one should I watch right now all right I've distracted um so how do people feel oh don't click on your own ads that is illegal okay I shall not click on my own ads I hereby affirm and I swear I affirm on the billion random digits bug mmhmm do you Daniel Chief Mon solemnly affirm on the a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal deviants in the RAND Corporation that you shall not click on your own ads I do do so affirm my fingers are crossed okay okay hi so let's do a straw poll I maybe I shouldn't I should just yes I think Simon is asking that the line is off and it's never I don't have enough training data nor do am i refining the learning rate in such a way that it's ever going to be perfectly precise I do believe that the perceptron would work and get a perfectly precise line if I if I for example a couple ways I could do that is if I had many many more training points so now I have a thousand training points so we can see it learning over time to correct its guesses and if I did something where eventually like I did something where I think it's called annealing where I changed the learning rate over time so I could start with a high learning rate and then lower that learning rate to refine and kind of get it exactly in position I dig you may now kiss the book it did I just marry the million random digits books because that's a little bit weird all right what do you guys think I'm trying to decide if I want to do more with the perceptron or refi feel like I want to refactor the Frogger because I'm not going to be back for a while and I feel like I can't let that Frogger code stand I mean I'm out trust me I'm all about just make it work messy code have fun to worry about it too much but I do feel like yeah so yes I mean that would be a great exercise if David in the chat asked is Daniel a professor or a teaching assistant unfortunately they somehow gave me some sort of professor like title here but really I'm just I'm like whatever is lower than a teaching assistant that's I think that that works for me just fine okay so I'm going to go to Frogger let's open up Frogger I want to show by the way somebody on Twitter shared with me I want to say if you're going to share stuff with me on Twitter please share it too at Schiffman I don't really check the coding trains Twitter but I did check it they just auto post stuff from YouTube but I did check it right before because I have it on this diss login for live streaming and at Jason ma on Twitter created and there's a gif of it here a version of the Frogger game that based on the code that I made you could see added colors and different you know different sizes and speeds and multiple lanes score and a timer and all that stuff's great example alright and then I wrote CI and I replied format Schiffman because that's what I'm better at doing okay so let's see where did we leave this at so this was this was Frogger let's see if I can at least defeat it once ah come on got it yay you just watched me play my own so now I'm going to so what I would like to do is I'm going to do a refactoring video the main issues I mean there's so many things that could be improved but this is a major problem this hard coding of all of these different objects so I think a way the other thing is this log clasp my discoverable is unnecessary so I'm going to just rename this to obstacle so a car and a log are different kinds of obstacles they can just both be an obstacle object then I'm going to create a lane class and so I will configure a bunch of different lanes and each lane will have the color of the vehicle the speed of the vehicle may be the type you know there's there's a variety of different ways that I could approach this so that's what I am going to do I think it'll be better if the Frog would snap the log it lands on but if it's too far off of the log and fall into the water that is a good idea alka so I think what I'm I approach here is more to refactor the code and not actually improve the gameplay although that that would be useful for another video as well but you know I'm not going to add score in that kind I just want to make the code easier to work with I should calculate the learning rate using the error be better than the number of iterations that is a very good point about the perceptron I shouldn't mention that can somebody somehow hold on I was keeping a text file is it open still open recent untitled maybe no so sometimes I try to keep notes for next time next time a perceptron learning rate tied to error a data that is not part of training set visualize these were the other things I want to do visualize the perceptron itself and then why is one perceptron no good so these are the things I didn't get to today add the mo momentum I'm sorry I'm reading the oh there's all sorts of stuff going on the chat all right yeah we're going to add color I'm going to add color in this because the lanes can have a color I think I've even it's just sort of random okay so here we go I don't know why playing the timpani sound it's my favorite sound effect that I have what time is it I have 45 minutes so whatever happens happens in this 45 minutes this Tiffany sound is still going it smells different hello I am back for another Frogger video so this is a guest part for at this point of the Frogger coding challenges in some ways this was unnecessary but I did do feel like the first three parts were a demonstration of what happens when you just try to figure out stuff from the fly you're kind of rushing I do not play this game for 45 minutes please hello welcome to what is now somehow part 4 of my Frogger coding challenge series of making the game Frogger so in that at the end of part 3 I have this and a version of the game that I can actually play here and I'm in a second I'm going to get to the top so what I want to do though so usually I think that for the part the first three parts were in some ways an illustration an example of what happens when you rush through code you're trying to figure out stuff on the fly and things start to get very messy I'm like I'll fix this later and you know I tried very I'm don't get me wrong them all for messy code and just having fun and trying what works but I do think this is an opportunity for me in my videos to take a look at what it means to refactor code so what I would like to do in this video is change very little really at the end of this video I would be happy if what you see is exactly this result but the code has been rewritten in such a way that it's a bit more scalable right now if I wanted to make the window taller and add more log lanes or more car lanes I'm going to have a very difficult time doing that a lot of stuff is hardcoded in here so the main work that I'm going to do and again I haven't really done this before playing this out I'm just going to be doing this on the fly as well so for sure i'll create new problems by solving older problems is create a lane object so let me think about this for a second so I need to do time out because I want to use the whiteboard and I haven't played that this dot song today do people want to hear that this song today that's usually what I play when I erase the whiteboard where is it as always I always forget to dis stop this stop this stop this duck nd this stop is stop stop this oh cool it's okay that cup of tea was empty it did not spill all over my laptop this stop this stop just stop this stop this stop this pit stop pit stop Jim's done this stop the stop and then this stop it stop just stop and then you this stop this stop I lose this stop alright so now I'm going to pretend that didn't happen and the Frog a unicorn of the lanes rainbowcolored definitely okay so now I'm going to go over whiteboard okay so let's think about what is a part of the lane so if this is the Frogger game an individual Lane has a bunch of elements to it it it actually could be an instance of a rectangle object it could also extend rectangle because it can have you know an X Y and a width and height but ultimately the things that I want to keep track of our number of cars or logs speed of those cars speed of those cars and logs a spacing of those cars are logs so Elaine is going to keep track of all of those things on its own and it could also what what else could it have I could have like a color the color for the cars the color for the background so that you can start to see like what are all the things that are part of an individual lane and another thing thank you to me I answer me who suggested this you might have noticed in my previous example that the cars and logs are actually basically identical I'm just drawing them in a different way and ultimately you know I haven't I'm actually not even drawing them in a different way that's something that's still sort of like left as a next step for this program but I'm interacting with them in a different way and then I'm checking whether the you know with the with the logs the Frog has to land on it with the cars the Frog has to avoid it but I think I could just use one object and just call it an obstacle rather than have these two different objects is kind of unnecessary at this point okay so coming back over here let's start trying to do this so let's write let's try to write some code for the lane class so class Lane oh yeah and and uh Simon is asking the chat what about the safety lane so I that's an interesting question I could just have a lane that has a number of obstacles as zero that could be how I indicate if it's a safety Lane and I could also there's something else I was thinking of here I could also have some sort of like a type variable whether the lane is like a cars lane or a logs lane and the logs could be Turtles right in the cars could be cars or trucks there's a lot of possibilities here and again I'm just trying to do a small simple version this so coming back let's create this lane class and let's get rid of I'm something to do this I'm going in order to do I'm going to save this as oh wait a second oh yeah no say this has frog or two and I'm going to delete the log class get rid of that complete that's going to break I'm going to call it and I'm going to change this to rename by the way this is something that's in processing now see if this works if I go and use rename I can rename it to obstacle it's going to change it everywhere in the code so see how well that did attach up so one place where I missed it here because obstacle obstacle so I missed it there okay so this should still be and this should be obstacle and this should be I missed it by not changing log everywhere oh so many places oh come on see this is why my code is terrible oh good okay so now I have at least the same program again and just obstacle instead of cars or locks now back to the lane so what I want to have is I want to have some array of obstacles what else did I say I want to have a speed and maybe I said maybe I want this to extend rectangle so I can have a location I want it to have a looking here a speed what else did I say a spacing sorry and a spacing let's just do that for right now let's start off simple so within the constructor extension say extends the constructor should have a number of obstacles SPD for speed and SPC for spacing so obstacles now is a new array of obstacles with n elements in it and speed is some speed and spacing is some and spacing is some spacing okay so this is the idea of a lane and if it extends rectangle I also need to call super and I probably should give it an X a Y and a width and a height X Y width height so this is a lot of stuff to pass in but X or Y a width and a height a good trait I'm sorry I spaced out for a second because this camera clicked this is a lot of stuff for the constructor I don't love that might want to rethink that a little bit later but I'm going to just leave that for right now okay so now what I'm going to do is I just I want to get rid of all this nonsense so I'm going to comment all I'm just going to delete it I'm just going to leave Row 1 just going to leave Row 1 and we get rid of this the idea here is that instead of having two different arrays of obstacles I want to have an array of lanes now how do I know how many lanes I need well actually the way that I'm going to do this is I'm going to have a lane object for every single horizontal bar even the beginning bar that middle safety Lane and the end for example so if I know the height in pixels I can just say the height divided by that grid size is the number of lanes that I need so I'm going to say lanes equals a new array of lane objects with total lanes is height divided by a grid and I want that to be an integer so I'm going to convert that to an integer total lanes okay we're getting somewhere refactoring refactoring very exciting so I want to have a total number of lanes and here's the thing actually Simon in the chat is making good suggestion I can really simplify this I actually don't need to pass it an X I don't need to pass in a width or height because those the X is always going to be zero the width is always going to be the width of the window and the height is always going to be that grid size so I can create it's rectangle with some hardcoded values and I feel perfectly happy with doing that and there might be some reason I have to change that another time but that makes this much easier to read okay so this is the total number of lanes now what I want to do is I want to loop through and create all of the lanes so every single Lane what do I need I need the Y position the number of obstacles speed and spacing so let's just pretend for a second that what I'm going to do is just put cars on all the lanes I'm going to say a new lane at I times grid right so I times grid is 0 times grid is 0 1 times grid is grid 2 times grid is 2 times great sum 0 50 100 150 so that's going to give me all the spots and I'm going to just put what is the next thing I need in the lane the number I'm going to put three objects in each one then I'm going to then the next thing is the speed I'm going to have all the speeds be 1 and the space thing is going to be 100 so I'm just kind of going to do this in an arbitrary way I'm going to delete this and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to comment everything out because we're going to have to figure this out now everything is going to get much better now so this stuff so what I want to do now is I want to loop through for every lane in lanes let's say Lane dot show so I want all the lanes to show so that means I need to write a show function and what does that show function dot say for all the obstacles have them show and by the way here when I made this array I kind of need to create all those obstacles so now you say obstacles dot index I equals a new obstacle Reeth poison is it watching somebody refactor their code wildly entertaining Kari oh my goodness I'm sure this was such a good idea so what is it when I make an obstacle well I did that I deleted all that stuff I needed to keep that because I needed to reference it but it's okay I can remember I give it an X or Y a width and a height and a speed so the obstacles get created at where do I do that in the lane the get an X the X is I plus sorry is the X is spacing times I comma the Y lanes one then what else the speed is the lane speed and width and height is um oh that's a okay I'm just going to make them squares right now grid comma grid I forgot about something okay so we're going to fix all this what do I have so far one red fog a hole just take a break for a second I I'm like my brain starting to gotta stay hydrated I think everybody's saying same in the chat I have to know what this is that they're saying Oh everybody saying the stream lag am I still here am i back okay just like for a second okay all right okay here we go let's let's keep doing this what do I see anything I probably forgot something rather important I made a bunch of links let's debug this and let's just see how many lanes did I make let's make sure I'm making a lane footprint Lee okay I made 10 lanes that's right each lane each lane do I make the obstacles here looks like I'm making the obstacles oh I'm not calling and I'm calling the show function lien show let's the obstacle dutch show obstacle not show so what's wrong here let's just see a mic so it should be drawing a bunch of things ah look at this the width is 1 I messed up the width somewhere okay new obstacle EXO speed is the last argument right the obstacle requires X Y width height speed X Y width height speed okay so a bunch I made a bunch of lanes that worked now let's you know I've gone a few steps backwards here unfortunately but we're going to get back we're going to get back to what we had it's this is going to be good trust me stay with me you're you stay with me let's say lane dot update what was it this is not update no no oh yeah oh I should just make a run function let's just make it run I might regret this later and we'll do a show update so lane dot run okay so all the lanes are working I know they're all doing exactly the same thing that's fine is it's going to come back yes they're coming back okay so this is good my lanes are working one thing I realized I forgot is that the lanes could use a variable for how wide the the so when I create a lane what do I have right now I have I have its Y position total obstacles of speed and spacing you know one thing I sort of feel like doing is maybe just making the speed random I mean why not right so I feel where are you let's make the speed random somewhere between like negative three and three you know let's just so I don't need a speed so that's sort of nice to see right so even just with the speed random I'm going to get a lot of kind of variation there and it could be hard there could be a specific configuration supposed to be but I'm gonna make that random then I'm also going to what I want then as another argument is the total number of vehicles and the size of those vehicles the width so I'm going to give it a variable called W does that mess things up though because it extends rectangle so I don't want that so what is it I'm gonna call it the length so this is the length of the cars or logs and that can be actually be an integer because I'm going to think of it as they all have to be a certain number of cells on the grid but multiple of 50 so now when I create the lanes I'm going to and I'm actually just could just make that random also but no you know I might end up I'm gonna let's just put them let's just put one in there I'm gonna do this you'll you'll see hold on I got an idea here so I'm going to one in there and then the obstacles there with is grid times that length and guess what I don't think I need to actually keep track of these variables well speed I do because it's random like I don't really need to keep track of this spacing it's Rhyno anyway really just using it to initialize but that's fine so now look at this that's with one and I've got all this nonsense print line in here stuff that I don't need where did I put that print line that I don't need now what if I save make say that great so now you can see they're all double wide and this spacing I could make 200 and you can see now they're all spaced out by 200 they're all double wide so now I have this ability to just put you know as many or as few things there's only one thing in each lane there's three things in each lane always with a random speed so I'm hard coding the number of things there with and their spacing but I'm making their speed random and I'm also going to add one more random thing which is just a little offset so they don't all start together I'm going to create a variable called offset again this doesn't really have to be I can really just use this as a local variable here and I don't really need this same thing with the spacing this can just be spacing I'm going to give it a random offset between 0 and 200 just as giving it an offset so what I mean by that offset is if I don't actually move them they will all start slightly offset from each other okay now we're cooking so I'm able to now have all of these different lanes and I want to give them a color and some other things at some point that can be an exercise for you here's the thing though what I love about this is I can run all the lanes but I still think on some level I want to manually configure them so it's nice that I can initialize them in the loop and could make them random but just for demonstration purposes right now I'm going to configure them I'm going to configure them one at a time so lane zero has zero things in it so the speed and spacing can be zero that is where the Frog starts Lane one which will be at grid spot is going to have three cars in it with a what what's the second thing a a width of one and an offset of 150 so uh okay so lean I'm so I'm going to just going to do this now really quickly then two three four two three four will also be a safety Lane then what do I have left let's do this again five six seven and eight I kind of want it I kind of want four I think what I would like so let's make this the height 600 I would like for car lanes safety Lane for uh for log lanes and then a SATA last safety zone so what did I miss here oh I need oh no that's ten that was right I don't need to make it ten for four no no no that's three ah I do need eleven if I'm going to do four look at this you know we've got a little less hard cut some new hard coding everybody so let's make this now back to 600 and here we go what did I get wrong here are people I should have eleven lanes well that's 12 550 oh boy ah right and now they all need to oh this is awkward this is awkward and here I'm going to give them just a lane in down and then what I'm going to do in the lane object itself is set the Y location and this is really not y is like index index times grid index times grid and index times grid okay so you can see now there we go there are all of the lanes and I want to make sure they update and so there we go all of my lanes now I can start to individually configure them so I can say things like the second one should have two that are triple wide and spaced out by 350 pixels the third one should have four spaced out by 200 that are one then this should have three that are two spaced out by oh and i don't want the speed to be random actually because they really should be like every other one oh and these are the top actually so what's first to so I don't that the random speed is a bad idea so I'm going to go back to setting the speed manually because I want to configure this manually and I'm going to give it the last argument will be speed and I'm going to say uh three negative two point five one negative one point seven and then I'll give this one a also zero I have too many lanes two point eight four I could have made it I could have just had its direction and still have it be random but I'm but I'm but I'm very but I'm going to manually configure this game of Frogger you can see how you uh negative and then and zero so now we can see and this one they need to the last lane they need to be spaced out by quite a bit more so let's space them out by 250 so there we go so now I have and then some I want these to change like this should be 4 this should be 2 and this should be 1 and this should be 4 and this should be 1 double wide triple wide single wide so there we go here is now my game of Frogger and I can go through it now I'm not doing I'm not doing any of the tests now I also I want to give these lanes of color I think would be useful to give these lanes of color the other thing I could do is I can yeah let's give these lanes a color and let's make that the last let's make that the last argument color and actually you know what I'm going to do I'm gonna do something totally different I'm going to write a second constructor second time today this was in a different video that I recorded earlier today I'm going to use something called constructor overloading so I'm going to make a constructor that optionally takes a color as its second argument and I'm going to use that just for all of the all of the the three lanes that have no obstacles in it and I'm going to say write a new function that has its index that can't really be an integer and then a color and it needs to call super and then it needs to say obstacles equals a new array of obstacles with zero things in it don't want to have any obstacles in this Lane and it's and I'm going to give it a each Lane is going to have a color and its color is going to equal C so in this constructor the color will equal black and here I can now and then when I in the run function I'm going to draw a rectangle doesn't rectangle have a show no I have I'm going to create a I'm going to just draw a rectum I'm going to say fill that color and draw a rectangle at X Y width height so we can see there we go oh I love this now I have a lane object I can configure the game laying by lane so I can create safety lanes with a different color and I can create lanes with other obstacles in them so now this is exactly the game the only thing is you know none of the actual gameplay is there so I need to go back and put that game play back in now I have all that commented out here I don't need to draw the these separately this what I can do here is I can say I can now look at every Lane so I can say Lane check frog so I want every Lane to check the Frog and that is going to be here so what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this okay show update this is really what I want to do here I'm going to take this and in the lane I'm going to say I'm going to write a function called check which gets a frog and then what I want to do is loop through all of the obstacles I'm going to call them oh I don't need to show ups this is like taking a really long time and I'm feel like I'm being very boring what we're almost there before he's watching um I'm going I don't need show an update that happens somewhere else and I just want to check if frog intersects that obstacle reset the game so I'm just now going to do that as if all of the lanes are obstacles okay see this stuff should happen really fast now that we've refactored I should be able to do this stuff really easily so see every time I intersect an obstacle I should get sent back to the bottom right okay so I'm able to play this game now I need to I need to only check so I need to figure out whether the lane is an a log lane or a car lane so maybe I'll do it type I could you let's do it type let's say I could make it a string that's probably a bad idea let's do a I'm going to do this in a kind of a goofy way I'm going to say type and the lane is also going to get as its second argument and we'll do that here too it's going to get a type when I create the lane so I'm going to say type equals S type equals s I'm going to create some kind of constants string safety equals safety string what other types could be car equals car string what's the other one log equals log so what I'm going to do is I'm going to create the lanes this way this one is a safety this one is a car car for car lanes then I'm going to have law then I'm going to have another safety Lane a log lane and another safety Lane okay so now we can see here I've added this now I could have just put the strings directly in here but I made these like separate variables at the top to store the actual strings because and honestly I don't want to use strings I want to use numbers because I don't want to have to remember is 0 or 1 so I want to have a variable and these I could say in Java awful java monster language speak I would say like final constant int so I want to make these intz but I'm just going to be sort of lazy and having to be all capitals and integers so now what I'm going to do here is this is an integer for a type I'm going to call it t just for type and actually I don't need to have this argument here by definition if it's getting if it's using this constructor it is a safety Lane and this should be an integer and I can take it out of here so these don't need explicitly to say safety because that's by definition rep just refactoring refactoring refactoring ok so now what I'm going to do in the lane check function is I'm going to say if type equals car I'm going to do this right now otherwise if type is a log what is the thing that I did I had this like very weird thing where I had to check where it was but now I don't have to do that I can just say take this all this code here not I'm going to just grab this for right now and I'm going to put this in here this was the code for seeing if it's intersecting with any of these frogs and if it is attach that particular law so I renamed some of these variables and I'm just just just all the same code that I worked out the last time I'm just and if it's not reset the game although this is a bit of a problem so I'm gonna have to work this out there so there's this is going to have to change because I'm doing it by lane now so let me take this out for a second we're going to work that out later so let's just see right now this should work whoops where I should be able to look at that oh whoa so I need to get my attach and detach going again let me run this again whoa it's already attached if type equals log so I wonder if this is happening by accident even for the yeah it's not attached oh but it attaches instantly even to that Lane so why is that happening it shouldn't right if the lane is not and by the way this can just be here it shouldn't right what am I missing here frog intersects oh why is it automatically attaching in this Lane oh these are the logs ah I forgot oh my god that I did this the top I'm creating lanes from the top to the bottom so these are all the logs and these are all the cars I forgot okay so now right if I intersect I've got to get through all these and now here's the thing though it's never going to detach so I need to get the detaching back in so how am I going to get the detaching back in so I need to determine I think I should have some code I need a break hold on a second to take a break for a second check the time I only have ten more minutes look I really have to leave and I don't have a lot of leeway here I mean I maybe have like five minutes of leeway but I don't have a lot of leeway and this is clearly but this is the last piece that I need to do the question is should I have the Frog register which lane it's in and only check that Lane right why not just register the Frog for which lane it is are on move detach that's a great idea every time I move I should detach that's a good idea okay so uh thank you to Alka in the chat who said I what I was thinking is one option would be to actually have the Frog register which lane it's in because I know it which lane it's in based on its Y position only check so there's not really any good reason for me right now to have all the lanes check the Frog I kind of want to do that but I'll get a different suggestion which is just detach every time the Frog moves right because if you're going to rods going to jump it shouldn't be attached to anything so I could let's try that that might actually be a really quick fix but I'm now realizing this loop for the lanes is kind of unnecessary I could just pick the one lane that the Frog needs to check against but let's do the detach thing real quick on move I'm just going to say frog attach no so it's always going to detach I need to start myself in the center right so you can see now all of those behaviors are back and you can see it's so now I don't have the thing that's telling me to reset the game so the issue is and this is why I want the fraud to register its lane the reason why I want the Frog to register its Lane is because if it's in that log Lane and not touching a log it needs the game needs to reset so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say and I still can do the move detach thing int late which Lane index equals frogs Y / grid right and an integer version that that should give me the index that it's in all right let's just see this print Lane index it's actually going to have to be inverted I just realized oh no that's right ten nine eight seven six so this works so now that's the only Lane I need to check so I can just say lanes index Lane index check frog so this way ah I got to start myself in the middle so when I'm testing it this is hard okay I'm starting myself in the middle the frogs Y location is high / maybe grid black put it in the center okay oh whoops that's at the wrong place oh wow it should just be lanes height divided by 2 grid divided by 2 is what should be yeah there we go sorry so now I should be able to oh ok so now I should be able to jump around but and get pushed off but I now need can go back and in the lane check if it's not okay you lost reset the game okay whew so now I should be able to jump around but if I fall off a log I reset the game if I jump into if I jump into the river I reset the game and it's resetting it to the middle because that's where reset is okay whoo I think we refactored this pretty nicely somebody made a good point like well why should I have this type variable maybe what I should do is use inheritance and have three different Lane classes car lane obstacle and safety Lane and actually that's a very good idea and I think it could be reasonable to refactor this yet again so I think this is going to be enough refactoring for this particular video all I did was refactor into this Lane and I don't know if you can really see this makes if you really want to see the beauty of what I've done not that anything I've done is really that beautiful what I love about this now is this is the draw loop looks ah I can't use my keyboard ah this draw loop is so simple and the one thing that I would actually say is maybe the lane index the Frog should actually have a function that just returns it's the lane index because look what's happening here I just run all the lanes I just checked the one lane the frogs in and update and show the Frog so this refactoring and even though this is a little bit unwieldy it's so much better and I think somebody's knocking at the door because maybe I'm being too loud I imagine somebody knocking at the door okay sorry about two that's going to be an awkward edit I'm going to start again here um even though this is a bit unwieldy because I've initialized all the lanes manually and maybe there's a better way of doing the arguments that something should be random or I should have some type of algorithmic way of generating it that's yet another opportunity so with refactoring only comes more refactoring refactoring forgets refactoring life is all just one big refactoring session so I hope you enjoyed my rather long refactoring session I think there easily could be a part five to this in a part six what I want to say and is that check this videos just if you want to contribute to this there are a few things you can do so in this video just in this video's description there will be a link to a github repository that has this processing version that has a JavaScript version of the same code and then also a link to another github repository that is kind of a community created version of the game where people can add their own graphics and different things and if you make your own version and want to link to an arena there's all these ways you could share and contribute to the stuff I need to say it more succinctly but check the description and I'll describe it in there so thanks for watching this part 4 is it the last will there be more will there be another actually I'm one thing that I was thinking of doing was redoing this whole coding challenge as one video but in JavaScript now that I've done it in four parts maybe I could do it all as one video faster I don't know we'll see I'm thinking about that if you're interested in that say in the comments but I don't know that anybody's actually watched to the end of this video ok thanks for watching and I'll see you in a future video oh oh oh oh no don't leave yet sorry one thing I left no no I think I think I might have left no no I got it right oh no I left the wrong I left the wrong position so there's let's play this game one more time I gotta win it this is my kids just watch people playing video games all day on YouTube so that's what you're watching now oh I have to jump on the log I really want to add I should add some the visual design some colors for the lane to know if it's River or Street I'm gonna make it 100 maybe edit so maybe speed this up this is I made this kind of hard because the last one is so fast yeah I win stronger I win the prize of the internet prize thanks for watching I'll see you next time the train pulls into the station oh I don't have to do anything that's just it okay please clap that's why they please clap I did you guys hear a knock to somebody Alka says Alka says I definitely heard a knocking fidgets spinner oh no sorry everybody I really have to go so this was all I was able to get to today the things that I missed getting to I think that could be done with Frogger okay but I could say like Frogger there's some really good gifts that people are posting in this um slack channel Frogger what could I do redo as one video in jf and fidget spinner I will be I I wonder what would happen I've been so I think curious about making a video where I just do a tutorial from my laptop like wherever I happen to be without this whole elaborate setup you know what you usually see you see the little picture of a webcam of a person in the corner then you see the screen or you just have two disembodied voice because then while I'm traveling I could kind of still make some tutorials but I don't know I'm sort of I just like my whole setup here oh this is I'm afraid of doing that but it is some it would be a way of me creating more content while I'm traveling around wow that's really small I hope the whiteboard is readable okay can I use the perceptron so yeah I mean all of this I would love for all this eventually to come together and it actually I have some examples that I've made already four flappy bird that I made one for flapping bird but getting a multilayer perceptron to control the frog to win the game is something I think I could do okay so it is 329 I will take a few minutes to answer some questions I'm looking at the slack channel for patrons coding patreon.com slash coding trade and I'm also looking at the YouTube channel a table play the biscuits on the biscuits on I don't they got to play right now but you can get it on Soundcloud probably if you just search for coding you might have to search for coding rainbow on soundcloud any updates on guest lecture for WebGL thank you for asking I have to admit I have to confess that I have really been behind on a lot of things and the things that I've realized slip is scheduling guests and I said June was going to be my month of guests but I had I did this other so many things have happened that I've just made it difficult to make that happen so I will be working on that while I'm away for a week I'm going to be doing a lot of emailing hopefully set up guests for when I come back and hopefully I'll have one with some WebGL stuff yes thank you nano I'm glad oh my a professor teacher at NYU yes so I will answer this question without being silly like I was before there is a program it's part of Tisch New York University Tisch which is the School of the Arts at Tisch School of the Arts I was free if it's over for I really should know that considering that I've worked here for about tsch tsch School of the Arts so ITP is a program let me go back at Tisch School of the Arts it is a twoyear graduate program whose mission is to explore ah the founder red burns who is one of my heroes and mentors she passed away a few years ago but this is a book of quotes from one of the lecture she would give to the incoming class and the last quote I read last time was if you can resist the temptation to run back to the shelter of your comfort zone so today's quote from read will be if you permit yourself the intellectual curiosity to explore your differences you would explore a new city actually these are all dot dot dot because they should read these all together because they end with you might be pleasantly surprised new read was ahead of her time this was like a tweet storm dot so this is where I teach I teach full time I teach three classes in the fall two classes in the spring and I've been making these videos ostensibly I started making these videos as supplemental to my courses and then I would sort of put them online and then I once I put them on YouTube a lot of other people found them and the audience really grew from there and I've been teaching these live sessions so NYU has been very generous and helpful with me in the setting up this recording studio here so I make videos and I also help other people I've been trying to do more of this at NYU make videos in the studio and then I published them on my channel and use crowdfunding so in a way like if you join the patreon that's a community where people can ask questions and talk about the code and suggest stuff that's you know it's sort of like the videos are free I mean they are ad supported on YouTube but for a sonam '''l fee a small fee you can join us a more a smaller group of discussion and that sort of thing so I think I won't ask so my next live stream it's possible that I'll experiment with doing some just content just from my laptop but my next live stream will be june 22nd or 23rd thursday or friday and i'll announce that i'll probably on twitter at Schiffman that sort of thing yeah I I did at the beginning I was streaming on Twitch I would simultaneously stream to twitch and YouTube and I just never really found an audience on Twitch so I don't I no one has been able to give me a good reason why I should switch over to twitch as a platform but I'm definitely open to it and uh you know let me know if you have you that is it possible one day to do a tourist toroid coding challenge to explain the formula yeah there will be no other live stream this week this is it for this week but I've got a lot of well not a lot I've got right now I have five edited videos that have to be published the three Frogger ones which are there you can find them they're already unlisted and then I guess two more from today what was I going to say about or something okay look let me I got another min and a half here I hope people enjoyed this light I felt like I was kind of off my game during the refactoring video because I was just sort of spaced out refactoring but hopefully that was useful and will get edited into something useful can a gambling game be predicted with machine learning actually there's been some recent research and work done in training an artificially intelligent bot to beat professional poker players will love it absolutely so uh you know sure a chance game there's no way you're going to win it blackjack and you can play optimal strategy but you're not going to have an edge but for a skill based game you absolute like poker you've absolutely could teach nai agent so how long is always asking about editing the videos Mattia at math blank on Twitter helps edit all the videos and they usually are done within within a few days but I would say you know within a week is kind of our always our goal when will we see you program at C it's a good question maybe maybe someday maybe never okay 336 I've really got to get going I what I would really liked it so I do have this list here of continuing to follow up but I think yeah I think when I come back I'm going to finish off the perceptron stuff because I really want to get to building the neural networks just stuff everything takes so much longer for me to make than I think it's going to do hopefully when I get back later in June and the first couple weeks of July and there's a July 4th holiday but I'm gonna try to do a couple weeks I'm gonna try to do two live streams each week cuz I'm going to also be away traveling for two in July most of you away for two weeks in August so it'll be two weeks where I'm here in July in two weeks anywhere I'm here in August and the other two weeks when I'm away all right thank you everybody thanks for watching I will see you all next week sometime but please stay in touch write comments like subscribe tell your friends about the channel and you can always tweet me at Schiffman is a good way to send me some feedback I read all the mentions for sure I mean and you know emails I probably replied half of them because I miss a lot but you can always get in touch with me and the comments I read it all the comments on YouTube as well and try to reply to them as I can ok thanks everybody and I will see you next time yeah people are asking for more 3d challenges I think that's a great idea I'm not very good at 3d I kind of I'm very 2d ok I'm just
