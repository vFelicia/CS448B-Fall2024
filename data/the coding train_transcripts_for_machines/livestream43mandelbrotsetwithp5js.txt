oh hello welcome this session is not going out to Facebook I just noticed but such as life today just can't I'm not gonna not gonna fight with the system right now I know what I need to do though I need to refresh or login or lookout or something but hello anyway I think I'm streaming live that's always a good way to start I can see that I am there ok so welcome this is a bit of a not really a surprise but a kind of lastminute turning on the live stream it is Friday it is beautiful sunny and cool day in New York City it is a little after 400 p.m. Eastern Time my name is Dan this is coding rainbow a place on the internet where me I guess I type at a computer and make some code examples and talk about them and answer questions in a chat more if you're interested in more so you can look at the description of this video there also be time codes in there are various points that happen in the video this various things that I do throughout this video will also be turned into shorter standalone possibly edited video tutorials and that's the usual stuff that I think I say at the beginning but I want to dispense with all the formalities because I'm usually very formal and I want to yeah I don't think there's forth this this is very this is this is kind of last night I didn't send out an email announcement about this but please if you're in the chat on YouTube please let me know if you can hear me okay and if the audio and sound and everything is alright alright so um let's talk about what I want to do in this particular session I have a few different topics that have been requested over the last couple months and I could do it could start with any one of them first let me cover what they are so I'm gonna open up a browser here I'm not at all prepared so I'm gonna have to do some organizing and getting ready and that sort of thing so something that's come up this is actually a really simple this could be a kind of simple quick one there is something called disk point picking we could you would need together here in this space right now right a computer program that randomly picks points inside of a circle and if we did it a certain way using something called polar coordinates and picked a random angle and a random radius we would strangely enough get a lot of points clustered around the center so there is a particularly rhythm sometimes that's great you like that that looks nice this is my beautiful perfect strange petri dish design but if you want to have a uniform distribution of points inside a circle there are some things you have to do to get this particular that is that on the right the version that's on the right so so that's one possible topic audio is okay everything is alright okay this is good it's nice to have a small intimate group today just here in the youtubes of the Internet's I only there's I'm here by the way at the school for poetic computation and there's a workshop going on and at five o'clock everyone from the workshop they're all collaborating most of them on outside or working on projects they're gonna present their work at five so I'm trying to do some stuff before five and then I'll be back on Monday for a kind of longer more official session where I will do more sound tutorials okay so this is one one possibility the other thing I would like to do which maybe is what I'll start with is the Mandelbrot set so this is yet another possibility just coding challenge sort of thing I'm starting from nothing quickly explaining the math behind the Mandelbrot set then writing the code to see it happen in the browser that's another possibility and then I feel like it your clothes have a crazy person talking to myself and then the other thing that I have in my head ah this is the super formula so super formula this thing which can get us shapes like this on the right which is part two of a series that I have where I eventually hope to get to doing some of these 3d forms but I'm not going to do the 3d part today I'm not mentally physically emotionally aired for that but I am prepared to look at this particular formula and apply it in code so that's those are the three topics I'm looking at the chat here informal anecdotal poll right now anybody have a feeling gut feeling if something you really want to see I don't know if I'll get to I fortyfive minutes I don't know if I can do all three of those things in 45 minutes we got the Mandelbrot set we got the super formula and we got the disk point picking problem any requests I'm looking at the chat letting people arrive slowly oh those 15 people here might not hold on enter full screen you know this incidentally I've noticed is not even though I didn't announce it and so it might be why there's probably a smaller number of people like a great time to do a live stream doesn't seem to be the case okay you know some of you requested dancing and there was no audio today so there was not gonna be a dance it but I could still do some dancing I can't really do it without music Matthew Friday is great I don't see any when voting in the chat I'm gonna do I feel the most confident I feel the least confident with the Mandelbrot set which is probably a good reason for me to do that one let's do the Mandelbrot set I actually already worked out some of the math for this earlier and I'm gonna erase it so that we could do it again okay I'm gonna clean this off here and then I gotta turn how is this lighting wise it's pretty dark over here right there's another light I can turn on it just that one seems to make this room especially hot okay racing this whiteboard here and next I am going to hello I'm going to turn off his light there's a little brighter over here hello this is where I'm gonna draw diagrams I'm coming back over here yeah Mandelbrot somebody voted Mandelbrot that's what I voted to me this might be the only thing I do today but I'm gonna so let me actually just look really quickly I forgot one thing I want to look at my existing Mandelbrot set example I forgot in this particular example how I chose the colors and I think I just used I just used the number of iterations the number of iterations okay and I'm in this like private area now the door is closed okay thanks Lauren okay here we go all right so great so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript let's find that I think the reaction diffusion example would be the best one to base this off of here it is so I'm gonna make a copy of that I'm gonna rename it to Mandelbrot I am going to open this in Adam which will be the text editor that I'm going to use and I'm gonna go to the code and oops Oh what happened to my fancy I had a maybe it's maybe it's right stuff okay I'm going to sorry sorry sorry I just want to clean this example up so that it can be a Mandelbrot set example and this is fine let's do this I'm just gonna put some random stuff in here and oh that worked it does work now uh and sorry everybody I'm I'm getting myself warmed up here I don't need any of this other stuff what am I missing here boy no need this there we go okay so then I just need to go let me let me leave processing aside and I'm just going to go to terminal and let's get this in the browser here and there we go and let me just do a couple more things to get ready here okay and line 11 oops how did that manage to work okay there we go all right so we're getting there whoops no no no and let's go to four let's do that I don't know what I'm doing I don't know what I'm doing anymore in my life I can't okay uh uh and we're gonna say well this actually just all work and setup because that would be just fine with me excellent okay everyone um let's see so who we got here now we've got let me just see here what do we got we got three wow this is pretty that's kind of amazing that 41 people with like watching this so I'm about to momentarily and I'm gonna just change I want to change my dimensions here I like to do six for 360 240 that'll work I am going to and I'm not gonna make this random anymore let's make these just all white I'm go all white is bad let's make it this color so I could see something with no background okay I my goal is to have the Mandelbrot set appear in this spot and I'm about to start working on it I'm gonna close this oh I really should left that open and we're going to go to I'm gonna I need I need a couple things one I like having this open and then let's just find like the Wikipedia page or something where the formula is visible that I can reference this is okay the Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers C for which the function f of Z equals Z squared plus C does not deferred what iterated from Z equals zero for which the sequence remains bounded and absolute value okay I am going to I think working at the energy here I did I could do some like jogging you can do some like what's like the Running Man it's like kind of like a dance right I should write with the Mandelbrot set I'm gonna working up the courage here I'm gonna cycle my cameras is 423 and what I'm going to do is do a coding challenge I have programmed this before but I did not try to do it today I did think about the math a little and program first so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to read this statement then I'm gonna say what a complex number is well I better practice that and B I'm going to go through the math and then I'm gonna take that math and put it in code I'm feeling okay hold on I just want to make sure warning for you YouTube video if you make one about this the random noise lowers the quality of the video a lot o I assume you already know this okay so that's probably why I have that flickering thing I am no longer gonna have that flickering thing but thank you for mentioning that I am recording this video to disk so hopefully that recorded to disk won't be a problem okay alright nobody seems to be complaining I think I'm ready to go I already cycled the cameras I've got a nice glass of water I've got my Wikipedia page here and so maybe I'm trying to sign maybe it would be better to start with this as my background I was like having the rainbow in the background though because I could make this I'm a little too can getting a little too concerned about this okay let's start with this as my background okay here we go I read everybody hmm so I was just thinking here I just want to look up just to get we I just want to look up you know I have my own sense in my head of what a complex number is that's what I was gonna say okay all right um all right I'm just gonna I'm just gonna get going with this anyone have any last okay okay here we go everybody whoops I do juggle I should just juggle instead for the span about set is making me very worried I have two erasers and some Kleenex so I'm gonna see if they can make a gift of this it's pretty good actually I would do tricks I could do tricks but I really need bean bags for those and and also clubs okay here we go everybody um oh now I'm gonna if something goes horribly wrong I've got the chat in the corner of my eye here over here and I am going to begin here we go there might be some strange noises and things happening in other rooms and places welcome to another coding challenge today's coding challenge is the Mandelbrot set Mandelbrot set is a very well known fractal named after its Discoverer is that a word Benoit Mandelbrot who knows if I pronounced that correctly the internet will correct me I'm sure you can use the Mandelbrot set to make patterns that look like the ones behind me and but on the one hand this is gonna be like a super simple thing to do because it's really just like I've got a screen and I've got pixels and I have to set each pixel a certain color and when I've done I see the Mandelbrot set on the other hand it's sort of like uh this is gonna feel complex numbers imaginary numbers well so let's so first before I get started I'm gonna write code in a minute but before I start writing the code I'm gonna go over here to this Wikipedia page and I'm gonna read this I'm gonna take a deep breath and I'm gonna not get to I'm not gonna get too worked up about it the man that brought set is the set of complex numbers so we first we need to understand what is a complex number okay for which the function FZ equals Z squared plus C does not diverge when iterated from Z equals zero what does it mean not diverge well later sort of says this remains bounded and half Lieut value okay so here's the thing I want to talk about what's an imaginary number what's a conflict what's a real versus imaginary number what's a complex number and then what does it mean to iterate a function over and over again and then just figure out what that function is bounded or not so let's come over here to my trusty friend the whiteboard I trust the whiteboard friend I have human friends I really do but whiteboard friends are okay too now okay so ultimately there's going to be a canvas hardwon and I'm not totally prepared that's why I'm making awkward awkward attempts at humor okay this is a canvas and ultimately what I'm going to do is look at every pixel on the canvas and perform an operation inside a color I was gonna look at something over there so now can I just start this whole video over I I guess it was probably fine but I feel like like a pronunciation was correct I'm gonna do this one again I apologize everybody but I I lost my train of thought I feel like you know I can see that YouTube graph I shouldn't you look at these analytics but on YouTube you can see analytics at the moment where people stop watching your video I was just like imagining by rambling at the beginning of way too long okay uh I'm glad I got the pronunciation right and okay okay okay okay I did not pronounce the T I said benoit mandelbrot but I pronounced the T and Mandelbrot invented most of the things collective I already studied unify yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I'd say yeah the discoverer thing was to well I'm not even in the right camera okay the discoverer thing was too weird anyway okay the T is sound all right here we go we're gonna do this again you know what this is fine I'll open with this page I don't need this page oh I like this page why not okay I got to do this again I don't have a lot of time oh we have a half an hour and this is probably gonna take a half an hour so here we go I'm just like all the cameras again one more time in three two one hello welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm going to with great trepidation but excitement and energy I'm going to program from scratch the Mandelbrot set show you how to do it talk about the math behind it and make it happen in javascript in the browser problems will come up but I'm gonna do my best so why why do you care about this it's a fractal pattern you can make some beautiful images with it you might also just sort of learn a bit about programming in pixels and arrays but yeah so I don't know you're here you probably want to do the Mandelbrot set if you don't you can go outside and play frisbee let's look at least and let's read this definition which you know it's gonna cause a small like a slight pain in my side here to read it but I'm gonna do it anyway and try to unpack and understand that as best we can in the context of a short YouTube coding challenge video okay the Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers see what does it mean for something to be a complex number and then to have a set that's the question we need to answer which the function f of Z equals Z squared plus C okay what does that function mean exactly does not diverge what does it mean for something to not diverge when iterated from Z equals zero okay so there's a lot of stuff in there and the first thing the first thing I want to do before I start writing the code is just talk about the math and the first thing I want to do is talk about what is a complex number okay so you might be familiar with an operation in math called square root I could say oh I think I have the wrong end of this pen I could say the square root of four by the way I forgot this whole thing I was practicing pronunciation and I completely forgot to do it the Mandelbrot set is named for the French mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot okay practicing st. Benoit okay the square root of 4 is 2 the square root of 16 is 4 the square root of negative 1 is what well in fact you might say to yourself there is no such thing as the square root of negative 1 it's impossible any number squared positive or negative results in a positive number so the square root of a negative number inherently does not exist this is not exactly the case in fact there is an answer to this and it's called I and I is an imaginary number it's imaginary because it's not a real number it doesn't actually exist but if we consider the square root of negative 1 actually be something that does exist and call it I all sorts of magic can happen but of which by the way is the Mandelbrot set so this is what's known so this is a real number and this is an imaginary number if I put those two things together 3 plus I this is a complex number a complex number has both a real component and an imaginary component and it is typically written in the form a plus bi a is the quoteunquote real component B is the quote/unquote imaginary component I personally love imaginary numbers because I could just imagine that then use my creative imagination to think about imaginary numbers okay so so this is what a complex number is now let's go back to that definition the set of complex numbers okay what does it mean they're something to be a set of complex numbers well this actually relates to you can think about a canvas right a canvas or canvas the thing that lives in the browser in HTML or processing or Java or whatever graphics environment you're using has an xaxis and a yaxis it's a twodimensional plane well what if a I don't know which one should be which I'll just pick one and hopefully the Mandelbrot set won't be upside down hey let's say a is the xaxis and B is the y axis the plane of complex numbers the set of complex numbers is all the number that appears here might have an a value of 7 and a B value of 3 meaning 7 plus 3i so this plane this set of complex numbers is all the complex numbers for all of all a possibilities and all B possibilities so we have to do something for every single a set of complex numbers within this sort of bounds of this canvas ok so that's good which the function f of Z equals Z squared plus C does not diverge what iterating from Z equals 0 okay this is probably the hardest part for us to understand but once we understand it we're done and we can actually start to program the code so let me come back over here and let's write that so f of Z equals Z I wrote the wrong thing down I might need some more space let's see Z squared plus C now C is a complex is a complex number A plus bi any number from this spot and we want to iterate this function starting with Z equals 0 so if we start with Z equal to 0 what do we get well Z the next Z MZ like we're z1e if this is Z index you know Z sub zero Z of the zero generation Z of the first generation equals Z squared plus C which is by the way just C so now Z sub two equals what C squared plus C and Z sub 3 is going to be C squared plus Z squared plus C so one of the things we need to look at how to do here is how do we get C squared this is where I need a little bit more room C squared what is C squared C squared is a plus B I times a plus B I right because C is a complex number it has a real component and imaginary component a plus bi well let's multiply these two things together a times a is a squared plus a times bi plus a bi now bi times a plus a bi again be AI times bi now this is a crazy one bi times bi is what B squared I squared what's I I is the square root of negative 1 I mean it's imaginary but it is the square root of negative 1 so if you square it what do you get negative 1 so this actually turns out to be a squared plus this is a bi plus a bi plus 2 a VI plus oh no not plus minus because I squared is negative 1 minus B squared or we could look at this another way a squared minus B squared plus 2 a bi well guess what this is a complex number it has a real component a squared minus B squared and it has an imaginary component to a B so this is all the math that we need because what we're going to do is actually in our code just calculate these values over and we ran over again generation to generation we're gonna iterate iterate iterate and as we calculate those values over and over again we need to see do they remain bound in an absolute value so the question is are they tending to go towards infinity or they actually just like staying around some reasonable number and the Mandelbrot set is the set of numbers for which the function remains bounded so it's all the time for all of the possibilities it's all of the ones that don't tend towards infinity whoo that was a lot to think about maybe pause this video go outside do some take a break for a little while but now if you're back I'm gonna start you're writing the code for that I'm gonna refer back to this math a couple times probably I don't know if your father I'm having a good time okay so let's go to the code now I have a sort of empty p5.js sketch here and this is some JavaScript code it's just like a basic skeleton here the only thing that it's doing is it's looking at every single x value at every single Y value and setting its pixel to a grayscale value of 51 so I'm gonna go take a look at that it's right here you can see here there we go there's my gray window if I were to you know change this component to 255 you can see it's like a redder window because I added more red so what I need to do ultimately is ups is I need to inside this code for every one of these x and y values I need to run this Mandelbrot set F of Z Z squared plus C math thing and I need to see them are my numbers getting bigger or are they not getting bigger and then I'm gonna set a color based on that okay so now we have an interesting question though to ask which is hmm if this is my pixel window which goes from 0 to 360 and 0 to 240 well do I really want and at complex number is a plus bi but do I really want to deal with complex numbers like 357 plus 212 I know I really want my range I don't know what it should be but I'm gonna just go between negative 2 & 2 and then let's try that top to bottom and probably get something's gonna be squished but it'll be fine so what one thing the first thing I need to do is I need to figure out what are my a and B values relative to X and y so I want to map X which goes from 0 to with to maybe between negative 2 & 2 let's make this a square and then I don't have to worry about any of this nonsense and then I'm gonna map B and this is really which goes from Y which goes from 0 to height also between negative 2 & 2 so I'm looking for all the complex numbers that go between negative 2 a plus plus negative 2 B no no sorry negative 2 minus 2i all the way to 2 plus 2i that's the full range okay so I want to use those numbers now I need to start doing that iterating okay so the first thing I need to do is say okay let's look at this we need to over and over again so we need to over and over we need an operation that's gonna happen over and over again so let's keep track of how one thing we should do is keep track of how often are we doing this let's have a variable called end because I want to just make sure like as long as n is less than I don't know some arbitrary amount 100 like I don't want to iterate more than 100 times I can keep doing what I'm doing and I want to have Z start with something so I'm gonna have Z start with 0 I'm sure I'm getting something wrong here because I'm it's like thinking about this as I'm doing and I'm gonna fix it as I go but let's let's figure out some things I need to calculate I kind of walk away pause recording to go look at my code from before okay but it's okay I'm fine I'm fine this is going to be okay okay did I get something wrong in the chat everybody put like rainbow emojis or something if I did something horribly wrong maybe rainbow maybe that's not right it should be rainbow if it's correct okay so the first thing I want to do is I want to calculate a squared minus B squared okay so I'm going to call that a a is our let's that's going to be my new a is a times a B times B and then I also need to calculate a B so I'm gonna call that B B is two times a times B so I have now calculated the real components the real and the complex components for the next generation and then what do I need to say to these say a equals a a and B equals B B and do it again so this is just my iterative process because I start with I think this is right write the number while yeah oh and then I need to say n plus plus okay now another thing I could do here is I could say like what does it mean for this tooten to be unbounded to tend towards infinity what if I just say something like I could be really lazy what if a a plus B B is greater than I don't know 16 or I made up that number that means maybe and not and I want to take the absolute value of that what if the absolute value of those two the real and the imaginary component added together goes toward infinity Oh greater than 16 that's my infinity then I want to break out of it so the question is did I get to 100 or did I not so look we're gonna come back maybe we'll talk about this again let's see let's see how far I've gotten why not use a for loop well I could use 1/4 don't make a lot of sense but I'm just using a a while loop for no good reason ok so now let's just do something I'm just gonna say like now if n let's equals if N equals 100 right if we got to the max iterations and I should probably make that a variable then let's make a brightness value brightness value equals 0 and then a brightness value equals 255 so let's just see what happens now if I basically with this simple little algorithm figure out whether n kept going and remained bounded or if it went to infinity let's see we should get we should get something well I got a nice like circle that's promising so now let's be a little bit more thoughtful about this maybe we can do some sort of coloring based on the value of n maybe that will get us something better so let's actually say now map n which could go from 0 to 100 between 0 and 255 timeout this videos gonna get edited I think I did something run okay let me let me out this is for added point I'd like to sorry this was harder than I I'm gonna look at my processing sketch for a second because I just want to see what did I do wrong practice makes perfect huh max iteration so I did that 100 800 two times a times B yeah yeah oh I forgot the plus see the whole point of this is yeah I I'm an idiot this should be right ooh that's interesting wait what do i do differently here 16 is very big that's why we use down here though I remembered seeing that in my code a a minus B be a a minus B B he goes a a B equals to a B N equals zero and then color zero if it's equal to maximum that's interesting that it n mod 6 n times 16 mod 235 what did I I must have dude unless something must be wrong okay let's what are the ranges in my processing sketch 5 yeah I did something mmm what did I miss here let me just do this for a second Oh something else is wrong cuz my math in here is absolutely right so I got the same result probably just have some like really stupid error somewhere you can't just because I'm not in draw right whoops I did it oh wait wait wait wait there is no I don't need the Z for anything I don't know why I have that Z there this must be wrong 0 2 with negative 2 I think the major for loops are messed up how are they messed up it's multiplying instead of a modulo what's the error sorry all done whoo yeah whoops sketch 40 Oh clips what did I do wrong yeah you swapped the operators around in line 26 wait wait love I thought my line numbers are different now eheh this is right right I wonder if this is wrong am I just the idiot I didn't have this right no that seems right it's getting redder it's getting greener oh no absolute value why did I put the absolute value in there thank you mean no wait ayyyy quills a a plus a is not adding C to the value yeah well let's yeah that's thing that's got to be the place that I'm wrong right so let's look at this again sad state I got 10 minutes to fix this okay you get your chat going over C is C equals a plus bi okay let me to come back over here so what I start with is Z index 1 equals a plus bi because then Z index 1 equals that a plus bi a plus bi plus a plus bi right so that should be right though because this gives me a squared minus B squared plus 2 a B I plus a plus bi so then shouldn't I just add a 2 here and B 2 there and I've got the next a and B hold on Oliver's saying something Oliver always fixes this for me you reassign a and B those auditions oh yeah okay I thought I kept track of that though right ace like shouldn't a start oh because I'm iterating I need to keep track of the original no no each time it changes the first time I calculate a plus B squared maybe should be the initial a and B when it is added I don't think so you're right though that that's kind of what's happening in here x and y hold on I think you're right oh you're right cuz it's always of course you're right there we go thank you ah I knew I had it wrong okay that's it that's it of course that's it that's it that's it okay so let me let me come back Thank You Oliver I that's why I didn't have this problem because in my other example the reason why didn't have this problem is because I use X I use I and J and then I use X and then a and B become X but I keep that original X because they're iterating ah yeah okay okay ah alright so I got to come back somehow let's let me come back to I did something goofy there I had it like this right so this is what I had okay I had something like this okay okay thank you everybody here we come now we're coming back if I can finish this is just a few minutes welcome back so there's a critical flaw in the way that I wrote this code and that critical flaw is right here so let me go back and look at these formulas again which is that each iteration okay oh god this is something new that I wrote again one more time continuity error holds I'm just checking okay okay nope okay okay welcome back there was a critical error in what I had written here which I just I didn't notice and thankfully the Internet chat came to the rescue it is right here in these lines a equals a a plus a B equals B B plus B now let's go let's think about what's going on here if you recall the idea of what we're doing is we're z the new Z equals the previous Z squared plus C and all of the math that I did here all of this right here this is me figuring out what Z squared is Z squared is a a plus B bi that's what Z squared is so what do I need to do I need to then add to that C but C is always the core original real and imaginary component of where we are in this complex plane so even though I want the new a and B that's then gonna get squared for the next iteration the next iteration to get updated right I want the new a and B that's gonna get squared over and over to get updated this that's getting added to it see this is really what's standing in for C right here this has to be those original values so I'm gonna I'm gonna just do this I'm gonna say C a equals a and maybe somebody on the internet here can I'm gonna post this code to github can submit a pull request with nice variable leanings for all this stuff because I feel like boy this is like I I I have a pet peeve and I'm really doing my own pet peeve which is like all these cryptic variable names that would never make any sense if you were just coming to look at it but it is what it is right now so I need to store those original values and keep that as CA and CB so let's take a look now and see what we get ah this is starting to look like that Mandelbrot set you can see it there now you can see like oh I kind of like it's not exactly centered I've been sort of the wrong place so you know we can futz with that why don't we we could fund static say like oh let's uh let's kind of like have a little bit of a wider range oh and you can see I kind of like squished it so I'm gonna make Y the same there you go but it's also still doesn't really look exactly like what you think of when you think of the Mandelbrot set um you know if i zoom in you can see there's some level of greyscale there what I'm doing is I'm essentially saying let me just take the number of iterations that got you right if it got to 100 it's done the number of iterations before it breaks out and gets to before if it goes to infinity how many iterations did it take for it to go to infinity so first of all one thing I should say that if an equals 100 and this is driving me crazy I really just need a variable here which is I'm going to call max iterations and I'm going to set that equal to 100 because I hate that I'm typing this everywhere so I put this here and I put this here and I'm gonna put this here so now if n actually get to max iterations let's say the brightness is zero and now you can sort of see like ah look it's all black in the center and then there's some white kind of on the outside and there's so many different ways you could color stuff here's one way I'd use this sort of mapping way another thing that I could do is I can say n times 16 and I can say modulus 255 so I recycle back down to 0 and it co that looks kind of interesting I know I don't know what that what good that did and maybe I need to for that for it to look like what I wanted to look like but I thought this is how I colored it in a previous thing but you can see that you can kind of just do you can you can you can figure out all sorts of ways of coloring and this is actually where I will leave you you the internet in the chat in the comments suggest to me let me go to my processing version of this just to look at it I'm going to open open recent this is a processing example oh it's already here what did I do color equals n times 16 modulus 255 hey that's what I thought I just did n times 16 modulus 255 let's try that one more time who knows so modulus 256 that's a good point it's not gonna change it though the camera huh I reached the end of this horrifying video I but I don't know what's another way to color this let's just try n modulus 2 56 you can see there's something I'm looking in the chat and let's try and times 2 there we go n times 10 n times 5 you can sort of see what's going on here so I'm sure you guys can figure out a nicer way to color this using different RGB values based on cycling the number it's really that you know you can also play around with what's that maximum number of iterations what do you actually consider to be infinity like what happens if I make this to be 200 you know that changes a little bit what if I make this one you know that changes it quite a bit you know you could also sort of play around with max iterations what if I make the max iterations 10 you can see what I got there versus a thousand you can see I'm starting to get more and more detail here the other thing I kind of want to do is give myself a little bit more detail so let me just go kind of zoom into it you can sort of so you can see so the idea here is that the Mandelbrot set right is a fractal in meaning that every part of the shape resembles the hole and if I start to sort of like zoom in we can look at the quality of this whole shape or we can kind of see like oh look that kind of looks like the whole shape and that kind of looks like the old shape and I could get finer and finer details I could do zooming stuff and also there's something interesting going on here they're these like nice little leaves that are popping up here and these are actually known these little parts of the Mandelbrot set are known as the Julia set and if I can manage to have the courage to publish this video online I will do another one that demonstrates the Julia set as well okay thanks for watching this let's see square root map and zero max ooh I like that okay wait hold on I think I should like I've been up do I think there should be like a crazy edit here I'm going to cancel that whole end of this video and I'm gonna take I'm gonna take let's look at a snake Fang suggestion here square root map n which goes from zero to max iterations 0 to 255 divided by 16 why would I divide by 16 that's interesting that didn't work someone give me your color suggestion and I want to like somewhere in this I wanted to get cut the same thing but C equals zero and Z changes right yet yeah try adding absolute value I meant to have I had absolute value in there at one point I don't know why I took it out and when I was worried things were going wrong I should have stopped here there we go there's the this is what I meant to demonstrate which is really just that much there we go okay and let me let me actually make that a little something okay try map square root n zero to max iterations okay hold on I like this I like this okay so map square root of map okay hold on VAR something far be our equals map n which goes from 0 to max iterations to go between 0 and 1 that makes sense so this is like normalized norm so I'm going to normalize that and then map the square root of the normalized value which goes between 0 and 1 to between 0 and 255 and there we go that's nice that's what it should there we go and then okay thank you Thank You Oliver the kindest soul I really appreciate it all right so there was a lot of me stressed out toward I don't know where I'm gonna cut this in Mattia I don't know what you're gonna do with this and it might just be what it was which is fine but I'm gonna try to reverse engineer back to where um I can remember this by the way what happens if I just yeah oh yeah I'm gonna okay so this is what I had and it was like not very good okay hold on I'm just gonna okay I got it I got it I'm gonna save our right equals 200 okay here we go uh okay so uh this is gonna get cut back in somehow I don't know how but it's gonna get cut back in somehow welcome back that was an awkward cut but so what I was having some trouble figuring out how to color the Mandelbrot set so I think it would be best to look at first actually it's just two completely simplify things so this is what the Mandelbrot set looks like if there's only two possible colors if there is a essentially a background color and a foreground color the background color is set to be 200 so every pixel is 200 unless it's something unless it's a pixel that's made it all the way to the max iterations that's with that's something that's bounded that's within the Mandelbrot set so if it's within the Mandelbrot set it's bright this is zero it's a black pixel otherwise its brightness is 200 so we can see it so what I want to do is keep that core Mandelbrot set the set itself with a pixel value of zero and now you could probably Google Mandelbrot set color system and you could probably find all sorts of ways of doing it but thankfully the Internet chat came to my rescue let's just look at one other way of coloring this particular fractal so what I'm going to do is what I want to do is say okay well the iterations got somewhere between 0 and 100 so I'm gonna map I'm just a little bit quieter now because I think there's a session coming next group I'm gonna map the number of iterations from 0 to max iterations and I'm gonna make that some brightness value between 0 and 255 let's look at that yeah kind of work but you can barely see what's going on there at the edges so we need a way of changing the kind of scale here and actually a better way of doing this would be to actually first just normalize and which goes somewhere between 0 and max iterations normalize that between a value of 0 and 1 and then I'm gonna say bright equals map the square root of that value which also but incidentally has a range between 0 and 1 to between 0 and 255 so if i do that and i refresh this page now you can see this is starting to look more like what you might be used to seeing in kind of Mandelbrot set visualization and the other thing you'll notice here is I'm just sort of looking at this zoom version of the Mandelbrot set the reason why it's zoomed out is because the minimum and maximum range here are between negative two point five and two point five so what if I went between negative one point five and one point five come on now you can see I'm kind of zoomed in on it and what if I went between negative 0.5 and 0.5 and by the way what if I just made these variables so what if I said min X equals a negative 0.5 min y equals and actually I'm just gonna say I'm gonna say min val is negative 0.5 and Max val is 0.5 and what I'm actually gonna do is let's make let's make a min slider oh I can't do that up here and a max slider min slider equals create slider now I need the minimum value to be some value between like I don't know negative two point five and zero and I'm going to start with negative two point five and have a range of increment value of 0.01 and the max value this is kind of silly what I'm doing how I'm doing this but max value is going to be the same but between zero and two point five and we'll start at two point five and then what I'm gonna do is actually say min value min slider value max slider dot value and I'm gonna do this now for a and B now I'm gonna map Y as well so now I have two sliders so if I run this program whoops create sliders not defined okay I forgot to include the p5 Dom library so let me include that p5 Dom library and you can see okay there's some sliders down here now now there's sort of an issue which is that I'm changing the sliders but I'm not seeing anything change so let's figure out what's going on here it is at negative 1.5 well I have no loop in my code because then draw it before I didn't want it to change so I just had no loop so I'm gonna take out no loop so that it loops but there really is another issue which is that you know it's I can I can make these changes but look how slow so this pixel operations are really really slow so I'm gonna do this just in I'm gonna make like a 100 by 100 oh the other reason why it's so slow is I made this ridiculous 1,000 max iterations meaning for every pixel it's gonna iterate 1,000 times so that's terrible I don't need let's just do it like 50 times and now you can see like I can start to zoom in to different parts of the fractal it's actually quite fast so now we can see like well maybe I should let it be a little bit bigger and maybe I should let the maximum iterations be 100 and it's still kind of like at a reasonable speed and you can see I start to zoom in and we can really get the sense of the fractal this idea of a fractal of the entire shape of the Mandelbrot set there it is up there I can't reach up there because my hands get cut off but you see the idea if you could still hear guys speaking quietly this has kind of been kind of a crazy video but hopefully you've got something out of this talked a little bit about complex numbers imaginary numbers looked at how to set pixels according to what the properties of iterating those numbers have over a plane of XY values and looked at a little bit of how we can manipulate it with sliders and what I would love to see from you if you watch this video when it makes something with it look at the code think of a more thoughtful way of adjusting the range of doing a zoom a more thoughtful way of coloring them or thoughtful way of exploring hat with this algorithm you can do and in the next video someday I will not make this till next week I'm gonna look at what it means to create something called the Julia set which are little fractal patterns that are kind of like leaves or branches coming off of the Mandelbrot set we'll look at those in the next fractal Mandelbrot Julius that coding challenge video thanks for watching you guys are asking oh I didn't change width to height that probably didn't matter because yeah because the width and height are the same but yeah okay I am suggesting to make a work working copy of your code yeah yeah I you know today this wasn't this was a little bit of a mess today I'm speaking quietly because there's presentations going on in the next room and I didn't want to disturb them I may be a baby well maybe I'll come back next on Monday and do this Mandelbrot set thing again so unfortunately it's 515 now all I managed to do was the Mandelbrot set so I think I'm gonna go do you guys have questions anything anybody wants to ask before I go today I'm gonna be back on Monday for a more significant to our long experience one thing I was messing around with I don't know if it's actually already here I'll show you guys is hold on where's Terminal hold on control ccome on terminal what I'm going to do is look at the Monday I think oh yeah look at this sort of super shape thing so I this is part two of the super ellipse which is just adding a bit more and once I get through this I hope to be able to take that into 3d can you make a shape out of text can I make a shape out of text yes definitely I like that idea I should do some more of these kind of just like interesting strange graphics idea projects which I think might be nice other neural network I'm planning to do some machine learning topic videos at some point just not today just this one one topic for today people have been requesting ASCII art generator I like that idea cool ooh excellent Oliver is posting in the chat a link to Mandelbrot maybe I can bring it up whoops me I am so dot me slash old slash Mandelbrot vandal rot PHP cool so here you can see ah and the various and that's nice maksim iterations and generate this is great thanks for that reference okay everybody so I appreciate your patience with me today and your enthusiasm and unfortunately Mona have to shut this stream off today this was an hour and I will be coming back on Monday hopefully first thing in the morning on Monday this coming Monday the first thing in the morning is Eastern Time for me in New York City time and around you know I need as early as 930 more like 1030 or 1100 probably when I say morning by the time I get down here and get all the cameras set up and all that sort of stuff and I want to do more tutorials about p5 GS and sound as well as maybe a couple other these coding challenge ideas okay so I have to go I don't know how I don't know how this is going to turn out but it is what it is and I'm gonna I'm gonna shut the stream off and please be in touch with me you can there's the ways that you can be in touch is Twitter is at Schiffman if your I have a new website I might as well show it right now coding rainbow comm so if you go to coding rainbow comm this just always has a link to the most recent video it's got a couple of links to some playlists down here some a place where you can sign up to get email announcements and I also recently launched a patreon which has a private slack channel that you can join for discussions and thanks for watching and have a wonderful weekend please be in touch send me your feedback write your letters of complaints to Brian Williams care of NBC and I'll be back again on Monday okay everybody I'm gonna sign off now thanks thanks again hopefully this Mandelbrot thing was somewhat helpful and there were some useful parts to it
