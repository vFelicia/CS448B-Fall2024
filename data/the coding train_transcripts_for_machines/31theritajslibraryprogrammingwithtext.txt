hello welcome to a coding rainbow video the topic for this video is Rita what is Rita how can I use it how can you use it who are you who am i I don't know any of the answer to these questions but I'm going to attempt to talk about all of them Rita is a software toolkit for computational literature it is developed by Daniel how it is an open source project that you can find on github and you can use it with a variety of platforms most notably Java and also the processing programming environment as well as JavaScript and in the browser or with serverside programming with node and if you dive into it more you might find that there are other ways of approaching using Rita but what I'm going to do in this video is show you how to use Rita with clientside JavaScript with p5.js and what kinds of strange and interesting language experiments you can make so Rita has a wide variety of functionality so I'm going to click here to the reference and you can see like oh my goodness look at all these functions there's so much I can do with it but let me let me talk about sort of tube key to key aspects of the Rita library one is there is an object called a Rita string or RI string this is something that you can kind of feed your own text into if you take your string and make it a Rita string then you can analyze that string you can say things like well what are the parts of speech of these words how many syllables do each word have you can sort of analyze this particular string of text in a variety of ways another thing that Rita has is a Rita lexicon what is a lexicon so this is a kind of key term for a lot of the videos and things that I intend to do who they use videos which is a lexicon is another word for vocabulary you can think of it as a giant list of words a dictionary in a way as a lexicon a dictionary has a lot of other metadata associated with those words definitions pronunciations that type of thing and Rita has a lexicon built into it I believe the libraries that I'm gonna another library that I'm going to show you called NLP compromised as lexicon built into it word Nick which is a web service that you can query you can send it queries about words and get lots of information back essentially that's a giant lexicon in many ways so this is the kind of key aspect of Rita that you can use now one thing I should mention is a lexicon is not a small thing imagine if you had a text file with hundreds of thousands of words in it and all their definitions this would be a big file but Rita has it built into it itself but in a moment I'm going to download the library and I unfortunately don't remember the exact names but you a JavaScript library usually has a name dot extension J s so there is the Rina j s which is just all of the stuff the lexicon but I'm going to download and use Rita full J s which has the lexicon built into it and I don't know if I'm missing other distinctions between these two things but that's sort of the main idea here so let's come back and let's figure out how we can get started using Rita in a p5 sketch so first of all Daniel how who maintains this project has a lot of great information about how to use it here on github in all these environments so I'm not going to go and also I would encourage you to look at Ken I contribute and you can see if you're interested in contributing to the development of Rita I encourage you to do so as well ok so what I want to do first is I'm going to go here under dist and you can see here we go I was right there's Rita touch a s there's the minified version of minified version with Java Script library is you know taking all the line breaks out and making variable names shorter so you kind of get this like smaller file but it's not as readable code wise just for the sake of clarity I'm going to use Rita folce s so you can see this is a big file 1.5 6 megabytes I'm going to click download and it's just opening it up in Chrome for me so I'm going to hit save command s and I am going to a coding Rainbow a to Z a week 3 Rita Jo Chasse so I have a I have a project here like most of my project my web sketches are I have an HTML file I have my JavaScript code have a libraries folder so what I'm going to do here is in the libraries folder I also want to just save Rita full JSI Pro I'm sure it would attach that j/s extension automatically but I'm typing anything there to be very secure in its use okay there we go Rita's is read enough full digest is in that folder and now I can go back to my program and I can run it now of course I don't know what that weird little error is but oh you know what it is it doesn't exist okay hold I'm going to go back here we can see there we go I've still got my sketch I'm viewing my sketch in the browser but one thing I want to do now also is I want to consume the HTML file I want to make sure I have a reference also to the reader library so I have a reference to p5.js mp5 Dom das and now I need to just add one more libraries Rita full dot J s so now I should have access to that Rita library and you can see that I that in fact it's working a lot of JavaScript libraries if just when they initialize they spit out some some information in the console and Rita here is spitting out what version it is okay the whiteboard cam is squished Kent okay I'll come back to that later so sure I'm looking at the live chat in this video and I shouldn't be doing that because you're probably watching this video with no live chat but anyway okay so what's something that I can do first of all so let me just say let's let's look at some let me do some stuff in the console for you and then we'll maybe try to create a little experiment I'm going to write a sentence I'm going to say it was a dark and stormy night so now I have a string with it was a dark and stormy night one of the first things you might want to play with is actually create a Rita string an RI string out of existing text so if I do that I can say R equals nu RI string with s so look at that and sorry and R is now this Rita string and you can see by the way the Rita string object actually has a lot of other stuff associated with it first of all it has the text this X Y Z Rita actually has drawing functionality for rendering text built into it as well I'm not going to explore that so much here but what I can do now is I can start to call all of these kinds of functions like let's look at our dot analyze our actually let me just do our POS so I'm going to now say our whoops imma say our POS POS stands for a part of speech noun verb adverb adjective what category of word is it and you can see remember what my string was it preposition was verb d what's vbd hmm so where this is more than just I mean n n is now but what's JJ and DT what are all of these what are all these parts of speech tags so these are parts of speech tags and they come from something highly specific and if I go to the reference page I'm sure it will tell me so this comes from the pen tag set so let's look at that pen referring to the University of Pennsylvania I believe and this is a kind of common set of tags for parts of speech and you can see you can get quite detailed about this beyond just like hey I'm gonna make some mad lips things with noun verbs and adjectives we've got four word word existential there determiner cardinal number adjective noun plural proper noun singular so I encourage you to sort of explore and play with this but just what I'm showing you here is the fact that you can now have an array that gives you the parts of speech of every word and this is this is something I could use them to create a program that that says find me all the nouns and replace them with synonyms or something like that so that's one thing that you can do and I just want to show you if I say are analyzed the analyze function is a function on a rita string that will give me all of the metadata associated with that string so if I do that I can now kind of look at this javascript object that it's giving me back and you can see there's this features array here and in there there are phonemes parts of speech stresses syllables text tokens etc so Reena does all the kind of common text analysis operations that you might do on a sentence a chunk texts how do you pronounce it what are the phonemes where are the parts of speech where do the words have their stresses how many syllables to each word hat does each word have and it also has a tokenizer meaning a way of using a way of chopping the sentence up into word tokens and I showed you how to do this with the JavaScript split function last week but this is a great thing that you can do here just with the analyze function itself so now let's make this example do something using these this text analysis and let's also add the lexicon so I'm going to show you in a minute how the lexicon works but first let me just spin something up here in this example where I'm going to create a variable called input and I'm going to say input equals equals create input I'll put in some default text like it was a dark and stormy night and then I'm going to assign an event input dot changed update I'll just say a process Rita so this is a very simple bit of code for a p5.js program where I want to just create a textbox that a user could type in and whenever the user hits enter the changed event will trigger and I'm going to have a function called process a function called process Rita and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say this you get a string from what is actually in that text input box the value of that 10 X in the input box and I'm going to say create PS so just to make sure this is doing what I want it to do right now I have oh and I should make the size of that I think if I do something like this no let's make it 300 great a little bit bigger so all I need to do is be in the text box and hit enter and so what happened there does the changed event this is typed correctly console dot log event tab Y has changed not working oops I just realized I forgot that with the changed event right I can hit enter all I want here but if the content hasn't actually changed then the event doesn't actually trigger when I hit enter so maybe I'll add a button just as another option so I'm going to say button I'm going to say button equals create button submit and then I'm also going to say button dot mousepressed process Rita so now I have and I apologize for my voice I have a cold I took a little break and my boys got worse so now now whether I press the button or hit enter if I've changed it this dysfunction down here should trigger so we can see I can hit submit a bunch of times or I can change something and hit enter okay so the reason why I wanted to do that is because I don't need it to be that big let's just make it 200 the reason why I wanted to do that is what I want to look at now is how can I pull out how can I get let's do some let's basically do a mad libs style text replacement algorithm so what I'm going to do first here is I want to say words equals first I want to make a Rita string so I must say var RS equals new read a string with that string then I want to say var words equals RS dot and I believe it's just tokenize so I don't remember if that's what it is I'm going to say console.log words and it's not the right function tokenize is not a function so let's go back and look at the reference and I'm going to look at the reference here and words there's actually a function just called words which returns an array of the words in the object so I'm just going to say RS dot words and I am going to refresh it it's submit and you can see there we go and what's nice about this is I also get the period so up my my punctuation is retained because ultimately what I want to do is rebuild this string so let me rebuild this string right now and I'm going to say var output is an empty string and then I'm going to look at that I'm going to loop over all of those words and I'm going to say output plus equal words index I and then after that I'm going to say create P with the output so what I want to do is split the string up and then we put it back together and display it so if I do this and hit submit I've got it but I lost the spaces so you know I talked a bit about using the split function where I have to investigate in the reader library maybe there's a way I can keep those space tokens but for right now just to be simple about things I'm also going to say output plus equals I'm going to just manually add a space so look at this it submit there's a little bit of a problem in that I have a space between the T in the period but again all this is clean clean up a bowl okay so now what what's next what I want to do with this example is go and use so first I want to also get the parts of speech I totally forgot about that so let's get the parts of speech and save rpoS equals RS POS and I'm going to console.log POS so we can see that too so whoops I'm in the wrong place I'm going to hit this hit submit we can see here are the words and here are the parts of speech so let's say all I want to do is replace only the nouns with another word so I'm going to do that by saying if POS index I equals and n so if the part of speech for the word at index I is a now do something otherwise just use the literal word okay so now what do I want to do instead of use the literal word well here's where I can use the other really another really powerful aspect of Rita I can use the lexicon one of the things I can say to the lexicon is when I am squished look at that one of the things I can say to the lexicon is give me another noun so let's look at how I might do that and I'm going to come here and I am going to go look at look at the reference and I can see here's all these functions so first of all one thing you should realize is you can expand the lexicon with this add word function and you can test all sorts of things and all sorts of stuff you can get things similar by sound similar by letter there's all sorts of information in ways that you can retrieve words from the lexicon but the one that I want to do is just look at random word and look at this I can ask for a random word I can ask for a random any random word a random word by part of speech a random word with a certain number of syllables or in a random word with a certain part of speech and certain number of syllables so let's look at how we would do that let's go to the code first thing I need to do is I need a variable to store a reference to the lexicon and in setup I want to say lexicon equals nu RI lexicon I think I think I just need to create a kind of read a lexicon object let's see if this kind of works and I should be able to say lexicon here and you can see there's the object and you can see there's an array in there with 20,000 things in it and those are probably the 20,000 words that are in the lexicon and I'm sure if we read through the reader documentation there'll be information about where that lexicon comes from so if I were to say lexicon random word trivialize tonight learners outcome and I could say random word six syllables conspiratorial archaeological six syllables I could say give me a random noun lifetime ran down with five syllables socialization so this is really exciting I just have sort of this instant vocabulary of things I can just use and use in my program so I'm going to say here give me a output plus equal lexicon random word noun so now if i refresh this page it was a dark and stormy unpleasantness it was a dark and stormy delineation and I could say kittens and unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes hit submit and now I have kittens and unicorns oh you know why because those aren't plural nouns those so interestingly enough let's do it for both nouns or plural nouns what might be a way that I could do that well here's something that's exciting I could say if I could say I could make a regular expression right and n dot star right I want to match and n followed by anything dot test that part of speech so this is me using a regular expression to say if it's any kind of noun give me a random word and then of course I don't have to hard code in and and there I could say give me a word with that particular part of speech so now if we refresh this still working either says dark and stormy loophole but I could say kitten and kittens and kitten and kittens and it's submit and I've got evangelism and points and naturalism and mandates so you can see it's working with both it's giving me a singular noun or a plural noun wherever it might exist okay so you can see this is what's possible now I would encourage you to do things like okay what if you ask for a rhyming word here or a similarsounding word here so I'm going to sort of finish this right here you have the basic idea of how you can import the reader library how you can analyze a string for various things like parts of speech syllable stresses and also how you can use the lexicon to start asking for things and so I would encourage you to explore this further go in look at the reference try other functions if you're looking for an exercise one thing that I might a couple things I might suggest are come up with a more clever and creative way to do this word replacement may be based on rhymes similar sounding not just parts of speech another new thing you might think of as make this interactive so what if you have a text and anytime you click on a word it replaces it with a rhyming word as opposed to just kind of doing it arbitrarily so some type of interactive system like that try that with the reader library and see what else you can do rita by the way has a whole lot of functions for generating text but i'm going to explore those later as i look at some of those algorithms in future videos as well okay thanks for watching this video on rita I hope you enjoyed it and I'll see you in other videos in the future
