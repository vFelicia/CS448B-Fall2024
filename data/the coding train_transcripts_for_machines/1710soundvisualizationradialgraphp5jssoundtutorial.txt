as always another audio visualization video and the previous one left us weird like shaking crazy graphing the volume of a sound file and what I want to do now and it was a great suggestion from Oliver and the chat is instead of graphing as a graph along say an xaxis what if I took this graph and wrapped it around a circle and the way to do that is to think about a circle as a bunch of points that are based on an angle and a radius so if that angle iterates all around the circle but the radius changes according to the volume then maybe we've got something so let's see if we can implement that so I need to I'm going to just kind of like simplify the code for a second so I'm gonna pull this out I'm gonna pull out the push oh oh that's fine I'll reverse engineer all this code later I made a new version but that's fine I'm going to take out this line and then run it again as always I've always pretty great to play this so what I want to do now instead is say ok what if I I'm gonna do a begin shape and shape and I'm gonna say I is less than 360 and I now I need to have I is the angle right so first of all I want to I want to have the sketch in think in terms of degrees I can by default p5 we'll think in width of angles in a unit of measurement called radians but I want to think in terms of degrees here and I can say VAR x equals and this is a math formula that converts from an angle and a radius to an x and y position which is R times cosine of that angle that's X and VAR y equals R times sine of that angle and I can now have a vertex at X comma Y and I can say R equals just 100 let me run this I think there's that circle around if your so what I want to do now is right before he or say translate with / let's let's have the centre be in the center and put a semicolon here and here we go as always our goal stop there do not let this stop this is the Cartesian coordinate systems and now what I'm going to do is are can be based on the volume so it can be let's just say it's between 10 and 100 based on what the volume is and I can get this out of here oops that pop is unnecessary and I want to only ever have 360 elements in the array and now I can do this as always I always forget the Vista all right so there's plenty more I could I could keep going with this you can make it rainbow color that could fill it in to stop colors I could have the colors respond to something else I encourage you to this version and stuff in the next video and then show you had okay thanks for watching another video where I'm
