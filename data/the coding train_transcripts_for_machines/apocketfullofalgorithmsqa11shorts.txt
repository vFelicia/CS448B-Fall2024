and we're back in part two I'm gonna show you my pocket Handbook of algorithms this is one of my favorite books to pull things from because everybody needs their own pocket Handbook of image processing algorithms look it fits in my pocket well hello I have right here in my pocket a handbook of image processing algorithms what's in here that's cool actually I should find a new one to do whoa warping ooh fun we should try that dithering I did a dithering I did the dithering who says that and I'm going to do this dithering more recently I've been using two incredible sources the Arcane algorithm archive which is organized by James schloth it's a compilation a community resource collaborative effort to have every single algorithm documented in every possible programming language I'm looking for something now that maybe I could actually do that I haven't done yet I want to go more in depth but it's going to be in the next one so scroll along and see you soon
