question from Julian I want to include not a single PNG but a gif but I have problems with the correct implementation Julian your question couldn't have come at a better time in the newest release of P5 there is a save GIF function arguments you need to add are the file name for the gift you want to save and how long you want to record the canvas and then there's an additional trick that I'll show you in a minute whoa that was gonna have an overlay that was incredible oh look at that it worked it doesn't Loop perfectly that's because I just said do it for five seconds but what if I said do it for a specific number of frames a full loop is from zero to two Pi so the angle changes by 2 pi divided by the number of frames now I could replace the number five with the number of frames and then an options object to tell it the unit I wanted to consider is not seconds I think yeah that's a perfectly looping GIF in P5 with one line of code
