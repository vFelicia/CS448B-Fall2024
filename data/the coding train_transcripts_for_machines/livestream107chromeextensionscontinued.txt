hello happy Friday greetings from live from New York University here at the Tisch Gillooly hearts it's me Daniel Shipman and I am here on the coding train to dude wait as I am most every Friday in this strange room which is actually just a closet with some filing cabinets and a couple computers but I'm here to talk about code and do some coding stuff and be with you the people of the internet and that's what I'm here for so if you've never watched before might I suggest something else to do you know tea is lovely to drink meditation is good I like listening to music board games I am a big fan of board games card games or excellent going outside and just playing like with a frisbee I don't know I always use frisbee as an example personally I like I'm not kind of like a baseball throw the baseball catch the baseball musicaltheater find somewhere that has musical theater and go watch and listen and be filled with joy with music and dance and song because if you are here just watching this video it's just gonna be me and my computer over here it's not beer as well okay so what's going on today is the usual Friday there's about 4 p.m. Eastern Time one thing I wanted to mention is I'm now trying to alternate morning versus afternoon my time because I know that right now hopefully you're sleeping and not actually watching this but some of some of my international viewers this is quite a late slash middle of the night time so everything I do gets preserved by the glorious thing that is the YouTube it will archive it I also save my own personal backup of the livestream and you can always watch it back later so what's going to happen today I am would first like to cover some business which is my handy dandy guide to what's happening on the Kotick train there it is so you can go to this URL which is github.com slash coding train slash rainbow code in this readme there are some key links for you for example the YouTube channel the coding train how you can become a I think I should say become a patron like the service is patreon but the people are patrons so if you'd like to support what I'm doing in a financial way you can sign up become a patron and depending on different levels I will sometimes if I'm going to get around to it send you something in the mail you will also get an invitation to this slack channel which I am looking at right now where people are telling me to make sure ah that I stay hydrated because as you know coding train is brought to you by water you can drink it and then sometimes later you might have to go can I say I can I say can I say pee pee on YouTube is that okay I'm not sure alright boy let me tell you ever since I got this water sponsorship it's just been amazing here I mean I've never my life has totally changed so you can suggest the topic it's kind of true that suggesting topical it just goes through this giant list of stuff that I almost never get to but I aspire someday I will figure out how to make this suggest a topic system work if I had a good system for upvoting or something maybe at least once per week I could pull something from there but right now I've just got stuff I'm trying to get to Oh the holidays are coming up what could be better for your family friends the significant other person and then a coding train tshirt or membership to the patreon or a mug anyway there's nothing you could buy whatever don't worry about it if you want to it's there is there mmmhmm so that's all I have to say about that now this is my schedule of my future live streams I am trying to have a schedule since I can't have a regular weekly time what I at least would like to do is lay out a schedule in advance and so this is what this is today Friday November 17th 400 p.m. I really need to go to the eye doctor it's terrible it's like it's either too far or too close I can't just go like this I have to take my glasses off oh okay some one of these days I think I really think I also need some more colorful glasses like something bright purple is really thick or something like that to be more stylish than I already am because that's you know I'm quite I mean this is like you know I am like totally with it with the whole YouTube thing being like you know super YouTube creator style person right I'm so old to be on YouTube okay now I'm looking at this what else oh so this is my schedule this computer doesn't have a power plug so everyone's wrong I have to so this is some stuff I'm gonna do today next week is a holiday here in the country where I live called Thanksgiving so I will not be having a live stream on Friday November 24th in fact this building where I broadcast from will be completely closed so even if I wanted to I could not get in here so the next live stream will unfortunately be two weeks from now but I have planning some bonus dates I did miss a date when I had a bad cold in November so right now tentatively speaking Wednesday December 13th I don't know if I take these topics too seriously we're probably gonna change them because things are changing in my mind I should also mention that especially here in New York you should come to this in person but if I go to ITP NYU edu slash show [Laughter] I should just always have this kitten Chrome extension so this is by the way I forgot that last week let me just look at this here are there even kittens here no there's not a kitten there anyway oh yeah look my profile picture is like some sort of kitten I forgot that last week I did a let's see if we refresh the page a different kid oh sorry it's very distracting the kittens but I did a chrome extension to changed any pictures to kittens so maybe I need to just turn that off briefly here for a second there we go let's disable that now I could come back to this website if you are here in New York Sunday December 17th from 200 to 600 p.m. and Monday December 18th from 400 to 800 p.m. you can come visit and see all 100 plus projects made by ITP master students all semester long they'll be showing their work I will be here I will also like I have done in previous shows do a livestream from my mobile device with some kind of ridiculous selfie stick thing oh my god even worse than saying P is saying sucks it's one of those I have one of those things that's got like a smoothing thing in it it helps you balance out whatever it is that you're holding so I will do a livestream about show you project from the show as well and this reminds me another announcement that I would like to make in addition to teaching here at NYU in ITP I am also involved with the processing foundation you might be you might remember the processing foundation from such it's as p5.js or processing py but one thing I wanted to mention is the fellowship program the open call for the fellowships or 2018 is now live processing foundation is a notforprofit we have a small limited budget and most of the things that we do are volunteer driven but this is one of the program run where we fund with a stipend speculative projects that can reimagine what processing can do as software and as a community so I encourage you to look at past fellowships you can see Cassie here who's the creator of the p5.js web editor Andrews also worked on the web at her DIY girls which is an organization in California got free Justin Raspberry Pi stuff Nicholas who did some work in South Africa with kids who didn't have any experience with computers at all Saskia has been teaching stuff in London Susan who did a program about teaching p5 in prisons and these are even so previous ones Alison and Clare except so take a look at this you can see what kind of projects we've funded in the past and if you're interested in applying you can just click here and I believe it'll take you to a Google Form and hopefully most of that is selfexplanatory but if you have questions about that you can reach out to me at Schiffman on twitter also at processing org is the official processing foundation twitter sometimes weird noises happen in here and i don't know if you hear them or just me but it was if somebody above me dropped a sort of like jar full of marbles like rolling around or else I'm losing my mind more than I already a.m. all right so what am I gonna do today apparently at some point I put all this stuff on this list so I would like to finish off I mean nothing is ever finished but I would like to at least complete what I had set out to do about Chrome extensions so I want to add I want to do a tutorial how that how to add a pop up to a Chrome extension I forgot what this is called somebody in the chat somebody in the chat actually okay Austin is giving me a good point I want to I should mention some things about the patreon rewards if people are curious Andre the chat asks do you have any good JavaScript tutorials well I definitely have JavaScript tutorials do I have good ones not so sure about that but if they have them and maybe you like them so yeah just just to answer a question here and everyone while I try to look at the live chat it's very difficult to follow but I might as well mention if you are a beginner and you've never programmed before there are plenty of resources beyond what I offer here on the coding train but the playlist you're looking for is this one foundations of programming in JavaScript so this is a playlist if I click on it oh no it's go surprise video I'm in an ad let's play a video for our new undergraduate program here it's very meta everything's very meta here but this is the playlist you want to look at there was something I wanted to mention about this which is if there's time today I need I want to continue yeah these videos these once I get to 7.6 I'm still using an older way of creating objects in JavaScript so I there's three to do videos here that I need to redo so I got to come back to that what was I talking about so the Chrome extension stuff I want to do on Twitter I'm gonna look up this tweet someone tweeted me very helpful information and you know it's it's my fault really just think about I you know the Chrome extensions is something that I encountered a while ago and used and talked with them but the concept of a browser extension beyond just simply the Chrome browser is a thing that exists and you can make extensions for other browsers in a more open way as well so I want to see if I can at least touch on that I want to revisit the current state of WebGL and p5 maybe do a little tutorial see how that is and moro P&J s and yeah definitely I term will be getting that very soon and and this is a new thing that I've been doing do I have this working I don't think I have this maybe I'll go through the steps to install this No so I'm really excited about machine learning ai stuff is coming to this channel I but what the two things I'm excited about one is I've been doing a lot of work recently with this library and in fact I met with the creators of the library yesterday Nikhil for at and Daniel smell cough who are amazing this is a JavaScript library for doing deep learning in the browser and I am working on a whole bunch of examples that I will go through and talk about on this channel very soon I'm gonna be updating a lot of my previous machine learning stuff using this library so that's coming the other thing that I have figured out to do which is kind of fun is any Python script torch script something that you can run and do via the command line I have a kind of a generic example for how to use nodejs to run that script and send the results to your p5 sketch so on the one hand I want to be able to do some of these algorithms right there in the browser themselves but if I need to run this algorithm as a separate script in a different programming language your environment I can use know to connect those two things so whether I get to that today or not is kind of an open question but that's my plan so that's my introduction 15 minutes I am going to I am going to now take the time at the beginning usually I say this for the end but I feel it's important to continue my work reading the entire book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal deviates last time I made it through the forward I don't think I read the table of contents so I'm gonna read the table of contents right now I'm gonna move on contents page let me start over contents page acknowledgments seven introduction nine production of the random digits nine tests on the random digits eleven normal deviates fourteen use of the tables twenty table of random digits one through four hundred table of random normal devious one to two hundred pagination begins anew with table acknowledgments the following persons participated in the production testing and preparation for publication of the tables of random digits and the random normal deviates Paul Armour EC Bower mrs. Pernice Braun GW Braun Walter France JJ Goodpasture WF gunning sessile or Hastings Olaf Elmer ml Jim Cosa JD Madden am mood Artie Nash JD Williams these tables were prepared in connection with analyses done for the United States Air Force okay well the introduction is gonna be you know honestly the the interesting thing is like this stuff is like the stuff in the introduction is a really fascinating interesting stuff the men I get to the random members got to get to those random numbers all right put that over there ITP winter show somebody I just this was my bookmark I didn't put it in the book somebody will remind me next time so I'm being asked in the chat Austin says don't we usually do this part at the end yes we do but I feel it's important to emphasize the random numbers book and I want to maybe as a bookend today's episode I'll do it at the beginning on the end all right let me let me take this let me look at this chat here for a second okay so I'm gonna answer a couple questions Siyad o asks how much different is p5.js from regular javascript and this is an excellent question on the one hand oh and by the way while I'm answering this question if somebody can maybe even in the slack patron group could give me a screenshot of how I had the whiteboard about Chrome extensions at the end of last week's video I'm gonna need to unfortunately okay it's off recreate that cuz the whiteboard has been erased I left it there but other people use this room so so now first of all I do have a video I think it's something like the history of p5 or during p5 and processing I have a couple videos maybe they're under the QA playlist where I talk about some of the stuff a bit more indepth perhaps but in a way I might say that comparing p5 in JavaScript is a flawed comparison so the thing to compare would be sort of more like comparing p5 and d3 or p5 and jQuery or p5 and 3j s because 3j s d3 p5 jQuery many more things these are libraries for the language that is JavaScript so javascript is the programming language p5 is simply a library of stuff that you can import and use while you're programming in JavaScript the reason why that the question is quite valid though however is because what p5 does is simply wrap or alter or provide a simpler smaller syntax for some of the things you might do in JavaScript natively meaning with just what the sort of like language provides in the browser for you by default mostly around drawing to a canvas so and it's meant to be more beginner friendly and easy to get up and running with that valuing sort of like emphasizing that over kind of longer scalable larger software projects that require a lot more strict ways of putting things together so that's that's what I would say is kind of an answer to that so Austin is also asking me to mention the Google forum so I you know I don't want to overemphasize the patreon stuff but I am finally getting around to sending rewards out for everybody who joined in 201617 I got the year it's 2017 everybody it's like the end of 2017 I've gotten everybody who joined in 2016 I think I think yes that's been that was done at the end of last year so you should have got if you're a patron you should got an email with a Google Form if you already filled out a Google Form then you didn't get an email because I have your nation already if for some reason you think that your should get something but you haven't or did get a form just send me I know right so now I have this whiteboard image and I'm going to zoom in on it and I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna try to recreate it so I probably should have done this so what's the main thing we need for a Google Form Chrome extension I don't know I think my brain is misfiring more and more every day somebody should do unlike scientific study of the vocabularies doing over time content script last week I did some tutorials on content scripts and we had something we had a file called content j/s I also looked at background scripts and I called that background dot je s I don't like this marker let's try a different one actions browser action page action I talked about actions browser action page action actually I think I might not I'm gonna have erased that since last week because I'm gonna actually put popups down here so you know what I could do is like add over here like browser actions the browser action is like you you hit a button in the browser you can listen for that in the background script I had a little diagram a silly diagram of the browser itself which looks something like this and I think I said something like content and button like button so I think this is fine to start with so the other thing I would love for people to think about as I sort of move into looking at what a popup is and how you do a popup I would love to get some ideas for like so I want to do the same thing I did last week which is just kind of do some standard regular tutorials and that would be just how to put a popup how to communicate between a popup and a content script and we'll see if I want to do the tab over and a tab over right I definitely want to do that so I want to do those things and then what I would like to do is like come up with some very simple scenarios like I had the kitten eyes our thing I had the doodler thing so I want to do like maybe one or two Chrome extension challenges mostly when I asked for this the things people give me are like really complicated elaborate project ideas that's what I want you to make it doesn't be complicated but I want to make really simple quick projects that are kind of ridiculous and useless to help inspire you to make things from those all right so all right so I think I'm good to go with the popup thing if you wouldn't mind indulging me for a second I would love to just like look at some of my examples oops so if you're so one thing I failed to get the code from last week uploaded I'm meant to try to get this afternoon so at least could say like I upload it but I didn't get to so apologies for that I will make sure soon to have all the code from the tutorials from last week and from today uploaded on github but what I want to show you is I also have a lot of Chrome extensions first of all I have a writeup by the way if anyone wants to this this is this page this website this is where I have tutorials for one of my courses if anybody wants to give me a pull request this page to fix up anything that's their point to new examples embed my YouTube videos that I published in the appropriate place on this page I mean I'm gonna get to this at some point but I would accept the pull request it's github.com slash Schiffman slash Schiffman net you can find this is a github pages site that uses Jekyll so you have to kind of see how that works but I would love help with that what I'm looking for is where I have the stuff on messaging I have popups so this this is how I do a popup I give it an HTML page and then what I want to look at then a lot of these examples are here in my a to z course and I just wanted to see popup messaging how did I do this between popup and the content script so this searches for the end just sends a message so it's the same thing that you do in a background script but you send it from the popup great okay so I'm gonna do this alright okay any yeah so there's a good clarification thing I'm gonna read this comment also from Austin it might be worth mentioning when you make a Chrome extension the background script and the popup scripts essentially run in their own individual environments and this I didn't mention to st. in those words but this is why when I look at the Chrome extensions page and I want to debug something if I want to debug the background script I'm gonna have to go and open a console through here the separate environment and it doesn't know anything about the content page only the content page does so having an extension enabled is the equivalent of having one or two tabs console open so having a lot of extensions running can slow things down ziz a good point okay so um I'm not gonna be able to follow any suggestions that are in the YouTube chat Amir might catch one so if anybody sees something good who if you're in the if you're in the patron group and you see something you can paste it in the slack chat or you can tweet your suggestions too at the coding train I think I think I'm logged in as that so I can look at my notifications so if you have a suggestion for who this is a nice there's some nice things okay if you have a suggestion you can you can tweet it to me here and I will take a look at it alright I think maybe oh boy did I really just talk for a half an hour I think maybe we're ready to begin what's interesting to me is like I can easily imagine a live stream that happens you know every week or something that's just like a half an hour long I manage to just talk for a half an hour like how I'm about to do something so apologies for that mono deep in the chat asked do you have any nodejs tutorials I have a whole bunch of nodejs tutorials I wish there was a really perfect and great way that I could organize everything so you can find it instantly you just have to poke through my different playlists on on YouTube alright let's let's remember our sponsor on the coding tree hydrogen dioxide hmm at oxygen stuff with the hydrogen stuff I mean you got to get it mixed in a certain way precisely otherwise you could really run into trouble but it is quite good alright yeah I'm being asked will you make a tutorial about how to make a Firefox extension I would like to to be honest with you I've never done that before so I might may get more of like I don't know tutorials the right word but I'm gonna attempt to do one if we have time today dihydrogen oxide I said that wrong didn't I oh my god hold on I totally said that wrong how embarrassing and then h2o Wikipedia yeah the two is oh my god I don't even want to I don't even I don't even I don't let's let's just move off of this topic immediately oh no I was right you're talking bout something else I don't know what's going on anymore can we please move up I don't know anything about a chemistry it's chemistry right that's the correct subject do I own a clothing store I do not but I do have look cool this is live right I can't just like go back in time anymore let's let's do some popups let's let's think about kids yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that I hide all right so uh huh thank you thank you very much everybody this has been the coding train introduction I think I gotta go now many 806 will be by again hello this is another video in my series about Chrome extensions which you know right now I just want to say at the beginning of this video I hope to actually turn this playlist into something that's instead of saying Chrome extensions just say browser extensions because that is something that is quite possible beyond simply the browser chrome but I'm gonna stick with Chrome right now as I work through all the details so what am I going to add in this particular video well as you can see here in my diagram the over there anymore my monitor is now blocked by something else as you can see in my diagram here I have talked about content scripts and background scripts and what I'm going to add today is something called a popup so a popup is a page that you can launch that's essentially like an overlay of what what's in the browser at the certain and a certain moment and I can launch it via a browser action for example clicking a button that I have in the top over here I can press that button and I can have some sort of popup come up so I could do things like I could have an interface where I could change colors or make selections or or type in a word that I want to look up I can augment the browsing experience through a separate popup page that is that as part of my Chrome extension so that's what we're gonna make in this tutorial I'm now going to walk over here and then I just realized I don't have anything prepared code wise I'm so I got a this look this will be an edit point so I'm gonna go here Chrome extensions backgrounds grip let's let's stick with that one whoops ah so I'm gonna do oh five popups and one thing I want to do is just fix this button because I think this button had all this transparency associated I'm just gonna hold on this is very important work that I'm doing I'm going to crop this image it's very important that I do this okay and then I'm going to look I'm gonna I'm gonna delete these extensions and I'm going to change I'm gonna open up Adam and I'm gonna close these and I'm gonna go to pop ups a background script which I don't need just to have a pop up I don't need a background script so I'm going to take out the background script this content script just changes when I press the button I'm gonna so I'm gonna take this out I'm gonna leave this in here huh maybe I should do this in hold on I'm gonna actually do this in the tutorial cuz I'm gonna start with the one that I had last so let me put that back and here so I'm going to change the browser action to a popup okay I should really switch to visual studio yeah probably oh there's this teletype thing for Adam have you have you all seen this we should try it looks very dangerous forbids it allows everybody to only collaboratively edit the same file which I'd love to do but I have a feeling that I will get some serious trolling in if I let just like open that up to anybody so I'm not so sure how to approach that all right so I'm gonna call this coatings train extension 3 and I'm gonna hit refresh and I'm going to come back over here and alright I'm going to I can leave these things open that's fine here all right and now ok so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start with the code that I had at the end of my background script tutorial which if we look at already made a copy of it into a new folder which I'm calling popups which you can find a link to this code for the tutorial in the description as usual and what i'm what i have is that manifest.json file so i've already changed it to coding train extension 3 maybe I'll say you know I'll changes the coding train popup it is like the content script is available for all URLs in the background strip now interestingly enough I actually don't need a background script just to have a popup like I might need a background script for something else that's going on in my extension but I don't need it just for the popup so I think just for simplicity in this particular tutorial I'm gonna take out the background script and I'm actually going to just delete the file that is the background so actual you know what I'm gonna leave it there because eventually one thing that I'm gonna want to do is if you recall a way that I sent a message the way that I controlled the content script or made an event happen the contract script from the background script was sending a message and actually what I probably going to want to do now is set message from the popup to the content script so the code that's in the background script is going to become useful for me because I can use that same code in the popup alright so but when there's a browser action I want there to be something more I want there to be a default popup no it's not written over there what I'm supposed to type right here I just looked over there because there was something interesting happening I'm putting notes over there and I want this to be now can I make that in another folder let's try this and I want to try do is make the popup of entire Pete let's actually first just make an HTML page so I'm gonna just call it popup HTML and I think I need to say oh I don't need to but I can say default title and this will appear in like the tooltips like a popup will come here alright so I think that is now some stuff that I can add to now have a popup now what this means is there needs to be an HTML page called popup that HTML so I'm gonna make that file popup dot HTML and I'm just gonna I mean I should I don't really know you need all this stuff in the HTML page but let's just put basically like something really basic there right now just to say like no I know choo choo okay so this is this page I want to see popup when I press that button in the browser okay here we go so now what do I need to do remember I need to load the code and it'll load that extension oh five popups this is the one I'm gonna select the whole folder I'm gonna hit select no errors occurred in the loading of this extension so it should be fine now I can go to any page I just happen to be going to my coding train I mean my chrome extension tutorial page I'll go there now look I should be able to see this button right here this is my button the reason why it has that image is because I included the default icon to be this PNG file and if I click there look at that there's my popup it can't have a giant to chew right there and not use the train whistle all right so we see that the pop ups work now let's try to do something a little bit more interesting with the pop up let me see if I can put an animation there something let's see if I can put a whole p5 sketch there so let's try that so what I want to do I'm going to just work with the file system for a second like let me see if I can do I'm gonna make a folder called sketch and then what I'm gonna do is I'm going to I'm gonna actually delete popup dot HTML we saw that that worked I'm going to pause for a second and come back in a second and we need to find a p5 sketch so let me what's a good example p5 sketch like the flocking one for example for like no good reason other than why not right so where do I have do I have a nature of code examples on this computer examples p5 seriously do not have a nature of code examples p5 let's go get that github.com / Schiffman / the nature of code examples p5.js that is clone this repository oh the morphing circle that is a good one oh yeah I should probably do something from a code previous coding challenge so it's a better idea thank you good suggestion so where is where do I keep that let's look for the rainbow code repository I must have it somewhere on this computer oops and let me Oh in my other it's in a different that's this is gonna be a problem is it really gonna let me do this there's no way it's gonna let me do this yeah because I'm not like earth this is so ridiculous boy am I really making this I'm over doing this now just like go rainbow there's a song anyway I don't know what my computer is showing me let's that's gonna be good enough so let's go to coding challenges and let's find what's a good one from here the morphing let's try one of the games like am I having technical issues uh I should just done the flocking thing I don't know why now I got nine I get myself feeling crazy like I have to decide what is this a fractal tree in p5 yeah I mean let's try this let's just get this one okay I like the maze generator let's do that because it's I'm kind of curious that it has like all this stuff in it let's do that desktop desktop Chrome extensions popups I'm just gonna really quickly just gonna really quickly run a server just so I can make sure that example works whoa did I just name the folder I meant to name this folder sketch not to get shot yes and here we go all right all right so this does work something horrible has happened though which is that I think it kept the file extension those computers are so silly because it's still in a folder called sketch j/s Oh everything's gonna be ok everybody I'm gonna manage this I'm gonna manage this I am going to make this happen I can do it I can put everything where I want it to be I can fix things that are named in weird ways for no reason and there we go ok so now the goal is when I click the button to have the maze popup let's see if we can make that work all right so where was I this tutorial was somewhere lost all right and I'm back now what I have done in that very long amount of time wait longer than should taken me is I have grabbed one of my previous examples from a coding challenge that generates a maze and I have put all of the code for that coding challenge in a folder called sketch so now what I want is for the popup to display that example let's just look at that example what that example does I've got that example also just running here in the browser let me just quickly go to that so this is the example it it generates a maze using a particular algorithm that I used a long time ago in to challenge so what I want is when I click this the files not there anymore I want to see that maze okay here we go we're gonna make this happen so what do I do what I have to do is this file doesn't exist anymore I deleted it what I need to do is here the default popup should be sketch slash index.html so the question is is that enough if I just point to that page that's in the sketch folder will it work or do I need to do something more to reference the different JavaScript files and libraries and things that I'm using let's find out and then I'm going to change oh let me just show you that here we should see we should say generate a maze that's going to be the message the little tooltip message when you hover over the button so I need to go and reload the Chrome extension and it doesn't actually really matter what page I'm on but I'm a stick on this page if I hover over here you should see right I'm getting that generate a maze message and then I worked so that was actually quite easy so you can see here I have the maze generating in the popup and interestingly enough let me press that but goes away is it gonna pause and continue from where it was before is it gonna start over had it already been running for a while when I first clicked it I'd even notice let's look again let's see interesting it started over so notice this is very important this is a page that's being loaded fresh each time every time you click it's not a page that's running and being hidden and then revealed it's actually a new page that's being loaded which brings up another question how do i D bug something that's happening on the popup is there something here nope whoops so let's add a console dot log into the popup this is actually all of that code and I'm just going to say console dot log frame count so this is what I would log typically in a p5 sketch if I wanted to just see that it was running it should say 0 1 2 3 4 5 counting every single frame so now I'm gonna reload the extension I'm going to refresh over here and I'm going to click the button so where is it logging that well let's look in the JavaScript console let's try clicking the button again it's over my console let me try it again no so notice how this is not where the only the content script is playing a role in the actual content page this popup is just information so this video is about the end because I'm kind of at the end of it but I need to do something what I want to show is how you can have the content script send a message I'm sorry the popup send a message because ultimately maybe I want to build an interface there where I you know I made a Chrome extension where I do it along the page so maybe I can like pick a color or change the line thickness that type of thing so I'm gonna get to that in the next video but I at least want to figure out where I can debug this stuff let's go back to here Wow I expected to see it here pause look at the chat where do I where do I see the right click on the popup and you have the console for debugging oh that's what I need to do or is it even something that I could do here oh this is where I could do it whoops so this is actually where I want to do it right no inspect I guess I need a whole separate I need to get it here alright great so that's what I'm going to do so the interesting no I would have assumed oh maybe I wonder what this is here but let's put it back and where was I did I already just look I think I just looked over here but do that again just in case I didn't alright so where we've established that it's not here in the console I don't see any console dot log if I look here this is where I would have a console log for a background script but I don't have a background script this is a popup I don't see it there where is it so actually thank you to the chat who clued me in on this I'm going to press this button here and I'm going to right click and if I rightclick I now see I have this option called inspect and I can select that and it's going to bring up another window I can go over to console so this is the JavaScript console for the popup there's a JavaScript console for the page content page there's a JavaScript console for the background script and now there's a JavaScript console for this particular popup okay so I've shown you how to add a popup you can do this anything that you can put on a web page can be in a popup you could start querying api's and drawing maps and doing anything in that popup so what I want to do in the next video is show you how to send a message from the popup to the content script and change something in the interface by what you're doing in the popup and I kind of have I have an idea for that okay hold on hold on we might have some breaking news default console.log comes from content scripts for publishers alone scope yeah yeah yes okay all right so now next up almost finished with this coffee here what we're gonna do when it's all done just drink water coding that coding train popup thing looks red I'm not sure what that's referring to Simon but alright so thank you potato cool I love all these crazy names that appear in the chat so a little woozy a very big lunch today I think that's it's not good for when it starts to approach five o'clock so what I want to do I need to talk a little bit about scope so let me think what I'm gonna do here the content script in the example just changed the content of paragraph elements I mean I think an interesting code a couple coding challenges could be take my doodle example and like change the thickness of what you're drawing actually didn't publish that video I just rose I didn't publish that video yet it's there in the playlist if you want to find it but it's just not a made public yet another option would be I mean I have this idea of doing something today that's a Chrome extension for Twitter mostly like can we fix Twitter like basically just make a Chrome extension that erases everybody's tweets and you only see like nice messages to people that's an idea and maybe then they pop up you could like type in your messages oh I know what I'm going to do so what I'm gonna do is I think what this did right is it made this Chrome extension what I had before is it changes the inner H it made everything or whatever the background color but I can change the innerhtml to whatever you're typing in the popup so we're gonna do that that's gonna that's what I'm gonna do yeah the popup just by default gets the automatic document body with or whatever the page width and kind of sizes it that way at least turn the doodle thing on and off that's a great idea Simon so you know these all these ideas one of my reasons for being here is not to do all the ideas but to have other people do the ideas but that is perfect that's a great that's a great thing okay so let me move on now and go on so oops I'm definitely gonna need a short break at some point to get some more water it's because I talked about well where am I here okay okay I'm back in another video about popups what I did in the previous video is I just made something a page popup when I press the button in the Chrome extension you know what it's really bugging me I don't know what it looks like for a broadcast on YouTube but I'm getting some weird like moiré pattern thing it's driving me crazy so I just want to change the width to like 50 or maybe 40 is actually 40 is better I need to reload the extension there we go okay interestingly enough it's like kind of and then I'm going to hold I just want to like clean this up a little bit here we go that's a little bit a little bit better all right sorry all right popup this is another video I just thought of that right now oh I'm such a not genius when it comes to bad jokes on the internet and I also think like I hurt my back the other day anyway here I am in another video about popups in Chrome extension so in the previous video all I showed you how to do was if you add a browser action with a button when you click that button you can have a web page popup and in this case I have an entire p5.js sketch animating as part of the popup but why would I want to have a popup well one of the reasons why I would want to have a popup is to provide an interface for my Chrome extension that might change some settings to have some place where I could enter some information to to show something related to what's on the web page that I'm on so in order for that to actually happen I need to have some way of communicating between the content and the popup now one thing that's important about Chrome extension I haven't actually used the word scope but I think it's to mention this before when I wanted to communicate between the background script and the content script they live in different scopes each one of these things lives in its own bubble the background script the popup the background script the popup the content script all in their own separate bubble so only the content script is allowed to mess around and know about what's on the content page the popup knows nothing about that and it's not as if you could just make a global variable and use the same variable in both places their different scopes there's sort of a trick to getting variables from the background script but that's another story now so what do you I need to do is I need to have a way of sending messages back and forth in very similar to how you might do this in a networked application I have this thing running over here and this thing running over the air I'm gonna send a message over here to make this thing happen that's what he did to do the nice thing is the API the set of functions that I showed in a previous video for how to communicate from the background script to the content script I can use that same functionality to communicate from the popup to the content script so what I think I'm gonna try to do let's come back over here is first time to get rid of this maze thing it's kind of interesting but I'm gonna I'm gonna go into my p5 sketch I'm just gonna kind of delete everything and I'm gonna have some extra JavaScript that I don't need I'm gonna delete that I'm gonna delete this extra file here this does not need to be in this video and I'm so I'm gonna go to sketch J yes and I'm just gonna say function setup and function draw and I'm gonna I'm gonna say no canvas and I'm going to put some elements on the page like I don't need this anymore I don't need the sound library oh that's interesting that I could have sounds I'm gonna put some elements on the page so I'm gonna say type paragraph replacer and then I'm going to make an input element with an ID called user input I know is that how you do it do I need to close it like that or just put a slash let me in something like that I'm gonna put that in like a paragraph then what I'm gonna do oh let's see this is this this looks weird but I feel like I messed something up here but I'm just gonna leave it then what I'm going to do is I'm going to reload my extension and I'm gonna press the popup I say okay so now I have this paragraph replacer what I want to do is anything I type here I'm going to replace the content on the webpage with anything I type there just as a demonstration of how you can communicate between the two and remember I could send from the content script so one thing I might like to do for example is I actually have an example so I'll link to that from here is what if I'm on a webpage and I like select a word and then I press this I'm gonna make this as a coding challenge so I select a word on the webpage I press the button and it goes to an API like word Nick and finds me the definition for that page so we'll do that as a coding challenge in maybe that in the next video actually but in this video I'm gonna do something simple and I just need to have this messaging go back and forth so how do I do that first let me just weirdly make sure messaging works and I'm going to actually no no let's I don't need to draw loop there's no animation happening you could have an animation what I want to do is I want to say user input equals select so I'm using the p5 Dom library to grab that element and then and that says user put user input then I want to use the user input dot input there are two events that can be associated with a textbox one is the event called changed which only happens when I like press enter or tab out of that I could maybe have a submit button or something but I'm actually just gonna do it as I'm typing so the input event is an event that happens every time I press a key so I'm gonna say pressed you know user key pressed oh boy terrible name for a function I can't even tolerate it new text will call this new text so I'm gonna write a function called new text and here now I want to send a message to the content script so all I'm gonna do now to make sure this is working is send a message with what's in like this is the message user input values so whatever is in that text input box that's going to be the message so I content script actually a hole ready has code to receive a message it already has code to receive a message because that's what I had in a previous example and I actually don't need to change it I do need to think about how I'm gonna format that message my background script that I did in a previous video has the code to send a message this is how I send a message now the thing is how do I get the current tabs ID so this isn't going to work exactly let me move into here the idea that I'm gonna do here is right now I'm gonna craft the message as a JavaScript object then I'm gonna send that message to the tabs that tab that I'm currently on I could actually send it to other tabs but if I send it to the tab that I'm currently on how do I get the tab that I'm currently on look up how to do that I have it in an example I'm like where would be the document to pause for a second I'm looking I'm looking in the chat to see if someone just wants to tell me where the document oh this computer went awry let's let's see if I have any okay so oh this is not scroll that shot is not scrolling here I don't need the input call it change text these are all like much better yeah oh these are also much better suggestions all right so what I'm looking for is okay let me look at my example first but I'm rather look let me look in my example and in my example popup messaging how did I get it oh I have to query for the tab look at that I have to query for the tab all right so tabs dot query params active true current window true and then I have to query and then I get the tabs back all right all right that's interesting so let's see where would that be that would be chrome tabs API this is it so just just so I understand correctly I'm gonna correct this I don't even need this anymore like I should just do this so just like this is more correct all right I will get rid of that I will get rid of that in a little bit why is my my monitor is like lagging behind me it's kind of freaking me out it's when I do something it like happens oh this is so weird wait wait wait I'm in real time I think what are you guys seeing a delay with my typing like watch this I'm pressing a and then it appears pressing a are you guys seeing that delay or am I just seeing this delay in a preview oh I'm really getting stuck on something indentation is off I have a feeling it's off because of this or maybe this what did I miss there's a little delay it's not really bugging anybody too much right the delay I probably shouldn't worry about fixing that right now yeah I see everybody fuge delay so let me know in the if the delay is actually an issue or if it's like everything you can follow everything that I'm doing even with that delay okay I know the indentation is off but oh yeah we fix that um that's gonna make people crazy all right okay wait so query Oh get actually you could just use get I was using query in my example but maybe we can okay so okay okay so what I need to look at is the chrome tabs package I don't know if package is the right thing to say the API and that's here so extension slash tabs this is a set of functions that I can employ to sort of figure out about the tabs so one thing I can do is just probably get current is all I need that I actually in some of my examples I noticed I'm using this query to like query about all the tabs but I think all I need to do is say get current so get current just gets the current tab which is what I want so I am going to say first right to do is say chrome tabs get current and a got tab so I need another call back and not getting into this sort of like crazy nested call back stuff which I really want to try to avoid and some of the new arrow syntax and other promises stuff I'll get into that at some point kind of but I think this is fine so right the user presses a key new text and someone suggested that I call this change text which I think is better then as soon as that happens I want to say which is the tab which the current tab so I need to get the current tab once I've got the current tab it should be the actual current tab is passed into my callback as an argument so once I do that I could just send the message to that particular tab I'm going to send the message oh right I'm not actually doing anything of value yet and to send that message hello and let's see what happens so now let's go and oh and let me in the content scripts console time console logging the message so I'm actually just gonna console.log the whole message so we should see that in the content script so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to reload my extension I'm gonna go over here to this page I'm going to open up the JavaScript console and when I do this I don't see anything yet but as soon as I start typing in that paragraph I should see here the message coming through that didn't work so let's look at inspector inspect this element let's look at the console Oh tabs dot get current cannot read property idea of undefined so you might need permissions ah so thank you breaking news from the chat firs I'll Simon Thank You Simon suggested that I call it change text and I probably need to add anytime you start to use something from the chrome API I need to explicitly say in my manifest out JSON that I intend to use this so I don't know if this is if that's the problem but we're gonna have to figure this out so one thing that it could be is that I need to go to my manifest.json and add something like permissions is permissions already in here no permissions and this should be maybe an array what's an array I think and it has tabs as one of my permissions so this could be the thing that fixes it let's try it I kind of think that I might have done something else wrong but let's try some and reload this I am going to reload this open up here yes work either I really just wait to in love with my sound in fact somebody should probably I probably need an intervention about that alright so that was not the air here I'm gonna think about this a little bit let's look at the documentation do you know what's good to do read the documentation gets the tab that this script call is being made from maybe undefined if called from a non tab context for example a background page or other words just just or pop up view so that's definitely the problem and that's probably why what I actually did in one of my examples is used query so let's let's use query so let's try using query so I'm gonna change this to saying I'm gonna go back to my content scrub where am I in the where am I looking in the pop up yeah in the pop up I'm gonna change this to chrome tabs query and what I need to do if I'm gonna run query is I need to give it some parameters for the query like I need to I want it says optional but I want like all of the active tabs and I want I think it's only active or current window and current window I might not need these but I recall doing this in a previous example so but you it's up to you to read this documentation to see what tabs you want returned so I need that so now I can query for all of those tabs this is now I want to say tabs because what I'm gonna do is get an array of tabs I know that the query function probably if I look at the documentation it explains gets all the tabs that have the specified properties there might be a way for me to just get only the current tab but I'm pretty sure that tabs index zero is the tab that I want so let's try this now I think we're in good shape here I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to say reload the extension I'm gonna come over here press the popup Oh seriously how could that not have worked let's look here inspect console huh no error message so let's let's take a look at this so let's let's debug this text changed let's console.log that video is way more debugging than usual and let's console.log let's look at the tabs I'm gonna say got tabs and let's console.log it and now let's try this again to reload the extension I'm gonna not use my ridiculous sound effects anymore because I'm overdoing it I'm gonna reload the extension I'm gonna press this oh of course now it works I probably just like missed clicking save or reload or something anyway so I think it actually did work but that's how I would have debug it if it hadn't worked weirdly enough I like behind by one reload right because now I'm not seeing my messages save am I not like saving in the right it's like behind by one reload let's reload let's refresh oh oh no no no no no I need the classic error I'm looking for all of my messages here only the content script messages will be there if I want to see the popup messages they are here so that is working it's an array it's this is the information I got lots of information is an incognito tab what URL is it on what's the width you can see there's lots of information that you can get all right we're in good shape let's move a little bit more quickly here just to finish this off so what I actually want to do is I want to send what I want to send is what was it called I called it user input user input value and what I want to do in the content script is rather than change the background color I'm going to change the inner HTML I think that's what I write to message dot text and I don't I'm not going to bother to check if it's a certain map there's only one kind of message I can get so as long as I've gotten a message change whatever the paragraph text to that message okay here we go I'm feeling good about this I think this is going to work and I'm going to reload the extension I'm going to refresh this page it's got some paragraphs on it I'm gonna feel confident enough to actually close the JavaScript console I'm going to open this up and now here we go oh it's the wars I really shouldn't have done that all right I shouldn't have closed anything let's try this again let's look it let's look here console Oh syntax error in my code ah the worst I'm the worst sketch line 21 Oh would I put this stomach on there probably all of you noticed this and you've bound to watch like an extra two minutes of this video it could edit out this mistake but probably gonna leave it in let's try this one more time reload extension and open oh no and now press this and now I'm going to type into the paragraph release inspect console ah okay so it's that's working all right let's see what's going on here in the content script console dot log message didn't get the message sketch Jas might see I think we're gonna have to do some editing on this one is too many I should be one line below yeah the semicolon should go here but Oh is there something weird with the sound effects those messages maybe they're not P elements no all right hold on Oh dot style this dot style is not relevant I had that south and I was changing the background color innerhtml is not a part of the style it's just part of the element itself so I think it's gonna work this time I've corrected this everything's good here in terms of my syntax let's try this one more time okay here we go I am now going to reload the extension refresh the page press this button and start typing yeah look whatever I type into here now goes into every single paragraph elements on the page this worked exclamation point thank you thank you very much so this has been the end of this sending a message from a popup to the page and I'm gonna do a coding challenge which you'll find at some point when I publish it where I'm going to actually take content from the page and display information while querying an API information about it there so I'm gonna do that in a coding challenge soon thanks for watching oh my god I it's already 520 now here's the thing this is actually really driving me crazy this delay I just want to see if I unplug and plug back in if it fixes it so I'm unplugging no so that delay is happening somewhere else I probably have to restart the computer which I'm not going to do because it'll cause the stream to end so hopefully everything is just fine whoo yes that's right since I did innerhtml instead a text content I can actually type stuff in there all right boy I'm exhausted just a long week all right so let me think I like the idea of doing this coding challenge so let me look at my list here so I did the least I did these two things I could do quickly the tab override it's like the simplest thing in the world I might as well make a video for that I don't actually even yeah inner HTML is but yeah security nightmare but you know whatever maybe I should a little addendum there I don't know if I should need to do an addendum but tab override let me look at that I feel like that's the easiest thing in the world to do Chrome extension override yeah this is like the easiest thing in the world to do you just change you just use the chrome URL override what's let's do that cuz that's gonna be like a short simple quick video and that might need a short break and then I'm gonna do a couple coding challenges and just see what I'll see what else I can manage today all right can I remember this chrome underscore URL overrides you tab I really need this break it's gonna make me P so we gonna make this one this tutorial go quickly I think I also might have had too much caffeine which was really a problem for me alright so let me get I'm gonna get that in a way what I kind of want to do is actually use the word Nick API and just get like the word of the day or something but let me just you know what I'm just going to show how to do this I can use the let me do this simple content script one post six tab override I'm just trying to think like what could I put as the content yeah thank you developer.chrome.com/apps ketch and it'll just do something silly like count oh you can replace any of these other things new tab bookmarks history fascinating fascinating yeah so here it is alright history new tab greatgreatgreatgreatgreat quick quick review all right wonderful and let's get rid of this one and let's go to tab override and and we'll leave all this here okay this Blake oh yes great idea kitten override that's a great idea I love that idea so let me get a let me just get like the sketch here so it's there and I never fixed that people are gonna go crazy kittens then let me get the kitten images and I'm just going to call this like one two three four five okay so I'm setting this up and here we go all right this this is really things my green thing here I guess I have to lower this a little bit like the keying is a little bit problematic today but hopefully it's fine you know what this needs to be maybe if this turns over a little bit points a little bit down it's not better okay I've got one more probably more than that but at least one more thing to show you about Chrome extensions I'm gonna show you about overrides what is an override so first of all if you use the Chrome browser and you ever hit command T or new tab you get this default page which has a Google search and like shows you some recent web pages that you've been to this is something you can override you can create your own web page that appears for a new tab and there are lots of examples of Chrome extensions that you can get that show you pretty nice things and daily affirmations and stuff like that you can also override the history page and well something else where do you find out information about this it's I'll include a link to this in this video's description this is the documentation for override pages so you can override the bookmark page the history page in the new tab page I'm going to override just the new tab page and the way that we do this is by adding this code here to the manifest JSON so I'm gonna copy this and I'm gonna go to the manifest JSON for a new Chrome extension I'm gonna get rid of the content script I just copied one of my previous ones I could get I don't need a content script as part of this and actually it wouldn't make sense to have a new tab override that also had a Content script I don't think so and I want to override new tab and what I want to do is point to my HTML page and I happen to have associated with this project this is my example number 6 a folder called sketch and it this is a p5 sketch and as an index on HTML page so what I want to say is sketch slash index at HTML I am going to just say function setup create canvas 200 200 you know background zero and I'm gonna say I'm gonna add something here like h1 hears a kitten cuz people make a new so I'm gonna add some stuff to the HTML and to the JavaScript just to see that this works now what I'm gonna do is go to my extensions page I am going to load the extension I want to load my example number 6 ah right I got an error what is my error looks like I have an extra comma here and it's telling me that I don't have valid JSON so I should be able to go back to my manifest.json get rid of that comma hit save try to then say a retry that worked and now I should open a new page yep so every time I open a new tab I get that webpage so let's make it do something a little more interesting let's say let's let's actually not have a canvas you obviously have an animation we say no canvas I'm gonna say R equals a random number between 1 and 6 because I actually want you know I'm gonna say between 0 and 1 2 3 4 5 0 and 5 I have what I have is and then I'm gonna say a create image kittens slash R plus dot jpg so what you might notice is that I have a folder called kittens with five images of kittens all named one through five so I probably should have started naming him with zero but I could just add one to it so I want to create a Dom element which is a kitten image and show it on the page so I'm gonna do that and I'm going to and we might have an issue I mean I'm just waiting to see what happens I'm going to reload the extension I'm gonna make a new tab up whoa that is and it worked well now here's the thing I should probably size it and I'm just gonna say image size window with window height image dot position zero zero so I mean this is some silly I should probably be more thoughtful about CSS and all that but I'm just going to use some p5 code to size the image to the page and maybe I'll get rid of the here's a kitten's message now I'm going to reload again and now make a new tab every time I make a new tab I get a different kitten yay so this is how you do a override so now the world is your kitten oyster think of what you might make something that checks for today's weather if you want to make something practical something that shows something beautiful something that reminds you of an important message anything that you could think of you can make anything you can make a webpage you can make as the new tab override thanks for watching subscribe like I'm supposed to say at the end the video this was a short one so maybe might actually hear it well everyone's telling me about how horrible my CSS skills are which is absolutely true I'm really losing steam here 530 yeah document.body dot style dot background equals URL kitten dot jpg yes but the point of what I'm showing is not the efficient way to make the kitten in the background I'm just showing you gonna have a p5 sketch so or any webpage and you drink some water I'm gonna take a short break I'm gonna play the dis song I'm gonna play the Vista song I'm going to mute my microphone and I'm gonna leave you with kittens this kitten I guess I'm going to take a short break and I'm going to come back let's look at our let me let me sort of figure out what I want to do for in the next half an hour that I have so I got through these three things so things that I could do are the coding challenge that looks up something onward Nick which I think would be interesting I'm gonna skip the omnibox thing definitely least today I should look investigate like how to make a Firefox extension I'm really not prepared to do that but I can at least maybe look at that a little bit WebGL let's see alright so let me take a break here actually let's do let me let me at least put up a little strawpoll thing see what people are interested in so options word by the way the word lookup Chrome extension involves a back we'll need a background script and a content script and a popup which I haven't done at all so that's kind of interesting word Nick like lookup extension WebGL revisited what else do I have on this list that I could do that's kind of those are my two things I would like to do and maybe I just yeah and then I'm just gonna whatever I'm just curious this is now absolutely that I'm doing this straw polls I think I'm just gonna try to do both of these but if I only had time for one which would you prefer I kind of want to be done with the Chrome extensions no strawpoll everybody I feel like if I do that last Chrome extension coding challenge I can be done with Chrome extensions I can talk about generic browser extensions for Firefox and even try to make one and then that might actually be it for today yeah connection to any API and a Papa but that's super interesting it's gonna open up a lot of ideas so I'm gonna mute my microphone you won't hear from me I'm gonna put on some music see if I can pee I always forget forget this I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this star this start song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me alright I'm back I realized what I should do is play I forgot that I can play my crazy trailer thing which is this thing which guys can hear you talking over a while while you take a break but I'm not gonna play this right now you can go and find that video on the home page of my channel o persistent data with local storage such a good idea I'm sorry everybody I'm not gonna get much let me add that can I I'm logged in as myself that's good so I'm obviously not I don't think I'm gonna get that today but I do think that would be worth so I'm going to do API lookup and persistent data with local storage I actually so I would like to do that I wanted to be done with Chrome extensions but that would be worth looking at some time so let's commit these changes alright everybody so what I need to do now is I need to give myself kind of like a basic template I'm gonna use the popup Swan oops copy can I just do like this or something yeah there we go oh seven I need something to perk me up here I know what it okay oh no not this one okay we are now doing word Nick so I need to be prepared so coding train so I can leave all this actually because I'm going to revise it in the tutorial there's this there's that but what and then there's sketch so boy I'm gonna have to look up how to receive the message it's fine I'm gonna but I do need my API key so where can I get that if I go to API is data word Nick word info hopefully my API key is still valid all right okay Oh weird nick has a public key that's good to know I don't mind using mine now I can always change it or regenerate it or something drink a little while I'm sorry but usually I simply won't have energy good thing I have to leave around 6 because I'm really running out of energy but let's let's definitely at least make this this is gonna take longer than 20 minutes but because I have there's a lot of stuff I'm gonna have to look up as I don't know any of this off the top of my head but let's go close all this and this all right here we go welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make a Chrome extension where you can let me start over again it's a good web page to be on for this let's just go to Wikipedia how about a steam train steam locomotive okay all right hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make a Chrome extension that allows you to highlight any word and then press a button up in the corner of the browser and it will open up a popup and show you the definition of that word so I need a lot of pieces to this here if I come back to my if I come back to my diagram here of all the pieces of the Chrome extension and I can't look at a diagram without marker what I need I certainly do I even need a Content script I just realized that I don't think I need a content script for this amazingly high the idea I wanted to have come up with an idea where I needed all three of these but I'm realizing that I think that background scripts can determine what it is you've highlighted on the page because that's kind of a browser action it's not really a part of the page that's kind of something you're doing with the browser itself you're highlighting some word and then I need the background script to send a message to the popup you know I guess I could affect the content script so this will be an exercise for you I'm gonna put the results in the popup but you could do something when you highlight a page you actually just create a little like div overlay wherever that word is or something that shows the definition but I'm gonna put that information in a popup and the popup is going to go in query an API like word Nick and look for the definition of that word okay did you guys hear that because I just sometimes some days some days Google dictionary and that's the one I use okay all right so I'm not gonna code from nothing here because I'm really tired a lot of time so I'm gonna use the code that I had at the end of my popups tutorial which is a witch which I'll link to in this video's description so actually what I would I I don't need it I'm gonna remove the content script I do need to add a background script I think I do this how do I do that I think is it just the name of the background script I'll have to look that up and I want to call this I want to call this word Nik look up okay let me double check one of my old examples look that's not that one hold on give me a second here okay I can do this everybody yes I can I'm gonna go back and look at one of my background script examples and oh this is what it looks like I just blanked I don't have this stuff memorized so to add a background script it needs to look like this so I now have a background yes and I have a browser action that look up a word and it's going to go to this particular sketch so first let me actually just see if what I can make happen is I can just if I select a word and I press the popup I see that word in the popup I just want to make sure that that happens so let me try that alright so what I'm going to do is okay in the background script I think what I need is an event for when I highlight a word and actually I pretty sure this event is like I can actually just use use the mouse up event so what I need to look for is Chrome extension mouse up event so it's really window dot mouse up what I think this is going to work for me is it just a regular event listener hold on time out I don't like that I'm doing this coding job before get event listeners oh it's not the right place look at this actually look at this here's a Google Group with actually asking this question probably capture selected text when the extension button is clicked it was exactly what I'm trying to do this is way too much how interesting I guess I could do this in the content script oh oh maybe I need to do this in the content timeout everybody I'm sorry I'm gonna look at my example this is the Don the worst I really don't know this stuff they should prepare for this I made this example like two years ago I'm just gonna look at it so this is the one that I think I do the word Nick thing and I do have a background script and a Content script because actually I should just start over ah of course I need to mouse up on the content page then I send that to the background script because I cannot send a message from the from the content script to the popup I can't send the message to the popup because the popup might not be open so I send it to the background script and then the background script receives that message and puts in a global variable this was the trick that I was going to show and receives it and then and I think I should just start over I'm just start this tutorial and then in the the popup whoops it actually there's a way to get yeah chromedout extension not get background page dot word okay alright everybody mmhmm we're gonna start over we're just gonna do this again it's gonna be awesome so I do need a background script do you need a content script and okay right everybody document I get selection in windowed I get selection both exist alright anybody who's in the slack channel who wants to feed me lines of code to enter I usually I'm like I'm like now I just give it up it's like it's like anybody can help me out here gonna make this happen okay what I prefer about Firefox over chrome is history management features in um interesting discussions going on here alright do we go welcome its promote a challenge where I really need just I don't know when you're watching this in the future in the past on a spaceship on your phone but I need I need I need some good vibes right now I'm gonna try to make this is gonna be a hard one for me I'm gonna make a Chrome extension that allows you to on any webpage like this steam locomotive Wikipedia page select some text and look up the look up the definition of a word that you've selected I'm gonna use the word Nick API and I'm gonna have the definition appear in a popup now we could make some case that this is not like the most thoughtful and elegant user interaction and so my challenge for you after I do this is there's probably a nicer way to do this like it's select should you actually just have the definition popup right there what's what's it what's a more elegant user interaction I can't even think of it but I'm actually the reason why I want to do this is because this particular idea requires all the pieces that I've shown you in my tutorials and requires a Content script a Content script it knows about the page is going to be a listen for the event of me selecting some text it requires a popup because I say so because I want to show the definition in the popup so in theory all that it requires is the content script and the popup because why not just send a message from the content script of the popup the problem is I can't guarantee that the popup is open if I probably couldn't open the popup automatically so I'm not going to open the popup automatically that's a code child see you if that's even possible I'm gonna select the text I'm gonna send the selected text to the background script by the way I was talking about this earlier that's why this whiteboard already has some notes about this then the background script is going to hold on to that selected text the popup is gonna get it from the background script it's going to go out to word Nick and it's going to show the results all right I can do it I could do it I'm gonna do it all right so let's let's work on this I'm gonna open up my chat that's going here just in case anybody can help me out the first thing I might need from the chat is how I get the selected text in the content script but actually before I even get to that let me look at what's going on here so I need a Content script I've got that permissions tabs and that actually might be unnecessary so let's just take that out right now I don't think I'm using that I need a browser action which is going to look up a definition so I'm gonna put that as the little message definition definition and then I need a background script this right background is is it script is it scripts something is definitely wrong here ooh boy no no not an array an object right oh let's just look at one of my previous ones background scripts oh boy I had a way wrong I was way wrong okay so adding a background script I need background which has scripts and then an array of JavaScript files that are part of the background script okay so now I have a background script a and by the way the code base that I'm starting with is from the end of my popups tutorial so I'll link to that video in this description so if you actually want to like what's up what's the code that I started with you can watch that video and wherever I ended that's this code okay but there's very little in it I I'm the the web page the popup has nothing in it just it I'm using the p5 library so just set up in know canvas and the background script it actually has some code in it from a while ago which i think is I'm gonna get rid of cuz that's no longer relevant I'm going to leave the but yeah okay so here we go and the content script has some other code as actually that I as well so I'm gonna actually get rid of all this it's very terrible idea so first let me at least get the selected text in the content script okay so I think I want to say like document dot event what is it what is it somebody told me document get selection a mouse up I wanna i want the mouse up event in the content script this would be an edit point no you guys didn't listen to my instructions and feed me the code that i eat at the time that i need it good thing the camera went off now anyway what's the event the mouse up event they can't remember this stuff especially not today is my brain is melted yeah alessandro is saying in the chat i believe i believe a better way of doing this would be when you open the popup send a message to the content script asking for the selected word which will answer back to the popup in the select word yeah that's actually so i'm gonna mention that ok window on mouse up okay all right so okay alright so by the way in the chat i'm being told a better way of doing this would be when you open the popup send a message to the content script asking for the selected word and then send that back so that's actually true I'm gonna still do this in a ridiculous way because I want to show you some other pieces of how you can have the background on the popup talk to each other but that is a better way to do it you should fix my code after I'm done so the first thing that I need is window dot add event listener this is a way for me to listen for the by the way I'm looking at the chat here as people are giving me some of this code of your mouse up and then I need a callback which I could write in a fancy way but I'm just going to say I'm gonna say moused UPS function worst name ever function so now if that event happens what I want to do is get the selection so I want to say the selected text is window dot I think it's just got to get selection let me just console.log that so what this should do is get this little all I should see is a console log of what's been selected yeah and I like this we're word selected it's gonna be a problem if you select more than a word but less that was a that was a good name Thank You Simon all right window decade selection okay so now oh I've got to load my extension look at my extension we're Nick it's called Wernick it's working I mean it's there I'm gonna go to this page I'm gonna open up the console and I'm gonna listen for this that event is not happening let's see here refresh the page chrome extension go so that is happening so what did I miss here window add eventlistener mouse up well let's just see if this has even happen oh wait okay hold on the Queen note get selection must be wrong let's see if at least if like were let me just console.log word select I'm sure window that get selection is totally wrong so let me reload the extension yeah oh and I'm having a weird thing where I'm either not reloading or refreshing properly because I'm getting more stuff happens so words selected and then it's actually selected text so selected text is an object selection and what I want is the actual anchor node there's got to be a way node value through a there's got to be a way for me to just get it without having this giant object but whole text text content is probably what I want so select should select a text anchor text whole content let's try that or maybe I want just text content all right let's see that was that something text content yeah so let's see if I let's see if this is right now let me just be really careful you're safe safe safe then I'm gonna go here and do a refresh and by the way let me rename the extension so I know what's going on it's the extension to be called word lookup okay I haven't looked at you in a while but really focused on my screen apologies hi thank you for watching this so let me reload the extension change the name okay now I'm gonna come back to here clear this refresh this page I'm going to find a word to select okay undefined it word selected so I clearly didn't look through that object carefully enough I'm gonna pause here for a second nobody's where's all the people correcting me words selected alright so I have to go back it's so sad hold on what I can do is know why all of a sudden today like the screen dimensions seemed totally wrong for me this we're gonna have to do some heavy editing on this let me go back I think just having one error and then fixing it I obviously typed in the wrong thing here so I'll debug this but we're good I'm gonna get the correct all right let me look at this again selection dot anchor node is there another place anchor node dot whoa that's whole text I don't want that I'm sure there's an easier way to do this just due to string no interesting does it actually work is that what I did to three yes that's what I did so you can see here that the selection is this whole elaborate object thing and I I just spend some time which you might have watched or I'm I'm not sure um be trying to like find the text in there but I thank you I just realized thank you to Alka in the chat that I can actually just say to string and what that's gonna do it's gonna take the selected text instead of giving me the full object about the selection it's just going to give me the actual text and put it right there and so so let's now let's go back reload this extension refresh the page select and there we go and were middle right you could see that I'm getting stuff selected wonderful okay now what I need to do is once I've selected something I want to send this information to the background page okay so first thing first okay so first thing let's get rid of this console log and let me first check if selected text dot length is greater than zero so if you know I could have a mouse up where there's no actual selected text so I want to make sure there's at least something there and then I need to send a message I'm looking for my notes about all the different ways to do things in a Content script if I want to send a message all I need to do I think I could just do because I don't need to send to a tab I want to send to the background script again probably use chrome runtime at it point as I look this up should really just have this I know what why am I doing this I should just put this on the computer over here I'm being silly I'm looking at the chat and all I need to do is do what everybody always says that I do that I don't do but I'm actually gonna do it now which is just put the code that I need over here because this is not working with me there's just I my brain is not coming up with this stuff off the phone the fly yeah it's so much simpler than I think it's just the runtime send message okay okay so all I need I was right I'm right I think I just need to say chrome runtime send message this is a generic way and this runtime lower case let me look guys note somewhere in lower case yeah so this is a generic way to just send a message and it's going to go to the background script and I can make the message an object and I could say the text is selected text so I want to send that message so now what I'm doing is whenever I select a word send that message to the background script okay we're sending a message to the background script so now I need to write some code in the background script to receive the message and I have that somewhere I'm pretty sure actually this is the easy part because I can use chrome runtime dot on message add listener receiver so I'm going to write a function called receiver which is going to so I now want the background script to just listen for messages so I need to add a listener and that function receiver it takes a bunch of arguments like the request the sender and the send response because if you want to send something back but all I really need to do is look at what's in the request so I think I'm just gonna say console dot log request I just want to see what's in there that's where the message should come in okay save everything save everything close a bunch of scripts save everything save everything go to extensions reload click here oh content script has a syntax error line 10 I always do this I really have a problem with a JavaScript object notation there's no semicolon here I should probably put a semicolon there okay I'm gonna hit refresh and oh wait I have to reload boy how much are you just watching me reload and refresh refresh okay so now I'm gonna click this I see the word majority now the question is if I inspect the background page there it is came in text majority yes so I have now the the message from the content script to the background script okay so now in the background script what I'm actually gonna do is just I'm gonna do something really kind of terrible I'm gonna say let word equal and I'm just give it an empty string I'm gonna say word equals request dot what did I call it text so I'm actually just gonna store the result in a global variable there may be some reason why I don't want to do this but here's why I'm doing this because and actually let's just put something I just want to put something in here here I'm just gonna put coding train on the start word because there is a way that I can access variables from a background script from the popup without actually sending a message so in other words and in other words what I can do so of course what I could do is when I open the popup again it would make more sense for an open the popup to send a message to say the background script asking for the answer or more directly I could just send a message from the pop into content script so all this background syrup is kind of unnecessary but it is a useful trick just to see that I can do this in the content script what I can do hold on here just looking at something it's gonna be an edit point yeah in the content script what I can actually do I'm sorry you know in the popup in the popup what I can actually do is I can say let word equal chrome dot extension dot get background page so if I say let me actually just say let back wrap BG page so I can actually access the background page and then the word is BG page dot word I think I could just go and access a variable that's within the background pages scope so something that I've emphasized is that the content script the background script the popup they all live with our own scope but I can access the background scripts scope and pull variables out so let me do that and I'm all I going to do is say create P word so let's see if I've made a mistake here let's see if this is working and I'm going to close this I'm going to whoop s reload this I'm going to refresh this page and I'm just going to click the button whoa undefined so I did something wrong so first of all I forgot that I had some stray code in the index of HTML so I'm gonna say call this word Nick lookup get rid of this so what did I get wrong here chrome extension get back you know I wonder I wonder if let using let is a problem because I wonder if I'm making use of sort of like goofy thing you just let me just make sure this really didn't work because I'm having a problem making sure i refresh yeah it's still saying undefined there so let me just change that to in the background script let me change is the bar let me change this devar let me reload you refresh and do this yeah look at that oh boy I don't like what's going on here I'm gonna look at the slack channel here somebody tell me if what I'm doing is to string dot trim I just need to trim I should also trim the text okay window dot word Thank You Alka all right the problem is here because I'm using Lent which is a wonderful thing let is a wonderful thing but let is locally scoped in a much stronger way than the old var thing with this I don't want to get into that now I've got a whole video about let and var but what I want to do if I really want to make this global Global global which is probably a bad idea I can say window dot word so if I say window dot word and I guess I need to do that here to window dot word I can put something in a more global scope attached to the window object of the background page there's actually this like secret background page the weird thing you don't see it but it's actually a page and so now what I should be able to do is once again reload the page refresh the page I might not need to actually briefer I'm gonna select locomotives I'm gonna do this and then look at that locomotives is there so all I need to do is query word Nick now we're in good shape now I now have what do I have I have a Content script that listens to me selecting some text it sends a message to the background script the background script stores it in a global variable for itself and the popup asks the background script for its variable again not a really sort of awkward in elegant way of doing this but to show all these pieces so coming back over here okay one thing I could have said var word by the way but the reason why I'm saying window dot word and actually I wonder once I do that I can probably just do this right I'm saying we know that word cuz I want to avoid using var that's which is sort of silly okay a couple things one is I should trim the text because it can sometimes end up having like whitespace and stuff in it so I'm gonna call dot trim which will get rid of any extra like weird whitespace stuff and now what I need to do is look up the stuff on word Nick so this is a little bit out of this so let's go to the word Nick so I'm gonna go to the word Nick API and I'm gonna go to the documentation what I want is the definition of a word so if I look up a word I can ask for its definitions and let's say I'm looking up the word Apple and I just want one definition I don't care about part of speech include related I don't need include related and I'll take all the sources whatever so I'm gonna try it out so this is the call this is the request URL that I need and then the definition is in an array oh boy Italy the definition is in an array and it comes under text ok so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna grab this request URL and what I can do in the sketch here I can say let URL equal you know see other people talking in the hallway and actually all I need to do is what I need is I'm gonna split this into two because what I want what happened here oh I need what I need is to put the word in between so this is a kind of awkward way of doing this but I need to form this big URL and actually I should use I should use this es6 thing that's new let me show you this in this video because it would be really useful here I think I could say backtick right someone's gonna help me I'm gonna need some help with this so I'm gonna cuz I'm gonna use I think if I say backtick I'm gonna get rid of all these quotes then there's a way I can actually break it up over multiple lines and just do back tic again right mmm hold on someone's gonna tell me how to do this back tick thing oh yeah and then dollar sign word okay but I seem to have the back tics wrong okay I can use back so something is wrong whoops something is wrong here in that oh I have this here shouldn't be here I thought I could do it over multiple lines let me see if I'm still oh I have too many back tics can I do it over multiple lines I know that's I'm just trying to do it over multiple lines which I guess is silly let me just let me go back yes backtick takes multiple lines all right so let's gonna let's try this is this now this is not something is wrong with this syntax anyway I'll let you are l equals this right what's going on here why is the syntax highlighting so weird oh it's highlighting URL okay thank you okay all right I'm gonna attempt to use a new feature that's part of JavaScript es6 which allows me to form a string by embedding the variable inside the string and instead of using single quotes so I'm going to get rid of all of the single quotes and everything's gonna look like a disaster right now get rid of all these single quotes and then I'm gonna use back tick back tick back tick so this should be this is now correct it's a little bit weird leaf syntax highlighted because so just to emphasize that I'm how this is working this is kind of useful I could actually write it like this like I can really see all this stuff so this is really useful to be able to break a URL break a string over multiple lines and what I want to come right after here is that's where I had the word Apple so I can now say I think it's dollar sign bracket curly brackets word so dollar sign curly brackets word this is now like fill in the value of this variable as part of this URL so I should be able to say load JSON that URL then I kind of a callback like got data I can write that function got data one of these days I'll start using the arrow syntax and stuff for an anonymous functions for the callbacks but got data data and then now I just want to say create p data index 0 so if we remember what was here it's data it's an array index 0 dot text so I just wanna get the first definition because I'm only getting one data index 0 dot text so this should be it right now my speak five sketch grabs the word from the background page forms this long URL to request stuff from word neck look uses the p5 load JSON to grab the data and show the salt okay here we go here we go there's got to be something wrong here but so first reload the page refresh this page I'm even gonna get find a word to highlight like number didn't work alright so let's look let's see where things went wrong ah server responded with the status of 404 so what is wrong here let's look at this URL I probably made a mistake in the URL one way for me to do that is just to put it here in atom so let's see HTTP oh look at this I got some weird oh there's an extra semicolon in there that's bad there's also extra spaces how come my trim didn't get rid of the spaces so let's so one thing here is a couple things I need to fix for sure let's go back to my code I had this semicolon the error was just totally unnecessary which is totally messed everything up and let's just trim it here also hi I thought I trimmed it over there but I'm gonna trim it uh it adds new line at the end of the string hmm hmm does it add the new lines or the new lines in there I kind of feel like it's okay I'm gonna I don't think the new lines are gonna be a problem okay oh I might need to replace all right so I'm being told breaking news I'm being told let's just put this in here to be safe replace any new lines with nothing so I'm just putting this on multiple lines just so I can make it more readable but obviously it can be on one line but just in case those new lines are going into the URL and messing it up let's do that all right let's reload the page refresh here I am going to select Railways gonna click here okay look that didn't work but let's see what happens now console the server is well there's like another semicolon look at this there's another semicolon right unauthorized because I stuck a silly extra semicolon so many semicolons oh that didn't work so let's get rid of these spaces that I don't know why they're in there I might have to do my own trim API word Nick page cannot be found is it HTTP so why is this not working oh there's other weird Oh the spaces are because of the new they're not from the trim they're from the new line that's all these spaces are being added these are spaces I'm really losing so let's actually make this a regular expression this is so weird you know what I'm gonna do so I can fix this but I probably just put it all in one line hope you so much better what if this is such a coding trainwreck but what I'm gonna do is I'll make a regular expression that takes any new line or any any white spaces new line of whitespace any whitespace any amount of white space and replaces it with nothing let's try this reload refresh select number inspector that's all semicolon is still there Oh cuz I didn't get rid of the semicolon ah all right one word try well I'm gonna try come on everybody this is gonna work I don't know what to play I'd have nothing to play I'm feeling good about this a little dizzy all of a sudden okay all right reload the extension are you with me refresh the page select number boy I'm really bad at debugging this I really should probably probably got to be much more careful yeah oh there's still some white space so why is the white space still in there alright cuz the new line can I do this so get the chat oh I need the global I need the global flag I need to go thank you breaking news I'm being told that I've forgotten that regular expressions when you use the replace function they only replace the first thing you find and let's use the global flag so I'm gonna go back to white space any white space replace it and and if this doesn't work I'm putting it all in one line okay you can't stop me I'm gonna put it all it wasn't here we go here we go everybody here we go here we go and go back and I'm gonna go reload I'm gonna go to the steam locomotive page and I'm gonna select locomotive I press this button a selfpropelled vehicle usually electric or dieselpowered for pulling or pushing Freight or passenger cars on railroad tracks so now I can go over here and I can open up the and I can see here for early and one thing I would like to do is I would just like to say dot style font size 64 now I wonder if all I'm doing is changing the popup so I have to reload the whole I probably reload the whole extension right 64 point let's make it like 48 point is it text size or font size I just want it to be bigger I just I just wanted to be I assume yeah look at that so interesting enough if I'm just changing the code in the popup I don't need to I don't need to actually need to reload the whole extension because it's kind of loading that on the fly which is weird how that works and also this is not real how do I make the size bigger of the actual popup that's probably I'm too tired to do that somebody will write it in the comments timeout timeout I'm gonna go away first I gotta come back how do I make the popup bigger please add text if heading also can you leave popup open until manually closed the information about Newcastle's incorrect like can I just do something like body like what determines the oh because oh I know the pay okay that's so I'm pretty sure that if I want that popup to be bigger to give me more space it's actually going to dynamically size it based on what it is when the page first loads but because I'm getting the data from Wernick later um it's not resizing so I could probably say body and then do something like with window resize by oh I could do window resize I so like I don't know if you guys would know who knows CSS would know this stuff better like can I do something like this and this has to be in a style tag according to my research according to my excellent research I don't need to reload the extension refresh the page yes oh look at that there we go so now I can click on locomotive and I get that I can click on America and I get United States I can click on obtain now again this is like the worst most Awkward interaction somehow if you're still watching this video first of all thank you they really appreciate it this has been a big struggle for me even though I made an example like this two years ago this is quite hard to do on the fly live even though you're seeing kind of an edited version of this I did do this live but I would like you to think about what is a more elegant interaction how might you want to augment someone's browsing experience to learn about additional context so this could actually be a practical tool or you could just do something kind of goofy and when you select a word you know it shows you it maybe shows you an image associating so I look forward to I will share some Chrome extensions next time I come back on a live stream of people who have like made more elegant interactions so please write your send me a link to your Chrome extension in the comments or tweet me at Schiffman something like that but this is certainly the end of this video thank you and good night fade out okay so I at 630 I think I'm done I put a fork I did not get two things that I wanted to do let's look at our list let's look at my list but I did persevere and get through kind of in a way everything I wanted to do about Chrome extensions I would love to do a Chrome extension that like just modifies people's tweets and as some so something nice to you but I'm not gonna do that right now so I uh brow okay I am NOT leaving I would it be here for a little bit longer against my better judgment I'm gonna do Firefox so first of all do I even have Firefox on this computer I have no idea how to do this no no don't import anything no don't make it the default so just looking at this am I like you know way out of date am I in a way out of date version or anything my firefox is out of date update Firefox about Firefox wait hold on about fire will open firefighters begin checking for updates and downloading them automatically Oh should be updating it right you should doing it what's the quantum thing should I try that quantum thing isn't there like a quantum quantum let's get quantum I mean quantum leap maybe Scott Bakula will show up fifty seven what house really ha I have 57 replace Oh No Schiffman browser extension this video I think we should do this with no editing doesn't matter how long takes me how much how much I need from the chat if I do this I think I can be done with Chrome extensions I could always come back to it but all right hello I'm very excited to do this video for you it's a little bit scary because I'm going to attempt to do something this video that I have no idea how to do and I've never looked at it before but I did receive this tweet from Nicholas who writes hey Daniel could you say browser or web extension most of the major browsers have the same set of api's so making a cross browser extension is easily doable see this link so it is true that this idea of ending a Chrome extension is not something limited to the Chrome browser and I've been saying Chrome extension all this time because it's what I was familiar what I'm familiar with and what I've used before but this idea of an extension is can be thought of in a larger broader way as a browser extension there is a uniform standard API from the Mozilla Foundation we can look at it here for a browser extensions so could I possibly in this video take one of my extensions I made like the kitten one and just make it work in Firefox as a browser extension this is what I'm going to attempt to do and I hope that people you you might be watching this as a Reddit 'add version but this is happening live and I'm really relying on the chat there's a YouTube chat and there's a slack channel going on here and I'm gonna follow and watch okay so what do i do first anybody have evidence so your first extension let's look at that I think I could skipped what are extensions oh oh so I need a manifest.json hey look at this it looks like I've done so actually I have a feeling I don't know if the chicken or the egg came first but I do know that I like I like a vegetarian omelet it's quite delicious now I can't be vegan obviously because eggs aren't but anyway I just I like vegetables that's am I really talking about that now no but this looks like so much so let me just go get my let's what is it possible that I could just run by extension in Firefox I don't actually recode it at all so let's go to all the these are all the extensions that I made with the exception of the first was a bookmark content script background script to kittens one the sketch one the pop ups let's try the kittens one i'm let's try the kids one so i'm gonna just make it a new folder whoops i'm gonna copy it and i'm gonna call it 008 browser kittens just i want to kids have to change some aspects of it let's leave that so it's just a content script with a kittens a folder of kittens and a manifesto JSON alright so let's see here how do I load an extension extensions Firefox colon extensions that doesn't work addons for Firefox where do I go so these are extensions I can get how do I add a developer one somebody I'm waiting for something that's fat to tell me cross browser kittens everybody should make cross browser cute wonderful kids I'm looking I'm waiting all right I'm gonna look myself unpacked extension firefox open firefox enter about debugging in the URL bar click load temporary addon so that seems like what I have to do about debugging yeah there we go enable addon debugging sure load temporary addon kittens where to kittens where the kids desktop extensions browser kittens open open no no do I just select a manifesto JSON file alright yeah it's there the KO it says chrome that's the worst so let me at least fix that let me go to the manifesto JSON and say browser this is now a browser X kitchen and if you want to watch the video where I programmed this extension I'll link to it in this video's description so now let me reload and then it should be running how about just go to Schiffman net oh it worked good look kittens kittens everywhere kittens it worked so what's nice to see here and actually it's nice to that that this is an open standard that this idea of an extension you can look at the chrome specific API the documentation and make chrome extensions but your code for the most part without and perhaps some minor changes I'm sure I mean this is a very simplistic extension but so there might be other things you can look at this mozilla documentation page to create cross browser extensions cross browser kittens for all so i hope you enjoyed them it has now become a very short video i would be happy to load my other extensions and see how that works let's just at least load one that has a button let's so now i'm going to be ambitious and i'm just going to say load I'm gonna load one that I made for looking up words and getting their definitions from word necks I'm gonna open up this one and I guess I have to within Chrome I select the folder looks like I select the manifesto JSON file so word look up now you can see look my button is there and I can go to let's go to a Wikipedia page for like rainbow and they're still replacing things with cats look I don't have a kitten here and I'm gonna select sky click here and look at that the expanse of air over any given point on the earth the upper atmosphere as seen from the earth service so I'm really discipline some ways I was a disappointed with myself but that's probably the right thing to say right here but I I prowl I wish that I had sort of started with this knowledge and from this point of view because as much as possible I like to use generic and open tools that can be applied to a lot of different things like different browsers or different operating systems but so but hopefully this is this video allows you to see if you want to do one of your extensions for a different browser you can all you can do that so thank you all for watching and I will see you in another time in another video maybe maybe if if you want you could uh yeah okay no no that's fine don't don't just just go on with your day wait wow I can't believe how easy that was alright everybody it is 640 how long has this livestream been QA I am happy to do a QA for a bit for a short amount of time I need to read some more of the random number book and then I need to go and I won't be back for two weeks because of Thanksgiving next week unless I can come up with a way to do a little something before two weeks from now but I will be back in two weeks try microsoft recommends some cool create or recommend some cool creative coding books I would love so my goto resource for that is probably props where I start with start with reprocessing org books gonna be kittens you should probably disable that extension as fun as it is remove how do I it's funny it doesn't look like you can enable and disable I just have to like remove it so this is a good resource for you to start with some creative coding books some that I this is one that I really really love generator design some other books that I've been recently looking at are this is a wonderful book ten print a history of computing and creative computing through the lens of one line of code from the Commodore 64 forth and code is a wonderful book a form and code this is a wonderful book forming code and design and code and design art and architecture a book that I love I wish I had my bookshelf behind me because I could sort of just look through it I mean Lauren McCarthy is getting started with p5.js book which is a port of K series and Ben Fry's book is is great for just getting started with p5.js pretty quickly and then Nick Montfort has a book this is like exploratory programming for the humanities or something something like that exploratory programming for the arts and humanities this is a really nice one as well is there a good resource for creating a I&J s thank you for asking that question what I would say to you right now for those of you who are interested go to deep learn j/s org take a look at that and I really hesitate to show this to you because it's very much in progress but a bunch of us at ITP are working on something called p5 deep learn Chancellor this is the URL for that github.com slash ITP NYU p5 deep learn is this is something we're working on to allow you to do machine learning in this is new KN image classifier that's like wasn't even there this morning and this is what I'm planning been working on this and I suggest you look at the contributors there's been other folks that are contributing to this and this is something that I hope you do a lot of video tutorials with starting in the new year so if you want to get a preview of this and start to look at it you are welcome to do so I would also recommend you take a look at teachable machines which is a project from Google Creative Lab and I plan on maybe using this teachable machines demo in some videos to explain certain machine learning concepts as well hello hello Dan I want to ask I recently graduated and struggling to find a job due to lack of experience I want to pursue software or web development any tips so first I'd like to say is that I don't know that I'm really qualified to answer that question because I'm a little out of the in my own world of making these YouTube tutorials and teaching classes but I will say that from my experience of working with the processing foundation and looking for projects to try to support or participate in that looking at somebody's web presence and their github repositories and how how they document their work is a really important thing so for me often one thing you might think about I mean a resume and your skills and maybe where you went to school and grades or some of those things that you usually think about these are the things that I need to apply for a job but how you and if it's not real and how you document and write about and explain your thinking and process not just your projects and things you've made so not just like look at all of my code but actually look at how I document and explain my code this is a really valuable skill and I think it really shows your it can really show your show your talents in a nice and open generous way so to me that's something that I think can be I aspire to do a good job of and that's something that that that maybe would help so and in that sense maybe getting involved in some open source projects which can sometimes feel scary or maybe it's not for you or you're not welcome or son included are you're gonna say the wrong thing and it's tricky and I would love as much as I can to help with that I certainly would encourage you to get involved with p5.js or processing foundation projects and tweet at me if you're not sure how to do that and hopefully this is something that I could do more on this channel to help get more people involved yeah alessandro asks a similar question low tip asks how do you would you structure an intro uni course for complete news so i don't want to I mean this is like you guys are like feeding me questions to like promote my own stuff but this is in terms of how I would do that is if you look at the learning processing and it's the learning processing book this book is how I think about that I mean it's a it's a you know I probably have new thoughts about this but this is the second edition this is the way that I teach programming here at ITP I'm not actually using this book because this is for the processing programming environment and we're teaching with JavaScript now I'm so getting started with p5.js there's a great book for you to look at for inspiration also but if you're interested you could at least you could also look at our syllabus right which is a github calm slash ITP NYU slash I see em 2017 so this is um this is kind of a outline of the syllabus of what we do in this course I will say that other programs do things in different ways of Boorman art focus and actually cadenza which is a online education company has a course called introduction to visual programming for the arts or something like that that's taught by Lauren McCarthy Casey Reese and Chandler McWilliams and so that that course also is a great model I think and okay Oh shadow plays as asked how's your arm doing thank you for asking it's actually doing really quite well can you even look at me right now do you know which elbow I broke maybe you don't even know it is the right side if I did this now you would know I cannot I cannot bend the right arm fully straight but I can get pretty good extension this is called flexion extension and I have a nice exciting looking scar that I don't know if you can see it but I'm getting stronger I'm feeling much better and thank you for asking are you teaching computer programming class with j/s so I'm gonna wrap this up in a second but yes so I teach at a program called ITP it's part of Tisch School of the Arts at New York University this is the web site it actually says ITP and ima because starting in fall 2018 the undergraduate BFA version of ITP called Interactive Media Arts will be accepting its inaugural class so there's still I think the deadline is not till December first so if you're looking for something to apply to and if you want more information you can tweet at me at Schiffman but this is where I teach so I teach I'm teaching three classes right now it's very hard and it's the end of the semester it's really busy but doing this YouTube channel is really fun for me and rewarding I'm trying to do my best and so I yeah and right so that's usually how I end up picking the content is I'm kind of do video tutorials on the things that I'm teaching at ITP so that I can publish those videos for the students at ITP and also make them publicly available yes so in the course that I'm teaching right now if you want to look for more information is that Schiffman net a twosie I'm gonna take one more question which I don't even see I'm gonna check that so I actually just completely forgot to look at the slack channel again if you want to support the work that I'm doing with a financial contribution which is not at all required it's only if you have the means and feel inclined to do so it's super appreciated but I want to make this accessible for anybody but you can go to patreon.com/scishow coding trained arm extensions alright so Oh chinatown asks in chat just starting to learn code what should i do first I mean there's umpteen ways that I can answer this question and I could point you towards lots of resources that aren't my own which are very good first of all let me just shout out the code newbies podcast I think code newbies is a podcast which is probably one of the friendliest and most welcoming communities they have a Sarang Sarang yet Barik who runs this podcast also started a new CS concepts podcast I've been listening to which is awesome and so I definitely encourage you to check out code newbies but in terms of my youtube channel if I go to youtube.com slash Schiffman this is the playlist for getting started from the beginning so I would encourage you to use that if you want to follow my channel there is also by the way you can also follow this playlist which is also totally from scratch but it's a much older playlist using just a different program there I'm gonna called processing but those would be the two places on my channel to start okay thank you well hello to Brazil Thank You Malvin the waiting music is by Adam Blau I can't hear it atuh Blau on twitter who also wrote the cutting train theme song which is this thing so if you play while I grabbed a random number book so I don't have any plans to remake the processing tutorials but that is an interesting idea I mean in theory I would love to give an infinite time I definitely would but the thing is most of them are still valid that the quality is not so great and but alright why a lot of viewers from Brazil alright I'm just going to read the first two paragraphs of the introduction early in the course of research at the RAND Corporation a demand arose for random numbers these were needed to solve problems of various kinds by experimental probability procedures which have come to be called Monte Carlo methods many of the applications required a large supply of random digits or normal deviance of high quality and the tables presented here were produced to meet those requirements the numbers have been used extensively by research workers at Rand and by many others in the solution of a wide range of problems during the past seven years now when it says the past seven years the original book was published in 1955 so I assume it's referring to the years between 1948 and 1955 alright it's all I have the energy for a Ricardo says the majority here just like this random number reading thing and but first of all I usually try to just do it at the end so you can always just tune it out and it's a little personal challenge to myself so you can humor me but I don't know if that's really true either let's do something unscientific here and create this poll I'm gonna vote yes and you can vote yourself with that URL and I will listen a couple couple more questions I'm looking for more questions Simon it's time for you to go to sleep Alvin asks about the ITP show it is the ITP show is December set let's look it up ITP dot NYU dot edu slash show December 17th and December 18th I should be here at both so please say hi if you come Jenner of synthesis music in p5 I did a video a little bit about that but not so I should do more oh boy this song is a minute and a half left should I learn p5 before native JavaScript which one should I go for a first I mean you're kind of asking the wrong person because most people won't answer the question the way that I'll answer it but I think learning p5 starting with the p5 library is a nice entry point to learning the basics of programming and from there you could investigate native JavaScript at the same time afterwards during but just having the sort of simplicity of the p5 environment it's you know if you're just in graphics and animation and beginner friendly stuff and making art that's what I would start with I'm a computer science major and my biggest problem is just how to solve the purp the problem not the coding itself did this ever happen to you all the time yes definitely it's really hard is p5 just the environment to program JavaScript for and kind of use the exact same code and just you can you have to make sure you import the libraries someone's asking if I plan any meetups I did attend processing day which was really fun I hope to you know so I hope I try to announce if I'm gonna be in a conference or anything I don't I would love I love the idea of doing more live events but I'm not so sure how to make that happen how many hours till the video ondemand abyss is uploaded it actually will be available immediately but it usually is usually available immediately unlisted so if you want the link it's pretty easy to find or you can tweet it me or something but once I have the description everything written it'll be released as public sometime this weekend probably alright you guys are the greatest even that many votes but okay thank you everybody we could refresh the results everybody's gone everybody's asleep my throat hurts been talking for three hours straight it's seven o'clock thank you everybody for tuning in to this today is coding trade I won't see you again for two weeks at least live on YouTube all these videos will get published though slowly over time the edited versions and I'm on Twitter although I think I probably should get off Twitter and join Mastodon because Twitter is kind of an awful place but for the moment I'm still there at Schiffman and this laptop died have to plug it back in and so thank you alright goodbye everybody I will play you and anybody anybody want to watch the trailer on the way out now I'm just gonna industry okay thank you everyone
