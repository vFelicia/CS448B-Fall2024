Did you stick with me? So now you're in the first section of the Nature of Code learning playlist, and that section is the Introduction. So what's actually going to happen now if you keep watching is the next videos that pop up into your feed or videos that I've made in the last several years about Perlin noise, the history of Perlin noise, and something called open simplex noise, as well as random walks. So this is really just meant to be a warm up, a way to dip your toe into the water. Maybe you haven't programmed in P5 JS with JavaScript or objectoriented programming in a while, and so this will get you a little bit of a warm up before I move on to the next chapter, vectors. So that's where I will be where in vectors, I'll be wearing these clothes, because at this moment right now, I am recordings that I'm going to next, they'll talk about vectors. But before I before you see me then, oh Nature of Code is really disrupting the spacetime continuum. Before you see those, you'll see a bunch of videos about Perlin noise and random walks which you can draw upon, I think, as a starting point for how you might want to start working with vectors.
