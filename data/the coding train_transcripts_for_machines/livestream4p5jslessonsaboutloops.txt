okay test volume let's see test test test volume test volume I think it's working okay I think I just read me and oops I got to turn the sound off here so I doubt there's anybody here but this will get recorded I'm gonna make some video lessons about loops and to start that off I'm opening up p5 I am creating a new your project and I'm saying okay sorry I gotta set up something that will need a loop for let's do this and maybe 50 100 150 200 250 oops 200 250 250 so what I'm doing here is I save this as under Luke's Luke's one what I'm doing here is setting up example ah you can't see me this whole time I should just start this over shoot anybody there to watching now sorry everybody okay okay so okay now back to the video I'm making okay so here is the scenario so this is a scenario I'm going to start with in the video which is the many many many many many many shapes how do you have this same line of code but repeat it multiple times with a loop that's the video I'm going to make I gotta turn the air conditioning down I have oops not very much time it's 1030 I'm gonna try to do a couple videos about loops in the next 30 to 40 minutes before I have to go and then I have class and I have my invisible cup again which I'm gonna drink my invisible water I doubt anyone's ever gonna watch this which is fine just fine by me and I'm gonna get started this video I'm gonna check the chat see if anybody's there has any questions or comments hi is that is the audio okay can you hear okay and then I'm also gonna do another test is that audio okay can you hear okay from this camera can you hear okay from this camera so I have to wait for any response now that I'm in my infinite thing all right I'm just gonna assume that the audio is working fine it always has been okay okay so now I need to get ready I'm gonna start over here and I'm gonna this video is gonna be about I'm going to make a video about the while loop and the for loop all in one it's gonna be a little more condensed than the videos I made last year about processing that are so more longwinded with lots more stuff okay here we go I don't know what the first thing to say is okay and also like my nose is running and you define happen tissue I'll be fine okay so this video that I'm making right now I'm going to look at something in programming a control structure a way to control the flow of how program runs what it does is called a repeat loop and this if you've just started programming if you've watched some of the other videos or played around with some code this is clearly something that you've encountered a need for and I have a prime example of that right here so you can see this sketch and it has 1 2 3 4 5 6 lines of code each line of code draws a line so there's six lines on the screen it's not too unreasonable I have six lines of code six lines in the canvas it works but I wanted to add some more lines or I I want to you know what mmm I think I want to do this with the circles stop I think I'm gonna do this with ellipses because I'm saying lines of code and lines is the shape and it's proving to be a bit awkward so this should work now I just need to have them be like 25 by 25 and maybe I'll put them all at 200 sorry but so I just copy 20 this also looks a bit more neat I can even do that oops I'm just being crazy now and I keep I'll keep the zero on there I think that's worth it okay um great I'm just gonna check the chat to see if anyone said anything hi Joan or maybe I pretty this pronounce the name okay I'm back okay so let me start this video over again a little water okay pen here we go hello so this I think I'm stop saying hello this video I would like to talk about something called a repeat loop this is a essential control structure in programming that you need to do all sorts of things if you've been working with code and drawing it's probably become a recently immediately clear what you might need a repeat loop for and I have a demonstration of that right here so if you see this canvas here there are 1 2 3 4 5 6 circles there each circle is drawn with a single call to the ellipse function and this works fine you want 6 circles on the screen call the ellipse function 6 times but if you want to have 60 circles on the screen or 600 circles on the screen or spaced them closer or do more stuff with them having an individual line of code for the same thing that's repeated over and over again is certainly not the route that you want to go so this is exactly what a repeat loop is for and I said that a repeat loop is a control structure and in a previous video I looked at another control structure known as a conditional statement so that control structure looked like this if boolean expression open curly bracket close curly bracket and if this is true this code is executed I'm going to add something once and then we go to the next line of code this is how this particular control structure worked the if the conditional statement control structure so the control structure of a loop is written just like the if statement but with a different keyword besides if and now there's actually two ways of doing it the first way that I'm going to show you looks very much like the if statement its while boolean expression while this is true continue to do this code over and over and over and over over again so I want to think about this control structure and I'm gonna add some things to the code and we're gonna add this control structure then into the code so these are really identical in their syntax and form the differences are if here while here if this is true do this while this is true continue to execute this code over and over again which opens up a little bit of a dangerous fact it's possible your program could get stuck inside this loop and this is something we're going to have to deal with immediately right now as we start to work on this problem so come on over here so let's look at this code again so one thing you'll notice about this code is I didn't use any variables so I think it would be advantageous to use a variable and what I'm going to do is I'm going to start a variable and I'm gonna call it X x equals 0 now I declared it up on the top am I in the previous videos that I made in all the examples the variables have always been declared at the top this is because there it's it's the I've been using these variables as socalled global variables meaning I could just use them anywhere in my code and the program remembers them over and over again forever and ever here is a case right now where actually what I want to do is just use a variable just for this section of the code and I don't need to remember it any other time when mouse is pressed or back and set up or anything like that so actually I'm going to take this opportunity to show you something called a local variable and if you declare a variable inside of a function I'm inside this draw function this variable right now is a local variable it's only available for the purposes of this draw function okay so now what do I want to do I want to put X here and I could say X plus 50 X plus 100 I could keep doing that and we'd have the same program I just used X instead of 0 but what I actually want to do is show you what if I just have X everywhere if I have X X in all of these lines of code now what do I have I have one circle at 0 because I drew the asain ellipse at 0 0 0 0 so what if I were to now add after each one x equals x plus 50 so let's move X by 50 after each ellipse and I'm also gonna do something I'm gonna add some line breaks whoops wrong place I'm gonna add some line breaks if I can manage this just to sort of look at it to see what is repeated okay so and let's add a line break here okay okay so let's look at this now I have these chunks ellipse then add 50 ellipse then add 50 ellipse then add 50 ellipse venality all of these blocks of code are actually identical right like let me let me delete them and just show you what I mean right so now we run this program one ellipse now let me take these two lines of code and just do paste paste paste paste paste paste paste paste paste auto format now I have all these ellipse there so this now now now we really have the same exact lines of code X like just over and over and over again there's gotta be a way to perform those lines of code over and over again I just want to say ellipse at X etc and then I want to say x equals x plus 50 this is exactly what I want to do I just want to do this over and over again while something is true okay so let's think about that we need to figure out when do I stop doing this over and over again if I just wrote true inside here this would loop would execute forever and the program would never would never stop and get stuck there we'd never see anything on the screen what is my exit condition well there is no answer to this question it's kind of up to you and what am i why am I even here drawing circles on the screen I'll never know but presumably you have a reason for learning programming and you have an idea for something you want to make in this case no I can make up something I want to let's say on that I just want to keep drawing circles till I get to the edge of the window so what is my exit condition hi my exit condition is this is the canvas the exit condition I want to stop looping when X is greater than with right this is what I want to stop looping but remember the thing that in here is when it's true that's not when I stop looping that's when I continue looping so I want to continue looping as long as X is less than width so as long as X is less than width I want to draw this ellipse over and over and over again okay so let's come over here and see that so now I can take all this nonsense and just leave this important part these are the two lines of code do that I want to repeat over and over and over again while X is still on the screen do this draw a circle move over draw a circle move over draw a circle move over so now I can add while X is less than width and then I need a close curly bracket and again this is a new block of code this while loop is a new block of code it opens with a curly bracket it ends with a curly bracket and the convention is to indent the inside just visually for a human being to be able to see it so now I'm going to run this we can see there all the ellipses now if you look at this you can see it kind of the first one starts a deer on the last one doesn't start it with that's simply because I have X is less than width we could I don't know if width is divisible by 50 I think it is I could try less than equals and then I kind of get that last one so the math here matters like where's your exactly your exit condition and that sort of thing but now you can see I've drawn all these circles so this is a good nice start however somebody watching this video somebody out there in the world who may be watching this video is gonna say why are you bothering with this while loop thing nobody ever uses a while loop well I personally felt like it was worth five minutes of our time your time my time to look at the while loop because it translates so nicely from this if statement to why so what happened here if this is true do this once whilst you do this over and over again but if you'll notice this particular while loop has three elements to it that I want to note to you the first one is we start with initializing a variable bar X equals 0 the second thing is we test for an exit condition X is less than or equal to width and the third thing I want to note is that we have this incrementation operation X goes up by 50 so those three elements are so common in loops that there's an entire other looping structure control structure called a for loop that puts all those things together as just 1 2 3 so I want to redo this exact same program with a for loop and show you what what I mean so we had so let me erase all this so take me a second think to yourself about something so I had 3 things I had an initialization bar x equals 0 I have a boolean test is X less than with and then at the end of the loop I had an increment ation option operation x equals x plus 50 so what I'm suggesting to you is this is such a common kind of loop that the loop you will most likely use in almost all of your programs and I would suggest you doing an exercise with is a for loop for VAR x equals 0 X is less than with X I'm going to go off of the screen equals x plus 50 can you still see that print these curly brackets okay so this is taking everything from this while loop and condensing it so the loop starts by initializing X every time through the loop X goes up by 50 and every time the loop finishes it checks if the exit condition has been met in which case it then exits the loop so we can now go back to this program and I'm going to what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to leave this I'm going to put this at all the circles at x equals 100 and I'm gonna rewrite this same loop down here with a for loop so I don't need to actually I'm gonna say for VAR x equals 0 X is less than with x equals x plus 50 curly bracket and let me widen the editor here so you can see the whole thing and then all I need is the one line of code the thing that I want to happen during this counting increment is counting looping operation which is that I want to draw the ellipses and I'm gonna draw them at 300 so let's make these some color and let's make these some other color and let's run it so we can see oh and I I guess I'll do the X less than or equals for both of them and you can see now so you can see both loops perform exactly the same task this is a bit more explicit because you can kind of read the order more obviously start with x equals 0 while it's less than with draw this circle and go up by 50 but the exact same thing is happening here and it's so common that being able to condense this into one line of code is something that you might do now inevitably you're going to see other examples around the internet and one thing that I think I should point out is this kind of copyright operation x equals x plus 50 is also so common that programmers have developed a shorthand for it which i think is worth noting right now okay so there is it's often you might see a line of code like this x equals x plus 50 this line of code can be written as shorthand as X plus equals 50 okay so that's one thing to notice you might see this in examples that you look at this is certainly more explicit and more longwinded but this is just as accurate as the exact same operation the other thing you might see is when you have the number 1 x equals x plus 1 this is written shorthand as X plus plus if you ever thought about it there's a programming language called C and there's a programming language called C++ which is like the next version of C but close enough but so this is also such a convention that it sort of made our way into kind of vernacular speak whose vernacular I don't know what vernacular means I really should've stopped this video a while ago so this is just a little tidbit you might see that if I were to add that to this example I would say I would change this to x plus equals 50 and then I would run it again and we have still the same exact result so what I would say to you is try to think try lines try rectangles try to control your loops what if you have things moving down or diagonally or what if you could you change the color like how would you have each one of these shapes be a different color from Bright to dark from dark to bright the map function that I looked at in a previous video could be relevant so try using a repeat loop to create some pattern of repeating shapes and the two other videos I would like to make one is I would like to look at a nested loop to a loop within a loop to draw a grid pattern and also I think I want to talk about an array which is a list of variables which goes handinhand with a loop so I need to make that video at some point thanks and this is the end of this one okay so I'm still live streaming that seemed to be okay you can use command click for multiple cursor huh I don't know what that means but thank you for the comment and hello to the few of you who are out here watching I am going I think what I will do is I think what I will do is let's see if I can do that nested loop one right why not right no big deal let's do the nested loop example video oh the other yeah okay so the other thing I want to mention the other thing I need to mention in a video is to talk about how the loop is within this draw loop I should have mentioned that in the previous video but I think I'll just do it both in the next one I'll do talk about the looping within the draw loop and also look at a nested okay so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna turn the air conditioning up for a minute to make it a little bit cooler in here while I'm getting ready so let me I'm gonna close this hello to some new people who have joined I'm recording oops I'm over here I'm recording videos I haven't so I'm also just like talking in between the recording a video so there'll be these finished videos that will get uploaded and then there's this long raw footage of me acting like a lunatic in here so what I want to do is remove this let me save as loops I'm gonna remove this while loop I have like 10 more minutes before I should move on and I have to get ready for actual class so so here's what I want to talk about in the next video I want to change this to be a grid of circles across the across the whole window and then I want to talk about the loop within a loop which I can maybe do by changing the color randomly and it'll like flicker or something yeah this could be better but it's just gonna be what it is it's fine okay okay so I'm gonna check the chat one more time to see if anybody had any feedback some other people are saying hi I say hi back to you and now here we go okay okay so I got certain the air conditioning back down I'm going to hit record I'll start over here let me erase this first start the video out and going to get started previous video I just made looked at some the basics of a while loop in a for loop and all we really did was like a tiny little thing all I did was a I said we I like to say I there's no we here okay so the previous video that I just made I looked at the basics of the control structure of the loop so I looked at a while loop and a for loop and for loop is the primary loop that I'm going to use for the demonstrations in this particular video so there's a couple little items that I want to add on tack on to this discussion you know all we really did we it doesn't matter I can say we it's fine I'm gonna start this recording this one one more time and it's gonna be finished okay here we go okay I forgot what I was gonna say I'd like to make one more video about loops I mean I could probably make 10 more videos about Luke's but I think there was a couple key things that are missing from the previous video where all I did was something very basic showed you how the structure of the loop works and used it to draw a repeating shape so it's up to you to kind of try to do some creative things with that but I think there are two pieces of this puzzle that I would like to discuss that I think will help your knowledge a little bit so the first thing is that there's something a little bit strange going on oh shoot it's fine that camera went off but guess what it's back on the open update fine I'll start over every time we hit the button then the camera goes to the wrong location okay I'm gonna stop this am I here back nope this cameras off okay nope come back to me camera this camera is causing me all sorts of problems oh it's back okay this one is good this one is good except it's kind of I got I like turn it a little bit there we go that's better okay sorry everybody if anybody is actually watching this on the live stream you have to deal with my technical difficulties but I am now ready to try this again I forgot what I was saying okay so think about two more things loop within a loop yeah okay I got it I got it I got it walk did you know I'm gonna leave this in the video because this really happened and it's there so uh the previous video I made we looked at I just looked at really really the basics of the control structure of the loop a while loop a for loop for looping this for primary looping structure that I'm used for the rest of the examples and all I did was something very basic use it to draw a repeating shape and now it's up to you to figure out what kinds of creative things you can try to experiment with to create different new kinds of patterns that you haven't explored before but I think there are two key elements that I would like to discuss that I think will fill in a couple gaps in your in in your knowledge here that will help you do more stuff with loops so the first thing that I want to mention is you know we I started talking about loops as if this is this new thing but there actually is this draw function and the one of the very first things I looked at in an earlier video is this draw function is looping and every time you get to the end of the draw function the screen is updated then the draw function repeats stuff is drawn again screen is updated so sometimes it gets a little bit confusing here if you have this loop like there's this for loop that that I just created in the previous example which is inside the draw loop this is all that comes back together because this this video is all about nested loops because this is really a nested loop draws looping the for loop is looping but right the goal of this loop was to do what it was to draw multiple shapes repeat the same ellipse function over and over and over again however if you were if you're thinking about this kind of in most to much detail you might have noticed it's wow this loop is going it's not like you see like the first ellipse then you see the second one then you see the third one then you see that the fourth one you just see that all you might also think yourself okay well it's drawing them one at a time but it happened so fast it looks like it's just all of them so I would like to remind you that neither of those things is the case in fact the window the canvas is not updated until the end of draw is reached so the purpose of a four loop inside the draw loop is not to animate something but rather to draw a whole bunch of things for each cycle of the draw loop if you want to animate things you would have to do something slightly different so let's take a look in this particular example so I'm going to draw these back in the middle these circles so the circles are just there I'm seeing all of them nothing is changing I could do a couple things one I could add random for the blue value of the color and now we can see that can you see that whoa yeah that's really like the worst let me make this random too because you can barely see that now you can see that more right so you can see that draw is looping over and over again and the only thing that's changing is that the color is changing the location of these ellipses from that loop are staying the same I could do something kind of strange and I could say let me add a variable like offset and I could say draw every ellipse at the X X as part of this loop oh my goodness I'm flickering like crazy this camera is having problems but hopefully you're gonna be able to get through this video anyway the X X is the same every time through X is the same every time through draw because X is what's this is making me crazy governing the location of those goals but if I were to say offset equals offset plus one now you can see I'm offsetting the location of all of those by some amount so this dismay this is these are kind of like a few sort of strange quick things that I've added here but the point of what I wanted to make is you just need to keep that in mind write this draw loop is for the purpose of refreshing that flipbook metaphor I think works well or analogy so I'm going to correct me the the flip book idea right you've got a page and then a next page in the next page in the next page there's no flip book here this is in order to perform a repeating tasks on a single page in the flip book so animation so that's the first thing that I wanted to know the other thing that comes up very often is kind of related to this because what happens if now inside this loop I put another loop for every X do something to every Y and let's think about how that might be useful and this is a kind of algorithm or process that comes up over and over again and again in any sort of computer graphics programming and other kinds of programming as well why because the canvas the thing that we're drawing to is a 2dimensional grid it has pixels along an x axis and it has pixels along the y axis so if I would like to draw something for every X fill in all the Y's so for the first X do all the Y's for the next X do all the Y's now for the next X do all the Y's the way that that works is to say for VAR x equals 0 the rest of the for loop and then for every X assuming this X is going up every time you do an X also do a Y so this is a little tricky to get used to but it's incredibly powerful it will open up a lot of possibilities you know you want to program a game that involves a 2dimensional board of cells like sir checkers you're gonna need some sort of structure like this if you want to learn about image processing how do you read every pixel of an image and make that pixel a little brighter a little darker or apply some other kind of effect you're gonna need this kind of loop so it comes up over and over again in so many things so let's look at that applying the code and I'm still here okay I won't flicker and disappear too much so what I'm going to do I'm gonna get rid of this I'm gonna save this project as I'm saving these because someday I will upload them somewhere I suppose I am going to remove this weird offset thing I'll keep the random fill why not we don't need this offset and what I want to do is add right here another loop for y equals zero Y is less than or equal to height Y goes up by 50 and draw the ellipse at X comma Y so all I did is now this is the exactly we're talking about for every X do every Y so my first X do all the Y's the next X do all the Y's and let's see if this works whew it did so now we have this perfect grid of circles flashing random colors all over the window you know how could you make those colors not random how might you have likes apply some sort of pattern to it how might you do all sorts of interesting things like have those circles start to shake a little bit that's a little bit more complicated that you're gonna need some other tools and objects and rays for a bit more but you can start to think about all these possibilities and I just want to point out that again if I were to take this loop and I did this sort of backwards I don't know why I'm showing you this because it works so nicely but if I were to not do it this way right if I were to do this two loops right this is what I've got with two separate loops I'm doing all the X's along the Y column 200 and now I'm doing all the Y's along the X sorry along the Y row 200 I'm doing all the Y's in the X column 200 so I don't know I had this my nose can show you this first and so now I'm like showing this after which really doesn't make a lot of sense but I'm just like leg this video fly with all of its weirdness and errors so let me go back to what it was correctly that was sort of like pointless to take that out and we could I think this is a nicer place to end looking at this again so what I've talked now about really very little but kind of giving you a running start here into thinking about loops a loop is something to repeat a certain task during one cycle of drama you can use a loop anywhere but right now I'm using it to draw multiple copies of a shape inside of draw you can also use a nested loop to see a grid if draw remember is the flip book so each time through draw if you change some aspect of the loop you know I just thought of something really interesting that we could try like for example everything can be a variable right here the X loop stops at width what if I were to put mouse X here so I just want to dynamically loop up to where the mouse is so now this loop remember is executing every single time but the exit condition is changing every time through Drive you're still watching this was a little nugget here that's that's hopefully useful okay so that gives you the basics about Luke's how loop works within draw how you have a nested loop and I need to make one more video which won't happen today because I now have to go do something else but I want to look at an array and how a loop relates to that okay thank you and goodbye this is where I need to click ok live stream I don't know if anybody enjoyed that there's a few people watching I'm gonna go now I'm gonna turn off this live stream so this video is there now on YouTube of just the kind of rambling live stream thing but I'm gonna upload the actual they're not edited but the the sections that are like of just the continuous lesson material upload those as well okay goodbye I don't know I have to go click on live control room and you can see this button here I am now going to push this button it says stop streaming and if this was 36 minutes and stop Oh something else came up yes I'm sure
