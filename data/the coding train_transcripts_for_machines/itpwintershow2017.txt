hello what you're about to watch is a highlight reel of a much longer live stream I teach at a program called ITP it to school the Arts at New York University at the end of every semester the students do a show of all their work it's a twoyear master's program this is over a hundred projects that students been working on over the semester you can check out this video description for a link to the full two hour and 15 minute livestream this is just a short highlight reel just to have it as something else but you can watch if you don't want to watch the full 1215 minute last room so I hope you enjoyed the project if you want to find out more about ITP or our new undergraduate program starting next year in 2018 called ima interactive media arts you can read more about it in this video's description thanks for watching see you soon hi my name is Ella Nichols and my project visualizes pulse information from to people and encourages you to sink your heart weigh it with somebody else so once it gets a good pulse from each person it's gonna compare their heart rates and then we can try to sync all of these sensors going to Arduino you know you know which then goes into my computer and is affecting a processing sketch hi my name is chen tao this is Mei Chen we just have this simple mission love wings I love space so we have this silly idea of just combining idea of letting a man flying through space using wings and that here is why we built this appreciate the physicality of the wings so they love putting a young and when they're interacting it's really like tangible I guess yeah like it was really surprised like a lot of children really enjoyed the game and like they talked to me said it was like really really cool and they loved to fly for like like all the time I am Stephanie Colton and I'm a second year at ITP I did a project called take me to which is a sort of couples trace routing IP addresses with Google Streetview so I'll use p5.js org is our website and we'll see it go through the different locations all right so I picked our website and what we're gonna do is we're gonna right now it's thinking and looking up all the intermediate IP address hops that we make from our network here at NYU to p5.js org and so what we saw are the Street View locations of all of those organizations that have those intermediate IP address is registered so on the way we hit talk to our communications in Virginia but also in New York we hit Zao bandwidth and then we also finally then ended up at new dream network in California which is where p5 dot org p5.js org is registered okay so I'm Yanni Harry young Shin so this is our project which Kendall's and it's all about yeah we're making your wishes blowing out the candles so as fast we just thought about turning of LED light flowing by blowing out but later we decide to decided to apply a story and you know the blowing out the candles making your wishes on your bus birthday it's kind of international myth so we applied the story on our project and then we also wanted you to add some kind of analog interaction on it so we also made electronic electronic match that you can turn it on by striking it on the match box my name is Yao and this project is called the cosmos in the water this idea this project is actually a meditation it's it's like there is young I am hatton you can see from the water so it's about Taoism so I want people while they are interacting with the water they can feeling their relationship with nature so are we part of the nature or are we isolated from it do we want to control it or do we want to achieve balance so this project is about the things that I want people to think while they are playing with it Kelly can we play whackamole all right hi I'm Kelly and my project is interactive whackamole and so basically you've got 30 seconds to hit whatever comes up as many times as you can for points and bragging rights and you know but of course so I'm gonna start the game off for you and then you basically people seem to like the croc pictures hyukoh by Fe so my projects call micro failure and it's about the fungus Network so I'm fascinated about how fungus they talk to each other and distribute nutrition's in the forest and I made a metaphor to indicate like how human beings can also mimic that and better distribute information so the interaction it's basically youporn your hand at one mushroom for example that one and you draw a circle so my name is il Rosenberg and I made a toy drum machine all made out of wood mostly kids just put every possible magnet on the board so what happens if you do that yeah it just goes berserk but yeah I'm Shawn I'm you ha this is our progress like a magic sandbox you can play with the sand and animation wheel changes along with it so that's the music my name is a Chelsea I'm transition Virgil is made by me and my partner yelling and this is an installation project with link for stampers with my Gmail API so basically you're watching is my email stress level so every time I got new email stepwells being a little bit so if I keep annoying this email spell things will happen for example the link was filled alrighty and now we are on the stage too so I'm guessing maybe trending more emails that below will be popped and the ways you have stage race it's a today so the arm will push all the player on the floor and smash it and you have to clean the mess and the first one is an egg so I think you can see egg is the life right it can be a chicken so you don't want to kill life so really your email so this tree will listen to your worries and store your worries in a near future he will send it back to you so the idea is like a time capsule as time has your worries will be minor and will be true my name is Taryn Gutierrez I'm a first year graduate student and ITP so this project is called the starting line project it's a racing game followed by privilege so we have two players two users answer a sentence of ten questions yes or no and if the answer is yes to any questions they run on the yes mat for two seconds and they step back and if the answer is no to any questions they step on or nomads and step back and so our overall goal was to use technology as a way to make the conversation around privilege a little bit easier oftentimes it's extremely difficult to have so we thought that one of the best ways to do so is embedding that within the game my name is acai and this is my musical gear table it's a table with gears here the different instrument marimbo our debrief sorry so when you rotate beats you can change them maybe yes my name is Jesse Simpson together with my partner Ahmad we created a MIDI controller out of the cello so essentially the cello the note is picked up the contact microphone and then the frequency is analyzed in max/msp and then translated to a mini value and sent to Ableton Live where two software synthesizers are controlled the knobs here that control different aspects of the descent zones I'm Haley and I'm product automatic and actually the meaning it's a maganet facility so this is for the magnetic sound insulation and also it kind of like Popish instrument smooth by megan is like repairing itself and then like the other megan is so i took me around and i can combine like making a like boomboom a gonna make a different lady McNown dirt in the recipe my name is hung and this is my pilot project this its name is into the darkness and it's a space exploration game i'll show you how now you see a little rocket on the screen and you can choose and and the reason why I want to make a controller like this is because nowadays people play games on keyboards and joysticks and Xbox controllers I wanted to make the control methods like more intuitive because just what you do is what you saw on the screen because I live with this rocket and the rocket goes up so or intuitive
