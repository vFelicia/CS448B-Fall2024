hello and welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to continue a series that I've been doing about algorithmic botany one of my favorite topics I'm here to tell you that if you like sunflowers and likes of flowers then this is the video for you to watch because what I want to talk about is a topic called Philo Texas and I want to examine what phyllotaxis is I want to look at the math behind phyllotaxis hopefully pronouncing that right and I want to create a nice shiny rainbow colored phyllotaxis example so this is the Wikipedia page phyllotaxis it comes from the ancient Greek Phylon meaning leaf and taxes meaning arrangement so it's a kind of spiral pattern that you see often in nature it's connected to both the Fibonacci sequence interesting thing to look up if you're not familiar with and also the golden ratio so the reference that I'm going to use is from this algorithmic botany algorithm botany org from the University of Calgary website there's a free pdf book the the math for everything I'm going to do is right here in this paper chain in chapter 4 of this book and you look at this and you think Greek letters and square roots and all that sort of stuff but I'm here to tell you this is actually going to be something quite simple so all I want to do is I want to rewrite those formulas kuna by sound board went off by accident I want to rewrite those formulas over here I'm going to say a fee or fahai I could never remember equals n times one thirty seven point five degrees this is a very very special angle hearts and stars for this angle one hundred thirty seven point five degrees one of my favorite angles everybody should have a favorite angle in their life I think and then also I want to say R equals C times the square root of n so you can see this is all we need so why in the first place do we need an R and an angle well this is why this is a coordinate space a Cartesian coordinate space with an xaxis and a yaxis and we're going to plot every point in this spiral pattern based on an x value and a y value so this is a point it's some X and why points however what the phyllotaxis math is going to give us is not an x and a y but a radius and an angle the radius being the distance from 0 0 that's R and the angle being the direction so you're going to see like this spiral pattern come out and we're going to draw all these circles each with a different radius that's either growing that's growing in an angle that's incrementing so we need to whip but but in np5 or processing or whatever programming environment is you might use I'm going to say like ellipse I want to draw a circle at a given x and y so what I need to be able to do is convert the radius and the angle 2 and x and a y and how do I do that I used something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation that sounds kind of fancy but basically I need a formula to go from my R and theta R and Phi or theta or fee or whatever angle R an angle to X&Y and the formula for that actually just uses cosign by the way if you say cosine of this angle it equals a cosine of this angle equals adjacent over hypotenuse x divided by r rx equals R times cosine of that angle and y equals R times sine of that angle we do the same thing with sine so these are these formulas you're going to see in our code and these formulas are going to see in the code now this looks a little weird the only thing here is is really are the only thing but we're calculating R and and the angle in order to get the X and the y in order to do that we need to have an N and to see what is n n is we're going to make a whole lot of dots for this phyllotaxis pattern and n is the number of the dot is it dot number zero dot number one number two number three number four and C is a number for a scaling pattern so you'll see that in a bit let's start to write some actual code so I'm going to come back over here and uh here we go I'm going to come back to the code I usually to come to the code yet so let's just look this is some p5.js code I'm going to it's running here in the browser it does nothing but draw a blank canvas but I'm going to create a variable n which equals zero and I'm going to say n plus plus right this is the first thing that I'm doing because each frame and actually I want to draw my background and set up each frame I'm going to draw a new dot and I'm going to how am I going to draw that dot I'm going to say angle equals what was the formula again n times one thirty seven point five so n times one thirty seven point five and the radius equals what C times the square root of n so we need to come up with what C is let's make up a number for right now let's make up a number what I know you're going to play with that number and we're going to see a bunch of different variety of results okay so now that we have a and are being calculated we can also remember now all we need are these two formulas to calculate x and y so now I'm going to say VAR x equals R times cosine of that angle VAR y equals R times sine of that angle and then also the thing is I want everything to be drawn relative to the center of the window so I'm also going to add a width divided by 2 and add height divided by 2 that's just to take because if you look at my diagram over here I'm thinking about everything is calculated relative to an origin point but in the computer graphics window the origin point is the top left and so I want to shift everything over okay so now I'm just gonna say ellipse X comma Y and I don't know I'll make the ellipse you know eight pixels or whatever and I'm going to just say fill 255 and then we're gonna run this program I don't know why I'm condensing all the code so no white space here we go let's run it see what happens hey look that looks pretty good something's happenin here oh wait I think we finished I think we did this already look that kind of looks like a cool little spiral pattern well let's um let me let me show you something special I'm gonna just expand C for a second whoa that's way too much uh there we go so well okay no this is not where oak is nevermind let's try to live code that's not going to work let's make C a little bit bigger actually I'm gonna make it a lot bigger just for a second sure make it 20 you can see what C is doing is it's actually sort of a scaling factor so how much is that radius changing right you can see here the radius is equal to the square root of the number times C so if I'm drawing my circles at 8 pixel with a diameter of 8 pixels let's try making that C actually just something like 4 and you can see we can start to sort of see that pattern let me make the circles a little bit smaller let me just say no stroke also maybe and then we can run this again and we can start to see there's that phyllotaxis spiral pattern there it is beautiful there we go in a way I'm kind of done right now I could sort of play with I could play with the scaling factor I could still actually play with the angle as well and if you go if we go back and looked at this paper you'll see down here like oh look at this here are some different kinds of patterns we could get if we kind of futz with the angle this one here as an angle of 1 37.3 not my favorite angle but a perfectly reasonable angle so let's run this and see what we get and you can see how this fire what kind of spiral pattern we get now which is kind of interesting in and of itself the other thing we can start to think about what we might do is how we might color the dots in a more interesting way so one thing that I could do here is just use a HSB color so I'm going to do you know what I don't think this is right I think this whole time I'm getting something sort of vaguely interesting and correct but I think that my angle mode I don't think this is the exact phyllotaxis spiral pattern because I believe the default angle mode of p5 is radians and really what this number is is in degree so I need to change the angle mode to degrees I don't know can you tell it yeah this is a little bit different and actually 4 correct so I think earlier in this video my phyllotaxis pattern was a little bit off but now you can see I'm kind of getting that beautiful more perfect kind the reason why I noticed it is because I think when I went to one 37.3 it didn't match up exactly with what was in that paper but now this is match I can see that this pattern is what's there so let me go back to now what I was thinking the reason why I thought of this is because I want to change the color mode to HSB meaning when I create a color I want to make it by 2 Q its saturation and its brightness so if I were to say something like fill 100 255 255 then I'm getting a sort of green color for all of my dots in the pattern and if I were to say 200 I'm getting a nice blue because that number is a hue between 0 and 255 so I could say something like I don't know just make it the angle modulus 255 and actually that should be modulus 256 modulus being a way to to cycle back to 0 so 256 modulus 256 is 0 and 250 seven modules 256 is 1 so if I do this you can see like ah look at that I get kind of a difference respiro Li hue for every single based on what the angle is um I could actually use n might also make sense just to do the actual number so you can see now the number on the dot is controlling the color I could actually do something kind of interesting which i think is angle minus radius we might try I think would be kind of interesting the difference between the angle and the radius I don't know if this is going to whoops oh it's just called a and I guess I'll say modulus 255 there as well whoops a my oops and I'm missing a parenthesis here we go this is kind of you can see how the you can see kind of wet where the hue is kind of traveling around in this spiral pattern so there's all sorts of possible ways you can think about how you might create the color another thing you could do is guy could change the size of these circles based on where they are in the pattern they could be smaller in the middle larger to the outside all sorts of things so here we are I've got a nice thumbnail here for this video I've made a phyllotaxis pattern I would love for you guys to go take this code that I'll release with this video scroll down read more of this paper can you make a nice sunflower pattern can you expand on this what types of things might you do make some experiments make some beautiful phyllotaxis and I will see you in another challenge in the future thanks very much for watching
