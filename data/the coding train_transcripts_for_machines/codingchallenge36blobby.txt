hello and welcome to a coding challenge which I'm going to call blobby coding challenge I want to make something that's a blob this is a this is sort of loosely a part of the agario coding challenges where there are these circular things moving around the screen but I'm in this coding challenge only thinking about just that sort of stationary circle which is a nice perfectly round beautiful happy little circle right there but I want it to be wavy curvy and the edges and kind of feel a little blobby so let's think about men come over the whiteboard here and draw some stuff right this is a perfect circle which is drawn as an ellipse but another way I could draw this perfect circle is by using a call to a function called begin shape and a call to a function called end shape and in between there I could make a lot of calls to a function called vertex so if I were to say put a vertex here put a vertex here put a vertex here vertex vertex vertex and connect them all then I have what I started with a nice perfect circle but what if I were to make this vertex go out over here and this one come in over here then I might have something that appears kind of curvy and what if these wiggle all around and kind of blob around then I have something that appears kind of squishy and blobby now there are a couple different ways I could do this option number one I could do some kind of physics simulation with a lot of springy forces I have this like almost as if these are all connected by Springs and as you pull one it pulls the other and kind of flips back and oscillates and jiggles and that sort of thing come and do that in another coding challenge you can take a look at one of my toxic libs kind of like cloth simulations to get an idea of how you might do that another way I could do this is with Perlin noise and I think I'm going to try that right now or I could use like a sine wave in other words all I want to do is alter this radius right each of these points is calculated based on an angle which I'll call theta and a radius if I iterate over all the different angles but change the radius and have those rate radii move move up and down randomly I can get something that seems kind of squishing and blobby so let's see if we can make that happen the first thing I want to do is go into the blob object and find this show function which is right down here and you can see what's happening here I'm drawing an ellipse but I'm going to change that now and I'm going to do a couple things one is I'm going to say push and pop because I'm going to also use translate because I want to first translate to the center of this object and then once I've done that I can say begin shape and I can say end shape and then I can have a loop so what do I want my loop to do I want an angle to start at zero and I want to go all the way to two how do you spell 2pi and i want to go up by some amount I'm going to say 0.1 and I really should be more thoughtful about this but I'm just going to randomly do this and then I'm going to say I have an X which is now this object's radius times cosine of that angle this is a polar to Cartesian conversion which I would refer you to another video where I go through this math and a bit more detail but now I can just set the vertex to that x and y position so let's run this and see if we get basically the same result I find it hard to believe that that's really what happened am I looking at the correct code let me comment that out okay it's not there shockingly that looks way too similar I guess that'd work oh you can see that it actually changed because it's not so perfect there on the right let's let's just to see see how this is actually working let's draw little ellipses and take out the vertices right you can see that's what I've actually done I've drawn all these little circles and connected them so there we go so this actually worked the thing is I want this variable this R to be something that changes so what if I said R equals this dot R plus a random amount between negative 5 and 5 and so on I used R instead what would we get now we would get something that looks like this you can see those radii are changing what if I did something where I said I want to have an offset which equals map sine of the angle which goes with a negative and 1 and 1/2 negative 5 and 5 and what if I say angle plus frame count times 0.01 or something so and so this is now this dot R plus offset that didn't do very much oh you know I just realized uh yeah that's just moving all the vertices together with the same offset so they have to be offset from each other anyway the point of what I want to do is not that actually I want to make this assign this sine wave thing work ok what I want is for each one I want to do I want to get this to work let's make this actually work I want it to do this I want you to just see what it looks like when there's a sine wave so I want to have this I need a separate value that's that really should work or I guess maybe these angles aren't are changing by too much hold on let's let's make this work right do I need to multiply this by like some tiny amount or something um I'm back whoops oh I'm back so actually the the angles I've just forgot are only between 0 and 2pi so there's only one cycle of the sine wave so I actually want to multiply the angle by a lot if I want to see that sort of oscillation so I I can get something kind of like this and you know I could play around with these you know values anyway you could you could get the idea of how I might not good off you could get the idea of how I can do various kinds of different offsets to change the quality of that shape but let's actually just use Perlin noise which I think will produce some interesting results so what if I were to say noise and I want to have an X offset which I'll say equals zero noise of X offset which goes between zero and one and I want to map that between negative twenty five and twenty five and I want that X offset to increase by some amount for each one of those so if we see that you can see now I have this kind of blobby looking thing and each time i refresh it looks a little stranger now you'll notice I have an issue where I'm not able to connect the last point to the first point very well and there's ways we can kind of improve that but you can see I've got like this kind of goofylooking shape now what I can actually do there's a couple things I could do number one is I could add a Y offset and the y offset is kind of like a global variable for this object it could start it it could start at zero itself and and the y offset is the thing that doesn't change for each one but just changes over time itself so if I use two dimensional Perlin noise now you're going to see this kind of like blobby of shape now the Y offset is changing rather fast so I might want to slow that down quite a bit and you can see now I've got some a more undulating like type thing I could have also by the way just not used to dimensional noise but I could have just I could just say X offset plus Y offset and you'll see this is doing something this looks like it's actually kind of like spinning because the noise IDs are actually kind of rotating around so that's another effect that you can kind of get by just like changing where the noise is beginning and even this like this doesn't bother me so much but you could consider using something like this in agario to make it kind of a little bit squishier and in that sort of thing so this account gets you the basic idea of having a bit of a Perlin noise ball so to speak I think what I'll do hopefully remind me in the comments is when I publish this code I might simplify this even further to just have that kind of shape thing and you can kind of tweak it let's think about and about improvements that we could make to to tie the last point to the first point itself okay so thanks for watching this right at some point I'd like to show you how to add some spring forces to this which would be another another nice kind of quality to it as well okay thanks for watching this coding challenge and I'll see you again in a future video
