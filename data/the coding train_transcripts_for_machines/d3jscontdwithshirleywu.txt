hello we're here we're live yes we're back surprised this is one of those rare occasions where a Kotick train episode is planned within like 15 minutes that's not entirely true because surely welcomed it again surely whoo guests from last Friday's regularlyscheduled nothing nothing has ever regularly scheduled but somewhat consistently on Fridays I have been live streaming and we mostly surely but I'll say we since I was also here did a tutorial around working with d3.js for data visualization and it was completely my fault that I arrived so there was very little time I'm just checking the chat to make sure nobody is saying focus alert I will focus the camera I forgot to focus the camera so we're sought a soft focus I look nicer in some focus so we rushed through a lot of stuff and I felt like it wasn't fair surely and so here we are back surely generously had an extra little bit extra time today Shirley's here actually at ITP doing a fellowship working on a bunch of really exciting social media and see you're making all these like physical things yes we talked about that for a minute why focus the camera yes okay so I don't know how to talk about this without any visual aid oh actually I could have a visual aid right I could just open up a browser yeah which you have hidden away so it's on the dock is on the left side it's just do this look at all these things that showed up okay yeah like typing but oh just black ops not actually onscreen oh no it's fine it will be now in a second okay there it is so I'm I might be because usually I do data visualization in the web so it's very I'm very digital but I've been wanting to kind of broaden my horizons and get more into the physical world so I've been auditing two of the classes here and one has to do douwe news and sensors and the other one and the other one has to do with fabrication so I'm gene two projects one final project with the students I'm and it's going to be a physical data visualization of women in computing uhhuh it's really exciting this is the one with the laser cut yeah like no no this is the one that we're still prototyping so it's gonna be like an actual installation you walk through and there's gonna be hanging lights and it's it's going to be hanging like orbs and then the idea is that as you walk through the orbs each of them are represent a woman that had a great contribution in computing but and the thing is that most of them we don't know about most of them so at the beginning of the installation they're all going to start out really dim because they're they're not very well known um and as people go through they're invited to kind of like I'm seeing or kind of interact with their read more about the women and there's gonna be details in the orb and every time someone reads more about them they couldn't glow brighter and a little bit brighter and a little bit brighter and the hope is that by the end of the exhibit like all of them will be lit up a lot more beautiful yeah and then so as you walk through um yeah so there's a lot of like kind of data encoding into it so it's gonna be my first like kind of big data installation that like people can actually walk through so that's the one I'm in working on that's what this tote switch is for and that I was playing with because then when someone interacts with I'm so I don't know if you can see but yeah I'm like as that switch is being tilted um the LED lights up and so that's gonna be how we control like when someone interacts with the orbit that's how we use Suns that they're like interacting with it and so the one that you saw with the laser cut out so this is kind of the prototyping for that like reforms for the orbs yeah yeah he's like mysterious look she's so cool she is prolific inventor and cool and CTO of One Laptop Per child um but yeah and then the other one you saw is and this one this one right okay and this is just for fabrication homework where I wanted to and these are some of the women Nobel laureates and this is this is a prototype base book and the idea is to light the LEDs from the bottom are sorry like the crystals from the bottom and so this is kind of the latest iteration I was working on yesterday so like then I'm they're color coded by the category of their award and as and so I'm gonna put the crystals on top of the lights and then it's gonna glow the different colors this is great so it's so fun to see because you know I somewhat of I would say like an anomaly here but so many people at this program at ITP and ima work with physical computing and fabrication and building physical devices and making threedimensional objects that live in their work real world and I kind of fall back to my safe happy place of software which has its own problems and complexities but it's great to see I know that you have done so much work with data visualization on screen and the browser d3 that's what we're talking about that's we talked about of Friday we're talking about today so it's really I find it always exciting to see people move into I'd like to like break through that what could be scary like to and like start to make physical stuff but it's been such like a friendly supportive environment like I realized like how deeply I am in software so much still got like even the most obvious physical things I don't see like yes like earlier today I was talking to one of the residents and I was like oh I need to build in the switch and he's like no just unplug it and I'm like oh like I was sorry I was I was clicking like like a battery into an Arduino and I'm like oh now I should build a switch to like control on and off and he's like no you can just cool I am going to by the way I think I mentioned this but I'm wait I'm going to be waiting in two lasercutting myself sai is a student here and I are going to work on I have a it's going to arrive sometime this week a box of 250 train whistles and I'm gonna try to like laseretched the coding train send them out is like patreon but I'm not I think I'm not gonna use Patriot but it's a longer story that I will get to at another maybe I'll talk about more in this Friday's live a little membership gifts for people okay so let's move let's move on because we we will hopefully won't be super rushed today but we're will be here until about five o'clock so that's about 45 that's a half an hour okay so I'm gonna kind of let Shirley take the lead here let me at least open up what I what we'd made before and I will try to in my own words kind of recap what we did and then you can tell me if I kind of understood it correctly oh and then we will also take your questions and Peter in can you explain how to iterate over the film's again so that would and that has to do with kind of like the interrupter exit stuff what so nothing we need to answer that right now I'm just trying to pinpoint where so I feel like there's two parts you could be talking about one when we loop through the data itself to calculate and use the scales and but he's probably talking about the enter update exit part where we're iterating through and the kind of SVG oh yeah so we'll make the jump like what we what we coded somewhat step by step last time was how to make one flower based on one movie but then we really quickly I don't think we again it was surely very quickly just added some code and so yes let's try to take some time to unpack that and I also would love to show a couple of the projects that people made based on yeah yeah so I know there were so let's so let me first recap and I'm gonna try to spend less than two minutes doing this so the first thing that I learned from Shirley is that syntax for creating a path in SVG yeah and for move C for curve two there was also L for line two yes and then and then that's really what so that's what's happening here this petal path is like start here start at the top curve to the bottom and then curve again back to the top and so this is a very simplistic design and maybe surely we'll touch on how you might make that more beautiful or you could look at her actual film what's it called again film bent flowers project to see so that's we learned then we could actually put that on an HTML page by creating an SVG element and all this is happening in a observable notebook which is like the p5 web minute or in the sense that I'm coding in the browser but very different in that it's got cells that can be executed separately users require a bunch of different syntax things ok then we loaded the d3 library that's the primary library we're using in these code examples then we loaded a JSON file that has all this information about movies in particular there the year they were released their box office yeah the number of the ratings things like that a lot of metadata metadata by the way then what we did was use a nominal just like source make this discussion much shorter we use the d3 library so if I go up here and look at the data we can see here's the movie diehard and all of the data associated with that movie then we use the d3 library to parse out two pieces of data their rating and what was the number of votes again soon number of IMDB votes so basically the number of people that like rated them ok so and those pieces of data were used to design the flower yes and so though all this functionality that you're seeing like extend scale linear quantize all these are d3 builtin T 3 functions that perform common operations on data like remap it from this range to this range or you know inverted or multiply it by this or that kind of stuff and so we did that and once that was done there is now this sort of crucial piece of code which i think is kind of what you want to react splain them yes in this crucial piece of code after the data is parsed and oh and remap to all the appropriate range it takes the data and makes the flowers out of it through this process called enter update exit but we're only using enter for this particular exam yes yeah and we were talking about I think going through the enter update I'd say and then kind of talking about steps of maybe what people that are watching might be able to do to kind of like complete the price right um and so do you want to do the which one I think you should start with replating more slowly any of the bits you thought you Russia's had to rush through and you can do that on the whiteboard let me turn the whiteboard camera on and I will keep an eye on the chat yes that'd be great I think I would love any questions to do with the enter update actually and I think that is Peters first question yeah and Simon is giving us some information about details of SVG tags yeah and so why don't let me just make sure this works if I switch to here whoops no that's the wrong button okay the audio should be back that was my fault so why I'm gonna alright I think I might know what's going on here this sound should be back and hopefully the white birds gonna be back in a second people can still hear me okay video capture device existing weird something happened create new okay everybody I realized that's the green screen that's no signal that's the computer this should be the whiteboard there we go we're back in business say I don't know what happened there so can say on something for a second Shirley hello okay your mic is good so now we're we're back in business so you can explain go back to whatever discussion if you wanted to have with the viewers and I will keep an eye on the chat okay sue we did this last Friday where I like super intensely rushed through inter update exit and that was the kind of the one that I wanted to go over and then if we have more questions about other parts of what we went over on Friday I would love to answer that too and but I'm gonna start with this and then hopefully like questions will come in as we're doing this and so what I wanted to do is kind of give a more concrete example of like um something that you might actually do when you're working with data are working with d3 and data um and so let's make this like hypothetical data set of I'm just gonna start with three so let's just say I want to draw like three circles and my and I want to like map my data to that so this is my data and let's see I'm just making things up right now let's see so my data is an array of three objects and each object has an ID and a radius number and so let's say that this is our SVG what our especially currently looks like and so we talked about last week about how and what d3 goes and does when we say d3 next and we always have to go like the SVG and then when we say Dotson liked all and let's saying that this time we're trying to draw circles and some we're gonna select all circles that are in the SVG and right now what we said last week is there's nothing that exists in the SVG and so that would return an empty selection and then the three kind of most common things that you see in d3 or that you saw in d3 I think in version 4 and before was this kind of pattern called data enter append and actually I think in version 5 or a newer version I think we now have a different it's a it's a different method and I'll cover this first and then I'll talk about the new method and because it's conceptually still the same the new method just makes the code part easier and and so we'll pass in let me just I always name is data and then I regret it and so we have values let me just call it vine use and we're gonna pass in values and this is the part that I kind of wanted to explain in more detail which is I'm in d3 dot data this method actually and can take in a potential second argument and we call that the key function and so I'm what the key function I'm if anybody's ever used react or view and that's probably really familiar to you because every time you try to render an array of something like they'll scream at you and be like for best practices enter a key function and and so that's the same concept but let me do this first and we'll say whatever M is so let me do this and then clean it and just watch out that actually the camera only gets to about here okay thank you um so I'm gonna stop this right here and I'm gonna kind of and go back to here and say and I'm gonna try and color code it so let me say that I'm my values here so like my actual data that I'm trying to bind are and this kind of like one five this ID is 1 and radius is 5 and then I'm trying to find you know ideas and radius is 10 350 and so when d3 sees that is thought data what it's doing underneath the hood is it's going to take the bat this array of values in it and when you pass in data and it has to be an array or else you're going to get an error and and d3 is saying okay let's loop through each of these identify what the key is so this is where it's like I'm looping through each of the elements in the data and identifying what the key is so it's saying okay this key is one the key is to keys three and then they will look in the Dom and they will say okay is there any elements that are existing in the Dom that our circle elements um that have the key ID one key ID two key ID three and I'll be like oh no there isn't any of those and so it will be like okay so the UM there will be an enter a selection you keep going and there will be an enter selection that d3 calculates and this this function calculates and it's saying oh I need to I'm trying to figure out then let me let me have like an actual like color coding of like okay so all concepts are going to be in blue all data are gonna be green and all SVG elements are red from now on so it's gonna be called an enter selection and this says that because there's none of those things that match like all that criteria existing in the Dom that means I need to go and create three circle elements I'm and we're gonna get into it yes yes so if if those did exist would it did would just like grab those elements and okay so enter you enter the enter but most typically is sort of the first thing that happens based on the data and if this and the stuff isn't there so it creates them creates the Dom elements what do you do so d3 does not do anything for you you have to create it so you have the option so let me actually okay keep going keep going I mean so let me rephrase what I set up a little bit so it data the method data will say you need to like we we need to create three Dom and three circle element being able to match the data so it like has this data structure if you like actually look at the Dom element and like it has all this like it had it just says and I have three placeholders if you ever want to go and create three Dom element so that the reason why I'm making this like really like that distinction is then the reason why you do dot enter is because you're telling deep three okay I understand that there is something in the enter selection and so please give me return me these three placeholders and then when we do dot append we're saying for each of these placeholders actually make me so when I do thought of hand this makes the Dom element yes and we had G in our example because we this is an example so that's simplified that's just making some circles but ours made a group that we then put a hole at your petals and things yes perfect so actually let me do this over here so this is this over here is the enter like it's same return many enter selection and is it making these Dom elements the circles with the ID that's here in the data yes ooh I'm actually you know won't be fun let's actually go into our what we created and let's inspect the elements and actually can you console.log every group I'm in the so let me just finish drawing this really quick so here what enter does is give you back three placeholders and what append does is actually create these three Dom elements in the three circle elements in the Dom with the data bound to it and and when you when you console.log will be able to see what that so when you say console.log right now the result of this whole process is stored in a variable called flowers yes console.log that object okay like this yeah I'm like there we go sorry everybody I'm like all my buttons are in different places console.log flowers so if I run this then if I look at the console these are them that's that's our data this is and so this is actually what d3 will return you and when saying is that it has 135 group elements and right and then the most I'm gonna do my code Vanna White okay so what the most important part of this so this is what like a Dom element looks great and what do three does is it kind of makes this oh yes the data in there that's the data so when people are like d3 binds the data like that's this is what they mean it actually like makes this little attribute or like call like underscore underscore data and then you can see this is this is the data we created here the pests sighs mumbles and the array of petals right okay and that's what we're gonna bout to use down here and so I think there was Peters question was like how did you loop through the film's and so what actually happens so actually do you want to come no yeah you're what actually happens is and when we do any of these don't adder or that style right what's happening under the hood is that d3 is applying this function that we passed in to every single one of those Dom element G over here yeah so yes every single one of these Dom element and in every one of these functions we can actually see that right there and that sorry I'm interrupting you in the transform and the way we actually see that in there was like a there's a property there that would have that's dis translate in it a trance oh yeah I think it was there under T so that part is not actually no that's that's that's a part of just like HTML and SVG and so like basically d3 is just abstracting some like Dom manipulations stuff for you and but in this function transform it's probably under the transform one that you found this is yes because heart is really big yeah yes I don't know if you want to get into this no no jump definitely do not I was my fault go on but I'm so it's and and this function what we're doing is we're getting the data this data per group element and then and then we're evaluating it and d3 is looping through it under the hood and applying whatever is being returned to each of those group elements and and so that's how deeply I'm that's how we use d3 to kind of apply data to each element so usually after you've seen this there's a doubter doubter doubter doubter oh sorry yeah usually after you see this set of code you'll see dadadadada under don't either so actually what an adder is short for attribute oh yes which is a HTML elements can yes it has attributes one of which is this like style and three okay so this is what happens when we do enter and then I when the try and talk about update and exit question so we only needed enter in our example because we were just like creating a visualization yeah so if it's going to change over time or something different it's gonna happen later it's gonna animate or maybe that's why we would need to add update yeah so if if it's a static visualization you only need enter yes it animates you need update that's not enemy be like just changes value it changes value yeah so let's let me just show that really quickly really quickly by you let me say that now that we've drawn okay so in here I wish I'd like on my computer right now and I can just like cut this out and like like this over here and putting here but one of these days I'm because this is recorded I'm just gonna erase this so we have we have yeah room yeah I saw somewhere in the chat I was like no don't you erase or something okay it's all being saved for until as long as the it's not the internet apocalypse you'll be able to find this material okay so then let's see now that we've like you know created all of this I'm let's say now for whatever reason we want to show the second state of data or a second set of data and let's say that in the second thing I'm you know we have we still have let's say I'm ID two are ten but let's say like we have actually you know what and let's say in the second state the rainiest actually goes up to 20 and then let's say we have a new thing um and I'm gonna call it ID 4 and this one is gonna have radius of 30 I am making all of this up so just just to understand that for a second the idea here is that if these are all tied to circles this is now in a way a new value for a existing circle and this is now a new circle because the idea is the key for each piece of data yes so let's yeah exactly so let's go through that together and so I'm gonna say you know this was okay let me now I'm trying to decide how I want to go about this let's still go use these no I'll draw anyone so we have we now have three circles and this is I'm just only gonna draw the ID this is ID one two and three and the radius is 5 10 15 this is the result after here after that yes thank you and then our new data okay our new data is ID 2 and radius 20 and ID for radius 30 so just like you said Dan do you want it do you want to do it well we would say we would say where do we have to say dot data again conceptually for us and so let's say that we want the very first add the order I usually do it is actually I exit first so you can exit after an enter actually you know I think you're right let's do it with the code ensue I'm gonna change I know but we needed that enter oh you don't have you just have update no enter I was so understanding with the enter that code we have is there only if we only need to enter we want to do all the call circles and then what I'm gonna do is first I'm gonna exit so this is concept I am now like getting completely I never used more than one color it's very amazing I should have actually I don't know things I get myself into the first step I want to do when I'm doing enter update exit the whole shebang is this part where I just tell d3 to do the calculate buying the data do the calculation then and what I do is I take circles that exit dot remove we would be this would happy happening like here so this okay I'm gonna make some more room for this circle thing so this will be on a new line right there yes yeah and I just wanted to it was okay I understood that this equals circles okay so okay so imagine that this is like in the guy okay um and so what's happening here is this is basically the like return value of data I'm and it's saying I'm and here another thing that that data would have done is say okay there's ID to ID for so this remains but these two need to go so these two are the exit selection and so I'm this we call the exit selection and it is the two circles with ID 1 & 3 because they're not here because they're not in the new data that we're trying to render but we're here values is is here but I don't see anywhere you refer to Val ok so very good point and you've caught me so technically speaking ok let me do this look that makes sense to me but how did it know to compare so oh you just said that oh you're just overwriting Davout the values changed yes it's kind of like isn't that the thing that react does or something it's just like something changed update stuff sorry you're catching me so I'm what I usually do is I put this whole enter like I put all of this code into a function and every time that you want to animate a new status set of data or you want to like somebody clicked on something you want to update the data you will then call them call that function and pass in the new values got it yeah ok sorry I was like trying to I get it again it totally makes sense so this is not an automatic process where this is always like looking at what the current values are it's a process by which you can sort of pull what's in the Dom and compare it to your data and update everything yeah so is that you need to do everything you need to do absolutely everything like reactant views and stuff like they're doing that's magically under p5 is like that as well you you have to draw nothing's gonna happen in p5 unless you're explicitly drawing yeah to me this feels like more automatic than peopIe but arguably it's the same idea actually and I think the difference is the mechanism by which things are drawn in p5 is this setup and draw function and here it's really about sort of starts more with the data and enter update exit the fundamental difference between d3 and p5 is that p5 defaults to canvas you set up and drop you somehow sense because then like you set up the canvas and then you draw and then if you want to innovate you clear canvas redraw everything this is actually actually updating SVG elements yes because SVG elements will stay in the Dom and you need a way to be able to remove it or update it but I don't want to go too off the track here but my you in d3 you can also say use canvas instead of SVG and but your and your code doesn't have to change or it changes a little bit so actually the great thing is if you want to use canvas I don't think you need any of this code okay because with canvas like we said it's just about like clear draw clear draw and so with canvas what you might do like with canvas all you would do is in the same function that you're drawing instead of going through this whole hassle of a process and we would just pass in the new data clear the canvas just redraw the new data um and so you might be like why are we going through all this trouble because if you want to learn to you three every single example other than the one examples for canvas will have this whole pattern and it's really helpful to know what's going on yes Scotty okay could continue there's also a tangent about like SVG versus canvas and when you want to use which but that's a that's a whole tangent and but yeah so was I talking about oh okay so this exit this dot exit is basically telling d3 that I want to like please give me this exit selection which will include these two Dom elements and then this dot remove we will actually be that's the function that actually removes it from the dawn and so once we call this what's gonna happen to our SUV G is this gets delete it and this gets deleted so that's what the state looks like after this exit selection all right sorry after this code is executed so ID number four is not added because the exit is only forgiving you what's missing and removing and am I gonna guess correctly that update will add number four very close very close and dirt we need another enter yes Oh cuz we just put exit before enter yes oh that's you didn't actually we're not actually getting rid of enter and replacing with update yeah we're just we needed to add exit first yes who could you do them in any order cuz you're kind of setting up or it's important to do exit because here it says enter update exit so that's kind of what I was imagining over the years I'm like developed this order because and I reasoned it out once I'm or a few times and now I'll have to talk it through yeah okay but enter is gonna get us the missing one okay yeah there's a reason for it and I don't remember off the top of my head and but yeah so what we want to do and then this is where you can say length dot attribute like you can set your attributes and so what this does is like you guessed it will say okay in this SVG what's missing is the for and so we're gonna go and create oh yeah is still ten update we'll change that to 20 so exits for removing enter is for adding and update is for existing things with change data I love I love doing this actually because I always feel like I'm not like explain you know I don't know any of this stuff I I like I've tinkered with d3 but I'm just in that that that place you know you've been there everybody watching been there where you like don't know the thing but you found some example yes you just like move some stuff around and then you kind of got something and you move on like p5 I feel like I know that inner mechanics of how things work so I can go a little deeper but this is completely new to me I also a hundred percent agree with everybody that's like canvas mp5 are easier to grok right cause I'm like you don't have to worry about like persisting Dom element removing them updating them and like all you have to worry about is cleared wrong cleared wrong mm and so like I think I honestly feel like p5 and canvas is the more fun one but like with um but like with d3 well so with indeed we can deal with HTML elements SVG elements canvas but you know I I think that's always important that people get into this trap of like oh should I be using this one or this one which one's better this one's better this one is no good I like my thing instead all of these libraries it's not a zerosum game they all are tools that have their own value and like you might say like oh hi I've never programmed before oh why don't you take a look at p5 or hi I program in JavaScript I have this giant data set I want to visualize SVG I feel like oh why did you take a look at t3 yeah so it's not I think we can fall into that trap of like I have to like prove that the one that I like is the one that usually yeah like I don't these are all like you said like they're all tools yes use them where they make sense yes okay okay so the one last part and this is gonna be oh and then what I have to do is I have to remember this enter selection and here in this in this variable and this is the part that's going to be get a little bit weird if it hasn't already Dan and I'm realizing that I'm running out of space wish me luck I'm gonna gonna be over here I'm gonna just do this third part over here and so this is kind of going to be the update step and what I'm doing here is saying enter dot merge circles dot adder and whatever attributes but I've never said adder before in my whole life and you think I at Furtick you like what is this header no but that's probably a thing that's a way to say that it's a dr so this is probably that there's a lot of weird things and this is probably the weirdest one so what this is saying is I have my enter selection which was this for and I'm dog data this actually also returns you the update selection which is this too and so I'm saying go and give me this enter selection of for merge the selection with this update selection of two and then set the attributes whatever attributes I need in this case what I want is to set the attribute radius and do and then you know I want to use the DAR and this would be that would be here also right so the reason why I have this is because you don't so here it doesn't apply to us because I'm okay the best way to describe it is if you have attributes you want to set that will never change do right here so maybe I actually my fills red got it so that means that every time I create it can never update it will it will never I this attribute will never be updated and so I'll just do it on creation just because just because that's much more efficient you can you can put this down here and the same thing will happen but like I mean you just don't need to and I'll put any attributes that will that are data dependent off of this thing like chained off of this thing and so now that we have this one line this radius will become 20 and this is this is the code for enter update exit so I have an interesting question here so enter that's exactly to this function called enter exit maps exactly this function called exit but update its there's this onesie called merge so there is no actual function called update the process of updating is merging the existing circles with the new data so it's called merge is that kind of yeah so basically the update selection you can think of it as like and I think of the update selection as like whatever it is existing and then needs to be kept but yeah honestly it's it's a it's a little bit it's a little bit that one's a little bit weird of a one and so now that we've gone through all of this pain I'm let me show you the easier way to do it because I think I have this here so I just found over here this notebook for always is from 2012 so it must not be oh this is like it's got some examples of like enter we can see this in track merge they sure like that but what I was looking for was that somebody was telling me there's a new thing called joint go back to that go back to that and then go up and so this is basically I'm well actually that's not that's not even really this is only this is from like seven years ago like my Google search was a little off wait so the thing I wanted to show you is what someone leads yes that's what I was looking for it's called joy yeah data join so it's selection I'll join you try the d3 selection that's what else and then do not find dot join selection not join yeah so yeah I'll let you stand over here you can point it over there people will be able to follow it more easily yeah so this stop join I think came out in a newer version of d3 and where it just abstracts away all of the pain that we went through and we went through this so that you can understand how it works by just do this so join is kind of like there's gonna be new stuff there's gonna be stuff that's gone there's gonna be stuff that was there but the you values changed joins gonna like account for on and update the Dom elements if you want like specific things to happen like if you still know you can you have these callback functions yeah do you like all the pain we just went through yeah no this do you like this is good because I you know it's it's Internet I kind of to me I have like encountered similar things like this like you can jump to use a weight and a sink in new fancy JavaScript it's not that new but like without looking back at what all this sort of like gobbledygook of promises are confusing what's going on so this to me is a little bit similar like yes we could have started with just this join but at least for me and in having seen d3 code before having this having this more sort of like full explanation of it now again it's like the reward you get your dessert yeah joy so I actually personally have never used before how new is this I'm I think soo a disclaimer I stopped using enter update exit period last March um when I started using view because reactive view again do all of this underneath the hood and so the way I actually like to Deb and it makes me faster developer is I use d3 to do all of that data translation so last week when we did all of those scales I use d3 for that I use d3 to like calculate positions for me and like like XY positions SVG paths and and then when I actually need to go render to the Dom I use view so when I stopped using enter update exit so it must happen between last March and now so I personally never used it but I think if you don't want to use like if you only want to use d3 to draw um and do everything then I highly recommend checking out the data join somebody harp eat in the chat suggested looking at this let's see if this this particular example which explains enter update exit is this the one you're looking at I don't miss block yeah cool so thank you okay I can add a link to this in the video's description as well I wanted to show two things I don't know if you saw these but two people created let's start with this one actually so based on Friday stream two people made their own versions of this this one is by Stefan Berg let me open it in a new window and we can see here film flowers based on the original so one thing I love about observable is how you can annotate with markdown so it's really nice to be able to do that I mean and and you can see the code is so much nicer yeah so these are beautiful you know it's something about also the with these kinds of projects the repetition and the arrangement of all the different flowers is really what kind of brings out the visual for me I feel like I had as soon was working on a project and it was like a sort of beautiful pattern but as soon as you could see like a hundred variations of them all in a grid you got other sense of what that pattern is like so that's really nice so this looks like pretty similar to what we did but just with a bit more thoughtfulness in terms of color and and the ranges but the other one that somebody made which will go here I'm Anthony McAteer or spectral flame I recognize that name from YouTube chat created something very similar but with a totally different data so let's look at this so this is popularity and contribution flowers of coding geometers so I have a playlist know what number I'm on 150 something there's like videos of like a coding challenge so they'll be I'm actually we could look at the data here whether they'll be like a star field a snake game all these different things so I guess what's interesting is to think about what first of all what is it what does it mean for something to be popular I suppose that's tied to maybe the number of views is that the right metric for popularity interesting question height of the background size of our items such as views the number of petals is how many contributions and contributions is a thing that if you go on to the coding train website and go to like coding challenges I'm pretty sure I think that 10 print 1 this has the most contributions so if I go to here you can see these are all like versions that people made after watching this video and seeing it's just this is the example of the pattern so this is like I like we were talking about I wanna make sure linear does this is like how would you're making an example like how far do you go with it like I you know do you want you add all the features do you make it beautiful or you take sort of leave stuff for the person who's going to receive the example to build on top of so it's hard to find that line but let's so let's take a look at this so if we look at this we can see here's all the data I'm and then here's the text is there and this I guess this is just the number of the number of what challenge it is that's the name of the challenge and then this what this down here and like what the curve because because there's a there's a difference in how sorry how long the arc is right Oh spectra is that spectral piano is in the chat actually clock has the most oh there he's there a little bit behind okay so you can ask your questions we'll get them yes I'm wondering sue there was wait there was popularity and that was the size and then the description up here says wait you could you could if you go down if you could just do this to hide it Oh God so it says views is size and height of the background number of petals is the number of contributions okay so maybe this is also tied to views maybe that's what so about the background yeah it makes sense because you can see this one over there has three petals in a much smaller arc whereas that snake game has a lot of petals at a much larger arc the background curve is just the views yeah got it okay cool I like I love also that you did this which is you can do this I'm very similar to in Illustrator you can do I'm sorry sorry we were you this one okay okay okay so this this text that um curves around the way you can do that is an SVG pad and then you can draw like a semicircle with like an SVG arc or some or a path arc um and then um you can say I want to have the text along it so that's really cool and and I think the same thing probably happened at the bottom because you can see like the 31 and 32 point one there like following an arch so that's super cool and I also really love the different like you went above and beyond this is so awesome like look at the different like petal shapes there's one here there's this one that I think is a little bit so there's you know 1234 is different cuz cuz 35.2 is what we started with and then 31 is different and then the the traveling salesperson one is different yeah so there's 30 is different 31 is a different pedal the one down here's a different pedal the one traveling salesperson is a different cuddle yeah this is really awesome so I'm curious also spectral piano like so from the this is all in a playlist so certainly with the YouTube API which I have actually never investigated really in a video I should definitely do that you could get a JSON file that has all the videos in a playlist their name I presumably the number of views but the contributions is something that's on the coding train website which is separate from YouTube I wonder if that was done by scraping like the coding train github or just manually entered that's kind of an interesting so that's what's also I think what may not be so obvious to the viewer here is there's like a multiple levels this is not all information that's part of so that's great to see have other peb you done this film flowers example in different other workshops and things that people projects with their own data in a similar way I have no actually it's cool because I've gotten people that cuz I released it three and a half years ago and so people have done it with different like like different data sets and different visuals like there was someone that did I think every episode of Gilmore Girls I feel like instead of flowers it was toasters I think it was and like it was toast and different like jams or something and they were like you know it was inspired by her filament flowers there was like some other people that did like butterflies or something like that and then in the workshops I have held I'm like people have they didn't use a different data set but I'm the petals that they've done are like really beautiful yeah like we were staying at the I think the shangrila I'm for one of the workshops and one of the students actually used the sangre lot like he like redid the shangrila logo shangrila logo and use that as the pedal oh and that was like I also thought you were on another his hey week was reminding me that we're well it's 505 okay I built in a little extra buffer of my cell phone we're gonna finish up in the next five minutes so if there are other questions we can try to answer one or two but I wanted to mention because you were on nothing is it a twitch stream that's Jason learn with Jason yeah did you use you went through so like a kind of similar project on that event was something totally different he also wanted to do something with films likes film flowers um and but for him what we did was we got his YouTube data and we are making holy buckets okay oh wait oh is it still ongoing yeah so we are like part two now I don't know I don't there we go pardon yeah yeah so we're still making the bus ooh that one is that we went and yeah so we design a whole buggy and we've like assigned different part and like data to different parts of the buggy and because he has an inside joke with his stream chant where instead of swearing he says holy buckets got it this looks like a bucket with wings and halo and like yeah it's very cute yeah so I so I'm I just pulled up I think what's the archive on YouTube but I believe that the the streams happen on Twitch actually I was I was I should look more at this I've been noticing that because I do most of this live streaming by myself I haven't really thought about how it would too much about how to do something with more than one person and I've noticed like people have nice setups that involve like you know a picture and picture and multiple screens and so anyway this has been great having you here is like a guest thank you for having I've had guests but thank you for going with the awkwardness of like this whiteboard where's table on everything I'm looking to see if there's any last questions Thank You Kate we c'mon for posting links in Twitch and then you used to stream like on your own Chad should I not be mentioning this you ever thinking of doing that again no I wanna do it next summer after life settles down yes okay good so you'll have to let bit I mean we'll stay in touch of course but you'll definitely have to let me know so I can alert the coding trained audience to chew and so we didn't make any changes to this code but hopefully now that we had Shirley back to more slowly talk through all of this wonderful stuff that this helps you understand some of it you still can if you would like make a project based on this example yeah yes gif it it's really had a few different exercise ideas because I think to kind of fully finish it um first thing would be um put the titles in so you can do that by creating a text within each group like a text element within each group and put in the titles of every movie on the flower and then we can also do another mapping and the mapping would be I'm the John rrah the colors and then the third thing would be a map I'm what was it Oh different petal shapes for different parental guidance readings if you want to go through the rest of the exercise and all of that is in all of those features are in the version of the project that's on your website here yeah so there you go back up the look I'm a little bit so this is yeah the parental guidance reading yeah guidance reading and the the colors so those two are the last little bit if you want to go through it and like kind of finish the like try some other scales and clean up the yeah so I mean so you know you saw my kind of crude version that I hacked together and surely helped me with so that's kind of like the raw guts of everything you can see a much more polished version with more thoughtfulness and ideas about different designs so I think on one hand what you can do is exercise and is try to match some of this by adding color and shapes and more pieces of data but you could also create or get creative and make your own or I you know you could also like take the same visual motif but connected to a different data source yeah so many possibilities so maybe what we'll do we'll see how this goes but for now you if you make something you can the two places you could share it would be the comments of this video or the previous video you can also share it probably will see it more quickly or easily if you share it on Twitter so we have at Schiffman as me but more importantly at sxyw you yes so let's just we sxyw you Twitter and pull up Shirley's Twitter page here and so oh look there we are so at Shirley sxyw on Twitter and then I've been trying to what we'll also do is that create a page so now I'm looking for somewhere here there's a cuz it's not in this menu yet but there is a page for guests tutorials how the website works but there'll be a big I'll make a page on the website where people can also and it'll show up as a list like you know if I go to this one you can see the gears like people's versions they made them so we'll make a page like this that might take a few days violet is the they are the github community manager to help make that page so I'll be in touch with violet about that I'll put that together yeah well people we did we've been answering questions all okay okay so oh well okay we can ask we can ask one question and can't really see it I'm curious what she referring to Shirley thinks of the coal lots visualization I don't think so that was one of my more so I started this new series embarrassed called coding and coding in the Cabana as I'm making these videos at home I have a little garden and so this is a particular visualization of a mathematical number sequence called the coal Lots conjecture okay and it produces a pattern that looks like if the code still works what did I do to this code that it's like now it's decided to crash the browser oh there we go this takes a while to render it makes this pattern what's crazy about this is this is the math for this number sequence you take any number and if it's even the next number is itself divided by two or if it's odd you multiply it by 3 add 1 and divide that by 2 and it's a famous conjecture in mathematics because it's not prove it's not proved but any the conjectures that any number you start with you'll eventually that sequence will end up at 1 so and then this is a visualization of a variety of the paths of all these numbers based on even and odd making left or right turns and you get this like plant like structure this is no invention by any means of mine and most of the stuff that I did is based entirely on this numberphile video which about the koloff's conjecture and you can see it here and there's actually somebody I had I bought this book I don't have it here but there's somebody made a like a coloring book of all these like math algorithms it's wonderful anyway so so that was the one question you think of us it's really beautiful I should say damn that like um it's if I really think really deeply about it this is kind of really amazingly miraculous because I'm me getting into generative visualizations and generative data art is a lot thanks to your nature of cool okay and there was like a whole project I did where are you like washed your Perlin noise and that's hot and I like I like refer to your like fractal tree algorithm that does music San Francisco yeah that was like basically all like a majority of the visuals in there is based on like what you've taught so if I take a moment and like think about it really I need to I do want to say though actually is there a like a recent conference talk that has a video online of you showing some of these projects oh but people could just go to your website but here's not that outdated yeah no I know but I was just thinking like oh cuz you gave a presentation here about some of these projects that people got to see so someone seeing these projects you talk them through is really nice so yeah so anybody should check out the project I think that Shirley was referring to or that I was referring to just now is this one called send me love from SFMOMA so if you haven't already thank you so much visit Charlie's website thank you too should never know we might just come back tomorrow for like another half an hour you're like oh wait a second one more thing but we'll definitely will definitely continue I look forward to hearing from people in the audience and things that you make thank you for LOM l0m yeah so definitely I'm but you should stay tuned you don't need me to bring Shirley on the Internet to you if you wait till maybe this summer as life settles down you might be able to find Shirley live streaming on Twitch awesome okay so now I'm really overstayed my I used up all my buffer so I'm gonna switch this to put this music on and switch to the wallpaper goodbye everyone thank you so much for tuning in
