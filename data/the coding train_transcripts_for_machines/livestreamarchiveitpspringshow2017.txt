hello here we are people are walking into me I'm live in front of Tisch School of the Arts New York University right here on Broadway in New York City hello everyone this is a special edition livestream where it's the ITP show ITP is a twoyear master's program where I teach full time and all the students are showing their work the show actually doesn't officially start till for about an hour but I'm going to just roam around with this camera and this microphone if this is starting now can you guys hear me okay is the sound okay I can see a chat that's going by so assuming that that chat works also be able to pass your questions around so I'm going to flip the camera so that it's facing outward and not facing on me and I'm going to go walk around oh there we go okay oh no no no we've got a slight issue okay hold on we've got an issue the cable for this microphone Hey the cable for this microphone is now go ahead okay the cable for this microphone is now in my way in the in the camera so hold on do you guys see this I meant to take this up here that should be good okay here we are I'm now entering the ITP show zone and we're going to find some projects we're gonna go in we're going to go into this funhouse in a second let's see there we go we're going to go into this funhouse in a second and see what's in there okay we'll come back to you Jared let's see where we are over here well nobody's really at their projects yet I'm gonna have to come back I see you guys can't see that I'm actually dancing and attempting to make this motion this is a Kinect here it appears up I see somebody upstairs now that's the view from upstairs there Stephanie hello I'm gonna try to dance again good thing I have this gimbal stabilizer alright let's let's come over and find out about this funhouse you should take your take her time will interview you for a second ok ah this camera this hold on I gotta practice with this camera thing here ok I think this is better ok hello so can you tell me your name Jared Friedman this is geode number one 1/2 it's a giant inside a disco ball that you can go inside and play around with the lights how long did it take to build this whole thing uh too long it was a couple months from starting the designs to having the finished thing but I'm actually unaware of which the lens I'm supposed to be looking at which it's just just it just look in general right about it right look sorry are you look at me I will look at you in some sort of fancy interviewing style like thing I have no idea what I'm doing by the way great I have no idea what I'm doing either there are some how 274 people watching right now if you can believe that utterly terrifying and absolutely wonderful can everybody hear ok still I'm seeing lots of lots of high and hey in the chat chat messages scrolling around okay should I go inside ok we're gonna attempt to go inside this with this camera I'm taking off my shoes I wonder I wonder ok let's see no I think I'm gonna be ok I might even hand this to you on my way out though we're going inside we are now inside the geodesic dome okay wow this is truly amazing can you hear the crazy echo oh yeah you probably don't see this in nice full beautiful quality oops sorry ah gimble I need to recalibrate this gimbal stabilizer thing there we go oh whoa so people are asking how do you find out the details about a particular project and what I'll do is once this video is published I will provide links to information about all these projects yeah I should have given a warning I guess although if you're watching a video on YouTube maybe you don't need a warning this is really something inter inter interactive I'll ask the question when we get out people are asking if this is interactive I think it's a preprogrammed sequence as ended oh it started again okay you see the mic right okay it's a quite warm in here actually I'm going to try to attempt to leave now oh let me show you guys where the exit is the back up here you can see maybe we're going to find out oh this cable keeps going in front of the camera this is the issue I'm going to just take it I'm gonna untape it hold on I'm having a separate technical issues nothing to do with you yeah this is better okay so I'm going to now hand jarred the camera I just hold it from here yeah yeah that's good and then you can take this mic okay put my shoes back on this is me but that was really intense I've been in there before them it's getting a swarm in there it's getting very warm yeah it's the lights are people were asking if it's interactive and it is someone it's responsive I think it's better than interactive so if you reach out towards the lights they did more brighten but you have to get sort of close to them phenomenal interaction is just to be thank you and so what I'm going to do afterwards as I mad at this video get archived and I'm going to try to put links to it it's not really working to my liking okay ah there we go I think we're good now okay it's what it's supposed to be yeah okay can we take a look at this project Rachelle II okay so I'm gonna interview you first about it so hello so tell me your name and what your project my name is Rachelle II and my project is called an Amelia consult oh it's a gesture based performance piece where human beings wearing masks animal masks move their hands frantically to generate music and how does it like gee so do you it's a bit for a performance yes yes it's a performance piece today it's going to happen at 500 and 730 p.m. and there'll be one before five okay so maybe if we are still if I'm still doing this at five I should come back down yes or if there's enough audience I can do an impromptu I hear the whistling happening okay we're gonna go for gonna go to the whistling all right I hear something crazy I've been happening in the window over here so we're gonna go over here and I'm not sure what's going on but something is happening can you by any chance 6wu can you explain what's going on your name I'm Jason Beck so this is CNC assisted music so we have can control the machine going X Y & Z and I provide the air my accompaniment provides it chooses what notes to play and we just try to get through without me passing out what tells what's the longest performance you've done so far I sure wish I could time it out I went a little black in the middle of it so I can't honestly say but probably around six minutes is probably the longest I could probably last awesome thank you alright CNC assisted music Wow hey how are you this is I'm live streaming right now another bout of insanity a so will you just move the mouse there you can make it let's say make it to be one if v1 is going to be this one right here alright okay so it's going to go and move there and go down into it okay then you can choose the next one so what you have control over is how long it's going to be in that position okay and how far you want it to travel each of these notes have different size pipe so they create slightly different pitch all of them super annoying okay okay that's how we're going to work alright in my pet my job is just not the pass out I'm going to put on headphones they don't do anything other than make me look cool okay okay we good oh my god we're gonna watch a little bit more and then I'll move on to another project okay we're gonna move on now thank you let's see what else I think we're gonna go upstairs oh there's an elevator do I dare go in the elevator I don't think so I'm gonna take the stairs I'm afraid to go in an elevator with a lot of people this I'm going up the stairs oh no I do actually yes but I oh yeah well here to the stairs I'm now walking up the stairs this is riveting I don't I don't know if I should narrate this or just let it be a nice silent walk up the stairs how steady by the way up poor connection so one thing is there's probably not the best WiFi here in the stairwell we're going to we're going to the fourth floor what is this oh my god more flights that go okay I'm not so sure this gimbal thing is really worth it because this stuff attached to it which i think is really messing it up I probably need to put the counterweight on to go this way come on let's do this there we go uh here we go that's better okay we're we'll be going inside in just a moment you have your idea you don't have your idea my idea to get in the door okay now we're inside okay let's find some other stuff to look at is this thing on it is here's the wooden mirror by Danny Rosen this is not a current ITP show project but this is a has been here for almost 20 years now this is the new version of it it's actually what it runs with a Kinect which you can see up at the top you can see my reflection here right I'm that's me I'm going to stand back a poor connection and I can move to the right and to the left to the left and to the right okay now that I've had a chance to catch my breath from walking up the stairs all right here we are I'm live who wants to show we look at some projects so we have our fortune told first okay we're gonna have our fortune told down hold on I'm really having trouble with this thing that's supposed to stabilize the camera but you know I think need to recalibrate it but it does keep it stable alright alright so tell me and tell me about your project my name is Paul SEO juice and this is a project called divine pixels and it's a series of experiments that takes ancient fortunetelling rituals and makes them contemporary by infusing different aspects of our digital culture into them that's my project cool so what can I have my fortune told what do I have to do so we will I'll shuffle the cards for you since you're holding all this stuff and then we're just gonna you're gonna so this is aa reddit tarot cards um that we're gonna be reading on you you made you made these I mean I made yeah not the process but I made the rocks and this and this no but the tarot cards you redditor cards don't exist that's your own adventure yes that's mine and do you want do you want to pour Kartik a pool one couple one I think it's for it to be legitimate I have to be so this is just for today how today's gonna go okay you got for us so basically you're gonna have a great day filled with love and excitement and lots of fluffy puppy kisses perfect that's just what I was hoping for that is your fortune for two days you have emoji runes so these are rocks that have emojis edge attend to them and then there's two different projects here one is you reading your fortune based on the maps of your hand and the other one is reading your fortune based on your Instagram so that's it so I can cool oh the Instagram yeah my Instagram though is private yes sir I can do mine if you want yes sure so you would what you would do is you basically you would type in your handle and then you would just hit submit and then it posts the latest image from your Instagram that uses one of the seven most popular hashtags it extracts the three main dominant colors and based on those colors it chooses words and it generates your fortune awesome and how does it generate the text based on the words and then I'm using a different Cup different corpus and I'm doing a Markov chain and it's and it's kind of generating this fantastic that's the project okay thank you I was looking at the iPad when you wait I really gotten the worst camera operator I'm now develop discovering okay all right Michelle can you tell me about your name even I just said it and your project my name is Michelle and my project is called hidden in plain sight it is an installation that shares the stories of New York Street vendors through interacted 3d printed sculptures all the vendors in their cards I'm going to try now I think to get a look at the at the different sculptures can you tell me about them as I sew so this is a series of three portraits this is Danny this is his card this is Tito also known as the dosa man from Washington Square Park might recognize him and this is Ana she the name of a woman from Ecuador you were too fast my name is Ana she's an Ecuadorian woman from from who sells her family's in Queens and the idea of the project is to share all the stories behind the street food of New York that we don't usually get to know and understand because we these are people who are part of our daily life but at the same time who we don't know much about and it's a community of immigrants of people who come from all over the world and I I believe that one of the reasons that Street food in New York is so great is because it's so diverse and it's made by people who come from all over the place so yeah so I have the 3d printed sculptures and then you can press the button in your okay so in their own voices and see them okay I'm gonna try to press the button here okay thank you oh wow look at that right unfortunately lighting wise doesn't really show up but oh there we go if I get a little closer so it's projection mapped onto the sculpture so the visuals changed as the sari and hold and have your subjects been here to see your projects this is my thesis project here ATP and this guy came to my thesis presentation and he brought food for everyone who was here he brought vegan samosas or the whole crowd awesome wonderful thank you so much okay okay all right let's come over here now I'm gonna get I need just I think by the way I'm gonna need to do something about this camera but here we go okay so tell me your name and about your project my name is sebastian morales and i product is called this digital consequences it's a piece that exists both yes physically but also online on facebook later today we're going to go live on facebook and people can join the stream and just by say like we're love they can control the machine i like we move to the left i love we move to the right and when the time runs out the hammer will fall so people might have a chance to decide if it's nice to play in this case or or not so this is what we're seeing over here is live on facebook right now it is not yet live it will your live around six o'clock today and people will have a chance to interact with it for about an hour before time is time runs out and the hammer drops awesome so at what time what time will the hammer drop around seven seven okay that plate is either going to be in one piece or in many pieces yes for for the Internet to decide and what happened yesterday how many people how many plates did you have yesterday or attacked yesterday we only did it once and tragically the plate did smash okay awesome I will have to check back again later thank you so I'm sort of feeling like this gimbal thing that I'm using is not doing much to stabilize the camera does anybody have any feedback as to if the camera seemed obviously my camera work and looking at the projects is terrible but as I walk around is it somewhat smooth or is it pretty jittery oh it seems stable okay so I'm not doing as badly as I think that I am okay great it looks great okay okay I'm gonna come up hello wait hold on I have poor connection so I'm gonna see if the WiFi will kick in over here and then maybe we can look at your project a very bad connection pointing it down it might be I am pointing it down okay let me see if poor connection oh let me see sometimes if I back up I'm sure it's all yeah it's all pixelated for everybody right all right let's let's see if we can get the connection back I'm trying to get the whole let's say I'm walking around let's ah unfortunately right now I have a poor kid okay and four time I I'm waiting for the WiFi to come back right now it's telling me poor connection people are watching they will hear you actually although not right the microphone pointed at myself is the WiFi working house how's it looking everybody uh it's good now okay people are telling me it's good now okay so tell me your name and about this wonderful project well my name is Rina thank you thank you guys and this is my project captive audience thank you thank you it was inspired by Donald Trump obviously yeah they got it and how he would brag about how audiences would give him standing ovations and I thought I want a standing ovation I want to point this applause so I made little hands to clap for me whenever I said anything and these little hands they love me and they love you they love everyone this is so awesome so how does it how does it know does it look for when you've paused in your speech and clapping for when I pause whether it's dramatic or when it's absurd ental they will clap they will clap awesome okay I'm gonna come around what people don't see who are watching is that you can also see a version of this right here on this giant television screen so she's being broadcast from her station to right here Oh Oh the WiFi came back I'm gonna try to walk over here now thank you maybe we could come look at this projects here okay uh Oh a I'm not seeing poor connection so let's give this a try you are a little backlit from the window but that's okay we can see we can see you can you tell me your name and about your project um my name is Lindsay Daniels and my project is called route commute um I started recording a lot of videos of my train commute because my train is above ground so you get lots of nice videos of like the skyline um but then my way of putting it back underground was to project it underneath my plants and then kind of thinking about how what you do above ground affects what goes on underneath all of these plants have sensors in them so when you touch them you will slow down the commute or you can stop it entirely and the only way to bring it back is if you leave them alone and then it will eventually there we go turn all turn back on and then also they have there's a rain sensor in here so that when you water them all the videos actually switch over to times when it was raining on the tree so it's just an interesting way for me to look at the relationship between the two and play with how does one affect the other awesome and where where'd you get the plants where did I get in the plants well this one is my friends plant from her bathroom window the other three are mine and usually I buy my plants at the hardware store because that's where they're affordable yeah awesome it's we should have more plants at ITP and more plants and projects I we have so many plates wonderful great job thank you okay we're gonna keep going here what's that oh is it how behind is it okay we're going to walk around here apparently I'm actually this we're this is a caught in the plant so we have some sort of like recursion going on here here's the live stream right now so it's at some point there we go we'll have infinite windows etc etc okay thanks alright now we're going to go into the abyss here and see what other projects we can find here we go I've got poor connection hopefully hopefully it'll start took a very bad connection very bad connection I'm gonna I'm gonna say a prayer to the WiFi gods eight oh one one one one one G BBB BBB way to 1 1 1 1 G bbbbb left home with 1gb BBB BBB this doesn't seem to be working is there another sort of thing I can try I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna walk around and hope that it comes back because I do want to look at this wonderful dragon all right let's see what we can find here still have very very bad connection I have to go somewhere where I get it hold on you up I'm trying to get the WiFi to return that right now nobody can see anything because apparently we have a very bad connection well yeah it's good now I'm told it's good now let's come over here okay hold on hold on hold on I'm really bad at camerawork I'm learned and I'm trying okay now I'm gonna ask you some questions like what is your name and tell me about your project hi my name is Angela Peroni and my project is the Museum of funny ladies which is an interactive museum based on a piece of the history of women in comedy focusing on one of the Pioneer comedy writers from the 1970s so you get to take a peek into her world as one of the few women writing for comedy in the 70s so welcome to her office I was five and a half years to this job I call and I was going to do that the rest of my life it's fun to pursue she'll come people came into the office and we heard one you can hear anything my life you can see the different shows that she wrote so you're following the story arc of her career as a writer this television is amazing I grew up with the TV just like yes I I remember there was like a moment in time where we got a color TV and that was like a super exciting thing yeah Wow and here you are a couple years later we have so I have color TV on a gimbal lock with a microphone connected to the world I'm using my television phone it's very exciting and now did the Sybil did you talk to her about this project and she participated in then so she was actually here yesterday so Sybil is wonderful she responded to an email the beginning of my thesis process and was there the entire way all of these documents and images are from her all the interviews are from this project so they were only for the strategies for this project so she's been super wonderful and being part of this awesome thank you so much of course thank you yeah yeah this is great I don't have to be actually beat beyond anywhere up I have a good connection but I don't think the dragon is alive we're have to come back looks like there's some some the dragon is being fixed looks like there's some work happening we're gonna come over here to see what's happening here okay where are we gonna go next uhoh oh here we go can we look at your project okay so a first I'm going to try to attempt to do some sort of interview of you which won't really be an interview hold on wait hold on I'm having camera work problems there we go okay now okay so tell me your name and tell me about your project okay hi I'm Matt Sarah my project is called cat in a box because there's many cats in this box and it's a it's a educational book box for kids to learn about simple circuits and I'll walk you through it yeah okay so pretend you're not seeing all this and it would feel like this and we would start off with a story of why we need to help cat because cats a party animal and breaks all the lights and so after that we go into like plug the lights and the buttons inside and we fix the circuits and you can live to see what you're actually doing and then we basically continue doing this for the rest of the house which somebody already did this back in and so yeah yeah oops if some lights that apparently cannot be fixed oh you're going so fast go back to this page oh yeah this is another socket with two lights and so it's this one and so here you can you can see what the difference in the circuits is like a little activity you can do inside and the last is is the room with the fan so then and then once you help cadfix all the lights there's a switch in here that basically turns on all the lights in the house wonderful now this is the format of this the structure it's inspired by a particular can you tell me about that yeah it's a it's a Indian form of art called Kivar it's from Rajasthan which which is why this is wrong and what it is it's like this popup it says Papa Meets museum sort of book storytelling method and it's beautiful so this whole the physical format of this is inspired by that and what kind of what kind of user testing did you do like along the way of building this ticket to the New York oh there was user testing with people on the floor at IDP but then there was also one at the New York Hall of Science which was so fabulous because kids are amazing and yeah that was great it was like three hours of testing and seeing what they liked and what they didn't and what what like did you is there kind of a targeted age range that you found it kind of works the best way there so I mean I've mostly tested with kids from four to ten and it works great and sort of like six to ten ish and there's also a way they use it the younger kids prefer just doing the top and like making the lights turn on and stuff but the older kids actually go in read and then try to mess around and see how they can make it different I just I really love the storytelling aspect of this and you know sort of a rich tradition of popup books and you know a lot of interactive stuff always ends up adding a screen and the fact that you're really still immersed in the story and in the content of the book is really wonderful yep name is creative and talented ah got it my cat is called cat okay got it thank you so much okay let's see where can we go you want to tell me about your project okay we're coming over here tell me your name hi my name is aldo montoya Moraga and this is my project is a set of tools for creating art so this in particular is a web scraper so you give it a concept for example I'm going to give it box and it's going to open google chrome and it's going to download as many pictures as it can from that concept and then on top of each one of them is going to put a message that expresses disgust against it just going to put something like this is bad this is this this this shouldn't be happening and things like that so while this is going on let me show you the other ones this is a processing solution and it's a countdown to my death so according to the United Nations that should be devon at 72 so this is a countdown that updates every day and when I read 72 years so it's gonna say I should be dead by now this one is a generator of random nonsensical jokes so you have the usuals like knockknock jokes you have bar jobs on light bulb jokes and they're all Python libraries that you can install how many our teachers does it take to change a light bulb 577 because of geodesic domes yeah I like to do and that's good because I've tried it I'm very bad at that I don't can't come up with good joke so this will be this will be very useful yeah this is a it's very cool for like being in tandem and just coming around with very short jokes that you can just fire them fire one after each other what what kind of text generation algorithm is is playing a role here and how though it's based so there's an algorithm that knows which are the structures of these Joe cycles and they have blanks on them leather feel by words that come from a repositories of tons of work awesome yeah thank you so much okay alright where are we going now alright yes okay all right we're coming over to this project here so tell me your name and tell me about your project hi my name is Anitha and my project is a wearable piece that detects and reacts verbal microaggressions so can you explain what a microaggression is so microaggressions are way that sometimes are expressed either in gesture or verbs that they might insult someone even though we didn't have the intention of that so as an example if you call a fully grown female as a girl that's a way of diminishing her or if you could say something like girl bear or don't be such a [ __ ] which are things that we end up saying they're just way of saying that being a female speaker when it actually not so the goal of this piece is just trying to make reflections over why we say the things that we say awesome so what happens with I say something [ __ ] okay and then if you say one of you yeah yeah I'm gonna react I will say the one on the bottom don't be bossy yeah Oh so have you actually worn this no not yet the documentation I did outside and people were just like what is happening and then there was some funny comments or just emails just like yeah we should have this and yeah so that's probably the next step it's great I mean I saw this yesterday so I knew what was gonna do but I just like the first reveal of it is so wonderful I love it thank you I think is amazing okay all right we're gonna keep moving on here and see what we can find how's it going all right what can I find looks like some fun is having had over here can I ask you to explain what's going on here so first tell me your double your name middle I'm mitsue and my project here is the screaming Sun it's a noise making machine that is completely powered by light it also gets signal from light so what you see here is if I cover the solar panel there's nothing going on there's no power going into the system but the moment I give it light it kind of starts making some noise and you can you can so what she's doing right now is right now she's changing the color which changes the intensity of light and that also changes the frequency you can also change the intensity of light coming out of the phone and that also changes the intensity and it's fully analog so the phone isn't connected to it in any way I can take out the phone is still gonna work the same way and yeah so the light that we have here is connected this the light of course it can be any light source but I just brought in this really fancy light that changes colors and whatnot oh did you Matt where do you imagine this being used for a performance or more it's for interaction for users to play with it or what kind of where do you imagine this living or habitat play I mean I started this as an experiment but right but right now it kind of feels like it can be used for some sort of musical expression I guess so so yeah it's it's just it started off as an experiment but now we're all just having fun collaboratively having fun so yeah thanks okay can I ask you about your project okay so first tell me your name and about your project so my name is Jesse Horowitz and my project is the radius project and essentially what it is is a device that attempts to count the number of people in an area by detecting smart phones so what I use that for was to create this map you'll see here and the blue is data that I collected and the black and white is US census data and the reason I wanted to do this was I spent a lot of time working with US census data as a geography major in college and one issue is that you'll notice is that it's residentially focused so neighborhoods like Midtown will be considered empty when experientially we know that Midtown is a very dense neighborhood so I was interested in building this device to sort of get it what is the experience of population density where do we find that and how does that change over time in place so this is something that you could we're with you yeah ideally I've tried to design it so that it could fit in a pocket and be pretty portable so that it could be used over like a large study area basically so right now it's telling us that nearby there are what's the units like is that actually 13 people or is it so it would say certain generally there's about 63 people nearby but then it kind of breaks that down into even more specific categories so that the nearby units in the middle there would probably be more like in this room and sort of line of sight and then that faraway category is is anyone who's in like sort of WiFi connection distance which is about like 110 to 100 meters awesome cool thank you a great job whoops oh did I just turn my gimbal thing off hold on it has all these different settings and I really haven't figured out the magical one yet okay well let's let's see if we can go inside this house all right cannot Danielle can I come ask you about your project okay so first you tell me your name and tell me about your project and I'll go inside yeah okay hi I'm Danielle Butler and I made safehouse which is an immersive physical environment and part of it is that you're meant to be surprised by what you find inside and so when you duck in then you can interact with what you find inside and discover more about the space in the story how many people would you say came and went inside yesterday that's a really good question a lot and what I loved is how many people would go in at one time so what's what's the most that's been in there once them I think five and it was great because I built it as an immersive installation for one and so it's really fun to see five pairs of legs sticking out the bottom okay I'm gonna try something very strange which is to go inside with this ridiculous camera thing and microphone okay okay I'm here I go we're going down now we're going up and inside the house okay so I'm gonna kind of spin around here whoops you can see now there are all these little doors and things that I could open up let's try this one okay I just have to try every single one because it's too much fun this is like a drawer uh oh okay it's fair to do this is the maker phone I'll skip that what so you can see there's all these beautiful like little like treelike structures it looks like they were like maybe lasercut little discs and attached together the trees are amazing but you guys I don't know if you can really see this but the ceiling is also quite beautiful I can actually so this is what's above actually I don't have the FET to it okay Oh what's this there's one more here there's like a little peak like a little people let's see if I and there's like a little tiny light in there look at this it's kind of amazing okay all right I'm going to now exit we're gonna take a look at these trees one last time too much nose sorry about that okay here we go I'm coming neck out now oh yeah thank you I've got it thank you so much this I love it it's amazing I just I love the moments of surprise and being able to look inside and find these little like these little tiny scenes the miniature like and the trees are beautiful two people were commenting that people who love the truth great job I definitely feel like sort of warmth and safety 'no sand comfort being in there so I think successful in that regards for sure okay all right hello hi se ho can you tell me about tell me your name and tell me about your project hi I'm Sarah and this is an artificial anti dancer so they're guys it's a stick figure that is like dancing by itself but it also gets like inspiration from people that is something in front of it so it's like improvising with them and also like learning about the new bottle what people are doing and then like doing that afterwards so it's like well it can generate like some kind of dialogue in which the stick figure follows you but you also follow weeds and that like this improvisation yeah I try it you want to hold this for me a little bit of a mess here the old if you hold that the microphone prod doesn't really matter now you will know that it's always a 13year I think I have to stop how did I do okay thank you awesome okay let's see here can I come can I come squeeze the blob okay all right let's see here so first can you I know this was a collaboration between you two right you want to come stand next to each other to have like your your okay so hold on I'm trying to let's see okay so tell me your names and tell me about the project hi my name is Regina my name is mint and this was a collaboration for two classes it's tangible interactions in live image processing and well you need to squish it yes you know what I get it I get it okay you hold them okay so I've got the blob here's the blob and now what I'm going to do is squeeze the block it's kind of like one of those uh stressbuster things it's very satisfied it's harder to squeeze than you would think very satisfying what's on this screen over here oh that's some of the 3d scanning you're doing you're missing okay hold on people are asking for to see what I'm talking about somebody go over here this is you can see okay so tell me about the 3d scanning problem so basically the way it works is you have that thing I'm holding it's an iPad with a structure sensor and so main had to sit to stand like super steel and I just go all around her take around I think it was like seventy three shots and then an app just makes a model out of her and then she went and took the models and did those animations of us we're not doing we cannot do that in real life it's awesome when do I get my three skin whatever okay awesome great job you guys I loved I just love the interface it's really so satisfying it it's awesome great okay uhhuh let's listen okay this is supposed to be a thing to stabilize the camera but I think it might might be causing more trouble than it's worth but okay so let me hold on let me first try to get you in this shot here I'm gonna ask you to state your name and your purpose now just a say your name and tell me about your project I'm Erin not Erin although I live here that run really you guys are roommates yeah yeah yeah we live in a giant makerspace um so this is my project it's called thank you lights basically it's made out of I tried to use materials from the trash so a lot of the bags say thank you in New York so I called it thank you lights it's powered off of aluminum um takeout tins and charcoal from a campfire and salt water so basically the way we it the only thing that's powering the light is for these realities yeah we move tunes like takeout mmhmm charcoal where did you get that from this I just burned some stuff in my my grill okay and that's a subscribe moon and the other is literally just water and salt yep yeah we're like you can use anything Gatorade you could use urine you can anything so yeah this is one of the batteries and basically there's a few cells in here that are sandwiches are those ingredients and then I'm using plastic bags to insulate them from each other and then there's a high powered LED that it's powering you can it'll last about ten hours with this light and then I'm using just a phone charger to recharge it to recharge your charcoal saltwater battery yeah so every 10 minutes or sorry every 10 hours if you plug in over 10 minutes it'll recharge it and are there any like I mean obviously this is sort of just a research and experiment to try this idea but if this if you're actually to use these is there any like safety concern or like what would I guess if you filled a room with a million of them they'd start emitting a hydrogen gas but if you need a lot of them to know they're pretty safe I mean they're not like lithium batteries that uh you know lithium reacts to oxygen very violently if you youtube hoverboard a battery explosion the yeah them using just regular plastic bags that i've learned together with the clothing Kanodia so that's kind of a fun process but one other cool thing about these bags are made out of high density polyethylene so you can actually they're safe to laser cut so I've been laser cutting them instead of buying they fuse together when you layer them on top and I I just have three this is three bags so it kind of makes a stronger material and then you can you can send them through the laser cutter without any fumes or anything as long as you use HDPE bags see if I can find that most most plastic bags are executed so awesome cool thank you so much great thank you okay well that's amazing all right so here we go I'm gonna keep walking around and try to get this camera stable whoa yeah somebody just posted something crazy in the chat okay okay here we go let's see I'm gonna go this way we're gonna go we're going to attempt to enter we're going to enter this darkroom I'm not sure what's going to happen when we go in here hello hello can we sit temp to see if we can make this project work here and then to try okay foot hold on let's see do you guys want to come stand over here where you might be in some light oh you don't have to turn the light on it's pretty it's no you're fine you're absolutely fine okay here so first one can you guys tell me your name and tell me about your project and then hold on I this thing is supposed to stabilize the camera and I'm not doing a good job and then we'll then we'll try it out okay so hold on here we go ready and hello I'm Haley hi I'm yes oh and our project is mirage' slide experiments and it's an interactive lighting installation using EMS stage lighting and people can interact with the light and there's no projection or screen involved to this it's just theater stage light that's true yeah we are using the three spot lights and the one say spotlights and but one is like moving hands so like you can track the people so even move the like people's like the motion and location what how are you track how is interactive how are you tracking what the person does to track people's gallatin and we process data from processing and so we control the DMX light color and the location and the size and we are using DMX light because now instead of slide like presentation like projectors because we try with projectors but they give away right faith and not very clear image like compared to DMX and we really like the quality of the light very crisp and light bright awesome cool okay so I'm going to okay let's do it let's look at first let's see so I'm going to see if I can get some shots here so this is the stage lighting whoa and we can see the setup here you can see that there is a connect up top here and then this is this particular kind of light does this kind of light have a special name or anything this is a moving had a light but the brand names elations if we just call the Elysian light got it okay um you guys want to hold this and I'll try it are you want demonstrate it okay why don't you demonstrate home let me come back over here just give me a second okay hold on let's let me try to get them okay go ahead you that's my favorite part so let's look at the tracking here oh so you actually also have a little simulation of where you think or where the light is supposed to be and as well as what's actually doing that's great and are you you guys are using which I'm using processing yeah and then are you and are using the the Windows SDK the processing library for Windows with the Kinect that's great we are some USB to up there called qlx to control the DMX like brightness and location and 500 people are asking about the delay I don't know if they're asking about the livestream or a delay but I don't think there really is it looks very real time to me I don't see any lag at all using a DMX signal and same SS software but we that's why we are using the CMS you to really stable and it's high faster than other like communication way so you're really like happy to use this and you imagine this baby being used in a performance or yeah so actually we we just went to the density apartment like show last week and then maybe because collaborate with the tensor performance it's really nice and it actually we can add more effect like for the like show cause up you can imagine in a really huge space way you could do is you're limited because just have a small area to demonstrate it lightest can move like uber 360degree like actually is not the like one more it's actually you can use a whole space of the war and don't like selling and they like flowers so it's really a we want to like working more like public space like building faster than like outdoor space and light like freedom for in the Washington Square Park yeah awesome great job you guys sure can I ask you about your wind chimes okay so hold on let me try to come over here first and see here okay so tell me your name and you tell me about the project and then I'll put the camera on the project hi I'm Roxanne King and my project name is wind chime so basically this is some realtime light fixture and also this is my person doesn't have sounds but it's like visualised wind chime visualised wind so basically I have three times and each every cylinder has different different modules that can connect to WiFi and then they representative of each cities so one is the soul and what what is the New York and the last one is actually the fake data because I want to contrast like desert and very dry and windy city so right now they are I'm using my hotspot right now so I grabbed a weather API from the open wthr.com so they're called and I visualize their temperatures and also the wind speed changes how they will help us there great modern interpretation of the idea of an old wind chime it's great well it's really like nice how they the light sort of fills from the top to bottom the last will be like star deserts or something like very windy and dry and hot City awesome great thank you can I ask you about this I can I sit down this is rope okay so first let's let's have a look here oh my goodness okay so um can you tell me your name and then about the project uh I'm smelly and this is my porous calcium oberfield I was inspired by this Chinese saying of oxygen into the field and few change back to the sea which which means that the great changes in the nature that we as human being our we don't live long enough to see that happening in real life so I want to create this like fictional window you can sit around and have a cup of tea and you can see that um inside a window that is happening what takes a millions of year like in real life so right now it's a here is where we as human would build things and then later on the water is coming over which is the second layers of rotation coming over to wash away our machine systems and they go back to the mountains like a whole loop that keeps happening around like 15 minutes it's a full cycle of that it is I just love the analog quality of it so what's what's actually behind there Polly wanna see sure I want to look at this beautiful setup that you have here so what are the different elements here you have just explanatory stuff about the project uh yeah this is where I got the inspiration from a couple and it was inspired by this time lapse video I made for light interactivity I just see that like human existence in the way there is like we're flickering around and I see the Sun is keep rising far as a law it just makes me think that something that in nature is very like like whatever but we as human with don't live blowing now so I was inspired by this idea then I kind of have this a whole graphic design of it and yeah is there a particular significance to the peach or uh not really I'm gonna eat it either pretty on the table I agree completely I was just wondering if what what the cultural significance is that I don't know about no no agent nation yes I agree okay is it organic all right let's look bond okay so let's come back and see what's back here extra is three layers of paper cousin is attached with a circle and how they are and yeah so that's basically de and Audrina and breadboard in a nice hat thank you so much it's very hard to quote create like quiet contemplative projects at the ITV show but you've done a really nice job of that okay okay we've got another project here with some bubbles projected I think we're waiting for the Kinect to come alive go back okay I'm gonna slip by you man will you tell me about your project Eric okay they hold on hold I'm not ready yet so first tell me your name in lwith so I'm Eric when she leave I'm doing a project about like a collar and popup windows so there are 190 popup windows which were assembling the collar from the cat webcam and also it's running a very basic level of machine learning so like this I have some business card mine has different color if I put on the in front of the webcam we will start assembling the color because it's running algorithm so it's only something the color have the most frequently in front of the camera now I change it to another one all of these are separate browser windows yes because I think like the popup windows it's like the trash on the Internet people close it once it immediately popup so I think I should do some recycling stuff you know using those popup windows to you know draw picture play some song make some instruments just like what do we do with those physical trash awesome it's beautiful it's it's kind of it's you know you we could I would see the same sort of grid and what it just has a different quality sort of seeing it on the desktop with all these kind of crazy windows there's this like using a very simple layout but like you know give you a pixel style pictures there as what the camera is actually seeing as well as the sort of pixelated version of it and how does how are you how does this how do you communicate from the camera to so many different windows actually I have once grapes to raise a collar and try to assembly them and then use a socket to send the collar to each of the windows so in theory this could work each across network so you could have hundreds of computers all over the world each sort of showing the same thing yes actually is playing some music right now and you can play with the windows like change the location of different windows or resize the window and it will change the loads its generative music so like each time you know click it or resize a you will get have like different result it's awesome great job ok you want to tell me can you talk about your projects hey hold on I'm having some issues here with my camera stabilizer ok so tell me your name and about your project so Steven Simon and I made a children's interactive storybook with physics involved from the classes nature of code so oh what a coincidence so I don't know actually requires probably headphones in it so so yeah this is on the web people could look at it right now if they go to the URL right yeah so this is live so anyone can go to this yeah and what's the story about so it's about a bear that learns how to cook and it kind of teaches children how to cook awesome great job cool so that's Steven Simon portfolio comm /ko di HTML I'm sure somebody will post it up look it's already posted yeah I've got a very good chatroom here going oh yeah oh wow look at that yeah that's wonderful also making popup books Oh that's great it's kind of like a audit bonus awesome great job to go this way come back hello I've got a live stream going here if you can believe this so I have to come back and have a more proper conversation I've like point eviction ever awake you're going to be on more projects would be done soon nice to see you okay okay say hello again walking around ah let's oh the dragon is on okay we're gonna come see the dragon now okay can I ask you to tell me about the project okay so tell me your name first and tell me about the my name is Franklin and this is my thesis project colored ritual the last forever and it's a kinetic sculpture of the traditional dragon dance performance yeah so so long it's long story short so just trying to bring back something that is deep transmitted into my culture DNA in a modern form so that yeah it can be remember again absolutely beautiful stunning GM do you have if you were to make this again a second version of this because what would you what would you do differently oh definitely I'm going to shorter that arm and have better motors I would like to have been made with custom parts so that I don't have I don't need those hoes are not necessary and what scale do you think you could actually make this that cuz it'll be amazing if we're above you definitely yeah it will be great if it got fill the entire room you know awesome it's really stunning great job okay I'm gonna try to try to show people it a little bit more so this is it from the front I'm going to come around to look at it from the side okay let's go and look at these sculptures here that are really quite lovely I don't see Shir the designer of these sculptures what I'm going to show them to you anyway these are called light escapes these are 3d press or have a little tired of doing this for an hour in ten minutes these are 3d printed sculptures that have light inside of them I don't see the creator of this project here this one is my favorite because it kind of it has the sort of entrance into the abyss here by the way you guys able to hear people that I'm interviewing and hear me okay because it's so loud in here but I guess the shotgun mic works pretty well okay where else can we go let's go to let's go towards the back we almost hit every single room so now I'm walking towards the back here Oh excellent we've got some crazy balloons here here in so I'm enjoying your guys lovely chat here you li can ask you about this project all right so tell me your name and tell me about this project my name is Sunita so this is the wave washed sand which I made out of like an Asian Chinese poem well can you tell me a little more about the poem who's it by and where you found it so this bowl resonated with me a lot because it's like kind of express those excel feeling Coppola was in prison and they he was in the Exile when he wrote his porn that's why the center balloon is kind of like in cage and then so me as a traveling students kind of feel resonating with him so on a base my thesis project on it so from there I kind of like try to find who is the best performer to perform this cone and then I decide to use balloons and then after that I kind of like put all this mechanism together to choreograph this performance or this show going through different lines and then with balloons movements to express the feelings so the poem is down here and it end you like laseretched it into this surface yeah laser etched and laser carded there are like English translation and so for each line of the poem there's a different choreography of the balloons yeah it's like an act of the show to the balloon at the balloons ever pop they never pop day like this is the last flying of this through and then they almost pop that but a string bag is kind of like paying the current life it's really fantastic kind of though a great job when I come back here so this is the mechanism behind it so you can see I guess air is going through these tubes it's so loud I don't know if you guys can hear how loud hello can I interview you about your projects okay so tell me your name and about your project so my name is drone right my project is called Iommi and it's based on a character I made like my 2d animation days so what I did is I made a crow a clear dart and did some edge lighting with the LED strip so there it is it's supposed to make it more stable but it's causing the issues so you've mentioned that you that this is a character from your TV animation day so you have a background working in television so I go through the animation reading yeah so actually a basis I based this illustration for one of my digital paintings so I want this for my it was pieces together I made of magic for so wanted to see if I can translate the painting into acrylic physical form so there are the similarities between your layered like peeking in layers and but also like I guess stacking acrylic in layers so there were some similarities there but just the physical medium is not less forgiving so I didn't make a lot of mistakes and have to go through a lot of acrylic unfortunately more expensive but uh I think if the end results came out pretty well I'm kind of happy with it and I think I probably try to pursue this and going forward see our new rhythm it's amazing it it's amazing how much it comes to light life blend it lights up because I was here earlier when it was off in your time looking what is there not only a juicer you know balloons and it's amazing yeah a little really different from upcycle plastic but yeah definitely also providing a child thank you okay can I get you to tell me about the umbrella okay hold on hold on hold on wait let's just have this is supposed to make my life easier shaky cam okay I think I got it back under control okay so tell me your name and about the problem all right hi I'm Samantha and my project is waiting in the rain or the umbrella rain machine and basically it is supposed to be an outdoor lamp or an umbrella that you take with you and what it's not raining it simulates the rain so I have sound and light going above and then I have actual water sensors on the top and so they change brightness according to how one there so it actually is reading will have these lights above come on and they'll flicker in the rain so you have it's really just nice to be enjoyable the gloomy rain a little bit more exciting I love this pound yes let's do this through your left could you do imagine that's actually being used out in the rain I think that it could be used in the rain I need to make sure how durable and waterproof it is but another idea it could possibly be just like a canopy or a tent and you just have it installed and you know Paul sleep underneath it I guess Google love falling asleep the rain noises so that was another idea but yeah what what class did you do this book on mostly light and interactivity I did a little homemade hardware make my own rain sensors but yeah an installation was for life awesome great job okay let's see hold on I gotta see if I can get this I've lost my here we go okay no no I just think this thing went a little bit crazy okay can I ask can you tell me about this project so tell me first hola okay hold on let me what I'm gonna do it actually is I'm mature what if I turn off the gimbal thing I'm just do that for a second the cameras going to go a little bit nuts okay now I'm going to turn it back on okay ah there we go I'm back okay so tell me your name and tell me about this project hi my name is Carly so this project I called it orbits training creating a big shadow so you stand in front of it you see your shadow always moving and running and it's actually inspired by outer space so yeah no space when a star is flying around another star when you get closer to that star they need to speed up and will be further you need to slow down so that it won't fly away and I feel like it's just like all the human beings that we all have the gravity that we never noticed and we are attracted by each other and we change our speed to to keep our orbit from each other people so that's the idea like you just become something like a tourist and you gotta move there you see a change of speed because of you existing there awesome so if I stand here if I turn around stand here I'm seeing oh my goodness well can you demonstrate it for me well I I love how much it really feels like a shadow and I know you're using a projector I can see it down there but it's just like I do have this light back here that gives you and it's so you the way that you've set up this installation with the light and the connecting the projector it just feels so much like an actual shadow it's really amazing yeah thanks a lot of people think they saw something like a Peter Pan you know right right it's very magic thing yeah great job all right let's see here hello guys what can you guys tell me about the project yeah okay some of your name first my name is Gina oh hi hi I'm Manning bear beauty they are Ruby skating experience based on the story of illegal mental hospital the audience as a patient they need to escape the room with both the physical clothes and the clothes they fund through the through the board so this is like an escape the room experience all the images our target image is going to trigger animations and videos clues to help you unlock the planter box and how do you know when you've completed it we are going to put a wristband on each players raised so because we are limited by the space we can't create a door so the goal is to find the right tools to how the wristband that you are free yeah yeah wonderful it's such a beautiful little like sanctuary you've created an invest of all this chaos I love the idea of Yusuf combining VR with clues to escape and so is our one of these actually like a lock that you have to open right there are three locks one is using a key one is using a fourdigit fourdigit combination numbers and the last one is going to use a word to unlock awesome boy have people been successful or they've had a lot of trouble has anybody gotten it no actually because we only give each person five minutes to do this second we got a very tired of eating bees yesterday so everybody only got five minutes maybe somebody will get it today all right thanks okay I'm gonna I'm gonna go out this way all right everybody whoops oh my goodness by the way in case you're wondering this is the room where all the furniture of ITP is and I got to reset this gimbal lock thing up look now it's pointing at me hello turned around backwards okay let me reset it how do I do that I'm going to turn it off I'm gonna turn it back on now I'm going to do this okay so I think I might be wrapping up soon I think I've got most all the project nice definitely haven't gotten all the projects but I've gotten a bunch let's come look at this over here but oh we've got a poor connection can I can I ask you about your project okay hold on let's see I'm having trouble with this camera let me try to get it to stabilize okay okay so tell me your name and tell me about your project oh my name Xia and my project then thank you each box have a live stream camera layer and I added some difference for the first one I turning it's a little bit labs so when they're seen falling down you can feel like a tiny person is the flying and the second one like zooming and make people feel like but by actually said nitch let's stir why so like a brand to live stream radio together I hope to make people thinking about that well we love from the public media maybe not that shoes I mean people can choose to a certain wheel to shooting at shoes and then public to the Internet they make us thinking about another thing so actually it's a it's the two season mallocing yeah that's my idea so what we're seeing projected is actually cameras that are part of the insulation yeah so this is a snake camera it's like the camera people insert to a pipe to see water instead of it has a line in self so it's perfect to my inspirations when there's the camera there just kidding of the way that you're playing with scale here is super interesting thank you I love this little tiny tiny tiny person here will span the hair your girlfriend you're a tiny person watching a few mice yeah that's me those are mine I'm stepping up and down so there's a camera also all the way down here cool Wow wonderful thank you so much can I ask you guys about your projects okay so tell me your name and tell me about the project all right this project is themed on dreamers and then we are using the physical paintings that's like going immersive to the paintings so I'm just going to show the demo how it's going to work and then yeah yeah and then first I'm just gonna show how it's going to work so a quick demo you just pick whatever the painting in life here and then just put it up here underneath the and it's gonna be text and then show what you know the paintings on this is the canvas so just adding more to you so everything has a different particle system so it's going to create something very interesting you know paintings on top of this yeah love the tabletop interface that's just sort of floating it's really quite lovely yeah and where is this all the content of stuff that you guys painted or is this inspired by producer you know she's my own partner and she painted everything though okay so coming I'll come over to you for a second so tell me your name oh my name is Gina and I'm actually part of the this project and I wanted to create some kind of an interactive painting because my background is fine art so I want to like interact with other users and I want to see them what they are creating by using my pieces awesome great job okay can I ask you sheer to talk about your project I actually came over here and shot a lot of footage of it already and I'm having some trouble here though so I'm now with this camera outside you okay so tell me your name and tell me about this guy my name is shir David and I made nightlight which is a series of 3d sculptures inspired by lowlight photography which means that basically I was really missing that moment when you hold photos we're not doing it anymore so I wanted to create a physical object that will represent this moment that we have when you have light falls on our bodies and we capture that in a photo but it's a 3d photo and I have three scenes one of them is a girl standing in front of a bar and the light in this scene is from aniele wire that I had to saw inside the sign and it's inside the pedestal so you actually go into the pedestal to see the whole sculpture the other one I shot my roommate and our fridge and you can actually turn it on and off it's a simple circuit I found at each basement and they were playing Super Mario so they have a tiny television that also shows Super Mario and you can see it here and so what's it was the process of photographing the scenes from from from finding the scene to generating the actual 3d sculpture like I had a few like 10 ideas of like what will be the best scenes to represent this idea of light photos and let's say I thought about the kids around the television like people telling a story around a bonfire like they have something in common something around them the robot is just like something that I see like every day I opened my fridge and I just wanted to have this like sort of moment captured it's some sort of like a weird short moment but it's worth capturing and and the bar I just walked around the city tried to find like a like a really nice bodega that I can fake the lights and I just saw this bar it was washing the street in this pink light and I thought it would be great to like mimic that and and then the scanning was made with a structure sensor on an iPad and you just go around and just hoping that you catch every centimeter of that model of the people and then I had to go to ZBrush and and fill all the holes and create like the best way to put all the electronics inside I'm trying to see it's like what you got there we go there was a moment it's very hard to see the Super Mario like on ball but there we go it's kind it's like so delightful to have it at that scale and to sort of see it there it's beautiful great job thanks to hey okay okay all right everyone I think I might be running out of steam here a little bit and starting to get quite crowded I am going to go and take a moment to sit down in a quieter spot I'll be back and maybe I will take a see if I can answer a few questions so I'm coming into this room here okay all right oh look sunlight amazing alright I'm going to sit down here and turn the camera around a poor WiFi poor connection okay I think I'm bug wrapping up here I've been doing this for an hour and a half and so I can see if I can answer a few of these questions I can see it chat it's all there was a question what languages are they mainly using for the projects there's no a specific answer to that question you know our intro courses are taught with p5.js and Arduino students use a lot of different software tools like After Effects and unity for projects but many of the projects are made with various creative coding type systems okay thank you it's nice to see all these nice and friendly messages I hope you guys enjoyed that this was a quite an experiment for me to try to do this live roaming stream I definitely need to figure out a better way to mount and stabilize the camera the this rig that I'm using worked really well but as soon as I attached the microphone to it I think the waiting of it is off so I hope and play yeah there's a lot of VR so I didn't go into two rooms that are full of VR projects because I didn't think there was an easy way for me to really feature those but there are lots of VR projects at the show yeah I yeah yeah it also would make sense for somebody else to hold the camera I just kind of liked the idea of doing the whole thing and I feel like making someone like follow me around just holding a camera seemed kind of like a I don't want to like torture somebody to have to do that but that would make sense do I know anything about C C++ yeah a little bit use the camera on a helmet that's an interesting idea this particular device that I'm using here hold on I'm going to put the microphone down is this Skylab and it has instructions that I clearly should have read better I'm I'm hoping this worked well enough that machiya and I can work to create a edited version of this like kind of summary of all the projects maybe that would be something that would be in like just about 15 or 20 minutes so we'll see if that can be done I forgot to tweet that I was doing this because I started it then I'm holding the camera so oops how do you get started with connect programming I do have a set of tutorials about working with the Kinect that you could take a look at you know most of the stuff that of the students are using with skeleton tracking is using the windows API the Microsoft official API and to use that you need to download the Microsoft software there is a tool here called connect Tron which I try to find the link to that and post it which allows you to what connect Ron does is it it reads from the Kinect and sends all of the data that the Kinect is reading the skeleton data over WebSockets and then so you can have any application even in the browser or JavaScript application listen to and talk to the Kinect yeah so that's how you can use the Kinect in p5 so by the way for those of you who are here right now I got an idea why not pick five suits from the ITP show and have them do a coding challenge the winner gets a teacher I really want to have more guests so I'm hoping to do more of that and what happens to these projects after the show some of them I can show I can show people what books are on my bookshelf yeah I'll do that in a second before I leave some of them everything gets taken down tonight and hopefully they get other opportunities to show them they document them they live on the web they get set up again some of them are websites and mobile apps but they're just here just for today okay I already forgot some of the questions were I was going to show the books as a guest the clean battery yes okay I can definitely try to make that up an oh I don't know if I'm going to unfortunately have a live stream this might be my live stream for this week because tomorrow and Friday there are a lot of graduation and other activities so we'll see what my camera's turn off sometimes because there if you have to do with European tax regulations and they go to sleep after 30 minutes I need to hack the firmware with this thing called magic lantern or some ITP students actually programmer that learn to create yes some we do get students that that do come to ITP with a lot of technical experience already before they arrive here yes you know I think in some ways maybe we do a better job for people who don't have any technical experience before they come to ITP but I'd really ask the students that they might have a differing opinion about that but you know ITP really did start as a place and and still you know one of the sort of core principles and philosophies of to be a place for people from a wide variety of backgrounds and an interest with a broad variety of skills to come together and collaborate yeah them I would say probably the majority of the oops hold on I'm he's gonna try to you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm done with the gimbal thing hold on everybody turning the gimbal thing off and I'm gonna take the phone I don't know sorry I'm gonna take the phone out of it oh no no don't power off hopefully the streams not gonna die so time is good let's have a look and see always don't throw it up hold on everybody sorry that this is this is torture everybody okay so okay let's look at me I want to look at the front camera okay so what do I have here here's some books fractal geometry of nature mastering regular expressions emergence foundations of statistical a girdle Escher Bach that's great book racing the beam a brick great book spacesuit by Nicolas de Monto local code by Nicolas de Mancha old college roommate of mine a super fandom by Zoe Nair and that's a book that I would highly recommend making things talk I've got Charles Darwin's Origin of Species programming collective intelligence I've been using that Turtles termites and profit jams some other stuff back here what else is up here I've got ten print Mindstorms by seymour papert that is a classic musthave words and rules by Steven Pinker complexification interactive data visualization by the for the web by Scott Murray getting started with processing vehicles by Brayton burg Foreman code look I even have two copies of that this is a nice HTML and CSS book fooled by randomness here comes everybody by Clay Shirky Black Swan hackers and painters not a ok oops hold on I've got a whole lot of books in in the lower area folks Oh actually there's a the unfortunate thing is the books that I'm actively reading are kind of out here so I don't know what's out here oh do I have two copies of programming collective intelligence all right let me see that let me see I'm going to move this artwork this is jerath or prints I've got a big fry here this office there's my finger in front of the camera there's a lot of others these are I think so let's see what's down here sorry my fingers in front of the camera I got it okay so we've got assembly language Muybridge algorithmic beauty of plants visual complexity see I've got the C programming language book this is a very old version of learning processing that was like basically printed through Lulu introduction computational media head first physics computational beauty of nature as well so got down here artificial intelligence processing new media reader Universal Street numbers Vincent Scully's architecture book that's from college programming artificial intelligence minor Pro get and some other stuff eight a 95 Wow look at that that's still in here so some of these books I could probably get rid of up here I've got some more deer up deer data processing creative code rules of play generative design guts eat look some detox tea nobody believes me when I say all I do is drink tea I got a lot of stickers here anybody and I even got my coding train mug okay let's see all right so I think I may be UPS my hand is down from the camera again hopefully you guys enjoyed Oh people have been asking for this hold on sorry that I'm so awkward now disaster with the camera here uh there we go people have been asking to see this this is my lovely silver play button ups hold on ah there it is okay that's about it okay here I've been working out some neural network stuff that will be coming soon I got some lovely uh children's drawings and then some neural network bath and let me swap the camera again and move my hand okay I got to turn it this way there we go okay everybody this is the Ben far I'm standing in front of this is also Darwin's Origin of Species colorcoded by different editions and used to record the videos in this room which is why you saw a green wall there and why there's a whiteboard there but now I record them in a separate room okay everybody thanks for tuning in to this one hour and 45 minute livestream if I missed any exciting projects maybe I'll come back and turn it on again but I hope leave a comment subscribe like you have any questions about any these projects you can tweet me at Schiffman and I hope to see you all sometime soon okay and talk to you all later oh and by the way okay so coming later today or tomorrow will be the edited version of the minesweeper coding challenge if you want to learn how to program minesweeper stay tuned it'll be on very soon okay goodbye everybody I'm going to hit click the finish button now
