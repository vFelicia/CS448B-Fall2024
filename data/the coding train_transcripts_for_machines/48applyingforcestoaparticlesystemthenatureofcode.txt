in the way we've wrapped up this section of videos about particle systems but there's a two little topics that I want to tack on to the end here one is kind of a strange thing happened that I don't know if I really intended but in our efforts to really focus on the ArrayList inheritance organizing the sort of collection of particles we took a few steps backwards if you notice in the particle system class in these examples the particle has a constant acceleration there's no apply force method but really we do want our particle systems to exist in the world we've built where objects that are moving around can respond to forces and this is going to become very necessary when we get to some future examples where we build these systems of objects that that interact with each other through forces the flocking system a crowd system those examples are really going to need particle systems where the particles can respond to forces from the environment or forces between each other so what I wanted this video to do is just look at adding the apply force method back in but this is not as simple as it may seem it's actually quite simple but it's not as obvious as it might seem like oh well all we got to do is just add the apply force method back in but let's let's think about this let's map this out for a moment before we come and put this in our code so we have a particle class this we know about this we've written this is the thing we've been making all along mover particle it's all the same thing now we have a particle system class our particle system class has the ArrayList it manages the collection of particles what's in our main program in our main program we have set up we have draw and what are we doing we're we're making a particle system a new particle system and we're saying hey the particle system should be displayed and the particle system should be updated notice here this sort of main program and if I go back over here it's the same thing notice here in this main program we are not referring to any particles how do we apply a force to the particle well in order to apply a force to the particle we need to say particle system dot apply force some force that's going to apply the force to the system which will in turn apply the force to every single particle so again this is maybe sort of a small detail but one thing we need to realize once we've sort of organized ourselves in this principle is when we want to act on individual particles we have to act on them through the through the particle system so we apply a force to the particle system the particle systems can apply force method which can apply a force to all the particles so let's go and add that into this example and this is gonna be I so it can be less than five minutes this video I'm very excited I can turn the timer on so okay so we know what we want to do is say something like hey there is a P vector called gravity it looks something like this and we want to say apply that force gravity to the entire particle system well what did we used to have in our programs in days of yours right in our particle class we had a function called apply Force which took in a P vector and you know I'm gonna skip mass right now you can add that back in and we added that force into acceleration and our update method we just remember one of the things we would do is we would clear out acceleration and clear out acceleration at V at the end of the update method because that's something we worked on before cope I could watch the video link to it magic internet machine thing that you remember so this is what we had before Newton's law force equals mass times acceleration we're accumulating the forces in acceleration we run this okay so so though now of course we run this but remember we only put the apply force method in the particle class we now need to put that apply for some that in the particle system class so here in the particle system class we need to write a function called apply force and what does that function do it receives a force and what happens here when we apply a force to a particle system we need to in turn apply that force to every single particle for every particle P in particles P dot apply force force so this may seem sort of silly and redundant and perhaps it is but this is our methodology now we send something into the particle system it receives it it runs a loop through all the particles and sends that to the particle objects itself and now when we run this we can see this looks pretty similar to what we had before because we're applying this gravity force but notice now I could say hey if mousepressed make a P vector called wind which sends stuff off to the right and apply that force so now we've all that work we did in Chapter two in all those examples we now have here I click the mouse and all of a sudden the particles are blowing off to the right I let go of the mouse and the wind has stopped so this is really important we don't want to lose all this work we did we now our particle system can now also receive forces and pass those along to the particles and we can see I just want to point out to you that there's you know so this is essentially example four point six if you're following along in the book but there's also an example for point seven where and one additional slightly more advanced example that I want to show you just in the same way we might take a vector and pass it through the particle systems apply force which will then in turn send it to all the particles we can do that with anything if there is a repeller object in our world in this particular example there's a repeller object that repelled that net at that as a force that repels particles we could we could send that repeller object through a particle system function in this case called apply repeller which in turn if we go and look at that method right apply force takes a vector and is that to the ply force method apply repeller whoops fancy computer what does apply repeller do it goes through all of the particles calculates the repelling force and then applies it so the point of what we're doing here is is is just to say that we can't accent we are not accessing the particles individually anymore in our main program we're accessing them through the particle system and you can see an example our first example just sent vectors in through an apply force but if we have other objects that communicate we can send them through another method as well so so okay so what I would suggest to you is go back take have you been working on that particle system maybe you've got it with all sorts of crazy different kinds of particles that inherit from the main particle class now trying to make sure your modeling forces with that go back and make sure you have that apply force method and one of the things that's really interesting to think about that you might try as an exercise we're going to look at this a lot more in future videos is could you make a particle system where the particles all apply forces to each other so for every particle apply a force to every other particle what would that need to do that's kind of a difficult problem and I want to say we're about it but I'm gonna leave it at that and we'll look at it more we're certainly going to look at it more once we get to flocking systems because that's exactly what a flocking system is okay I think there's one more video left to make and I'm gonna do that right now but you don't need to watch it right now because you could go do something else like pee or have a snack whatever people do and they are not just in a room by themselves talking to a camera goodbye
