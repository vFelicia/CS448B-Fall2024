popup this is another video I just thought of that right now oh I'm not genius when it comes to bad jokes on the internet and I also think like I hurt my back the other day anyway here I am in another video about popups in Chrome extension so in the previous video all I showed you how to do was if you add a browser action with a button when you click that button you can have a web page popup and in this case I have an entire p5.js sketch animating as part of the popup but why would I want to have a popup well one of the reasons why I would want to have a popup is to provide an interface for my Chrome extension that might change some settings to have some place where I could enter some information to to show something related to what's on the web page that I'm on so in order for that to actually happen I need to have some way of communicating between the content and the popup now one thing that's important about Chrome extension I haven't actually used the word scope but I think it's to mention this before when I wanted to communicate between the background script and the content script they live in different scopes each one of these things lives in its own bubble the background script the popup the background script the popup the content script all in their own separate bubble so only the content script is allowed to mess around and know about what's on the content page the popup knows nothing about that and it's not as if you could just make a global variable and use the same variable in both places there different scopes there's sort of a trick to getting variables from the background script but that's another story now so what do you I need to do is I need to have a way of sending messages back and forth in very similar to how you might do this in a networked application I have this thing running over here and this thing running over the area I'm going to send a message over here to make this thing happen that's what he did to do the nice thing is the API the set of functions that I showed in a previous video for how to communicate from the background script to the content script I can use that same functionality to communicate from the popup to the content script so what I think I'm gonna try to do let's come back over here is first time to get rid of this maze thing it's kind of interesting but I'm gonna I'm gonna go into my p5 sketch I'm just gonna kind of delete everything and I'm just gonna say function setup and function draw and I'm gonna I'm gonna say no canvas and I'm going to put some elements on the page like I don't need this anymore I don't need this sound library oh that's interesting that I could have sounds I'm gonna put some elements on the page so I'm gonna say type paragraph replacer and then I'm going to make an input element with an ID called user input I know is that how you do it do I need to close it like that or just put a slash on the end something like that I'm gonna put that in like a paragraph then what I'm gonna do oh let's see this this this looks weird but I feel like I messed something up here but I'm just gonna leave it then what I'm going to do is I'm going to reload my extension and I'm gonna press the popup actually okay so now I have this paragraph replacer what I want to do is anything I type here I'm going to replace the content on the web page with anything I type there just as a demonstration of how you can communicate between the two and remember I could send from the content script so one thing I might like to do for example is I actually have an example so I'll link to that from here is what if I'm on a web page and I like select a word and then I press this I'm gonna make do this as a coding challenge so I select a word on the web page I press the button and it goes to an API like word Nick and finds me the definition for that page so we'll do that as a coding challenge in maybe that in the next video actually but in this video I'm going to do something simple and I just need to have this messaging go back and forth so how do I do that first let me just weirdly make sure messaging works and I'm going to actually no no let's I don't need to draw look there's no animation happening you could have an animation what I want to do is I want to say user input equals select so I'm using the p5 Dom library to grab that element and then and that says user put user input then I want to use the user input dot input there are two events that can be associated with a textbox one is the event called changed which only happens when I like press enter or tab out of that could maybe have a submit button or something but I'm actually just gonna do it as I'm typing so the input event is an event that happens every time I press a key so I'm gonna say pressed you know user key pressed oh boy terrible name for a function I can't even tolerate it new text will call this new text so I'm gonna write a function called new text and here now I want to send a message to the content script so all I'm gonna do now to make sure this is working is send a message with what's in like this is the message user input value so whatever is in that text input box that's going to be the message so I content script actually a hole ready has code to receive a message it already has code to receive a message because that's what I had in a previous example and actually don't need to change it I do need to think about how I'm gonna format that message my background script that I did in a previous video has the code to send a message this is how I send a message now the thing is how do I get the current tabs ID so this isn't gonna work exactly let me move this into here the idea that I'm gonna do here is right now I'm gonna craft the message as a JavaScript object then I'm gonna send that message to the tabs that tab that I'm currently on I could actually send it to other tabs but if I send it to the tab that I'm currently on how do I get the tab that I'm currently on okay so what I need to look at is the chrome tabs package I don't have packages the right thing to say the API and that's here so extension slash tabs this is a set of functions that I can employ to sort of figure out about the tabs so one thing I can do is just probably get current is all I need that I actually in some of my examples I noticed I'm using this query to like query about all the tabs but I think all I need to do is say get current so get current just gets the current tab which is what I want so I am going to say first ready to do is say chrome tabs get current and a got tab so I need another callback and not getting into this sort of like crazy nested callback stuff which I really want to try to avoid and some of the new arrow syntax and other promises stuff I'll get into that at some point kind of but I think this is fine so right the user presses a key new text and someone suggested that I call this change text which I think is better then as soon as that happens I want to say which is the tab which the current tab so you need to get the current tab once I've got the current tab it should be the actual current tab is passed into my callback as an argument so once I do that I could just send the message to that particular tab I'm going to send the message hello right I'm not actually doing anything of value yet and send that message hello and let's see what happens so now let's go and oh and let me in the content script console I'm console logging the message so I'm actually just gonna console log the whole message so we should see that in the content script so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to reload my extension I'm gonna go over here to this page I'm going to open up the JavaScript console and when I do this I don't see anything yet but as soon as I start typing in that paragraph I should see here the message coming through that didn't work so let's look at inspector let's inspect this element let's look at the console Oh tabs dot get current cannot read property idea of undefined so you might need permissions ah so thank you breaking news from the chat firs I'll Simon Thank You Simon suggested that I call it change text and I probably need to add anytime you start to use something from the chrome API I need to explicitly say in my manifesto JSON that I intend to use this so I don't know if this is if that's the problem but we're gonna have to figure this out so one thing that it could be is that I need to go to my manifest.json and add something like permissions is permissions already in here no permissions and this should be maybe an array it's an array I think and it has tabs is one of my permissions so this could be the thing that fixes it let's try it I kind of think that I might have done something else wrong but let's try some and reload this I'm going to reload this open up here good work either I really just way too in love with my sound in fact somebody should probably I probably need an intervention about that all right so that was not the air here I'm gonna think about this a little bit do you know what's good to do read the documentation gets the tab that this script call is being made from maybe undefined if called from a non tab context for example a background page or that's the worst just just or pop up view so that's definitely the problem and that's probably why what I actually did in one of my examples is used query so let's let's use query so let's try using query so I'm gonna change this to saying I'm gonna go back to my content scrub where am I in the where am I looking in the pop up yeah in the pop up I'm gonna change this to chrome tabs query and what I need to do if I'm going to run query is I need to give it some parameters for the query like I need to I want it says optional but I want like all of the active tabs and I want I think it's only active or current window and current window I might not need these but I recall doing this in a previous example so but you it's up to you to read this documentation to see what tabs you want returned so I need that so now I can query for all of those tabs this is now I want to say got tabs because what I'm gonna do is get an array of tabs I know that the query function probably if I look at the documentation it explains gets all the tabs that have the specified properties there might be a way for me to just get only the current tab but I'm pretty sure that tabs index 0 is the tab that I want so let's try this now I think we're in good shape here I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to say reload the extension I'm gonna come over here press the popup Oh seriously how could that not have worked let's look at the tabs I'm gonna say got tabs and let's console.log it and now let's try this again to reload the extension I'm gonna not use my ridiculous sound effects anymore because I'm overdoing it I'm gonna reload the extension I'm gonna press this oh of course now it works I probably just like missed clicking save or reload or something anyway so I think it actually did work but that's how you would have debug it if it hadn't worked weirdly enough I like behind by one reload right because now I'm not seeing my messages save am I not like saving in the right it's like behind by one reload let's reload let's refresh I made the classic error I'm looking for all of my messages here only the content script messages will be there if I want to see the popup messages they are here so that is working it's an array it's this is the information I got lots of information as an incognito tab what URL is it on what's the width you can see there's lots of information that you can get all right we're in good shape let's move a little bit more quickly here just to finish this off so what I actually want to do is I want to send what I want to send is what was it called I called it user input user input value and what I want to do in the content script is rather than change the background color I'm going to change the inner HTML I think that's what I write to message dot text and I don't I'm not going to bother to check if it's a certain method there's only one kind of message I can so as long as I've gotten a message change whatever the paragraph text to that message okay here we go I'm feeling good about this I think this is gonna work and I'm going to reload the extension I'm going to refresh this page it's got some paragraphs on it I'm gonna feel confident enough to actually close the JavaScript console I'm going to open this up and now here we go all right I should have closed anything let's try this again let's look it let's look here Oh would I put this damn I go in there probably all of you noticed this and you've had to watch like an extra two minutes of this video it could edit out this mistake but probably gonna leave it in let's try this one more time reload extension and open Oh No and now press this now I'm going to type into the paragraph release this dot style is not relevant I had dot South and I was changing the background color inner HTML is not a part of the style it's just part of elements itself so I think it's gonna work this time I've corrected this everything's good here in terms of my syntax let's try this one more time okay here we go I am now going to reload the extension refresh the page press this button and start typing yeah look whatever I type into here now goes into every single paragraph element on the page this worked exclamation point thank you thank you very much so this has been the end of this sending a message from a popup to the Paige and I'm gonna do a coding challenge which you'll find at some point when I publish it where I'm going to actually take content from the page and display information while querying an API information about it there so I'm gonna do that in a coding challenge soon thanks for watching you
