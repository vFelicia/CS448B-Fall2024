okay I'm in another video now this one I'm fresh I'm losing steam but I'm going to make this video somehow take a break and if you're watching these in sequence I'm finally going to get to this discussion that I've been procrastinating and stalling because I'm afraid of it but I I want to talk about CSS cascading stylesheets the style function in pp5 what's the difference between those two things but that's the next video right now I want to look at some more events that uh that that you can handle in JavaScript in the browser page in P5 besides just Mouse press so what's the context of this discussion VAR button equals create button button. mous press and the call back the name of the call back goes here so this is the only event that we've looked at you have this button you click on the button and this code whatever the code inside this function you know function do it and if I reference do it here do I don't know what that means uh if I reference the name of the function here this code is executed when you click what are some other events that are part of the browser that P5 handles for you again now one thing I should mention is you don't need P5 to do any of this this is not an invention of P5 I'm using P5 as a as a as a library that gives you a set of functionality to access a lot of what's available in Native JavaScript in many other JavaScript Frameworks in uh you know jQuery being probably the most wellknown and famous one of these Frameworks that is incredibly sophisticated a huge library with tons of event functionality that you can handle but I'm using the P5 Library as a as an entry point to this much larger topic of JavaScript in the browser and later in some video try to peel back those layers and compare and contrast with other types of ways of doing the same thing breathe so but what are the events that I want to show you in this video so here are some other ones Mouse over Mouse out changed input so with any of these four other events the process is exactly the same if I want to know when you Mouse over the button I say mouse over another function to handle that Mouse over now the thing about the button which it in some ways it was a great example because it's so sort of obvious what you want to do with a button click on it but all of these events are available for any kind of Dom element that you might create you can click on a paragraph you can click on a H1 element you can click on the canvas you can Mouse over a canvas you can determine when a slider has changed its value um so let's let's I'm going to return back to the code and see what happens if I attach some of these other events to other Dom elements and ultimately what is it you probably want to do you want to like when you Mouse over an element you want to highlight it by changing its style oh wouldn't it be nice if I there was a video about CSS and style I guess maybe I'm not doing these in the best order but you can watch them in whatever order you want that's kind of the magic here so let's look at the and I'll come back to these events in the CSS uh video so let's come over here and let's look at what what types of elements are on the page so right now there's this paragraph element there's a button there's a slider there's a text field so let's look at a few different kinds of events I'm going to uh handle first let's look at the paragraph so what if I were to say name p. Mouse over uh uh and what should I do to that paragraph um I'm going to just call a function like over Pera oh boy I'm I'm terrible with variable names but now this means that when I Mouse over this Dom element I want oh boy darkness is upon me oh it's sunlight look the sun is shining right on me this is wow look at this is kind of exciting moment the green screen stuff I have this window open and sunlight I need sunlight we all need sunlight you should stop programming now and go get some vitamin D uh sorry about this sort of weird shadowing thing that's going on I kind of I'm kind of enjoying it I'm looking at myself myself over here that's why I just keep staring over here it's very vain of me anyway let's we had we had a video a topic sorry okay where am I Mouse over when I Mouse over this paragraph this over PA function should get executed so I need to write a function called over I'm probably standing in front of this right now over Pera that's a terrible name for a function so what might I do when I uh execute that function is uh I might change name p HTML your mouse is over me and you know what let's just go crazy here and let's also do mouse out out perah and I could write a function and let me zoom out here so maybe you can see this better uh out Pera uh name p. HTML your mouse is out you're out isn't that like from some you're in you're out it's like my kidi Clum this a very that's a someone watch this in the future the aliens will be watching this video and W won't get that cultural reference I'm not sure I even do okay um okay so what's going on here oh my God I'm losing my mind okay so let's uh let's try to get some code here in the same window that you can see I'm going to use some line breaks here I'm going to bring this down here just so you can I I'm obsessed with getting things laid out nicely so you can see here I've there's a Dom element with two events a mouse over a mouse out over I changed the name to some to I changed the text to this out I Chang the text to this so let's zoom in on the browser and if I mouse that didn't work Mouse over Mouse out oh is that the right paragraph name yeah it is what am I doing wrong somebody help me out here uh name p your name wait type your name oh you know why it's not working so this is kind of an important thing it's good to have these mistakes my hair is messed up this is a bit of a crazy video uh but it's uh if you're if you're watching I thank you but so it's good to have these mistakes like what's going on here why is that not working well you can make events and those events can happen but if there's something else in your code that's also happening it can easily override those events and I I made a sort of classic error of forgetting about this draw Loop so what's in the draw Loop name p. HTML that's happening always always always always always always always always always so it doesn't matter if this momentary event is executed instantly as draws looping it will override that by changing the text back to the text input so let me comment this out and now I can run this again and we can see my mouse over and mouse out Mouse over Mouse out Mouse over Mouse out so this is how these are just more events right there's the button event Mouse pressed there's the mouse over Mouse out event I could actually attach a mouse click event for when I click on the paragraph it's a little bit awkward because it's not really like a clickable thing so that is one nice that's another event that you can look at for incidentally you know I could attach that same event to the canvas oops ah um right I any element uh out per and then look at this I could say canvas. mous pressed change color so all of those those same events right the thing that happens when I Mouse over the paragraph also happens when I Mouse over the canvas the thing that happens when I click on this button also happens now when I click on the canvas but not when I click over here and not when I click in here so this is an interesting you can see these functions can be attaches events to multiple elements so there's so many possibilities here now I want to look at a this is enough for you to just mess around with now that you have Mouse press Mouse over and mouse out but I also want to look at these events which are a little bit strange the changed event the input event so let's think about this why do those events exist and why do you the person who is watching this video need those events what I need now is some lunch I think fading fading fast I'm going to make it through this video okay um changed that input so let's let's think about the slider let's think about the text input put box the input box I think I'm drawing what I just erased the slider how did we use those elements before there was a canvas and the canvas had things on it and there was there is there was there always has been there will be a draw function and the draw function is looping over and over forever and ever and ever so if I use the slider's value or the input's value in draw I'm always accessing that value continuously so if it Chang the stuff in draw we'll use the changed value of the slider but what if I want an action to only happen when I move the slider not when the slider's just sitting there only when I move it what if I want an action to happen when I only when I move the slider and then release the mouse or what if I want an action to happen anytime I type in here or anytime I T not anytime I type it but when I hit the enter key that's what changed and input the those two events do I just realized something that I might be in my code using an older version of the Dom Library so this input I might have to like pause for a second but it's fine you I'm going to edit I'll edit it'll be fine nothing bad will happen um erase what I just said for a second out of your mind and let's come back to this question these are two events the lingo of these events is a little bit strange and possibly not the most intuitive but there's two different events there's anytime it changes the value of this changes ever so slightly or there's any time I finish my action of changing the value that's the difference between just moving the slider all the continuously versus moving the slider and releasing the mouse finishing moving the slider or any time I type versus hitting the enter key so the changed event is for finishing your action the input event is for any change to that the value of that Dom element so let's come back here and take a look at that so let's um I've kind of mix and matched so many things here but what I want to do here is comment out the actually no I can leave so I can leave all of this sorry what I want to do this is still working but what I want to do now is when I type in my name and I hit enter I want to see sorry it's very hard for you to see that when I type in my name and when I hit enter I want to see that content change so what is the event for that input. changed and now I need a function to handle that uh you know update update text so what I can do here is I can say function update text and say name p. HTML input. value so now the text inside this paragraph right this paragraph is is name p so the text inside this paragraph is changing when I Mouse over when I Mouse over or Mouse out and now it's also changing if I hit the enter key right or tab actually will trigger this event so let's see if that works I'm going to type my name Daniel nobody ever calls me that but that is my name and hit enter and you can see look at that magically it updates now look at this those other events are still triggering and I could type you know my uh Fred Flintstone Flintstone right and you can see Fred Flintstone um so now the that's yet another event that you can handle and and and the um and so um let's see okay so I think the input so this is a good lesson to learn actually that the mistakes should just be in these videos and and you know I'm going to fix it all on the Fly not even going to edit it it's going to be fine I'm at 13 minutes nobody's watching anymore uh you know I should like say like a secret phrase you could email me or tweet me that message if you're still watching I don't know what that' be Fred Flintstone I don't know I don't even I never even W I was not allowed to watch television as the children my parents are not watching this video I I I if I I I I I I I I would gamble a lot of money that they're not watching but um anyway I I don't know if it made me better or worse or what but okay um so let's now try to change let's now use instead of the changed event let's use the input event input now I think I'm going to get an error look at this uncaught type error undefined is not a function now it's on line 26 oh my goodness first of all I created this like crazy circular thing where I have an in a variable name input and a function name input that's actually okay I don't really like it I kind of like it kind of makes me want to change this to like name input so at least I don't get confused uh right name input and then I'm going to change uh here name input uh everywhere I put it so many places um uh but um but but but there was a problem ah here name input let's come back to that problem undefined is not a function we're still at the problem the reason that that doesn't exist is not because of any other reason other than the input event was something that was recently added to the P5 D.J the P5 Dom library and I didn't when I made a P5 default project out of this editor the updated version of the library uh wasn't ready so you know what I could stop now and rerecord this or fix it but and I'm going to kind of dig into the guts of this in a sort of a weird way but then kind of at 15 minutes you can stop watching this and and just go and get the more recent version of the library yourself but let's look at how I might fix this so number one is let's go to the p5.js or website and I'm going to click on download now what I want to I'm going to download uh p5js complete and I'm going to look for that file and get the folder and you can see if you download that there's a lot of stuff in that folder this is the most recent version of the p5js library this is a minified version of the library which is kind of an interesting thing uh you know a smaller version U the code is condensed but it's not as readable you might want to use that for various reasons that's another topic another time what I'm looking for is this p5.js I want to get this more recent version of the Dom Library so I'm going to hit command C which I'm copying that file and I'm going to go back to p5js the project and I'm going to do view show sketch folder so that I can look at it in my finder window and now I'm in this project other events there's a libraries folder which has those files in it I want to paste the new version of the library in here and I want to replace it yes I do and now I'm going to go back up you know I kind of said now it's telling me Oh My Goodness something horrible has happened you made some changes to some files I don't know what's going on reload you will lose any changes I probably shouldn't have done that changed the file system while the editor was open at the same time I might complain to the editor and say you know what I didn't change sketch. JS so you shouldn't really be telling me this I just changed a library file I don't even have open and maybe that's a bug that we can file that that some that I can remember to file or somebody watching this video can file in the p5js editor repository click okay uh so I'm kind of reloading that which is fine um and now I'm going to run it again and I still got undefined is not a function on line 26 six ah uh yeah I think that's right let's so let's let me be a bit more methodical let me get the most recent p5js as well and uh let me go back to the sketch folder and in libraries and add that as well oops I'm going to delete this one and this is the new one let me make sure that wasn't the problem uh what am I missing now okay boy this video is a total failure I should come back and just rerecord it later uh it's like 18 minutes long uh maybe somebody in the chat is like looking at me and telling me what I last line has in uh um last line has input. value did I did I missed something update text okay let's uh yeah oh is that that's definitely a problem is that the problem no but that's not line 26 if I comment this out name input is not defined uh I spelled it wrong somewhere in line 51 yeah it's working um all right so you know what this is uh I'm going to actually um I want okay well I'm Gonna Keep I'm not stopping this I'm G to fix this in this video I could I could you know could get edited later I'm going to look in the reference let's see what happens and actually what I want to do is go under libraries and P5 Dom I wonder if that wasn't actually the most recent recent version that doesn't make any sense though um and uh look for uh events input the input function is called when any user input is detected on an element the input function is often used to detect keystrokes so this should be right what did I I wonder if did I do something wrong let's look at this again name input that's the element input update text undefined is not a function let's just see over Pera let's try that what's undefined um so hold on let's actually look in the Dom Library so I'm now I'm going to look in the library to see if this event is in there October 6 uh no so I don't actually have I didn't actually get the most recent recent recent why did that why did I not get the most recent recent version let's go to GitHub P5 so now I'm going to the actual GitHub repository for p5js and I'm going to go under uh lib addons p5.js October 6 yeah that seems like it's the most recent version uh and let's look at the raw Source here find add event listener change so how come I was definitely using this the other day and I I must be missing where the most recent version is if I get some sunlight it'll become clear to me uh maybe somebody not pushed yet um did I get the right copy I yeah yes I could do console people have so all these great feed all these great um uh pieces of feedback i' I I've just this has been a complete failure this I don't know whether I will upload this video although I think I will but I guess I should you know sometimes when you have this kind of problem you should stop go take a walk outside go talk to a friend I'm sure that I will Discover it those of you uh watching this live waiting with baited breath I'm sure um it's about 1240 p.m. Eastern Time right now New York City time I'm going to take a break and I'm going to try to come back at around 130 145 or two and uh hopefully do a few more of these videos I have appointment starting at 3 um and I'll definitely come back I'll post another link to this live stream to my uh Twitter account which is Just shiffman sh Shi ffan there'll be a different link um and um I will come back and uh answer this question uh okay lunch you need lunch thank you guys okay I'm going stop this video uh stop
