wahwah hello and welcome to another Friday edition of the coding train with me and some new cloaking device for this laptop over here I this is why I'm late actually I was up here leisurely just like getting some fresh green paper with some tape and putting the making nice little things of tape and putting it on the green paper and then putting it over here you're wondering what I'm talking about you can't see maybe I could go here no that doesn't really help so anyway but I'm I'm then I realized oh it's 130 I have to start live streaming and yes so I so people that shat are pointing out that something is different let's see can you figure out what is different and no I'm not referring to my haircut although I did get a haircut that was this is less than 24 hours old no wilderness Dan unfortunately today it was very strong wilderness stand by yesterday afternoon and I decided to get the haircut because there's also something else different I'm looking in the chat this snow is gone hi it is a balmy 60 some degrees Fahrenheit here in New York City today it is a warm almost one might say springlike day and I decided that today is the day that I will remove the coating trained snowy background all right so here I am as I often M you let's say you're watching for the first time maybe you are maybe you aren't sorry unlikely that you are but let's say you are watching for the first time my name is Daniel Schiffman and I appear every Friday except for some Fridays including unfortunately next Friday next Friday will not be here next Friday I'll try to have a makeup date for that but every Friday to do some coding tutorials some fun time coding time things generally feel weird about the whole thing I'm actually just in a closet on the ninth floor of the 720 school of the arts in New York City there's no windows in here by myself I've got some Sunmi and I'm staring at a camera lens but I have this sense that there are people out there watching and that they're interested for some reason and what I have I'm not really what I have to say but perhaps what I am going to do so let me take a look here and I'm just checking the chat grey wizard got no snow in the chat I don't know if that message came before I said it or not because the timing is hard for me to tell but I'm going to assume that gray was or did figure it out so I'm excited I know I hear a little bit subdued today I'm not sure why I didn't plan for that just or what's coming off of me here but I am going to do something that I've been hoping to do for a long time I'm going to tackle tonight do I have it open neuro evolution so let me show this to you this here is a version of the game flappy bird otherwise known as flappy train this is a version that came from that started with what is in this github repository the coding train flappy bird clone this is a fork of that repository made by versatility train contributor did I get the did I pronounce that I don't actually don't know that that must mean something we're on generation 7 here I was wondering why I'm only on generation 7 when I left that was letting was run in the background because I didn't have it open so I have a bunch of examples of something called neuro evolution meaning a genetic algorithm to evolve a neural network for some tasks such as an optimal play strategy for the game flappy bird and so I'm going to as coding challenge number 100 I am going to make my own version look at that look at that beautiful almost made it make my own version of this let's see if though before I do that I can get some thumbnails for a match yet we need some we need some pipe designs that come in here all right all right so that I just need to have a good thumbnail for the video that's gonna come out of me during the livestream closing for a thumbnail image later that's exactly what you were watching so uh now so what I'm going to do today is I'm going to make a version that does precisely this that evolves an optimal play strategy for the game flappy bird i however even though i did say that the reason I was making this particular github repository was so that I could have a more fun interesting coding train theme design for the game this became enough of a project that the complexity of the code is such that I would rather go back to my original simplified it's just an ellipse and white squares white rectangles as the pipes designed for flappy bird in order to just demonstrate the core aspect so in the tutorial I'm going to use just I'm gonna let's so let me find that right now so I'm gonna go to by way did you know that the coding train has a website it is the coding train com Oh weirdly I thought it's supposed to say like live like when I'm live here but I don't know why it doesn't do that maybe it doesn't do that who knows you act this website you can find things like a button to subscribe to the coding train channel if you have not subscribed maybe you might like to subscribe I'm supposed to ask you that because that's the number that is like the thing that means something but should it mean something I'm not so sure who cares alright then you can also if you so choose become a patron through the service patreon and you will get an invitation to a slack channel and in the slack Channel right now Don Wilson asks is the level generation the same every loop or does it change each time there's no my simple version of the flappy bird game has no level level jet no no content of levels it's one game that just happens now let's say I wanted to find my original code for that flappy bird game I'm gonna go here to coding challenges then I'm going to search on this page I'm gonna go to flappy bird and hero clappy bird a flappy bird so here it is coding challenge it was number 31 I wore let me see Jai still have that green headband hold on a second indulge me here all I do in that coding challenge I thought it would be fun to have like a rainbow headband for like I'm a 1980s aerobics instructor but the problem with this headband as you'll soon see is it has it might just look like it has a like if I stand over here it looks like it just has like a white stripe but it's green and you will notice that as soon as I go over here and you will see it changes color or I walk around you can start to see the text or it so I don't think I can wear this because too many people make the comment that your head is separated from your body but there we are okay so now if I'm on the coding train website I could next click I could watch that video or I could go to this to the challenge and now I am on a web page that has the name of the challenge it has a description here in this coding challenge I attempt to program in JavaScript using the p5.js framework probably should say people I've just library right here a clone of the game flappy bird and then I could click here get the code and it's downloaded for me I could also click here on live example and I could see here is the game running in the browser what is the deal what's the deal with slow frame rates in the browser have you ever but I'm poor Seinfeld depression um why is why is this like what's going on on this computer it's just 30 frames per second I just feel like when I was looking at this on my other computer downstairs earlier today it was very very fast I got to make some improvements this game so okay what am I here for I am going to grab this code so bear with me for a second here I am going to put it on the desktop and I'm going to rename it to neuro evolution flappy train and I am going to open this up in the atom oh maybe I'll use noop cat oh excuse me no op cat was here last week I've not released the edited version of her tutorial but she installed I term Oh tip of the day message yeah ooh the window shows I term to tip of the day it will appear every 24 hours to let you know about new features and hidden secrets more options to view more tips I would love to just stay here and look at all these tips I'm on a time schedule or p.m. this challenge will be over it's July the live stream will not be over but the challenge will be over alright I I'm not ready for a new workflow today I was gonna use Visual Studio code and I term I'm not ready so close to being ready but I'm just not ready somebody goes desktop I'm going to go into this sketch and I'm gonna run my fancy little simple HTTP server I'm gonna minimize the terminal then I am going to open the atom editor alright these are the things that anyone else would do before they start live streaming but I cannot bring myself to do that I'm going to close this I'm gonna go here I'm going to drag this down to the atom editor I am going to narrate everything I'm doing on the computer so that you can hear what I'm saying and then I'm going to take a look at the code I'm gonna indulge whatever it's asking to do here all right so hello are you still watching this live stream I was quickly just getting my code from coding challenge 31 because that is the base code I'm going to start with I'm getting a notification I would have missed that meeting today okay I'm gonna miss everything is fine Calendar alert away all right so now what I want to do a few things I want to do I want to go into the web browser here is the game I know the camera has shut off I really did think I really was starting this afternoon so I thought I'd have a little more time this morning to like prepare some stuff and maybe try installing magics firmware it didn't get to it surprise surprise okay so I need to do some stuff to the game first so a couple things I want to do number one is I would like to be using the most recent p5.js and I'm just going to reference it from the CDN so I want p5 Minjae s which I'm going to put here and then I want I might want to use the Dom library so why don't I get this I'm use the minified versions okay notifications will come again correct Simon and the chat says I thought you've done this as chapter 11 in nature of code that is correct this coding challenge will be part of chapter 11 of the nature of code book the new chapter 11 to be written all right let's make sure this still works and now and now something nothing's gonna happen it's totally good that drum roll now okay let's let move a little quicker here I lost my what I was seeing about let me replace bar with let now oh I'm going to show you sighs a fun little tip here is a nice little regular expression for converting something from yes five is this what's going on here oh it's the table is just poking through they're converting yes five function constructor function syntax the es6 classes and I'm going to say find and I'm going to look for I'm going to turn on regular expressions I'm gonna say this backslash dot parenthesis dot star question mark n parenthesis space equals space equals space function see this look I want a regular expression that can find every single reference to this dot of function name equals function parenthesis and I probably should make the amount of spaces here optional oh no come back it went away what I have to retype that in well I will zoom into it at least now so you'll see so I'm making a regular expression here I am looking for this the reason why I put back slash dot is because I want to escape the period the period as a meta character in a regular special means any character then I want to capture whatever is in here I don't want it to be greedy like I want to stop as soon as I match any number of spaces followed by an equal sign followed by zero more spaces followed by the word function so now now that I have done that I want to replace this with just what I captured there so I want to turn this constructor function into an es6 class and so now I'm going to say replace all and I have done that there I'm gonna do it on the pipe I'm gonna say replace all I've also done it there now I'm going to go to that and I'm gonna just start doing this manually now could make a rave expression for the rest of it but it's only two classes I'm gonna change this to be a constructor function and I'm gonna go to the pipe and I'm gonna change this to be oh whoops I have to change this to class that's what I meant to say and then on the pipe I'm gonna change this to class and then I'm gonna write a constructor function and I'm going to close it here and there we go so now I have hopefully still a working game all right let me fix up this game to make it a little bit better number one let's change the resolution to like 640 by 480 oh okay why is it so weirdly what is going on why is it running like it's the slowest thing in the world what is go am I crazy I'm looking for like anybody fall along running this code and it's running like this sluggishly is it because I'm sending the output of the I'm so confused all right let me let me not worry about it I'm gonna make the pipes a little bit wider they look very thin that looks better I am also going to a ho ho I think this is let me go to let me get this improvement from that's already in so I think this is better to actually have a the same spacing between each pipe and then a random spot where that occurs so let me do this let me grab this and let's see if this works no okay why didn't that work let's look let's take some more improvements from here draw a seat this is why I didn't want to get into this draw half draw half rect mode this dot x0 this w this top this dot x height minus this dot bottom this w this dot bottom that makes sense does this make sense the top is a random place between a random place between height divided by six and threequarters of the height it sort of makes sense and is there some like let me just make sure a rect mode corner so what have I done here let's say pipe pipes index zero spacing is 125 the top is 267 and the bottom is 392 and the X is 210 this makes sense top spacing hmm oh this is going well so far isn't it let's comment out that top is 124 that looks like about 124 the second one top is 248 that looks like it so that looks like that's right so the bottom is this dot top plus oh that's not the side that's ahahaha the bottom is the location of the bottom oh this is easy but I probably should conform to whatever I'm doing here which is the way that I'm height so the bottom should actually be height this dot top post this dot spacing right the way that I have programmed this is that I want the bottom to be the Y location of the bottom but the way the way that I actually have programmed this is for the bottom to be the size of the bottom right because the way that I'm drawing it is from the height that much so it's not the location it's the size of it which should be fine there we go so there's always going to be why it's slow it's always going to be 125 and boy they're really quite using the original code I get 60 frames per second Yeah right what's going on on this computer something's going on with my Chrome I noticed that this computer was having this issue well that's the same speed does that feel faster to you how do I see the how do I find the console web developer web console framerate weird is it actually all right so hold on Wow gained like 20 frames per second um too many pages open I don't think that's the probably do have this open that certainly can't be helping but look at that it's like so sluggish alright I got to figure this out everybody I'm gonna do something kind of terrible let me I will remove this later if you all could do me a favor and I'm just uploading these files run this please there is now in the flappy bird clone github repo this will just take a minute here some try this sketch and let me know if you're getting the same speeds as I am because I don't know why it is running so sluggishly which is fine like I can live with that like I could always okay like for example I can make the pipes faster and I can have the pipes come out less often like so but it's just like barely running and yeah right 60 like something's going on on this computer and yeah okay I would restart the computer I don't want to do that yeah people are getting 60 framespersecond right I guess I'll try restarting Chrome I have an idea I'm gonna do is I'm gonna take extreme measures I'm going to clear is uh but once the page has been served huh like all my momentum has been killed alright fine let me look at this let's try let's look at Firefox frame well guess I don't really care that much 30 frames per second yeah yeah I'm still only getting 30 frames per second on Firefox maybe I'll restart this guy I'm just gonna just gonna restart the computer I don't have to restart the stream and then I'm gonna give up because I don't want to spend all my time I want to get to decoding he lost all of my energy the restart the eye I did just fresh restart the computer I'm in the void try to enable hardware acceleration what's that I could try disabling the friendly errors but like that shouldn't be enabled so let's check some stuff and then I just need it's probably a new computer let me do Chrome is up to date Ashley sluggish disabled friendly errors like I spell that right disabled friendly air oh it goes true vehicle's true probably what else weird okay enabling a hardware acceleration how do I do that preferences yeah it's enabled what if I disable it oh I feel like that got better well hi Yanis or jonas all right that's it I'm out of here train is leaving the station oh this doesn't make any sense I think it's just this I think it's just time for a new laptop I think this laptop just has a lot of trouble really it's on its last legs probably should do something to help it out oh my God look at that I'm going to all right I'm gonna live with this speed is perfectly fine it's 30 I'm not really leaving it's 30 frames per second I turned off the hardware acceleration so the reason why I don't think this matters is I'm pretty sure that's why I was using the minified version of p5 the friendly errors are disabled by default I thought with the minified version why are the pipes never arriving this this should be easy enough for an agent an AI agent to beat it's pretty easy for me to play I'm just testing out the game here all right great let's make the pipes a little bit closer just don't want it to be too easy I think this is fine let's make the pipes speed a little bit faster and that's good okay all right okay everybody now we're good got this game I don't actually need this highlighting thing so I'm going to take that out that is not relevant for this particular thing that I'm going to do the other piece however that I do need is I need the files from the toy neural network library I need to have matrix a chess and neural network is and I just need to put those in here I'm gonna put these in line I'm not actually using this anymore and right I'm referring to zero points I have actually a weird sort of nonsensical theory that I'm gonna try in a second and then I just need to reference those files as well matrix yes okay all right now we're cooking now we are cooking okay so hold on everyone it's a couple or the one thing I just curious to try oh those are in sorry a folder called libraries I think it's fine I'm good I just thought maybe I'm gonna live happily with my 30 frames I feel like my browser must be like ebooks whoops I'm just not gonna worry about this before we're gonna do neuro evolution huh okay and this one over whoops there we go all right all right everyone I think it has something to do with the integrated graphics probably yeah all right all right let me check some of these smart ideas whoops nope it's locking me at like 30 for some reason even even if I don't do anything in draw this is an OL this is really old Mac I do need to get a new one yeah I sort of I also have this suspicion that hold on a sec give me one more thing to try I have now unplugged this is the plug that goes into the laptop so that you can see what's on my screen watch here we go can you read my mind you must build read my thoughts now or see them are they displayed behind me I hear computers can read minds now no it's not working all right hold on just give me a second here oh look at that I'm a dumb dummy doofus dumb dumb dummy I am getting like 60 frames per second wildly fast now really just the output causes the browser to not be able to render all this time it's been this cable yeah yeah the HDMI out is set to 30 frames per second it is true hold on hold on sometimes it's the little things in life I know I never get anything done but just be with me here in the moment as I try to achieve 60 frames per second in the browser it's totally the screen refresh rate which by the way I think I have hacked no no no it went back so let me go to the display preferences and okay so now oh oh you can't see it anymore but so I just switched it to 1080i hold on everybody I think we're gonna be good in a second all this time no oh come on up here I won't show up at 60 frames per second well let me I'll put it at 60 frames per second well what if we do this no NTSC no 1080i60 no 1080i50 ah Oh weird weird this works but there's some weird stuff going on is this a problem yeah 30 is totally fine especially now that I know what the issue is but I just like it like this but does this look crazy weird I might need a better HDMI cable for 60 I just like on my preview it looks all distorted and weird but I can't tell no I know I could just double the speed of everything just run 720p gross it looks awful okay we're going back we know what it is we know what it is Oh refresh rate is that oh look at this now I have this option hold on didn't give that to me before Oh cuz I was here hold on hold on I was at 50 oh it looks even worse okay okay we're doing we are doing you don't want I I is bad we want give me my scaled I want Oh 10 ATP and then 30 and 30 is the maximum alright going back to 1080p 30 whoa boy we're going back to 1080p 30 and there we go is there an option to disable the vsync in Chrome that is an interesting question whoa also what happened to my chrome there we go so now we're back we've got 30 and now uh Chrome settings let's see vsync no no no no 1600 by 900 well now we know a little bit more about interlacing we're fine everybody I'm done with this nonsense I am moving on this is the version of flappy bird the pipes look I think I want to just make the the birds motion a little bit like the gravity should be like a little bit stronger and ah oh it's got this like dampening which I think it's kind of unnecessary yes yes I know what's happening here and okay whoo that's way too much all right and a little bit hard to play here that's better just want to make sure the game I want to make sure like I can play the game and now I'm able to do that okay great all right chrome flags vsync is that really a thing there's no vsync in chrome okay all right everybody let's get to some coding huh let's get to some coding before I can get to coding I must get to erasing goodbye to no op cats drawings from last week you would think that these would get erased sometime in between and we finish now but no he's not meant to be I basically run out of this room as fast as I can because I've done and do not return to it until a week later and I have now exactly 1 hour 1 and 1/2 hours to complete this coding challenge because we are not gonna spend any more time worrying about the vsync we are just going to get to coding okay good here we go all right let's check this pen pretty good not so great let's try another one you can't see what I'm drawing is I'm drawing above better better no good trash those are these ones over here apply trash alright alright guy let this run for a little bit negative eight point five is the highest with point six gravity I think what I think I like where I've got got it right now I'm gonna let this one run from how how do you say versatil astute Tillis is that the correct pronunciation so I'm gonna let this one run because I want to start the opening of the coding challenge with nicely well I really should so we'll give this a few more minutes you should have been doing this I realize I can't let it run in the background because if I if I go here those it's still running yeah so long as it's like so I have the neural network libraries let me just remember couple things I want to find let me just remember does this have the copy yeah it has the copy function and also has this whoa mutate function which this is weird gonna change it yeah let me leave it at like change it to this okay we have that you know I was thinking actually the but everyone so let me make sure this is there then the other thing I want to go to is the pool selection closed this particular I want to make sure I have access to this algorithm and I think I actually have it in the traveling sales person coding challenge TSP I just want to have this yeah it's this function great great okay I just need this function okay all right okay okay Eric says I could use his real name this is from Eric coding trade contributor versatility on github who has been helping me manage some of the code in the neural network library he made version sort of testing how the nura evolution stuff would work and here we go looks like after a little bit of time it got it got almost all the way there okay well I'm here let's do that let's do a little moderation just modder just here moderating the YouTube chat for a minute okay and now we're ready let me all right okay it's time for coding challenge number 100 here we go uh in this coding challenge I am going to do something that I have been wanting to do on this channel for uh know about 100 coding challenges I'm going to make a project that involves neuro evolution I am going to combine both neural networks and genetic algorithms into an agent into a simulation of a simple game and I'm going to train choochoo train that agent to play that game effectively by making decisions with a neural network and evolving its neural network with a genetic algorithm way too much explanation so this is a demonstration that versatility on github coding train contributor Eric made this is using the flappy bird clone github repository that various folks have contributed to design ideas to and it's actually running neuro evolution right now and you can see these trains are kind of getting better and better at making their way through these little gaps so I'm going to program this myself now I'm gonna make a version of this in this coding challenge the difference however is I don't want to work in a sort of a simpler place so I am going to use the code from I think it was coding challenge number 31 which just is this simple version of flappy bird that I'm playing with the spacebar right now so I took out all the design stuff just to see if we can get the oh god I'm terrible at this the mechanic the mechanic of the game working now I need to move over to the white board to it for a second before I can write any code I want to talk about all of the pieces going on here alright so number one I need the I need to have the flappy bird game so you can look and find you if you wanted to recreate this coding challenge you can go and get coding challenge number 31 I've actually made a few minor tweaks to it but I will I guess after this is over of an update though so coding challenge 31 will mirror the code as I start with then I also need the toy neural network library which has two files associated with it matrix is and also neural I think it's just called n NJ s so this is the code for the neural network and a some code for some matrix multiplication math that's part of the neural network if you're interested in how this library was made boy do I have a lot of tutorials for you link to those somewhere in this video's description and this by the way incidentally just just has a file for the main sketch I believe it has a file called pipe touch a s and one called I know I'm probably writing off the side here but close enough pipe digest and one called bird s okay time out for a second I'm not able to see over there okay so this is all the code that I'm gonna start with now nowhere in here is there anything about a genetic algorithm so most of the code that I'm gonna write during this coding challenge I'm gonna put into a new file and I will call it G AJ s there are a couple features that are that are in this neural network class that are that I put there for the purposes of being able to apply a genetic algorithm and those are a function called copy which allows me to make a complete copy of a neural network in its like current state as well as mutate which is a function that allows me to make some minor random changes to the state of that neural network and when I say state I mean all of the weights so these are some things that I'm going to definitely need to make use of what I will not be doing is I won't be training the neural network in the sort of traditional way that you might have seen in some my other videos like the doodle classifier or the XOR challenge where I'm using this thing called back propagation supervised learning what I want to do in this video is something that's akin to this idea of reinforcement learning now reinforcement learning is a field of research that's been around for a very long time it predates deep learning neural networks all that sort of stuff and there's I love to UM do lots more tutorials about reinforcement learning the recent advances that you might have seen with things like deep mind and it's Bach that learned to beat all the Atari games those were developed with a style of reinforcement learning called a deep cue learning which uses a neural network and trains the neural network based on this reward based system so you have this idea of in reinforcement learning that you have a world the world is going to be in our case the world of flappy bird the world has a given state the agent or the entity that is being reinforced trained me that is learning based on that state just taught decides to make an action I'm going to jump up I'm going to not jump up in this case if I bird is very simple and then based on that there is a reward that reward is fed back into the system and we kind of repeat here now here's the pig this is what makes deep reinforcement learning and other reinforcement learning scenarios very complicated let's just think about this in the case of flappy bird I am a bird I am over here I now this is the state the state could just be the pixels of the display and that's in fact what was used in this in the deep mind project I rewire my brain I am a bird and I am looking at the state and evaluating the state I'm going to choose to make an action that choice is to jump up I now expect my reward please everybody shower me with your gifts I have made this wonderful decision to jump up the problem is how do I know if that was a good or bad decision I don't really right now I don't until much later I don't the payoff for certain things that I might do in a game scenario how do I know if I'm you know if what's another what's another example of this chess how do I know if I'm playing say the game chess if this move is really gonna be a good move for way down the line this is something I really need to be to figure out I think it's very complicated very quickly the good news is I can use a different system I can say you know what instead of trying to actually figure out whether it was a good or bad decision I'm just going to make a whole lot of these birds maybe like a thousand of them they will all have random neural networks random neural networks they will just make random decision and maybe some of those random decisions happen to be better than some of the other random decisions I will then take those into a new generation and repopulate the world with a hundred new birds based off of those ones that did well over and over and over again this same principles of a genetic algorithm so now I might refer to if you have not ever worked with a genetic algorithm before I prefer to you to mine the gather of the tutorial series timeout for a second okay all right everything's fine having a little little inside joke with myself okay all right let me just check to see any questions so far I kind of want to do that again because I took too long I also want to just quickly I want to make sure I reference some work that has come before me in this area so I want to have this link open and available to myself okay all right okay hold on hold on okay got it got it got it okay I yes so Simon in the chat is mentioning who's saying that is not reinforcement learning that is neuro evolution exactly so what I'm doing in this demonstration is akin similar to reinforcement learning in that I am using neural evolution to Train an agent to find an optimal strategy to a game which is exactly what reinforcement learning is often used for and I am just going to do something here and there we go okay moving right along thank you about you for figuring out edit all this extra noise stuff out let's see what's next okay okay so let's go and write a little bit of code and then we're gonna have to come back here just with the whiteboard I know in a second but let's let's start doing a little bit of code here so I'm gonna go into the code I'm gonna go into the bird class and right here I'm noticing okay this is the function that causes the bird to jump up how is that currently decided that is currently decided in sketch KS here when I press a key this will no longer be the case this entire function is now going to be commented out I want the bird to make its own decision whether it should jump up or not so now I'm gonna go over here and I'm going to say this dot brain equals new neural network so the idea here is that the inside the bird object the bird object will have it neural network and its neural network will be the thing that makes the decision whether it should jump or not I'm remembering this is not an original idea I have of course I will include some links in this video's description to other references and papers on neuro evolution but I also want to briefly just point out a bunch of these links which are here these are some other neuro evolution demonstrations that are on github from various other github users there's a floppy learning one and asteroids learning one the steering agent snake neuroevolutionary ssin playing Super Mario so I'll include links to all these as well as well some of these papers and other resources in the video description ok so now here's the thing if you watched any of my neural network tutorials you might have might remember that what do I need to put in here I need to say how many inputs I need to say how many outputs and I need to say how many hidden nodes so what goes in there this is whatever we have to return to the white board ok so here's the thing this is the game flappy bird I'm going to now architect my neural network down here I need a bunch of inputs I need a bunch of hit in and I need a bunch of outputs let's go with the easy part first the easy part here is perhaps the outputs so let's say I was playing I wanted to train an agent to play a game that used the arrow keys so the the the player of the game can either move up down left or right there's four option I would have four outputs I want a vector with four outputs each representing the probability or the confidence score of whether it's the play the agent should move up move down move left or right in this case I don't need for the only decision is jump or don't jump in this case I really only need one output right I can have one output that ranges between 0 and 1 if it's greater than 0.5 jump if it's less than 0.5 don't jump let's just do that so let's do that that's going to make our life so much easier so I'm just gonna have one output oh so simple we'll do some other I'll do some other examples in other videos with more complexity one output now how many inputs this gets a little harder now wouldn't it be nice if I could write some generic code that's basically going to work for any game as long as I have a way of evaluating the score of the game the same code will work for everything and one way of doing that would actually be the pixels of the game as inputs so maybe I take the the visuals of the game I sample it down to a lower resolution image i flatten that into an array I take the brightness of every pixel I feed that in as the inputs that's certainly one thing I could do I would love to try that as an experiment in as a counterpoint of the way I'm going to do it in this video I'm instead going to take somewhat of a higher level approach and I'm gonna do some feature extraction manually with my brain I'm going to say that I think I do have this oh I shouldn't use this headband to erase that's a bad idea alright I have a paper towel I will use that I'm going to decide that I think that the important properties the inputs should be the Y location of the bird the X location of the closest pipe the Y location of the top pipe and the Y location of the bottom pipe how many inputs is that for so I'm going to have 1 2 3 4 inputs and 1 output and I don't really need to have these bracket things here okay so I've decided how many inputs and how many outputs so now the other question is how many hidden nodes should I have this is a very complicated problem this might work was just one hidden node it might work with no hidden layer at all even in fact it might work with just two of these inputs and be able to figure it out but let's just decide that we're also gonna use four just for the sake of having some hidden nodes we can experiment does it work better if I make 64 hidden or four or eight trial and error is your friend machine learning systems okay so now this is now the diagram of the neural network I must sit here and connect all of the various lines alright so the inputs come in here and the output comes in here for inputs for hidden one output if you want to learn more about how a neural network works all of the internals that are going on here what all these connections are in the weights refer you back to my neural network tutorial series but this is pretty similar also to what I did in the color predictor there were three inputs and two outputs I can't remember all right all right so now we've decided that I want to have four inputs four hidden nodes and one output so we now have the brain of our bird and then in updates the bird is going to decide oh oh this is more complicated than I thought let's write a new function let's write a function called think so in think basically what I want to do is I want to say let the output equal the this dot brain predict and I want to send in the inputs so for example the inputs have to be an array of four numbers right so they would look like something like this I'm gonna put them in there and then I'm just gonna say and if the output is greater than 0.5 then this dot up right so this is the idea here that the neural network library that I'm using has a function called predict when I call that function I send in the inputs the inputs go feed through times the weights some activation function times the weights some activation function I get the output and based on that output if it's greater than 0.5 the bird jumps if it's less than 0.5 the bird doesn't do anything but this is no good here right this is just B let's just see if this works though I mean these are hardcoded inputs that never change that's not what I want but let's just at least see if I don't get any errors so I'm gonna in here now I'm gonna I'm gonna add something I'm gonna say bird dot Fink and I'm going to run the sketch again look look at that it's thinking it's jumping right it decided every time it's basically always going to be up at the top or at the bottom right because it's getting the same inputs over and over again now what I need to do is actually make inputs out of these values these values its Y position top bottom and the x position of the pipe okay let's do that so now I'm going to say digit it back in the bird I'm gonna say let inputs equal an empty array I'm going to say inputs 0 is this birds Y position Y position inputs 1 is oh boy okay here's the problem now I need to know about the pipes so I am a bird and I need to know about the pipes how do I do that so maybe what I'll do is I'll take in as an argument to this funk I will take in the pipes array so that is sent into the pink function now I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna say I'm just gonna do pipes index 0 this is a bad idea but let's just start with this pipes index 0 top inputs to equal pipes index 0 bottom inputs 3 equal pipes index 0 X right so this is the idea here I want all of those things to be the inputs to the neural network I don't need this anymore right because I am getting them from the properties that's it and now let me run this and see what happens yeah it's kind of jumping all the time it's kind of jumping all the time alright so this did enjoy seeing the Bravo look oh it's doing something that would actually kind of look did something and make some its own decisions this that was very exciting all right well what I've got some problems here number one is when I sort of made my pretend version of it I purposely made numbers between 0 & 1 so one thing I should really do is normalize all these values that's a pretty typical thing to sort of clean your data so what I'm going to do is I'm say this dot Y divided by height this dot top divided by height and this on the pipes bottom divided by height and the pipes X divided by width so let's do that and identify let's get rid of this now you know does this nothing really different is gonna happen here I'm gonna run this a bunch of times oh that was a good one right those are pretty good fun all right so you can see that it's doing something it's trying to think but I've got another problem I don't know is pipes 0 the right pipe I think I need to I probably need an algorithm to check which pipe is actually the one closest when you remember let me look at the main sketch how do I add the pipes yeah so first of all the pipes are getting added to the end and when did the if the pipe goes offscreen it gets deleted from its spot which would typically be the earliest one so he might work but let's let's be smart about this let's actually let's just say that I'm probably this is probably overdoing it but let's actually find the closest pipe so I'm gonna assume the closest pipe is pipes index 0 then I am going to look at all of the pipes starting with 1 and I'm gonna say oh actually you know what let's do this and I want closest different closest D being the closest distance to be the absolute value of this X minus closest X ok then I'm going to say let D equal we can start with 1 here absolute value of this X minus closest closest X and if d is less than closest D then the closest is that particular pipe and the closest D is that new distance so this is a little quick algorithm find the closest pipe here's the thing though I don't want to pipe if it's gone behind me already that one shouldn't matter I got an idea let's get rid of that absolute value thing right because as long as the distance is so what I can do if ok the pipes X minus my x it's positive if it's over here and I want that to be a lower lower number but I don't want it to be negative so as long as D is less than closest D and D is greater than 0 then we're fine but what if this is negative but it wouldn't be at the beginning oh but what just hang out for a second I have to stretch I'm looking at the will fail on the Bertus between two pipes you should use an array of raycast in front of the burners input distance between obstacle like how selfdriving car works yeah she does probably what I should do closest equals PI this not X oh yeah and that should be pipes index I yeah I have a type on line 34 yes I do well as the X version the bird is smaller than the pipes Y position yeah so okay a couple of mistakes here one is this should be pipes index I I'm going to change this to say closest is no and the closest distance is infinity I love that you could type infinity in JavaScript like knows what that is that's a number it could store in memory but what I'm actually going to do here I think this will work now and then I can start with 0 right so as long as it is in front of it that's the closest one so now I can say instead of pipes index 0 I'm going to say closest down here I'm gonna say closest here and closest here and here we go now we are ready Oh cannot read properly top of null all right so what's going on here this dot X minus pipes index I and D is greater than 0 what do I have wrong here because as long as there's at least one pipe you should always get that first one this dot X oh boy [Laughter] oops so the way I program this I've got I've got to say pipe school I took out the absolute value I've got to say pipes index I this dot x right because I want it to be positive like the pipe pipe pipe pipe pipe everything goes past it okay this should be fine uh hmm or not Oh X dot X pipe next I dot X okay there we go so I can do this a bunch of times and we can see I'm gonna get a bunch of random birds that are doing sort of random things whoo all right I think this is gonna be a multipartner coding challenge I am now wrapping up the end of this first part because just to summarize what have I done so far I have built a system where I have the game flappy bird I have developed a neural network architecture for the bird to read in the state sort of evaluate the state of the game make a guess as to what it should do should it jump up should it not based on that and then I have put that into motion that neural network is part of the bird object now it has a brain for 401 and then it has a think function which sends the data about the gain into the neural network and decides to go up or not now what I need to do is actually implement the neuro evolution part so I've been implemented the neuro part I designed a way for the bird to make a decision based on how its evaluating the scene and what I need to do now is make a population of them and try them all and evolve them over time so I'm going to take a little break here I'm going to meditate for a minute on how much my brain doesn't work as well as a simple multilayer perceptron and I will be back in the next video to actually implement the genetic algorithm part thank you for tuning in and being on this journey with me all right ah yes Eric points out the numbers for the pipes are going to be the same for every bird so do that part in the draw loop that's true I think however this that's a nice optimization and efficiency but in terms of demonstrating this idea for games where the agents would be in different places and would actually have kind of different inputs I think I'm gonna just leave it there because it's fast enough I mean there's not it's not this algorithm is nothing that's really gonna be slow there's like two or three pipes every time all right I just I feel like can I just really just I can't because I don't have time I just I I wasn't happy with how that went maybe not sure you can like edit it in such a way that I'll feel less like I was lost it's fine I kind of want to do this I have this sort of thing where for so I noticed that if I make a coding challenge that I shouldn't worry about this but my coding challenges that are just one part get viewed a lot more than if they're multipart but I shouldn't be optimizing for views I should be optimizing for making good useful content and this needs to be in multiple parts I mean I couldn't make it in one part but then it'll be an hour or so video and I think it's better to break it up alright I don't know I never know what to do your predict method returns an array oh boy that is such a good point oh my goodness Christopher thank you you're predictable it returns an eraser oh that's the first thing I need to fix that's the first thing I need to fix in the next video interest let me just check it see if it's actually like the behavior weirdly just curious just curious to evaluate this for a second see what kind of numbers it's getting yeah okay all right you just fix the fact that I have a lunatic in post please thank you very much I'm sure that'll be possible all right what time is it 3 o'clock we gotta get moving player folks 45 minutes I can do this 45 minutes I got through the main part all right I don't think that's doing anything I really wanted that console.log is making me crazy know why it's making me crazy but it bothers me all right why am I not using to output I probably should have used two outputs yeah I when I made my example I did use two outputs but hopefully it'll work with just one output all right I'm gonna keep moving on here all right let's reset the cameras the cameras not go off during that whole time period it seems impossible that that wasn't yeah I know I removed this zero I did that on purpose because it's got to be in the next section it's so sad because I get that over there and it was like perfect it slipped and I caught it it was like really cool looking cool I was like oh I wasn't in the right camera we just go over here and show my my manual dexterity okay never mind moving on I am back for part two of neuro evolution with floppy train I don't know slappy something you can see here I now have this neural network which is driving this circle it's not really working so the problem is I only have one I need to make a population of them so that I can pick and choose the ones that are making smart decisions somehow and making their way through this maze of pipes but before I even do that in the chat thank you Christopher mistake was pointed out which is that I forgot that my neural network library just like it expects as its inputs an array of values it expect it gives you back as its output an array of values and I forgot about that because even if it's one value it's still coming back in an array so I need to say index zero here so what I want to know is that first element of the array is it greater than 0.5 or not the truth of the matter is nothing's really happening yet kind of getting the same so but you can see things are possible all right so now let's see what we can do here the first thing that I need to do is I'm going to make a new JavaScript file and I'm gonna call this G AJ s so I'm not gonna make a population class or genetic algorithm class I have a would like to at some point refactor what I'm doing here into a more a package way that you might be able to just like use it as a library as part of the toy neural network library has some functionality for genetic algorithms built into it but I'm just gonna write all the raw code here and the main thing that I need to do first is I need to change the idea of having a single bird too many birds and I want to use cons it's so exciting when I use Const I'm gonna make a population total total I'll just call this like total and I'll make it 100 so what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say I equals 0 I is less than total and then I plus plus so I'm going to make a population of birds birds index I is a new bird then what I'm gonna do here is I have let me just do this here for let bird of birds I'm going to use that for of loop to just loop through and have every bird think update and show now I haven't done that I gotta fix this thing with the pipes so let me just comment this out for a second but let's at least see all the whole population going so you can see yeah that's kind of interesting it's definitely like there but they're doing different stuff now they really are yeah well done I just I got to think for a second now in my example version of this that I made this is a pause moment for a second if I go to my example that I made for my class a while back when it starts there really like a much bigger variety of stuff happening so one thing is let me change the transparency a little bit but was there anything else that I'm doing in this example that would that I'm forgotten about here could it possibly just be that having two outputs is actually gives more variety all right so I'm gonna I got to think about this all right so one thing I want to do here just visually I want to be able to get a better sense of the birds so I'm gonna look at the birds show function and I'm gonna say stroke 255 and fill 255 comma 50 like I'm gonna give them some alpha so you can see that most of them are doing exactly the same thing ah there we go there's sort of a variety there I'm just kind of a little suspicious here let me try two outputs let me see if two outputs actually yields some more unique results so in that case with two outputs what I actually just want to do is something like if output 0 is greater than output 1 so let's try that for a second yeah it's kind of the same maybe I just want to have a bigger population yeah there we go just had a bigger population so I just want have a bigger population because I'm gonna need more possibilities okay so now here's the thing I need to do something else rather important I need to eliminate any birds when they no longer when they when they hit one of the pipes so now what I need to do is as I'm going through here I also want to say for let J equal birds dot Birds dot length minus 1 J is greater than equal to 0 J minus minus and I could use filter or something but I'm not gonna use filter I'm gonna come back to that another time and then what I want to do is I want to say I want to have this if pipes index I hits Birds index J birds dot splice J comma 1 so this is now me deleting any birds that stopped living there that hit one of the pipes so let's run this and see oh sketch such as error oops I forgot a semicolon here okay let's try this all right so let's see here and see if we can get to anything making none of them making it through that's not a good sign so I would like to at least kind of live in a world where so I'm gonna make it a little easier for them right now in pipe I'm gonna make this I'm increase the spacing to 175 so I'm just gonna make that space between the pipes a little bit easier oh yeah one made it through because I just want to at least kind of increase the chances that there will be some that outperform others right and somewhat random but let's let's see oh this is good okay so we're getting somewhere now what I need to do is I need to think what are the things I need to think about when I have a genetic algorithm timeout for a second is there like a yeah yeah different colors is a good idea so I should do that okay thinking thinking I think I need some water so shadow plays and the chat is saying dan you should input the distance from the pipe and the bird well that is important I'm basically getting that by the nature of the pipes exposition because the bird never moves so if I know the pipes exposition I know the distance so the neural network should be able to kind of learn from that I also just make a much bigger population but all right okay so a couple things number one is I know I'm going to need to have a new generation so let's actually let's let's let's write a function called next generation and just for right now I just want to get sort of like the process going here for next generation I'm gonna say four let I equals 0 I is less than total I plus plus Birds index I equals a new bird a new bird and I know that in the main program if at any point whoops if at any point Birds dot length equals zero then call next generation so now if I run this we should see that at least it's going to let these run as long as there are some birds and then uh nextgen an X Federation is not defined because I forgot to add it here to my index.html file so I need yet another JavaScript file I'm going to call it G ajs ok so now as soon as all of the birds run out Oh made it through oh come on whoops did I forget to like it save next generation I say call it new generation No next generation oh I know what the problem is oh why do I make these errors I put it in live /g eh okay sure come on let's move along folks all right one more time let's with feeling everybody oh look at those two birds maybe their genius that is a genius bird already okay so you get the idea here now I haven't involved as a Realty this is very exciting for me at life it's very strange okay so what I need to do though is this is no good I don't just want to make a whole nest new set of new birds I want to evolve them from the previous generation so in order to do that I need some sort of fitness and so I'm gonna build into each bird object I'm gonna give it a score and also a fitness and I know it's probably not necessary for me to have two variables but the way I'm thinking about it right now this is gonna make it easier and so the idea that the longer a bird lives the more it increases its core so in update right every time update gets called it should get another point so I'm gonna say this dot score plus plus okay so every time update is called its score goes up and then what I want to do at the beginning of next generation is I want to calculate a fitness for every single bird and I want that I want all those Fitness to all those Fitness values to be normalized between zero and one and add up to one and if you watch them my previous genetic algorithm tutorials you'll see why I'm doing that I need each fitness value to be a probability that it gets picked for the next generation so the first thing I'm going to do in next generation is I'm going to calculate all the Fitness values so let me break this out into some functions calculate Fitness so in calculate Fitness what I'm going to do is for every bird I am going to first I need to do is get the sum so I want to say I know I could use the higherorder array function here my brain doesn't think that way some plus equal Birds score so what I want to do is first add up all the scores then for each bird I want to say bird dot fitness equals its own personal score divided by that some so this is a way of kind of calculating and normalizing all the fitness values now maybe I need to make this exponential in some way or be you know power law or some kind of fits your way to think about how the score master Fitness but this is I'm just gonna would use this sort of like linear way of doing it right now I could square the score so let's see fitness equals bird score divided by some so this works for calculating all the fitness values now I've calculated all the Fitness values I then need to boy I'm moving right along here then what I need to do is I need to pick all right all right all right let's hold on for a second here time out I'm gonna go to my I have a genetic I know where it is we Kate GA slides download my battery's at 100% isn't that nice alright so if you remember from it a few if you happen to watch any of my genetic algorithm tutorials I go through this presentation which walks through the actual algorithm itself so what I need to do so I have evaluated the fitness of each element of the population but here if you look at the next step I need to make the new population I need to ever end times pick two parents with a probability according to relative fitness this is so that I can apply this idea of crossover take half of the DNA of one and half of the DNA and of others and mix them together here's the thing I'm gonna for the purpose of this video do a simplified version of crossover one way that I could do a simplified version of crossover is not to cross over at all instead of taking two elements and combining them I could just take one element and make a copy so I'm gonna take the ones that do well and just make a copy of them and the reason why this is going to be so easy is because I already have as part of the neural oh no yes why did this camera go away it's on it oh it became loose cable got loose because I already have as part of the neural over here as part of the neural network class itself a copy function and guess what I have a mutate function and if I come back over here we're going to see the next step is mutate you take the child's DNA based on a given probability so this is what's nice that I did this in a previous video I added these things to the neural network library that I'm using so now I'm going to go back oh and let me just minimize this I'm going to come back here and I'm gonna say instead of just making any new bird I need to pick one I need to write a function pick one that is going to somehow return one of the birds based on the with a probability map to its fitness so here's the thing we're all the birds where of all the birds gone I kept deleting them any time they'd hit up I deleted it I deleted it here's the problem I think I need a backup what's gonna be nice here is they let birds equal an empty array I'm having an array called saved birds and I guess what I could do is maybe what I'll do this is a little bit silly but every time I delete one I'll just say saved Birds dot push pipe cuz I pretty sure if you delete something from the array it it it gives you it returns right if I say pipes index 0 dot splice 1 whoops sorry pipes splice 1 0 comma 1 right I get that pipe object it gives me that pipe object it gives it to me as an array so what I need to do but I think I can push the array into it and so this should work right if I now have if I make an array which is an empty array and then I say eh okay I know the picked one here hold on no loop thank you very much no ok now I can do what I want I can do whatever I want a dot so let P equal pipe splice 0 1 so P is this array with one pipe into it then I could say let a be an array a dot push P and so now only let's do it a is Oh a is an array with one thing with a pipe in it so that works alright just testing out my idea so what I can do now is when I'm done I'm back to sketch right as I'm removing the birds I can save them so that now when I go into the genetic algorithm pick one I can use I can pick one out of the save Birds so let me just for the sake of our just say let a child equal random saved saved birds return I just want to see that this works alright so I'm just gonna this is not I'm not using the Fitness yet as a probability but I just want to pick a random one just to see that the workflow works return child so birds index and then I'm also gonna say child dot mutate zero point I'm gonna have a 1% mutation chance so I'm gonna let it you take a 10% when if you take 10% of the weights of the neural network and then I'm gonna return that so let's just see if this works and then after I've done that I also have to clear the saved Birds so empty that out so this now the neck every time I want to make a new generation I should calculate all the fitness function values I should pick I should get however many new Birds clear out the SAV birds and go again so here we go as I'm waiting for the next generation come on birds you're doing too well ah child mutate is not a function ah child and of course child on you Tate is not a function oh oh boy I just realized what's going on here time around for a second oh really is this not working the way that I think it is that it's not actually like if I look at save birds right now lips ah what's going on here where did I end up here oh why did I put the pipe in the saved birds that makes no sense I put it in the pipes offscreen oh boy oh why why is coating like this it's much harder when you're trying to do a tutorial and on a live stream do this coding thing oh my goodness that's 320 I got afraid you gotta hurry up alright alright so many brought so many problems with this I don't even know what to say okay there was a little bit of a jump cut because I really went off something like weird direction of it made no sense I don't know if you noticed and we're yelling at that your television machine thing that you're watching me on but for some reason I put this down here I started adding the pipes to the safe birds so apologies for that this is not where that goes the pipes get removed just when they go off screen it's the birds that I want to add to these save birds also I'm not so sure I might be making an array of arrays we just run this for a second and let me let a bunch of birds die and let me look at save birds yeah I made an array of arrays we don't want that we want an array of birds so I could probably use concat but let me just push in the one thing that I'm removing just to fix that and we can see here is there's no birds in there and then now I have an array of birds alright so that's better at least now pick one is still gonna have a problem so why is pick one guy I sort of stopped thinking about what I was doing here I'm taking a bat bird I'm not making a copy of the bird I'm taking that exact bird object and putting it back into the birds array which is fine but if I want to mutate it I need to mutate its brain the neural network so to do that I think what makes them I mean just as a quick I could just like let's write let's put in the bird class itself let's write a mutate function and mute a function I would say this dot brain mutate zero point one so I'm just gonna kind of have this hardcoded in here that when a bird mutates its brain mutates and I think I can get away without actually making a copy of the neural network oh no no no no no I want to make a new bird with the same neural network I think that's gonna be I'm gonna be better off because otherwise I've got to reset all of these numbers and values its velocities got to go back to zero so I don't I want to make a copy of the bird and I kind of want to but I don't really need to make a copy I just need to make a new bird with a brain so if brain right if I create a bird with a brain a bird breaking then I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna make a copy of it just for it's probably unnecessary is brain copy so I'm gonna do that if otherwise if I'm making a bird without a brain I am going to I'm going to just make a bird with a new blank neural network and there's already a copy function that's this way I'm setting myself up for future success if I want to do crossover it's going to be a little bit easier then here what I want to do is in pick one I pick a random bird but I return and then I say let bird equal and then I'm going to say let child equal a new bird with that birds brain oh this is very weird and then I'm going to say child dot mutate okay and then now this should get me the right idea right I'm picking a random bird out of the save birds and making a new bird with the previous birds brain I could do cross over here right if I want to do cross over and then I mutating okay so let's give this a whirl here we go did it did they all die and have a console log for yeah there we go okay so this is working I probably should clear out the pipes so the other thing I should do I think is that would make sense is when also as soon as there's a new generation um I should probably say pipes I just should just like let me just add one pipe and actually you know I'm gonna do I'm gonna make this my own counter this is a little bit unnecessary but I just want to reset the counter back to zero counter plus plus and I'm gonna have a global variable whoops hopefully can't type I'm gonna have a global variable called counter set equal to zero okay so I just want to do that because I want to like I don't want to I mean like I wanted the whole game to restart her two pipes though at the beginning for some reason why is that I'm looking at Sketch j/s because I add a new pipe in setup which I no longer need to do because as long as I put this first in draw now okay there we go okay so now there's one pipe all the birds are trying to play flappy bird as soon as they all go away the whole thing starts over so now we have the work flow we're actually good to go here we are good to go the problem is I need to pick them based on their fitness values here's the good news I have a function this comes from my traveling salesperson coding challenge it comes from this github issue that was filed on August 5th 2016 with this particular algorithm for picking an element from a population based on a given fitness so I'm gonna go over to here actually and I'm gonna grab this exact pick one function and I am going to bring it over and I'm gonna put it in this so if you want to review how this function works in more detail you can go back to my previous videos but I'm just going to paste this right in here and the idea here is that at the end list index is that particular bird that I want and this made it I know I have slice here I can't remember why I did that but basically this what I'm doing here is now instead of picking a random one I'm gonna pick it from that list now I wrote this function with arguments but the good news is I can take this stuff out and what I'm really doing is I'm saying okay birds index dot fitness that's the probability right I'm picking one thing from a list based on probability those were the arguments here I'm picking something for a list based on an array of probabilities so now wherever I see list what I mean is birds and whenever I see probability I mean birds fit fitness the fitness of the bird so this is birds index and I don't know why I have that slice there and then so this is good I'm good there we go so this is an algorithm for choosing a random number and seeing words falls into the sort of spread of all the probability values and again you could go back to my video where I specifically talk through this entire algorithm but I think this is going to do it right now so let's now run this code that's really the last piece and I'm going to let this run for a little while and I know I'm not because cannot read property why of undefined so what what what did I mess up here let's take a look here console dot log bird all right let's see what's happening here piped J s89 even get that far I was so excited that I was done where am I pipe dot j s 18 hits bird and where is that that happened and it's being called in sketchiest line 28 if pipes expert in Luke's Jay save bird splice why the bird doesn't exist hmm oh good thing that happened they might see what I did wrong what did I do wrong choose from saves birds thank you thank you all right I clearly made a mistake thank you IH o RL in the chat I need to be using saved Birds remember birds has nothing so I need to say saved Birds right save Birds so that is something I definitely need to do is that the problem that I'm having I think I might have a different problem also yeah so I think because once all the birds are gone it's kind of doing this one more time next generation right it seems to only have a problem after I call next generation so I must not be so let me go here let me say console dot log nextgeneration console dot log Birds let's look and see what's in there let's see what's going on here ok so here we go I really shouldn't make it to the pipe Cubs book quickly because now I have to wait I have two functions called pick one in the code do I not even realize that so have a lot fun to fly I'm a big array of undefined did I leave like oh oh my goodness I left this function in the code why is that there all right let's see if that it was like using this other pic okay next generation all right all right we're getting somewhere now cannot read property fitness of undefined okay so here we go cannot read property fitness of undefined so let's take a look at saved birds and let's take a look at index all right here we go there's a lot of debugging in this particular video all right whoa what line sixteen oh it was going through all this got through all of them weird ah are the fitness while R is greater than zero all right and then what happened and then we got to the end yeah of course because it never so let's look at the array of 250 first of all let's make our life a little bit simpler by just doing this with ten birds while we're trying to debug this in that way we can have an easier time of figuring this out because there's only ten of them so lift velocity there Phil I want to check the fitness values Fitness is values of all these are zero so my fitness calculations somehow messed up let's look at that so let's look at calculate fitness let's console.log some okay let's come to a look some don't wait wait wait zero that's not good bird dot score let's look at all the birds score whoops scores 96 scores 96 so that's right they're getting a score oh I need to do saved birds here saved Birds so everything here has to be saved Birds I probably should do it the other way around okay there we go the Phineas calculation also needs saved birds probably everybody in the Chad's been telling me this for like the last five minutes now I feel pretty confident here I probably shouldn't I'm gonna take out my console logs and let's see what happens let's see can we get to the next generation yes we got to the next generation now am i seeing anything evolve I don't think so cuz I only have ten so let me give me myself a lot more birds let me give myself a lot more Birds back here I'm gonna say let's give myself 350 Birds and let's run this sketch all right I'll be back in just a few minutes there's a thousand people watching come on birds you can evolve Oh what time is it 340 I'm doing okay so I am not fully confident that oh I know it's there's a bunch of things I definitely want to improve here alright alright so I'm back it's kind of like big God it got a little bit better but there are some things that I really want to improve here that I know that I'm pretty sure we'll make this perform much better first of all it's pretty silly that I have to sit here and like watch it for like a half or an hour to see if what will evolve and there's something I could do very quickly to speed this up because if you think about it I don't I don't need to draw the game at 30 frames per second I could just run the game really really fast I'm just kind of like show it to me every once in a while so I'm actually going to create I'm gonna create a little slider here I feel like this should be part three I'm gonna make a part three because if I'm making a multipart I players will have a part three so hold on alright alright so this did okay they seem to be improving there's some good ones in there that are jumping but I'm gonna wrap up this part too or I finally applied the actual genetic algorithm part to evolving the neural network with a population of these things and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do one more part where I'm gonna improve this I'm gonna do a few things number one whose speed up the process so I could get it to evolve a lot faster and I'm gonna change the way mutation works which I think will give me a slightly it will help me find an optimal solution a bit faster so come back if you want I will be okay welcome to part three of my neuro evolution flappy bird coding challenge alright so yes oh that looks like it should probably should have hit the pipe there but anyway that aside look at these birds they're really trying to get through those gaps in the pipes alright so I want to do a few things to improve number one this is a bit ridiculous that I have to sit here and wait and let it run it's kind of enjoyable I mean if I would have to go soon so I got to speed this up so here's one thing I'm gonna do to speed this up I am going to I don't need to write all of the logic that's driving the game I could just do that many many times per frame right I don't actually need to draw and show the animation so for example if I were so one thing I need to do is separate out all the logic of the game from the drawing so one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to take out pipes show here let me just this is like counter is part of the game logic looping through all the pipes and checking them that's part of the game looping through all the birds if Birds this is part of the game so what I just put up drawing is not so let me take out bird show and now I'm just gonna at the end here set say let for let bird of birds bird show for let pipe of pipes pipe show this should be exactly the same nothing has changed but now and I might as well take the background and put the background here so this is all the drawing stuff and now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say for let n equal 0 n is less than cycles a call it cycles see n plus plus I'm going to do all of the game logic stuff many many times oops which goes all the way down to here so and then I'm gonna say let cycles equal 100 so watch this so now this is just like doing it really really fast over time but I want to be able to like speed it up and slow it down also so one thing that I can do to do that is I am going to say let slider slider equals create slider I'm going to make a slider that goes from 1 to 100 and starts at 1 and that I'm just gonna say slider dot value so I instead of a variable called cycles I'm just going to use the value of that slider so now I've got a little slider here I can speed things up and I can slow them back down so this is gonna help me a lot where instead of having to like speed up the video that you're watching if I'm editing this after the fact I can actually just do this so in fact I could let this go for a little bit and then I could come back and see like how we doing here we got one that's doing pretty well so but here's the thing I also think there are some things that I really need to do to help the help the evolutionary process along one thing is I'm gonna go into the neural network code and look at how I'm doing mutation so this is the mutate function so first of all I'm a little suspicious here I want to make sure that mutation is really happening so let me least console.log test I just want to see I'll call it I just want to see that this is happening in the code somewhere and I'm gonna go back to sketch dog s and just have like three birds because I don't want it to go crazy so as soon as the three are done I should see mutate mutate yeah so I got a bunch of mutation so that's good so that is being called so hopefully the weights are being changed but you know what might work better I think I have a sneaking suspicion is that it might actually help me to rather than when I mutate pick an entirely new weight so you know what's going on here the internals of the neural network are something that I haven't talked about in this series that's really something reserved for my other videos about how neural networks work the only thing that's relevant in this series is the inputs of the game come in the outputs come out and the output tells me whether I should jump or not but what's actually stored inside the neural network or a bunch of numbers between negative 1 and 1 for all of these connections and so mutation means just pluck one of them out and give it a new value but if it's one that's doing sir pretty well I just were to like tweak the value a little bit instead of just giving it a whole new value and also what if I were to just tweak it a tiny bit so use one way I could do that is use a Gaussian distribution of random numbers random numbers that cluster around like a mean of zero but are often like so just like I want to give each a little bit of a nudge so let me come back over here and I'm gonna have to build in Gaussian random number generation into the library the neural network library but right now since I have p5 involved just to fix that I'm gonna comment this out and I'm gonna say return valve so this would be just like me adjusting the value a little bit right return the actual value changed by a little random amount but I think I'm gonna because when I did this for my class last year actually I remember using random Gaussian which is this is now a p5 function from the p5 library this doesn't exist in JavaScript so got to implement that into my library but it'll work for now the mean would be 0 and the standard deviation would be like point 1 let's try that so let's see how this goes oh and let me I took out the console.log and let's give this a whirl now all right so I'm gonna speed this up and I'm also oh wait there's only like two of them so the other thing I need to do is let's get myself a nice population let's try 500 of these all right so there's 500 going I'm gonna speed this up and I'm gonna let this run for a little while and I will be back but at least we look at the chat okay let's see how we're doing here all right so it looks to me like we've done it there you know there's so much variation in here but I've evolved it for now 76 generations and what we see here is that we've got a bunch that are still alive and they're probably one in there that has pretty optimal weights and it's making it through now one thing that I would really like to do is it's kind of more fun to watch this if I show only the one that's kind of doing it bet doing best but at some point there will only be one left but I think we're pretty much there here's some things that you might want it that I would love to do with this in another part but I'm gonna leave them as exercises for the viewer come on over so a couple things one is that I can keep track of the single agent the single bird that has done the best overall time over all generations and I could save that in a variable like the best bird record bird and at anything and what I could do is actually I could download those weights I could save those weights to like a JSON file it's neural network configuration to a JSON file or even just save it in memory and I could always just click a button or something and say let me just see this one so that's something I would really love to add to this it's actually I might as well just show it to you because the example that I made for my course which is here is essentially exactly the same but there's a couple different things so one is I'm gonna so let me just ramp up this speed here so let me let this run for a little while the games may be a little bit different in this one and but so one of the things that I like about this is once I've let it run for a little while I can just click run best so far so now it and I could speed this up a little bit but I think I better train it more because I didn't get a really good one so so this is the idea of being able to just run the best one that's done you know that that has the best high score look at this okay so I'm gonna now I'm gonna do this so we can see this one that kind of has a pretty good sense of how to play the game kind of running just watch that one on its own it's very satisfying to watch like maize that it's doing it so that's one thing that would be worth as an exercise trying to add to this implementation that I made now once I even do that I could save it to a file so there's actually in the toy neural network library there's a like a save Jason I think function so I could save it to a file to reload later so if I'm training it all day or for an hour I could save it and bring it into another biome that's one thing another thing that I might want to do is I could probably optimize the fitness function quite a bit for example what if and this is a thank you to versatility for this this suggestion what if I actually scored not just how long it lasts but how well it maintains its look why location in between the top and bottom of those two pipes so that would be theirs but there you could probably think of many other ways that you could optimize this so saving it making the interface you know now we could also take this and we could go and add all the fun coding train design elements from the original from that flappy bird clone repository pull request now start the floodgates are open so we can make a version of this that maybe has even like a saved pretrained flappy bird agent I'm gonna take I'm gonna pause for a second just look at the chat whoops because I have to take a break just hold on one second also Hey so just like five more minutes I'll come grab you guys okay okay sorry just don't worry this light this live stream has more some stuff is gonna happen but in about ten minutes so but let me see here okay for the fitness shouldn't you divide the bird score with the score of the best bird instead of dividing it by the sum of the scores no I want it to be I want no I don't want the highest Fitness to be one I want all the Fitness values to add up to one that's the way the probability map works use the Y velocity as input okay great so another suggestion that just came in from the chat is the actual Y velocity as an input as well because if I'm already moving up maybe I shouldn't jump verses by moving down so that's something you can add oh and here's another one what if actually instead of feet my own sort of manual feet whoops my own what if actually instead of my own manual feature extraction where I'm kind of evaluating the flappy bird scene to make inputs what if just the pixels what if it was just the pixels of the game itself that became the input but now we have a problem right we have a problem which is that I am looking at a scene let me just speed this up with come on let me just refresh right I am looking at a scene with many many many many birds playing all at once if I want to use the pixels of the game as input I cannot have the whole population there I need to have just the one current bird that is playing so I have to create a graphics context for every single member of the population and in fact this flappy bird game is so simple that actually as the player plays the game it doesn't affect how the game plays out imagine if I were doing my Astro it's coding challenge I can't have them all play in the same world because if one shoots an asteroid the other one hasn't shot that asteroid the game is changing for all of them so another thought experiment it could be how could I actually make this work where I see instead of all of them playing within one canvas a grid of the whole population lots of little little little versions of the game all playing together you know to be honest to make this work I don't have to see anything at all but try doing this with another game can you find my snake challenge my asteroids challenge my Frogger challenge any of those now could be trained a bot could be trained to play that game using the exact same technique so I'm just looking at the chat when I'm inside the pipe I chose the next pipe yeah that's true and people are telling me quickly add that y equals height kills the bird no so I'm not gonna add hold these things they need to be killed when hitting the ground I didn't know that that's part of flappy bird all right from the chat I also just learned that I have a couple mistakes one is that supposedly I guess in their game flappy bird if you go to the bottom you die so I don't have that implemented be introduced to see if it could solve itself with that also the way that I'm finding the closest pipe it's no longer the closest pipe right as it gets right up to it and so I really should not consider to be the closest pipe until it's gone all the way past but there's lots of little tweaks and minor things so I would gladly encourage you to create your own versions of this and submit them as community contributions and I'll look at them and maybe do another live stream next week or whenever I do the next live stream going through and showing some of these community contributions all right so thank you very much for watching this threepart to fuel coding challenge if it was really in three parts IP 23 I look forward to doing more our coding challenges hopefully maybe around a more neural evolution coding challenges because it's kind of one of my favorite topics okay thanks for watching and I'll see you in a future video all right so shadowplay asked Dan shouldn't the pipes have the same position every time you die no I precisely don't want them to I want to train an agent to be able to play any course of pipes I don't like I wanted to be able to work with wherever the pipes may be I don't want it to learn just one specific sequence of pipes can you check if I can turn on live subtitles let me try so I'm in my live dashboard does anybody know where that is so I'm looking I can't believe there are a thousand people watching now this is nuts I have never had a thousand people watching are extreme options normal latency enable DVR monetization cards I don't see an option for live captions unfortunately interesting Carmen in the chat writes for someone who has no knowledge of coding this was actually super informative I started watching knowing nothing and now I kind of understand what's going on that's amazing to me so if you if you're watching this and don't have any knowledge in coding I might suggest going through my beginner p5 tutorials so it's a just almost four o'clock yeah I have I think once before I had a thousand people watching live usually it's between 500 and 600 people so let me just mention what I'm going to be doing next now that I've gotten through this is I'm gonna start using tensorflow j/s so one of the things that I want that I'm going to do next the next thing I'm going to do and I'm gonna be integrating tensorflow chasse into some examples for the ml 5 library ml 5 github Chasse at github I owe so this is a library being developed at ITP which is built on top of tensor yes I'll come back and talk about what all these things are but if you recall the doodle classifier I made for example I want to remake that doodle classifier with a much larger data set and a common something called a convolutional neural network built on top of tends to float yes it'll be much III assume I'd hoped it would be much more accurate and robust that way all right so let's check back on our bird so I what I'm gonna do right now is it's funny my preview is stopped working but I assume people can still see me hello to Nigeria that is unbelievable to me that there's people all over the world watching read some random numbers alright so I'm not done for today I'm done with this project but this live stream is gonna continue for about an hour more I think what I'm gonna do I'm trying to decide whether it should I think what I'm gonna do is is it better for me to say I need like five minutes to get set up with some guests I should just say what the guests are why am I like I like said this like thing where I want it to be a surprise but there's like no reason for that so I have some guests who are coming at own and Guillermo who are going to talk about their work with p5.js in Spanish and they're actually going to show some new materials that they've been making to teach programming in Spanish and they're going to do a tutorial about p5.js in Spanish so that's what's going to happen but it's gonna take me some time to get that all set up so I'm trying to decide if I should stop the stream and just restart it or if I should just like go to a scene that like I could put this on you could be forced to watch this on I don't know if I want to torture people with that so I think I'm gonna just hit stop streaming to give me five minutes to redo the microphone setup and let them get in here and get a new laptop to be comfortable so I'm just gonna pause the livestream just mute sound don't stop people really don't want me so I'm gonna make sure it's okay with hold on I'm gonna mute my microphone I'm gonna I'm gonna microphones back again I'm gonna bring our own and Guillermo in here and I will introduce them in a moment so you're just gonna see people shuffling around I'm gonna but I'm gonna mute my microphone and put on this music Oh best thing okay hello everyone you hello ok I think we're back if anybody before I start introducing the guests if you're watching this if you could just let me know that the sound is ok so I'm actually I could listen here hello 1 2 3 what about to me yeah great ok ok so it might be this one sound I sound a little bit quiet so we turn this one up alright alright so oh my goodness I'm getting like a phone call here this is what a disaster okay so I'm gonna take my cloaking device laptop and I'm gonna move this over here because I'll come sit over here once you guys start I'm gonna watch the chat to see if there are questions and so okay so we have two guests we're I'm gonna I'm gonna switch the mic quickly to the sec the second guest come on over here Guillermo let's see if I this is Aaron and Guillermo I'll let both of you introduce yourself as well um they're here to tell you about work that they've been doing with the p5 jet with the processing foundation with a p5 GS project so we're gonna do a short little walkthrough presentation about what the project that they've been working on and how do more about it and then after that we'll take like a minute or two break then they're also gonna do a tutorial as well for total beginners just be in a different language so if you speak Spanish you're in the right place okay so let me try to not too awkwardly hand you this mic so if you put that in your pocket it is kind of like this is actually one of these like Madonna earpiece but you can just clip it to your shirt so if both of you come over more to this side you can you come in here and you have the perfect and you have the website okay yeah this and I wouldn't fall screen it because that way because where you're standing you can see is like okay hi super excited to be here the contrary my name is sedimentary Moraga is my friend here Montesinos we're both artists and Chilean programmers we are collaborators of p5.js provide the process and foundation and we are teachers of introduction to programming you simply 50s in our own collective with three more friends I sculpt coded any spaces and tell a chili today I'm gonna be talking in English and I'm just gonna be doing saying the same things I'm saying but in spite hola como esta yo seguirá

mood and a welcome party label on Odisha respect OA happy Cinco hood I say particularly yeah so today we're here to tell us to tell you tune great news by the pricing foundation regarding p30s so Peter J is a JavaScript library right that allows you to do pretty premium on the web and sorry in today you see here this is the P 30s website it lives on p5.js org and now in this upper right corner you have a link you have a button that says yes and you can click on it and now the website is available fully in Spanish a toaster lab Rivera primera mucho que de hacer que la pagina debe cinco de sa

Laval cómo encontrar la you yo dig accompli de o plus r2 poor separado a credo in JavaScript they been in develop Rick took Kira Melissa the next part it's called empezar which which means getting started so here you have a cool tutorial about how to start from scratch so it tells you how to use a file to download and then how to create an HTML file that loads a p5 library and then how to start programming in PFI with the setup and draw functions so this is a cool tutorial of how to do your first software using default es ahora si nunca programa OC new capture their mom passing code is on I

interesante a bicyclist mmhmm so continuing the next section would be the reference we say great website where you can check every function and every valuable and everybody who disobey level in the library you can read about it so for example if you go to alpha you have a working example that you can edit if you want you have a description of what the function is for you have a syntax section which tells you how to write the function you said and any parameter that's that's there you also have a description of what it is what type of variable it needs and all of this is now in Spanish and that's for every functional variable but a token is ten comments and on pacing code is a in Faneuil la pagina importante la parte importante sido la referencia es la verdad a Frenship a cinco say

processor stipend LANL post the medium Kailyn so they'll post me Lola fund ocean processing yes so in yeah but so in medium.com sludge processing processing dodge foundation you have to new medium post when it's written in Spanish and when it's written in English allow the whole process for internationalization of the processing foundation educational materials we talk about the process of the website and the book and everybody was involved in this project yeah that's that's the announcement thanks so much it's an honor to be here and we're super excited about the future of this I'm just gonna speak and your mics will pick me up it's fine a little bit here so I'll see if there's any questions in the chat but what I thought what I would love for you guys to do is to maybe if you could just do a brief introduction where you say your names and where you're from involved with coding and the processing foundation just we have that also because I think so just to let people know we're doing this live to make this announcement but the same way that I often then I'm not all the time but we're gonna do it the same way that I sort of do a live stream and then publish edited videos later is we're gonna make this into an announcement video that will most likely be released through the processing foundation YouTube which if you don't already subscribe to you should just search processing foundation on YouTube you'll find it but when this video gets published I'll make a link in the video's description also I'll post it something posted in the chat that would be great so go subscribe to the processing foundation YouTube so I wanted to just get more of an introduction from you guys that we can put just that I think that'll be nice to have and then I think we're gonna stay live and have do a little brief introduction to coding in p5 but only in Spanish so that's going to be like similar to my introduction I've always been that's similar to my introduction to programming videos but there but in Spanish and that will figure out maybe I'd love to have it as like a video that's on the coda trend channel but that might make more sense also the processing funding to go to we'll figure that out there so that's what's happening so maybe I'm gonna I'm gonna step aside and look at the chat a little bit to see if there are any questions and then if you guys can just do a little more introduction about yourself and I have that and you can put that go back to just have a like p5.js website Spanish one perfect people in the Chad who are confused or what's going on I finished all my tutorials for today the VIP versions of the splash stream will be archived and available later and the edited versions will come out next week but we're gonna be here for like another half hour or so to do a bit more tutorial stuff in Spanish so especially if you're a Spanish speaker come join tweet to your friends to come join if you want to listen anyway and just kind of see what we're doing that's great too and of course you could any language you want on the chat is perfectly welcome ok so i'ma let you guys do a bit more interesting stuff sweetly in English and then spin it okay okay is to both in England and the importance party so I'm a Roman to a Moraga I'm a programmer I studied at NYU ATP and I I've been part of the price inflation for some years mostly working on this internationalization of it I've been working on translations of the p5.js book and the pitch ideas website yeah that's it yes I'm here Montesinos I'm Gillian I'm an engineer musician programmer since 2 years ago I've been working in creative coding I started I involved it started to involving p5.js community I've been working in the internal service internationalization process of p5.js to the world last year I studied in the school for poetic computations here in New York and now I've been accepted in 90p so this is so cool that's now in Spanish already Spaniard hola soy yo Monta

LaMarca a koala and air quality in ten Thomas empuja empuja lo lo st. another universal or a software lived as a believer yurt oh yes my second alimony RTT autonomous artery in the school 420 computation yay Bertie Daniel where Sarah to a TV anyway should come in from the chat which I'll ask this is from Red Hen dev I have a Spanish student in my coding Club is there a particular coding concept term in English that is especially difficult or strange so I guess you know to generalize that question have been more like you know well how do you deal with variable names from as you're translating examples and things like that are there particular considerations that you have to make when you're porting and translate things to Spanish yeah answer I think that sometimes there's the same word like library there's sometimes two different translation and it's always a challenge to be consistent when we're talking so sometimes you would use one or the other and the people would confuse that is directly different things but at the same time so for example a library is a constant economy like day the correct our nation would be biblioteca which which is here but library also it's super similar to where Spanish that's called leave the area that's why people usually translated to so and they coexist like there's half and half of material translated both ways and people think they're different things for them oh yeah yeah I think in in the approach of teaching logic like programming logic there's no problem because it's the same mathematical logic and I think there's no problem in to use English words just to explain concepts like if this is a conditional but in Spanish there is other word which is si but I think it doesn't matter because you can use the English name for this tractor so it's okay and in the Declaration of variables or functions I think it's okay to it's the same idea they're similar it's like function is function yeah but yeah that's easy to remember that sometimes things are more obscure like int like int like doesn't make sense in Spanish that well for I think the biggest challenge is that there's no that much material like if you look up in Stack Overflow or in Google and you look for examples in Spanish it's not that much that's we're excited that now all these examples on the website and the book are in Spanish so there's a lot of materials to start with what we're gonna do now is transition to doing the Spanish language tutorial if I'm right this will be a total beginner tutorial so I know a lot of people are probably currently watching if you already know programming maybe you don't speak Spanish so you're welcome to stay we encourage you to stay and watch and give us feedback but the idea here is to take the content that we're going to show you might as well do a live since we're here live I know I did just tweet it out so hopefully a bunch of people have joined might be new to programming or Spanish speakers who are joining and watching now welcome hola and that then this will get re edited and published separately as an introduction to be fine Jess in Spanish for the practice website or wherever we end up figuring out to put it so that I'll let you guys figure out what you want to do so you can just you can it's a sort of silly thing that I do wanna do video stuff it's like I this whole thing is happening live but then I think to myself okay now this new thing is beginning start it that way alright okay great so when I'm in Spanish in three two one go hola um sorry ok this is very normal all this like live production stuff that I normally would not be livestreamed so if we do new screen recording because this is also just a good backup to have I think now so just because one of the things you'll notice is where you're standing is often one might be the friend of something you're showing up which is fine and that way when we edit this later that can get it'll get beta but if you keep kind of over here I mean maybe more room than that so but yeah if you three two one Spanish hola vamos a room tutorial Vidya min embrace our own casinos IBAMA episode of star p5.js a Cinco cotta

for today actually I do have a really ridiculous request I pretend to flame it on the chat but during my live streams as a sort of tradition I sometimes read random numbers okay and so I sure so so hold on so I'm gonna pull this will take us out actually y'all let you do it then I'll say goodbye okay I don't know what this is never gonna be used for it so you could use just one line it does it leave Casali espanol in Spanish this is like it sounds like this there is immunity at the siento cincuenta in seminary siento certainty CD no intake watermill Auto cientos no vent I see a vent you milto siento continually cuatro mil cuatro siento no enter you know ECAC Cinco cero said si de cuatro say stress cero cero Quadro Cointreau trasero say dos dos tres uno dos tres Eden where a quadroon where a press Oh Cho Cinco Oh Cho cero do this the only way to end the live stream is just to come over here and click but I want to just make a couple announcements which is that one so this live stream of the whole time without owning Guillermo here will be archived as long as you scoop exists so that will be there and once this later tonight or sometime this weekend the description for the archived version of live stream will include links to everything about the Spanish p5.js the book their websites and all of their work so you should be an immediate post and all of that the other thing that I hope that will do so in addition to the neuro evolution tutorials that I did earlier today those will come out next week on the coding trade youtube channel the announcement about the spanish p5.js and the spanish p5.js and this p5.js tutorial we will make into a separate standalone video one thing that I think would be great to do trying to do better this with my own content is to make sure everything is captioned to make the videos as accessible as possible so if anyone is out there wants to volunteer to help caption in Spanish or even translate into English so we can have the Spanish tutorial have English captions please feel free to get in touch like write a comment youtube has some features where people can actually just submit those so also subscribe to the processing foundation YouTube channel where I hope that will love this content will will be available or crossposted I don't know the best way of doing that is there anything really important that I said that you should translate into Spanish subscribe to the so tell people in Spanish to subscribe to the processing foundation YouTube in case that's where we end up posting the Spanish language tutorial but no mr. Larry Dixon what can a progressing foundation and YouTube bammo a real in data processing foundation working on YouTube ELP miracle Tao Sukhram see Paquita video avatar puesto en la boca nelly and then going train come on price information I believe if I go here to Community Day you can watch if you haven't watched the processing Community Day videos here they are so thank you everybody for tuning in thank you for all the support in the chapter people were all sudden commenting in all sorts of other languages yeah and I think it's really wonderful and exciting to me that we're finally able to do this it's such a complicated technical thing on the one hand but also just so my know you guys have put in so much work and to all the translation and everything so that's really I'm really excited and thrilled that it's out there you can leave comments on YouTube you can tweet at processing org is on Twitter p5 xj s is the p5 twitter account these guys are also on Twitter yeah so on all the information for all that will be in the video's description alright so uh next livestream will not be next Friday I'm not I have a thing here at ITP allday next Friday so I'm hopefully will pick another day next week to do a livestream otherwise I'll probably make up the week after I trying to do it once a week ok so goodbye I'm gonna just press stop streaming stop recording and I'll see you all next time
