hello and welcome to another guest conductor video here on the coding train now it's been a minute since i had a guest video i'm hoping that 2021 that i can really pick up the pace here i have a goal of having at least one guest video per month and what's a better time to start than march now in case you've missed some of the other guest conductor videos i featured a 3d modeling live stream from chrissy brimage a cozy coding session with aaron davey and a video by amigos code and you can find all of these in the guest conductors playlist on the coding train today i am so excited to feature a video from lily james lily is channeling her engineering education dance training and resourcefulness through queer femme and black identities into a wild and wonderful youtube series twirling tech goddess as a computer science major lily encourages radical diversity and inclusion by making the process of learning tech more fun accessible and relatable to people underrepresented in stem so the very first thing that you should do right now and i'll put up a card and maybe an animation to remind you is go and subscribe to the twirling tech goddess subscribe click the notifications button you don't want to miss anytime lily releases a new video now to be honest i had a pretty hard time picking which video of lilies to feature and show here on the coding train they're all amazing and and i think the word i should really use here is fabulous but i've settled on one and it is called 3d printing a motorized high fashion hat i don't talk a lot about hardware or 3d or fashion on the coding terrain and this is really the one of the main reasons you should make sure to also subscribe to twirling tech goddess you really want to round out your youtube education lili's creativity in using a combination of 3d printing alongside open source models is really aligned with the coding trains goals of making technology approachable as part of this video and thank you to lily james for introducing me to this wonderful organization coding train is making a donation to queer asterisk a coloradobased 501c3 nonprofit providing queer informed counseling services educational trainings and community programming i'll include a link to the queer asterisk website in this video's description where you can learn more and make a donation if you'd also like to support them but we are here to see the twirling tech goddess i will note this is a reposting of an existing video on her channel so what i'd really like you to do as strange as this might sound is stop this video right now pause this video there's a link in the description a card will pop up go and watch it over on her channel if you choose to say that's okay too the video will play you'll get to experience it but whatever you choose make sure you subscribe to the twirling tech goddess turn those notifications on you don't want to miss a video i am so honored to be able to share this youtube channel with you you're in for a real treat if you haven't experienced it before um and i hope to see you in a future cutting train video hi inventors i'm lee lee the twirling tech goddess i'm black i dance i'm queer and i'm an engineer welcome to the twerk shop a show that explicitly encourages radical diversity and inclusion by making the process of learning tech more fun accessible and relatable to people underrepresented in stem each week you'll come along with me as i create something fabulous using cutting edge tools and technologies then i'll put it through my patented twirl test to make sure that it's stage ready that's right we twirl with our tech because you know what they say the family that slays together increases their socioeconomic status together on this episode we're going to be making a motorized headpiece using one of my favorite technologies 3d printing i'll walk you through the hardware and software that we'll be using for the production and design of the headpiece and then i'll introduce you to the motorized element that we'll use to make it move and spin a little backstory when i was on tour as a figure skater a french compatriot of mine noticed that anytime i saw something cute in a shop i would hold it up to my head like so so fall semester i'm walking through the bookstore on campus here and i spot a little heart that's like moving and i knew i needed to have it on my head so i asked the sales clerk where can i get one of those and i basically blacked out as he spouted off all this information about how to make it and i had no idea what i was talking about so here we are two semesters later and i finally have the tools and skills to make it happen so let's get started so this is a 3d printer this one belongs to the school and it was about two thousand dollars this one belongs to me and it's a tenth of the price and a lot less cumbersome so this one doesn't even work so let's get this raggedy piece out of here and get to work this is the bed it gets hot this is the extruder it gets hotter this is the filament you'll use and you feed this filament into the extruder it melts it drips it on the bed makes a 3d print it's amazing there's multiple ways to get the image to the extruder via this processor one of the ways is using an external sd card you can also connect it directly to your laptop using a usb cable or your desktop when it comes to 3d printing you first need the document that you want to print much like any 2d print job on a paper printer you can print a preexisting document or you can create your own document we'll touch more on creating 3d models in a future video where i'll be creating my own high heels today however we'll be using a preexisting document to create a motorized headpiece the documents have authors and those authors are published as specific sites sites such as yegi and cults 3d have 3d prints that authors artists creators post for sale if you purchase the right 3d printer however it may in fact come with some complimentary exclusive 3d models designed by excellent designers for that specific brand such as ultimaker there are also document libraries of sorts that offer open source free download of preexisting document models such as thingiverse which is hands down the most popular and the one we'll be using for this project now let's go over to thingiverse and download the gearheart document link in the description these downloads come in various types and you'll want to look for the stl file to download that one there are other file types but for now we'll just focus on our dot stl files next we'll download a 3d printing app think of this as our print preview for this project i'll be using cura link in the description below from inside cura we'll import our stl file this takes our 3d model and slices it creating a new render that can be printed layer by layer now let's get the document to the printer and let the printer do its thing first i printed a prototype and i'm glad i did because this specific print had an enclosed bottom and i needed an open bottom for the motor after finding the parts that better suited my needs and removing the parts that didn't i merged those files and made a second print which is the one that i provided for you all link in the description and now let's talk post production so depending on the pla you use you may or may not need or want to smooth the surface of your print as you can see up close prints leave layer lines so to smooth that surface you may want to use sandpaper to get rid of some of those lines and you can also soak your piece in acetone or nail polish remover once you've done that you can also prime the surface with a plastidip or primer if you're gonna paint on top of it or adhese any glitter or be dazzling effects so this is your motor it's a few bucks link in the description you can just get these on amazon super simple you power it and it spins this is going to be our external power source it's a battery pack four batteries go inside you can get these in the size of three batteries this four batteries is six volts three batteries is going to be four volts and two batteries is three volts the thing that i love about this is it also has this handy dandy on off switch so we can turn it on and make sure we have power if we see a little spark we know that this is working so i'm going to use these alligator clips available at any hardware store these are a few bucks so that i don't actually have to touch the wires now that they're live and i'm going to connect one of those to each of the rivets on the motor and boom oh super handy so now you'll get the idea if i take the fan piece off pop the headpiece on houston we have liftoff to turn this into a headpiece we're gonna need a few things essentials handydandy glue gun and glue sticks your favorite pair of scissors your least favorite headband and a small tupperware with lid and keep your motor nearby so we're going to build from the bottom up is my strategy so i take the headband which is going to rest here on my head and we're going to glue the bottom or the base of the tupperware onto our headband and that will house the motor and then we'll put our lid on the motor and then hot glue our headpiece onto the lid which will allow the motor to stay weatherproof inside let's get started me so now that this thing is fully assembled i'm already thinking of finishing touches and embellishments that i want to make to cover the headband and cover the tupperware and i invite you to play and have fun with your finishing touches and embellishments please share your photos and videos of your creations down in the comments below and they better not look like mine now let's take this headpiece for a twirl a wearable isn't useful to me if it's not stage ready so i'm gonna go get changed and i'll see y'all on the love mountain like share subscribe turn on your post notifications remember who we become today will determine what we
