is the best do do do hmm all right uh how's my audio it looks like it's quite loud uh let me see what i can do here i meant to adjust this well in advance oh no okay that's better maybe too quiet still the same that's better what's going on here okay um test one two test one two test test test test test test test test that's getting too loud that's getting too loud there we go all right everybody sorry about that audio sounds good it's fine all right hello everyone good morning it's morning for me i know that people are watching from all around the world i have forgotten to turn one of my lights on i don't know that it actually makes that much of a difference let me go ahead and take care of that now you can see it's a little bit brighter maybe it's too bright i'm going to hit start recording so that everything here is archived to disk just in case ah it's been a while since i did a live stream on youtube um i'm glad to be here uh having an interesting summer oh let's start off with something fun so i was recently at uh processing community day in copenhagen where i received this beautiful gift and i meant to pull up all the information about it i have to do that later perhaps this is and i don't know how well you can see this i'm looking at my monitor over to my left an authentic 1950s era danish train whistle the actual whistle that trained conductors in denmark an an actual not the an example of an actual whistle not a not a replica i have this whole beautifully printed and designed information sheet all about the uh history of this particular whistle and for the first time ever i don't know if anyone um uh if anyone in the chat was at processing community day copenhagen please say hello but thank you to the organizers of processing community today copenhagen for this whistle i hereby begin this first live stream of the coding train in a while on youtube with my new train whistle here we go everybody did i build that up enough for you wow i might have just blown out all of your ears all i saw was red on my audio monitor was that a problem uh thank you for asking about my health uh i uh one unfortunately came down with covid like a few weeks ago now to be honest it's taking me a little bit to feel i'm not i don't even know that i'm really 100 i mean i am testing negative and all the symptoms are mostly gone and if you can hear it in my voice there's still a little bit of congestion that i just can't seem to totally shake my energy level is a little bit low but i was just also very inactive for two weeks so i'm slowly getting back into the swing of things um thank you for asking okay so um but i'm very excited to be here with you uh uhoh wucha is on airpods uh i hope you all are fine if the coding train ruins your hearing i don't know i don't know who who you can uh complain to i suppose it would be me all right um so i have a thing oh actually before i get going um let me just thank today's sponsor of the coding train uh these are my friends over at brilliant uh in fact um i was just watching some youtube videos this morning and brilliant ads kept popping up and i thought oh what is the universe telling me it's telling me to go live stream and talk about brilliant or it just knows that i love brilliant um and i think that you would too if you like the coding train and you like learning um the topic that i'm going to cover today is a continuation of uh reviewing my wave function collapse coding challenge which was a 80minute coding challenge that i did over several live streams and one of the fundamental concepts in wave function collapse is the concept of entropy as applied at information theory and whenever you have some topic like that from science from math from from logic i mean from the world of learning is that a world what i'm trying to say to you is where do i turn when i want to learn more about a particular subject that i'm interested in making coding examples about i often turn to brilliant in fact when i come back later in this stream to look at the brilliant website a little more closely they have a whole course on information theory so i'm going to talk about entropy for a little while here and then we'll revisit that brilliant course on entropy and see how that is so anyway um you can sign up for free uh at brilliant.org codingtrain lots of interactive lessons i'll say i'll show you more about that later um you can sign up for free and if you want to unlock all their courses the first 200 people to do the show through that link will receive a 20 off the premium subscription all right back to the matter at hand beta hunter asks how was denmark oh my goodness i loved it i love denmark i also went to sweden um which i absolutely loved um and i just had a wonderful time and i can't wait to go back sometime so all of you um folks from anywhere around the world invite me i would love to come there's so many places i haven't been i could start listing them all um i'm getting a note from simon the uh intrepid uh the probably the person with the most knowledge of coding train history catalog everything uh that that that someone in the chat mentioned that the timer was ticking slowly meaning the the clock in the opening video it is rendered into a video that countdown i wonder if it is inaccurate not exact time i'll have to take a look at that have to investigate i would love to come to india um and hello from nigeria fox the bomb asks how do you take your coffee i like my coffee with oat milk either black i like a single espresso mess maybe with like one little sugar crystal in it maybe if i'm feeling saucy but mostly i like i like oat milk oat milk almond milk is good soy milk could fine with cashew milk is i love all the nut milks they're just i mean oat isn't a nut i guess but i don't like to talk about food on my video show i'm making all these references today to uh a whole podcast network of things that i listen to unnecessarily i could also do this uh because i've got some stuff coming up oh let's announce something you're going to have heard it here first let's see if i can why am i not signed in okay hold on everybody do you mind a bearing with me oh this is so sad hold on i have an idea i have an idea i really should be more prepared for this kind of stuff but i have an idea talk amongst yourselves ah yes i'm signed in okay um so i have to go to my studio hold on i'm giving you guys the scoop here i'm announcing something that well some of the members who are in the member discord know about um but i'm just i have to pull up a secret private link here that i'm going to make public later today let me get that link and let me bring it over here oh i closed that i probably shouldn't have closed that all right here we go yeah i'm signed out of youtube all right everybody if you thought you were excited about today's live stream which is mostly going to be a casual chatting reviewing a previous coding challenge and talking about things that i missed i want to try to explain i mean this is going to be practice because i'm going to have to come back to a video and try to explain shannon entropy in more detail a name for claude shannon i don't know how that's gonna go it's probably gonna be a bit of a mess um so i'll need you to help me through that but anyway live in two days uh i will be having a guest on today's on on saturday's stream uh dr christian hubicki who is a professor at florida state university runs a robotics lab is an expert in i think if i if i go here to the um there should be a video description here um if i do this um we can find out um director of the optimal robotics laboratory his research specializes in bipedal locomotion specifically optimization methods that apply to both legged legged leg robotics and biomechanics so uh christian um dr hubiki does a lot of work with uh the motion locomotion of actual physical robots and as you might be familiar with i do a lot of uh coding examples about simulation not really in not simulating uh robots or even um living creatures in their locomotion maybe maybe i've touched on i've done some kinematics videos i've done some reinforcement learning slash neuroevolution style things anyway uh um christian's gonna be here to teach me about robot controllers and the first one we're gonna look at hopefully this might be a little bit of a series over the next year um is a pid controller uh pro something integration derivative i know i've watched some youtube videos about it and i'm learning about it and he's going to code a simulation in python i'll work on it in p5.js that's happening this saturday um so this is just it's just unlisted right now i'll i just was like still working on the description and you know the thumbnail although i kind of like it um see if anybody can catch the easter egg in this thumbnail right here with these numbers um so uh so i would love uh i'd love for you to tune into this i'm really excited about it um we'll see how that goes okay um now back to today so uh i'm gonna make a a chat uh a list here of things that i'm gonna cover so first i want to follow up about the uh directional horizontal directional drilling let's write that down then we're going to look at wave function collapse and there's a whole bunch of things that i want to look at so i'm going to look at the the passenger showcase um i am going to look at um correct uh corrections and i'm going to look at youtube comments that people have made with some corrections or questions uh i am going to look at a corrections and next steps document and then anything else that comes up i will add here to my list um pete the paper boat says i made a ball balancing robot with a pid controller they're very cool so did you make a physical like an actual robot or a simulation i assume i guess when somebody says i made a robot they're generally making they're generally saying they made a physical robot just for me my mind goes to simulation pretty instantly all right um i'm trying to think of what else that i want to cover the numbers are purple in hex that's a good guess uh i didn't consider that but let's take a look uh let's do background let's go back to this uh oh did i close that window i don't remember what the numbers are 762687 that's a really cool guess i can use that for a future um this lovely purple so i didn't i didn't think of that but we do get this lovely purple from that hex code anybody else uh i would love to give a prize for somebody who gets it but i don't know i don't know how to like find the right person who got it first or whatever that seems scary and like problematic so uh all right let's see um let's go let's talk about let me let me go to the first thing on my list here so first of all in case you haven't seen it and there's a lot more to say and to come about the website this is the new coding train website it's um coming along i really have to thank there's too many people for me to name to thank but uh just to name of couple fun planet and kphone 22 have been the amount of times i've been recorded saying oops that's a good one it could be i haven't done an accounting of that i would love for somebody to do that um have been importing so much of the content from the old website over to the new website just the sort of volunteer effort from the community has been amazing um let's see who else i i i i shout out a couple names that jump to my mind but i think if i go here on to into the website's github and i go under insights and i go to contributors we can see here um these are all of these folks here um that i really just need to thank and um for contributing to the website and there's a long list because one of the exciting new things about the website is the passenger showcase so where where is that uh here it is so um so here is uh chris sears bezier arch synth wave animation uh based off of um the coding train bezier curve video and if i go to any of the challenges for example come on come on website you can do it what's happening twitter was down for a little while is the internet broken today i see by the way a simon is typing dot dot dot out of the corner of my eye and i just have to wonder so there is um jasper is asking about it i hesitate to show this because it's still in progress but on the about page i don't know why i can't get any of the pages on the website to load am i clicking incorrectly have i lost the ability to use the internet what is going on uh the number of minutes recording people are doing really great guesses about the 762687 that is not it number of minutes recorded on the coding train um the route challenge is broken what is going on how could this be ah what happened where's my like technical difficulty slide and music this is insane is the internet working i mean obviously i'm streaming you're seeing me i have a green light over there for my connection did netlify go down so interestingly enough this laptop is connected through a mesh wifi network and my streaming pc is hardwired into the ground basically uh and people are saying it works i think there's something wrong with the internet here on my on this particular laptop okay the editor shows up there we go all right that was a temporary little glitch there so here i am on the challenges page and i'm going to go to the most recent challenge horizontal directional drilling which was a collaboration with uh practical engineering so if you haven't checked out the practical engineering video about this topic please do i just kind of you know as every opportunity i have i like to alert people to the new website so if you are looking for all the metadata associated with a coding train video of course i expect that most people are going to find the videos on youtube and watch them on youtube the the reason for the website is to make finding the source code that goes with the video more easily any reference links that are in the video are linked here in the description as well as other related videos in particular i can just click over and we can see look at this sponsored live really see i love this this is just like it's like the universe knows i've clicked to a youtube video that's going to show me an ad before i could play it and it's as if i'm playing the ad that's the actual oh and when we got somebody join us remember so much is happening i'm gonna i don't want to skip the ad i feel like you can't skip the brilliant ad i gotta let it play all the way through this is amazing um it's interesting that i'm not signed in also and it just i don't know where it's pulling decide to show that ad and show all these recommendations but let's go here so this is the amazing video from practical engineering um uh yes i'm going to be talking about wave function collapse i i'm just kind of covering i'm being too longwinded about this but i just kind of recapping some recent things that are happening on the coding train so check out the practical engineering video um if you by the way i was going to say all these people have come to my channel now saying came here for practical engineering and you know i i've seen maybe that's not the people should leave comments with a little bit more substance to them i don't want to flood practical engineering's channel with spam but i just wanted to say like if you found this video from the coding train maybe send grady a little note just saying hello there you might appreciate that okay uh um okay yes yes yes simon thanks for that information i got to come back to that all right um so i'm closing this out so the reason why i'm showing this to you is uh you know when in the coding challenge i have this very very very basic simulation of toggling the bias of a horizontal directional drilling machine to carve out a path through the earth with no obstacles with no sensing with no particular goal and the prompt one of the prompts from the videos video that challenge was to ask people to submit and uh create their own variations of this and boy were my expectations wildly exceeded so if i go back to the challenge page on the website oh and that's over here and i go to the expanded game this is a github repository and i guess i should start protecting my main branches that has a little bit of documentation here in the readme and you can currently see now what the current version of the game looks like it's got a much more elaborate interface where you can reverse the drill start and stop there's obstacles there's this fog of uncertainty parameter which makes it so that you can't actually see the obstacles but you can kind of get this view of clues as to where those obstacles might be there's a target that you have to get to whoa i just kind of twisted my ankle there weirdly by the way i always like to show people this is um this is the full view of everything that's in my room here that's what i just kind of twisted my ankle like that for no particular reason um so let's play this game um lots of people have contributed to this i could head over to the insights as well and go to contributors and see all of these different names so thank you to everyone who's participated a special shout out to sergey who is a researcher in applied mathematics mathematics and has really been putting in a lot of effort into this game and simulation and i think um even did something which i was like which i maybe i should do for more of my coding train work which is added a citation link to cite this particular uh simulation and code example in an academic paper so we'll see maybe we can get the coding train cited in more academic papers that would be a fun thing once with our collaboration with a real life robot scientist maybe that where that's that's the future of the coding train here i mean i am i do teach at a university as my day job but you know it's i don't consider myself a um an academic per se i'm i'm a i'm not an academic i just play one on youtube uh okay uh ah so let's actually go ahead and play it now i'm gonna click over to it the interface as you can see is much more elaborate oh ah let's pause so one thing that's really wild first of all i love is that there's a whole animated drilling machine which is just people are still trying to guess 762 687 nobody's gotten it by the way you're off like you're the direction that people are going it's not uh it's not a data an amount of something related to the coding drain i'll just tell you they're often that that's not the that would have been that that's clever i probably should have thought of that but it's not um not what it is all right so first of all we love this animation let's see can i uh pull back a little bit here pullback doesn't seem to be working but maybe i didn't go far enough i can toggle the bias i can uncheck this fog of uncertainty so without it i can see the the geological layers and the actual obstacles let's put that back on visual instructions oh that just takes me to this image oh i think i might have like gone away there okay great i get to start again by the way there's also use by using random seed there's this nice persistent link to this level so you can see here in the uh query string we now have so maybe we should we should see is it a random c it's not this but this would be fun 7 6 2 6 8 7 let's play that one all right this looks like a good one i'm going to see if i can reach the goal i'll stop talking for a second i don't know what's just popping up there if that's a bug or that's supposed to be happening all right i need you can see that my path oh i'm not going to make it am i nope now uh this and you can see you get this whole kind of score uh like a reward for maybe the amount of time the distance you have the drill length i haven't actually done a deep dive into what the score has been this is wild can i pull back no so let's um let's let's refresh we'll try it again all right i think i'm going to be able to get it this one is not doesn't look like that hard a level just need to kind of toggle back and forth to kind of go straight here what is flashing there can anybody tell me all right this should get me there oh so close to this this should get me there oh come on bend back oh okay oops nope let's try this again i'm gonna get this one i need some dramatic music playing i need my dramatic music tracks at the ready okay come on i really gotta sneak around this one as close as possible i think this should do it come on bend bend the popup happens when a checkpoint is added the pull back oh there's checkpoints for pullback points okay uh calculator turned upside down says christiers no that's a good guess all right i feel like i you know me i'm like i have a problem when i'm streaming and like i refuse to just move on to the next thing even though when i clearly should is i'm super stubborn but um let's see here i mean it's possible that a given map is actually impossible i want to try to stay as close to that's possible oh no no no no no it's all about bending right around that was like stop pop oh no i'm gonna get it i see the path now this is harder than i thought it would be or maybe i just picked a really hard level uh see i once again i need to be bending right that's the key um i also should pause and pull back keyboard control might help me here i think there are keyboard controls there we go there we go that's going to get it right ah i was so close pause pause try going down further so you have more room to turn around oh that makes sense good tip everybody i don't know why i was trying to like that makes sense yeah now i see i was kind of taking the wrong approach i was trying to get as tight a turn as possible but actually oh yeah this is so much easier now there we go come on come on come on come on come on no no that comes that was oh man my pixel color detection is by the way this i could also take the randomness out the randomness is just a little bit of noise in there that doesn't make the turning as perfect but all right this is clearly the way to do it don't hit that obstacle close let's go all the way down those give me a lot of room to turn there we go we did it everybody yes train whistle what did i where did i put my new special train with so i put it away all right no it's fine there's too many steps to pull this back out all right everybody okay look at my score ah now we need we need like a share button so we can kind of like wordle tweet it out um all right we made it anyway so i'm really thrilled about this thank you for everybody who contributed there's still plenty more could be done i think a lot of work could probably be done on this to think about how this could be adapted for mobile i believe it does work on mobile but thinking about i think the interaction design as well as the aspect ratio of the sort of scene that you're looking at there's probably a lot of improvements that could be made there all right wow it's 10 35. by the way i have a hard out at noon today so this stream is going to end like promptly at 11 55 like no ifs ands or buts like and not one of those where i say i have to end and then i go an extra half an hour so really really really really stopping all right uh okay oh my back i haven't exercised because i haven't covered my whole body kind of just aches and is weak it's also really hot so it's kind of too hot to go running especially if i have been out of practice so i got to figure this out here got to get some more exercise in i have no ac by the way in the studio it's getting quite warm in here so i might need to start the opposite problem with the winter when it gets too cold in here but i might need to get a fan we'll see all right let's turn our attention back to wave function collapse uh yes christoph b amazon link in the description um so apologies for that so first of all i mean i don't know if i should just be addressing random things here but that's what the live streaming is for to chat with the audience so i'll address this um at one point i had a coding train affiliate shop with amazon so i would link to various books and different things uh from videos and you know i would earn like some small i think it's six percent commission on purchases made through that link at some point amazon cancelled my affiliate i violated some guidelines and maybe i put a link on a place that wasn't approved i have no idea what i did i sent some support emails and whatever appealed it never never rejected no response etc so i gave up first of all i'm not to be honest not a fan of amazon i don't i mean who is i don't know uh so i'm kind of like ah maybe this is a sign from the universe telling me stop uh linking to amazon but i do would like to be able to share um especially like uh books i think that i use for my own research and preparation i have two books that i've written that i could share links to so i was thinking of actually um setting up a store sort of storefront through oh this is not it it's a bookshop it's bookshop.org i think yeah is this it um so this is a um online bookstore that supports local bookstores um and um so i think i can create an account i just haven't had time to do this oh look and we have a new u.s put laureate um you should all listen to the commonplace poetry podcast shout out to friend of friend of coding train commonplace poetry podcast i believe this poet laureate was a guest at one point on that podcast um tell him the coding train sent you um anyway so uh somebody i would love someone to remind me about this because i keep meaning to set it up and then replace all the amazon links with bookshop so uh david suggests a treadmill under my standing desk and alexander says no ifs you say how about a switch all right that was a good one all right um let's see actually just out of curiosity can you even get the nature of code book here looks like you can so that's good i can link through here wonderful the irony here of course is that this book is printed the nature of code is the print version is uh amazon kindle direct basically so which wasn't what i originally set out to do i used a company called createspace at the time which was a printondemand service for selfpublished books um but amazon acquired them so actually this is a great question um and i was thinking of reaching out to some publishing contacts i am you know i have i'm having to eat my words here because all i do is say that i'm doing this and their hat progress has been made but i think i probably should take a couple weeks off from coding train video work and only work on the nature of code book i don't know if you would all accept that for me i mean sometimes i've gone for weeks at a time just for personal stuff and travel and i got covered and i have anxiety issues you know there's all sorts of reasons why i disappear and don't make a video for a month but what i'm saying is uh i'm really having trouble i think it's it's not really like a motivation thing because internally i feel very motivated to work on the nature of code but it's like it's a procrastination issue like i'll do anything to like avoid it so i wonder if i should um really just like close everything else out and just for two weeks like only work on this one idea i have was um using twitch streams as a as a mechanism for just like streaming me working on the book um it would be more of like a silent stream i don't know how distracting that would be how productive it would be but i'm thinking of doing that next week um all right nobody's gotten this yet i'm gonna i'm not gonna reveal it because um you know what you know why i think nobody's gotten this yet is because you have to be an old person uh i i'll have to explain why i'm realizing like you gen z folks you're not thinking on these terms uh so um uh and i want to give too much away there um but um if you write a switch statement in the stream i don't i didn't i don't get the joke about the switch statement uh okay all right twitch streams are better okay all right thanks for the feedback everybody all right i've got to move on to wave function collapse here all right so let's let's take a look at i think i have it featured here so i can just get right to it all right so first of all if you haven't watched this video yet i would love for you i mean you could you could go leave right now and watch it but i mean i would have no complaints if you did that in fact that might be a better use of your time it's quite long i would love to hear your feedback anecdotally and also based on the sort of youtube numbers for it you know part of me was thinking is this a mistake like should i have made a just ten minute explanation of the algorithm summary of it walkthrough of the code print done script it edit it publish it to youtube this is instead my sort of coding train style of an edited version of me building the whole project over hours and hours and hours little animations and hopefully some extra things to help you understand extra references but also a little like little animated jokes and funny moments some sound effects and that kind of thing so but it seems like if i have a big project to tackle like this this is a way of doing it and it has value for the audience so so far so good um if you are looking for the source code for it i'll just click on it right here um this is the p5 web editor um i'm going to dig into the source code a bit deeper and look at the what's currently in the github repository but we can see the algorithm here generating this pc board pcb board like pattern if you want to understand what it's doing you know that whole video will hopefully explain it to you um i really encourage you to take a look at these references different references of links of things if if you're watching the video and something i've referred to is not part of the list file an issue on the coding terrain website you can leave a youtube comment but those i sometimes miss um so file an issue on the coding train website send me a tweet um you can actually uh add it yourself through uh through a pull request so i love your contributions i also just want to highlight this tab which is you know i try to i've made references to many projects artworks games that in the video so you can find all of those here providing credits again if i missed something please let me know so i can add it um this by the way um this is 80 minutes long and is the edited version of what i did over three live streams so if you i would i was gonna say if you are insane but i i don't this is not for the faint of heart but if you might be uh so ketan ketan balakar got it although it's different it's put in a different way so ketan i don't think anybody oh no daniel franklin got it first daniel franklin uh if we can authenticate you i will send you a sticker pack a coding train sticker pack let me write this down youtube uh daniel franklin and somebody in the chat got it before please let me know um but i would love to send uh daniel franklin uh and you know it was just two messages later ketan cake time i'm gonna write down katan let's see if i can send kaitan a sticker pack also ketan baal these are youtube names writing them down i will review the chat i have to figure out how to authenticate you as a real life person but um mason sickler got it okay hold on scroll back in the chat uh i don't see it i you know this chat is being logged so i'll go back and review it mason sickler okay so i'm gonna write down mason sickler uh um yes if you on the keypad if you type out if uh is the audio oh no my audio is going um on the keypad if you type it out you'll get robots all right so not for the faint of heart um not for the faint of heart you this is about nine hours of me doing everything so if you were ever curious about how a coding train coding challenge gets edited into a video and you want to see the raw material it's all there for you uh nothing there's nothing hidden so the reality of everything i went through to produce that video is all there in these three live streams mason sickler looks like mason got it first chris sears also confirmed that in the coding train member discord by the way i didn't think we got a new member uh during this live stream ah pedro oh so here's the ah thank you so pedro brings up an excellent point um right the code for the rubik's cube challenge is not accessible through the link in the video could you update that so this is a major issue and um i haven't been able to go and update so let's go to the rubik's cube challenge and show you what's happening so coding train rubik's cube part one i'm gonna go to this one let's see if we get an ad no we no more ad for brilliant uh hack the planet okay let's skip this um i try to usually be logged in to youtube because i have youtube premium so that i don't show ads but all right so this is going to happen to you a lot here the youtube description also has a lot of the metadata associated with any given video less and i'm trying to improve that if i click here it's going to take me to page not found because there is no p one this is the wrong url but even so even if there were this would still take me to page unfound not found but this coding challenge has not been ported to the new website yet so if i go here under challenges and i start to search and i kind of page through actually finding a given challenge is also a little tricky that i want to work on but if i page through all the challenges i won't find it so um what i just want to see if that 404 page oh you know what's missing from here so here's another thing i just found this 404 page needs to link to the old website so i'm going to write this down 404 page link to old website so the old website is not gone you can still find it and it is i'm going to give you the url for it right now codingtrain.github.io website archive so it's um this your this is no longer being maintained don't file any bugs or issues something's broken on this website not gonna get fixed but if you're looking for old content that seems to be missing from the new website or something that was there before you can still find it i'm gonna go to coding challenges i'm to go to rubik's cube i'm going to go to the challenge and in theory the code should be like i know i did this in processing so i'm going to click there um the code should be here so here you found now the other thing i'll say is in all of this new reorganization there is a new github repo i think it's this there is also this github repo which just has all the code for all the coding challenges so if you just if you don't want to like be navigating through all the different websites links you can also just come to here and find uh rubik's cube one you can find the the code for it here you can um so um alexander said i am doing some redirects to the old website i didn't want to automate this because i really just want to like do away with the old website i don't want people having to go there so i think there's a little bit of a mental block with like i don't want to put in the effort to like redirect everything the point is to have the new website working and to go and update all my youtube descriptions if you would like to help with this what you can do is i'm going to go to thecodingtrain.com i'm going to go under guides and i'm going to look at this maintaining the website guide so if i click on this guide this guide will show you how to add a page to the coding train website for a video that doesn't exist and um you'll you'll see that if i go to the let's see if we can go to the repo i'm sure there is a link to it at some point here maybe this is an issue that it's not easily findable um just looking yeah huh well i know where it is is there a link to the github like right about maybe under the about there's a link to github here just curious where oh probably in the huh so i probably should maybe in the footer i mean it goes to the coding train github but actually have a link to very specifically to the the coding terrain website it's not a big deal it's the first pin repo so i'm i'm overthinking this all right if i go under pull requests you will see here that people are opening pull retracts this one's from kfon 22 who uh has um opened a pull request for the chaos game coding challenge so and we can see so you can participate in this at this point kind of a volunteer effort with some um some maintainers who work on coding train projects um helping along with it so um but i will say this site uses gatsby and if i go here under redirects like i am specifically redirecting a few things so if there is uh like some of the most visited pages on the old site i'm like redirecting them to the correct website so if you want to pull request any redirects to this json file those will also uh work that would also be welcome um and yes so this has been uh i've talked about this to death on on other streams about the website i don't know what chris which specific aspect chris manning is referring to this could be automated it could be automated but the whole point of me doing this is that the old website has out of date links incomplete information so i don't want to automate bringing all the content over and just have a totally broken website so we're doing it page by page at a time so that everything is corrected and built out it's much more important to me i'd rather have something totally missing than there but broken and if you go through the site maintenance guide we've automated a lot of the steps for you that there's a starting template we've reformatted it in the json format but it does require a manual step to review all the content and correct it and update it to work on the new website um but maybe you're referring to automating all the redirects which i also could do but again i'm that if somebody wants to just take that on great but i'm trying to prioritize the things that are most important to me and my goal here is to have this website really finished and built out with all the content by the start of school in the fall because that tends to be when teachers and students and people around the world are using the resources on the website most okay thank you for the screenshot i also got a screenshot of the chat of mason sickler um okay so tomer is asking such a good question and i i've got to move on here to looking at the passenger showcase but do you look at passengers code only in p5.js no the answer to that is definitely a hundred percent distinctly a no the whole point of what i'm doing is i mean i love p5 you want to use p5 great there's a lot of reasons why you probably do and those they're good reasons but the point of what i'm doing is to share my passion for teaching code and trying code and struggling through code with you and for you to share what you make back with me and when you can you do apply something that i've tried in a different language in a different format in a different way that's the most exciting thing to me so please port it to unity python c plus plus uh do it by hand you want to make a wave function collapse quilt where you execute the algorithm by hand and sell it on etsy i mean you don't have to sell it but i would buy it i would buy that instantly insta buy insta purchase anybody wants to make a wave funk quilt physical thing like please go for it share it with me ah that's that's i would love that ro doc is here ah roadock perfect timing hi ro doc uh thank you for your membership i didn't even realize um yeah and i do want to start doing um more uh challenges in other languages as well but you know the list of things that i would like to do on this channel is very long and the reality is i get to one percent of it um all right so let's move on because i've spent too much time just kind of like rambling away here i'll remind you that even though there's a lot there's not a lot of code happening today although i do have some intention of writing some code we'll see if we'll get to it um saturday i'll be live streaming on saturday and doing a coding challenge so come back on saturday for my robot controllers with um with guest uh um dr christian vicki okay um let's close out a bunch of these tabs we've covered uh the horizontal directional drilling i'm gonna come back to brilliant in a second i've talked about bookshop this is the rubik's cube challenge look let's just compare look at this gray what year was this 2019 you know i wonder though i think in my old studio the lighting was such that the gray didn't show up as much as the lighting in here i mean obviously i do have more gray hair a little selfconscious because i've been recently getting comments i used to yeah you used to only get comments of like wait i just found out how old you are you look like you're 27. now i've recently gotten comments like you look like you aged a lot in your videos which it's been a rough couple years for everybody not not even barely for me compared to i think what other people have been going through all right um all right now back to wave function collapse let's start looking at the python the python the passenger showcase let's see did so we have a little bit of an issue we're having a little bit of an issue with the website which somebody might actually be able to help with if you have experience with gatsby and netlify anybody here is like a gatsby slash deployment to netlify expert please get in touch are you not 27 no by the way my birthday is coming up just putting that out there in the universe is it bastille bastille day today um nothing wrong with i agree i by the way i have a very youthful demeanor i'm feeling my age the coven really got me uh you know i trip triple i had my booster had everything i probably had the variant i'm sure it was omicron which i know has been milder but i i had a rough i had a rough time with it and i have not recovered so fully recovered i have recovered um but i'm hoping it will uh slowly each week i'll um get even better i just i feel like cloudy in the head but i mean i also i'm just like i'm so neurotic about things that i think i might be over like overly like obsessively like analyzing every slight feeling anywhere that's like a possible symptom so all right now so rodak your contribution is not showing up here right now but i do want to show it so somebody remind me um if i haven't notcha code says help with netlify so i will my birthday's not for a couple weeks it's not today so all right so but let's start going through these so one by the way uh if you if you're not a fan or viewer of sable rafe and creative code news and the twitch his twitch channel i'm really inspired by what he does with reviewing projects that are made by his community i do actually think his methodology is better in the sense that there is a theme like flowers for the week whereas these projects shared by the community are tied to a particular algorithm or video but it works for the coding train and it is nice to be able to see a tutorial and see what people have done with that so i do think there's value in both but you should definitely check that out he does a wonderful job reviewing people's doing twitch streams weekly reviews submissions from the community and i would like to start doing more of the same so let's get right to it number one wave function collapse in python with backtracking so let's take a look at this we're going to go over and we can see here that this looks like a port of the wave function collapse algorithm in python and we can see oh look at this now dare i try to run this look at these ooh i love that there's a mondrian one look at these these are fantastic so this is the and by the way i want to address this mistake um that i made i mean what's what's a mistake you know there's a lot of artistic license here like why is this a mistake versus not a mistake but it's a mistake in the sense that if i were trying to reproduce the precise um and not yet yeah i'll be if it's not your code let me know if it's on the page or not um if it's on the page i'm going to get to it if it's not i need people to alert me to be able to look at it during the stream um the original sort of design for this would be to not have into these individual i'm trying to not step out of frame here and cut myself off but not have these little individual squares or these really thin uh thin sort of like rectangles um so that's a mistake that i'll address i really love this one like this is really cool looking uh as well i mean all these are great um i love this sort of like maze generator like thing so these are fantastic so um let's let's try it um that's what today is for let's try see if i can run this let's learn how to do it because i don't do a lot of python so i'm going to open up i'm going to um i'm going to go here and let's go back let's follow these instructions so let me clone this repo and so now i've got the repo i can go into it let's see here let's follow these so this is um these instructions here really have nothing to do with this particular project this has to do with creating a virtual environment so i don't know if you've ever programmed in python i have a video about this hopefully it's not too out of date if you're looking for it where i go through this a bit more detail but the python settings and configuration and dependencies and version that you have on your computer can get re can get tangled up in total spaghetti if you're just constantly like updating and installing things and different projects will not be compatible with certain versions of certain dependencies and it can be a total mess if you just use like one python environment the sort of like global environment of python on your computer actually if you're using online notebooks like a collab notebook that's in essence each notebook is its own kind of virtual environment but the idea here is to set up sort of a sandbox a blank slate version of python that's activated for this particular project so i could have the right version and all the dependencies et cetera so let's see if i can get this going so i think though i want to be uh what um what i would suggest doing is this is my this is actually my own name of of the virtual environment so i'm going to call this with w f c so i want to create a virtual environment called wave function collapse oh and you know what i've got to say python3 because this command v env is the command for python version 3 which i have so that created that virtual environment and then i need to run this activation script essentially which is now in the folder wavefunction collapse which now i can see here i've activated that virtual environment so anything i do right now if i type python whoops python what happened yeah i i guess i need dash v is something else dash dash version we'll see the version of python i'm running for this particular virtual environment right because if i open up a new tab and type python version that's the global python on my computer and i have python 3 installed under python 3. so i created a virtual a virtual environment python environment with python3 now let's go back and i need to install all the requirements the dependencies for this project numpy gotta love numpy opencv now this is interesting like what are these dependencies being used for like what in opencv is b is for this um wavefunction class project that's really interesting now let's just try running python simple pi building a tile sheet uh collapsing building the image and we should see there it is 11am look look at that one i made let's try doing another one now all their arguments where i can make it like higher resolution and stuff i'll have to look through that would be a really cool thing um i really like this one so let's run this one sheet 40x40 tile 7x7 so let's go look in the code and i also be curious like where did these designs come from like there are sort of the canonical example wave function collapse tiles that a lot of different uh examples and repositories use also i'm forgetting that i wanted to start with talking about something a 2007 phd dissertation called model synthesis which i think is a a neglected to reference specifically in my video but that's obviously a really key reference to the origins of the wave function collapse algorithm so let's look at abstract. so yeah so it looks like i could just do i'm just curious what if i change this to 80 by 80. it still says whoops still said 40 by 40. so i'm not so sure what's going on here fine you can install that i don't know if the log was just logging hard coding 40x40 but let's go to which one did i just do uh what should the file name be although i guess i can look at date modified abstract oh so that didn't work something about me changing it to 80 by caused it to fail let's go back 40 by 40 tile 7x7 let's see take a look now yeah so i'm not sure i mean i have to dive deeper into the code but that's something that i would want to be able to uh and maybe it would make sense for me to say something like oh and i know you can't you might not be able to python abstract and then have you know like dimension be 80 or something i don't know i don't know what the uh the proper way to format the arguments but that would be kind of cool zachary that's a great question i'm i'm gonna keep going i wish i could i need to do a better job of collecting people's questions so i can answer them at the end but the the short answer is accurate about do i have online lectures from nyu i mean that's the short answer is yes um uh they're indistinguishable from a lot of my videos because i release them as like publicfacing videos um okay so uh so i want to look a little more at the code just to sort of see like if we could learn anything from it but we can see the data structures look somewhat similar tiles tiles data left side data right side data um low tiles the rotation is here so this looks like a lot of similar kind of code to what i implemented probably with some optimization and improvements i would imagine i love that there's this function about defining the neighbors updating the neighbors find lowest entropy amazing so i love seeing this great work great work okay let's move on thank you uh to shrike for submitting this um let's take a look at wave function collab and i haven't looked at these i mean i've glanced at them but i haven't looked at all these wave function collapsed by asanka sovis so here we have a repo oh i love so first of all i always love to see a nice animated gif in a repos readme to give me a quick view of what's going on there is a blog post amazing that there's a blog post oh fantastic documentation uh explaining the set of tiles these are the ones that i used defining the rules tiles as a class so this is being done now in ah this looks like it's being done ported in processing small comment is a very nitpicky comment but i cannot help myself the convention would be to capitalize the names for a class lowercase for variable names capital for class names and i would recommend doing that um just purely it's just a purely for your own sort of sanity and documentation doesn't affect the functionality but you'll notice here p image is capitalized so that's one little nitpicky comment we can see the tile set creating a new tile object with the image this must be defining oh defining the sides the sides of the tile i'm just trying to understand what the second index value is um zero oh no these are the valid neighbors these these are the valid neighbors the index of the valid neighbors so this is done in looks like it's done more in the sort of first way that i did it function that returns all the tiles that's great i love this documentation where it's all explained this is fantastic work uh one of the awkward things about working in java oh asanka is there in the chat oh yeah i'm so so glad that the whole point of this i love that you're here in the chat wonderful um this is one i'm very impressed with that you did this because this is one of the real heartaches of working in java is to have to deal with these very longwinded um uh statically typed or i don't know if that's the right term but arraylists arrays in javascript are just so flexible and easy to mess with um conclusion um i'm intrigued why are you referencing purlin noise here i'm actually not reading this in detail and then thank you so thank you for but this is amazing um i want to make i want to share this remember to share this through the coding train twitter as well so um really great work um and i would love to see um i just really appreciate this this level of documentation all right um coding adventure that's really the term that's sebastian lags term so but uh uh but uh your coding challenge i guess is where i'm what i'm stuck with all right uh stefano silvreski aperiodic tiling a lot of people made the um okay be warned excellent documentation in the comments here it may take a while to find the right tiling if you're using a generic seed when it manages to complete the grid the output will always be an aperiodic tiling so a lot of people in the comments referenced wong or wang tiles so i need to do some more research uh yes here it is so i definitely would like to read this paper and maybe this is something for a future coding challenge am i doing something totally redundant if i have this as the topic of a future coding challenge or might i take other approaches to this concept of wang or wong titles i'm not sure the proper pronunciation by the way i already can hear my voice going and that's the sort of remnants of kovit i've just been congested sort of sore throat just has not totally gone away okay i know let's run this oh this is amazing this is this is absolutely beautiful and i wish i knew more about this to be able to explain and discuss it further so first of all that didn't seem to take a long time to find the seed at all and i wonder if it's ah i see interesting so ah so there is a hard coated seed in there so for 600 by 600 dimension equals 20 like we could try this seed cool i'm actually also curious to up the dimensions to see what happens you know there's a real joy in just watching these go it's almost you can sort of imagine this crew of little tiny robots inside the computer trying to assemble this pattern so you know i always i always find this to be an interesting question is the sort of beauty of the algorithm in watching it execute animate or is it in the final result and these are not mutually exclusive and these are not yes or no questions but i think it's a really interesting discussion to be had and i certainly find both in the case of weight implementations of wave function collapse to be quite um ah stefano is there too i should try one less 1777 i would love to hear from you uh stefano uh more about implement the actual rules for a periodic tiling what did you mean by that is this kind of a simulation of of sort of the idea of a periodic tiling as visualized through wave function collapse but there's a whole way of creating this pattern without um without using wave function collapse that uses another set of rules and do you think this would make sense for me to tackle as a coding challenge video anyway this is wonderful i'm always curious to look at um i don't know to what extent this looks quite similar to ah yeah so look at this so we can see this is really using my code base which is great i mean that's the whole idea of this and i'm intrigued to see that the um that these are done let's look one thing that i don't love about the p5 web editors don't let me preview these images so if i wanted to i have to just download the sketch but i'm curious to see what these tiles actually look like if it i mean just stop for a second and imagine i guess we can see because we can see the the outline of the grid here but it's almost like you imagine the tiles to be the single rectangle single squares that are rotated and we're actually laying them out in this rotated fashion but we're not uh and actually the tiles are oh why aren't these not previewing that was weird okay i'm at a loss here huh why did they not download anyway i i suppose you can imagine that's so strange i'm not going to i don't know if that's a bug in the p5 web adder or something happening the wave function collapse eventually finds an api italian with those 11 tiles there are actual rules to get a tiling with the wang tiles got it okay thank you for that comment this is so fun okay wonderful um by the way there's also i think a really great i think roon matson and his programming design systems has i thought roon for programming design systems has a nice article about symmetry might have seen it somewhere else maybe it's somewhere else and not in the book yet and but this is a wonderful resource if you haven't found it i haven't seen it before okay moving on i guess i you know so i'm gonna i i really thought i was gonna be able to do a lot more during this live stream and i do want to look at entropy and brilliant but let's keep going let's see if i can get through these before i do that okay so this is gurichi's wavefunction collapse we can see it's directly a fork and the change log here is there's a custom pattern so i wonder if um i'm just curious to see what was changed here circuit inspired so there's a new pattern here with a new set of rules that are noted with a different notation with this underscore all right so i think i need to clone this repo to sort of see oh oh wow look at these ah this is a dream so i'm curious i don't know if you're in the chat um whoever glitchy um but if you are in the chat please say hello because i'm really curious like where did you design these tiles yourself um and i need to find it whoops so let's clone this um i'm going to just make a directory called showcase i should have put the other one in it let's grab this repo let's run a server and see what we've got here wow this is beautiful so look at this pattern from these tiles this is very creative what i find so i mean it's like a circuit design but the sort of alpha blending and gradient of these patterns and it's just really beautiful and unique um if we look at the tiles let's look at these tiles this one is circuit inspired look so first of all there's a lot more tiles this has 20 tiles and we can sort of see like there are some very basic ones like that must connect off of this on the top we can sort of extrapolate what the rules might be um but that's just wonderful i'm always curious we can see that with all of these tiles and permutations it runs rather slow i'm just curious like how far we can maybe push it oops oops wrong one let's take a look at the code here and let's try 30. yeah let's try 30 just curious so now you can see it's running much slower so this is really a lot one thing i didn't pay attention to at all in wave function collapse is um optimizing to get the thing to run faster and if you dig into the algorithm deeper and look at a lot of people's implementations that's what a lot of work goes into but i i do believe that this there's the potential to run this quite a bit faster um i would imagine even just like the processing ports run faster just from sort of running in you know javascript in the browser with no kind of workers or webassembly or webgl or optimization generally run tends to run pretty slow but let's let this generate i'm also amazed at how well this is doing with not getting stuck again there's no i missed quite a few things about recursion and backtracking and various things to help the algorithm not get stuck in generating a pattern it looks like train schematics looks like a subway map yeah those are great comments all right so i'm going to move on but this is absolutely beautiful work thank you so much for sharing this i want it to finish though but i'm going to move on i'll run this more on my own oh you know it's also probably running slow because i've got these all these things running in the background uh okay we are now optimized performance oh fascinating okay so it looks like what we're going to get with this one is not a new design but optimized performance and let's see what we can learn from it so this is also a fork revamp the imperative for loops for higher order functional declarative version optimize several unoptimal loops and the biggest optimization is implementing updates just for proliferating cells also added the possibility to declare nonsquare rectangular canvas okay all right so let's look also original version computed array of valid options for every cell in every loop this is not optimal because the majority of cells don't change the majority doesn't change rules are set in a way that only cells which are adjacent to the collapsed cells is proliferating and therefore we are tracking the array of such proliferation cells and run entropy reduction only on those cells this increases performance a lot and allows computing much larger grids well here we go nacho codes did i um are you uh i'm ah oh wonderful did i are you glitchy i'm confused about which um did i look at yours or i'm not sorry about that i'm kind of trying to keep one eye on the chat but i'm not matching not your youtube name with a github name so let me know if i've looked at yours already or not uh so let's let's try running this first of all i would love to look at the commits so okay so first like i need to get better at um i need to get better at using some of these nice features of javascript like the spread operator um we can see here this is for calculating a rectangular grid that's super helpful you know again this is just using a higher order function by the way my understanding is that the higher order functions are really great can be really great for sort of code being concise but don't necessarily optimize the speed of anything and in fact are often slower than just a sort of raw for loop but i haven't done any deep dive into this um okay these are all just changing for but this i think is the sort of more significant change right this is where i'm drawing everything what is this doing this is just filtering things that are collapsed and then drawing those image ah so this is just the same but it's kind of like saying draw the collapsed ones draw all the noncollapsed ones and then huh i have to think about this more i'm not fully understanding why this third one is here because this seems to me like it would cover everything so i'm not entirely clear what this third one is um but that's i'll come back to that i'll have to look at that later i wanted to sort of look at so this is looking for the minimum entropy this is what i'm okay traversing the whole array every loop is not optimal in fact change proliferation is possible only in some cells noncollapse cells directly adjacent to collapse cells that makes sense so start with all ah so this is a really interesting optimization i understand now if we go back and look at my original code what i'm doing is looking at every cell in the grid and calculating what are the possible states it could be which tiles could fit here but i act what this is proposing that which seems correct to me i have no reason to believe it's not is i only need to do that analysis for cells that are adjacent to collapse cells and that aren't collapsed themselves presumably and so by creating a separate list of cells that need to be checked i only need to work through those that shorter amount and then uh that's what's happening through all of this i have no idea what this is doing i have to investigate uh what a javascript set is uh simon is offering some interesting comments saying that there is maybe an issue with this in that the recursive entropy reduction has never gotten around to um yeah so i would imagine there's a way of doing this with also the recursive entropy reduction that there's like a middle ground there but this is too much for me to cover right now um so let's just keep looking through this but this is fascinating okay so now i've looked through all the changes let's try running it and let's sort of put the pedal to the metal if you will i'm getting a little okay so now all right so i'm just going to rename this whoops just want to put these both in here now we're going to look at this one and let's run them side by side so let's see what's running here let's close this so this is my wave function collapse my original wave function collapse is running at oh hi from china thank you frog stud very kind of you um is running at port 8081 whoops and the optimized version is running at 8082 so let's go sorry this is tricky to manage this because they're all called wave function collapse so this is mine and i'm going to just set the same so let's set them both to 600 by 600 and a dimension of 30. okay so this is mine is now set to that and then this is the showcase one let's also set it to 600 whoops 600 by 600 ah what is going on here by 600 and 30. let's just make sure this looks like the right changed code right no this does not look like the no it is because it's got no that's me i did that hmm wait a second how can i tell where i am all right i need to just rename it hold on this is the one i'm looking for let's call it optimized sorry i know you can't see that so i'm naming renaming them renaming this one wave function collapse optimized so i can actually tell what's going on because i can't tell right now uh and let's go to visual studio code sorry that i have so many things open here let's close this python one i'm going to close this one close this one so now let's open the code for this one we can see i'm the optimized one with dimensions 30 600 by 600 this is strange did i is it did i not clone the right one i think i didn't clone the right one by the way so get remote oh yeah so i totally just messed up i hope that chat is telling me this already and uh whale ai is explaining what the set the set is hold on i've totally screwed this up so thank you for everybody's patience here we're going to the optimized performance and let me make sure i'm getting the correct one which i can see here is v balco and then i'm going to rename that to optimized and we'll look at that in visual studio code okay ah so we're gonna change it to 30 by 30. i know i'm in the right one now and calculate cell size i'm just going to have to assume that this is going to work correctly 30 by 30 and let's close out this is mine i'm just closing out all these extra tabs so i've got mine and i've got optimized optimized is running on port 8081 and mine is running on 8082. so let's take a look at mine first so we can see the speed at which this is running you can get a kind of sense of it let me do a force refresh just to be sure up here okay now oh i don't know why that we paused that one and let's go look at 80 81. oh look at that yeah so this is way faster so definitely a major optimization and um i'm pretty sure this is the same looks like it's the same dimensions i also love how there's something marking what needs to be analyzed and yeah this is great so thank you for this i'm gonna have to dive deeper into this um i would definitely i don't know if um um v balco if you're watching right now i would certainly accept pull requests with some of these changes i might go a little easy on the higher order array functions but uh pull requesting this sort of that this like basic optimization i think um would be great i you know the original code will always stand in the p5 web editor version all right so i've got two more to look at before i start to look a little bit more at entropy and let's look at oh onacha codes not your codes did i get yours did i get yours let's look at uh gab rz's so first of all this is called pretty bad north so if you're not familiar with bad north bad north is a game i believe made by oscar stallberg it uses wave function collapse to create these 3d scenes i would love to say more about it i'm not an expert on it at all it's definitely one of the things i came across in my research about the wave function collapse algorithm townscaper i think it's the sort of newer it's i don't know what the relationship between bad north and the townscaper is but townscaper is certainly um let's see this is a great video to watch which you can sort of see wave function collapse in action in a 3d world uh with incredible um animation and visual design elements like way beyond anything that i've gotten close to doing um and so uh it looks like what we have here um i'm closing all these tabs is and let's go to the code version from gab bar rz uh a basic 3d implementation of a scene uh nope so not your codes where do i find yours is it is it somewhere like is it on twitter is it on the github issue was it merged but not showing up so let me know where i can find yours not your codes so this is really nice to see and i'm sorry that i'm running out of steam a little bit here towards the end of this stream and maybe not having as much mental fortitude to comment on some of these ones i'm getting to later uh this is one of the things i really wanted to discuss today you know i guess there's lots more followup streams i could do about wave function glass but a waiting system i did not and this also relates to the the proper calculation of entropy in particular shannon entropy um but to um uh so i just got a little lightheaded there um to um uh to think of every the possibility of a given image showing up in a tile let's say i have ten possible images that maybe they aren't all don't have equal probability um so thinking about the sort of weighted probability of a given uh like if we're creating a landscape like maybe water is more likely than land which is more likely than mountain or something like that so um and we can see here that there's a wonderful um discussion of a sort of set of to do's i'm just always curious to see if i can peek into you know this looks very similar to what i did everybody is updating and using the spread operator the tile class looks very similar i'm just trying to understand where the 3dness is and where the rules are defined now here they are oh i'm looking in the wrong code base where am i looking how did i get there that's so weird a cell no whoops oh my goodness look at me the interface it's looking like i've totally tricked myself i'm like looking at this and thinking this is a way for me to browse the code that's visual studio code in the background here are the co sorry about that everyone so we can look at grid we can see that um there are slots this term of slot there is sorting and looking at the entropy picking a new option i'm not going to be able to uh i was just sort of hoping to see if i could find uh the rules looks like there is this idea of sockets in a mesh so in 3d it's actually much more complex to connect all these neighbors so it looks like there's a probably a different way of looking at this but i suppose we could find grid.draw i'm sort of curious to see uh look look at the draw function i'm just here to see what uh slot.draw i just wanted to see what are the sort of like native shapes that are being um drawn and it's a it's drawing a particular model so each one of these cells is like a polygonal model that makes sense and i can restart it like what if i i want to close like lower the speed quite a bit yeah so this is great i encourage you to continue this i would love to see more examples not your code submitted it on the site okay so we are now done with the ones that have shown up here and i'm just going to explain to you something that's going on on the website and um so i'm first going to go here into issues so there's an issue happening where not all of the showcase projects are actually showing up on the website and i hope to have this resolved next week sometime now why is this occurring so what's happening is for whatever reason the netlify slash gatsby build process is does a lot of caching to speed up the build of the website and i'm not sure why but the passenger showcase doesn't always update and i was able to get it to update by running clear cache and deploy site you can see that it took an incredible it took 67 minutes to build the site that's not really a sustainable amount of time so i need to figure out how to and we had a little bit of discussion about this here but i need to figure out ways to optimize the build and or not be able to recognize when the passenger showcase has been updated and not have that cached my suspicion is and i have not done any actual analysis that my guess is somehow if i haven't made any changes to this page like the passenger showcase is stored in separate json files in the engine of the site so my suspicion is if i didn't like change the language of the description or change a time code that the page doesn't rebuild it just uses the cached page even if there are new showcase projects i have not this would be something that's happening in gatsby i have not investigated to know what this is true but it's the only thing i can think of because why is it that the showcase sometimes doesn't update even when we merged a pull request so if anybody knows or wants to help resolve that uh roon matson who's uh one of the designers from dsi who built and designed the site is going to be investigating this more next week we have scheduled some time to look at this together but if you have any ideas please let me know but good news is i can find so not your codes i don't see a pull request here but i'm going to go look at unless it was closed already i'm going to look at this one from raw deck so rodak123 so i'm going to have to manually go and look at your project train track car roads and tunnels in processing java so one thing um that i commented on this looks like you uploaded as the sample image one tile so first of all a plus for uploading a low a small image like the preview images shouldn't be they big images because it will cause the website build to take forever because gotta resize them all but this is too small i think so usually i think we want like a 400 by 400 or 800 by 800 image we're looking for but i'm just going to go direct to your your url try this.showcaseprojects.update i don't know if that's a real comment or not um and let's clone this one we've got thankfully we've got a different name and this looks like it is a processing sketch fantastic so we're going to open this up in processing i'm trying to keep this someone please help me find nacho codes project so we can look at it before i go i don't have a lot of time here oh wow so this i've always been wondering about so i want to i really want to add this it looks like so first of all this is fantastic i love of course it's like train tracks i mean this is amazing i love it train whistle for this one so one of the things i love about this is it looks like visually it's overlaying all of the possibilities with alpha transparency and i love the way that looks and kind of gives you a preview of what's to generate so i really want to add that to mine thank you so much for adding that to this i just love it so much uh 800 by 800 but it failed yeah rodak there are some issues um it looks like you have the um member icon please message me in discord and let's get a thread going in discord to try to help you sort this out um so we can get this on the website but this is just absolutely wonderful um and i'm sorry that i'm low on time here to look at this in more detail um but um we can just i can see the amount of effort and time oh look at all of these tiles there's so many where did you get these did you design them yourself is this from some other example it's just wonderful uh i'm going to run this one i'm talking okay last call wow i had this list of things i wanted to go over and do today which i'm not getting to clearly uh lego pc game just like this last call not your codes uh let's see if we can make a guess here not your codes nope youtube is it on youtube ah about studious gammar okay let's try this whoa okay we're looking you drew them ah wave function collapse oh we've got another wow amazing so first of all wonderful job updating this uh this looks like it's i really want to quickly run this so let's quickly run this i'm going to do i'm going to throw caution to the wind here and oh did i lose my python one where is it no ah is it this one yes um so uh i just wanted to activate that i'm just going to use the same throwing caution to the wind and i'm gonna use the uh uh same virtual environment which is oh whoops oh it's also called wave function collapse uh okay so now let's try doing this we're getting pillow and pie game so these i assume are for the graphics engine okay and we're just going to run main dot pi oh amazing oh look how fast this runs so it's great to see how fast this runs in python beautiful job so this is really cool that we have both a python script that just generates the image with no visual and now using pygame i assume is what's this engine for drawing it so wonderful work um jia codes i'm sorry that i'm running out of time here i would love to review this further i encourage everyone to check out um and run this themselves looks like i can go into a different directory to export an image and then maybe there are ways to change the tiles um r to restart look at that fantastic great work i love seeing these i'd be curious to hear more let's make sure we can get this on the website as well all right so um this is a little bit unorthodox here but one of the things i really wanted to talk about on today's stream was entropy and here we are i want to let's let's take the 10 minutes here and let's cover the topic of entropy and who do i have to help me cover the topic of entry v but none other than the sponsor uh you know pretty much the main sponsor of the coding train which is brilliant so if you like the coding train if you like learning and watching my videos hopefully you're inspired by them you maybe they're entertaining for you maybe you learned something but the best way to learn i really believe is by doing it yourself so maybe my videos uh encourage you hey if you want to bring me a kitten you can maybe my videos i we're fostering some kittens i thought maybe i would but my videos inspire you to learn um and try something yourself but brilliant is a website um there's an app tons of courses with interactive lessons and so many ways you can learn so whenever i'm trying to learn a topic i immediately go to the brilliant website so you can sign up for free please do so after the stream today so if you haven't uh sign up at brilliant.org codingtrain for free lets them know that you found brilliant through the coding train yay that's a nice thing for me for you um of course if you are uh interested and want to unlock all the courses i'm going to show you what you can get with a premium subscription and through that link the first 200 people to use it will get 20 off so let's go back and actually look at the brilliant website and um i'm just going to show you here under courses all the different courses so first of all i want to just highlight this beautiful geometry course because if you like making pretty pictures with math with code you're going to get so many ideas from here so you know i've made i think i'm on coding challenge 173 now i'm always looking for more ideas and more things that i could try as a coding challenge this is a literal treasure trove of stuff so i really encourage you to poke around the brilliant website if you're looking for ideas of things you can try with code um what i want to look for is um information theory oh i'm so likely to record i mean i'm literally extremely likely the fact that i'm recommending brilliant on a live stream i mean it's a sponsor i paid to do so but i i do do do i would recommend it regardless um information theory so let's go here knowledge and uncertainty so learn the math behind uncertainty can you put a number on how much you don't know sure you can when you learn something new how should it change your beliefs about how the world works this course gives you tools for managing uncertainty and interpreting information you'll learn cutting edge mathematics like information theory so the concept of entropy i want to come back and do i'll have to revisit this in a future live stream or video to get a little deeper into information theory and entropy um this course i um really has a wonderful set of uh interactive quizzes so let's get started i'm working through this for just a few minutes um and um let's let's try uh let's try just let's let's work together and see what this uh to see what this course is like it says it is said that we live in an information age indeed information is a powerful force that shapes our world and the range of human experience but what does it mean to have information is it something we can have more or less of how do we go about obtaining it so the answer to this question leads to three closely related ideas so information theory i'm basing oh i want to do so many videos on bayesian i mean i've had a little bit in the monte hall problem about bayesian inference but i want to do bayesian text classification spam detection sometime let's go on so we're going to start this journey with alice she's trying to figure out how to ask efficient questions that obtain the most information possible oh this is so good guess who by the way mind sweeper was a lot of people commented on my wavefunction class video why didn't you use mind sweeper which is a great game also to demonstrate information theory and entropy um i was watching a khan academy video about information theory that was talking about um thinking about this idea of a bits a single how much uh you can measure information in terms of bits and a bit being like how many yes or no questions do you need to ask flip a coin so let's keep going through this a terrible crime has been committed a rare and precious diamond was stolen here are the main suspects alice needs to find the criminal by asking a few yes or no questions as possible all right let's see if we can do this suppose alice's strategies go through the suspects one by one by asking was it audrey was it bill how oh this is so good this is such a great way to i hope i don't know i have to ask brilliant if i can use this in a video if i make a video more about entropy um but so um so how many so often so like entropy can be a measured there's almost like a measurement of surprise and i i can see where this is leading to because one of the ways to think about entropy and information theory is to get to the right answer how many yes no questions you need to ask so one way of doing this is just asking individually is it this person is it this person is it this person four four four four that would be sixteen so i guess i only need to ask 15 questions because um by the time you get to 15 the last question you'd be getting the right answer incorrect eight oh eight oh my brain my brain right because eight because wait what did i show the explanation here i think i'm one by one oh on average on average i always miss this ah such an important point see how i i supposedly have some level of expertise in this stuff and i mean it is i've been streaming for two hours and my still getting over like being sick like a week ago and it cut me some slack here but of course the whole point of this is not how that i would i i'm thinking about this is very similar to big o notation i was thinking about what is the maximum number of questions you would have to ask but this is on average i could get lucky and get it on the first try or i could have to ask all of them so on average since they all have an equal likelihood um uh um the average number of questions is 7.5 because 15 is really the right answer okay back to the problem okay let's keep going see this is what i love about brilliant it's giving me these interactive lessons with questions and then it's not the worst case and then if you get it um wrong there's a wonderful like that's the way to learn like i'm not going to forget that next time because i got it wrong um so i'm i'm kind of out of time here i would love to go through more of this what i wanted to do is just i just want to briefly look at um uh here like the thing that i want to skip to this or the bit is the perfect unit for measuring your uncertainty a bit relates to this idea of a single yes or no question and by the way what this is leading to is we could start to design our questions in different ways like uh is the person who committed the crime were they wearing glasses and that might eliminate a certain number and we could start to measure the uncertainty the bits the amount of surprise we have uh in terms of getting the right answer um in in more ways and then uh we can see this formula oh that formula right there this is what i wanted to dive deeper into and i should really use this formula in wave function collapse algorithm but i wanted to mention that here so i would encourage you if you want to learn more about information theory and entropy this is now using the flipping coins to check out brilliant it's a wonderful i'm so grateful to brilliant for sponsoring the coding train um you didn't see it here but a lot of the lessons have a lot of interactivity where you get to drag and dro drag and drop sliders or rearrange puzzle piece pieces they're really fun to play with just that doing that alone but also like gives you ideas of interactive things you could create uh it'd actually be interesting to think about making like a coding trend course on brilliance or something someday you have to consider that so anyway brilliant.org coding training sign up for free lets them know that you found it if you want to unlock all the courses um and all of their features um you can get 20 off of premium subscription it's also a great gift idea somebody's birthday i don't know somebody's birthday is coming up uh you can gift them a premium subscription you know if you don't know what to get somebody they have all the things you want to buy more plastic but they love learning they love math and science it's a great gift all right um please check out brilliant thank you for the sponsorship one last shout out before i go which i meant to cover earlier but um i want to just quickly click over to um the uh references here so this is the uh github oops you're not seeing this oh and thank you tony k for joining very kind of you make sure you sync your discord account um so uh one thing i wanted to mention that i that i would really encourage you to do a deep dive into in particular if you're interested in the tiled model is um to go and look through the um in the original wave function collapse repo which is what i based my coding challenge off of to go to the credits and hold on i'm looking for maybe i'm in the wrong ah yeah used work sorry to go to the used work um you should definitely look at all of these references i didn't do a i i probably should have done a better job of citing the sources for wave function collapse as i was citing wave function collapse but in particular i wanted to highlight a model synthesis um which is a particular algorithm that um paul merrill did a a phd thesis about um this is the thesis in 2009 and it's really really interesting highly detailed long read about a technique for essentially creating these tiled textures using again i haven't had the time to read this through in detail but a different heuristic a different methodology maybe a way of selecting the tiles that might have some advantages maybe there's some pros and some cons between model synthesis but the two are quite similar in interesting ways and i would encourage you to check out this original work um and uh you know i would say the overlapping model is really where wave function collapse takes this idea of model synthesis and placing tiles next to each other and really uh runs with it in this really amazing direction that i hope to get to in a i plan to in a future live stream slash coding challenge so that's all i've got for you today thank you again i didn't get to david snyder i didn't get to your correction so there's um there's a lot of things i made a whole google slides presentation unfortunately i just like out of time but um while we're here i'll just i would encourage you to check out um and help me like help contribute oh you're not seeing this help contribute to this um read me that's in the way function collapse repo because this is my plan so these are some things that i want to do and look at in the future work there was also like a really bizarre thing that happened to me with property names and david snyder submitted this excellent explanation and correction which i wanted to go over today but i've run out of time um but if you have ideas for how to approach the overlapping model things that i should do next steps in refactoring optimization corrections from the video this is my running list of things that i want to cover and do in future live streams and video all right everybody i'm sorry that i have to go i appreciate you all so much don't forget this saturday less than 48 hours from now i will be right here with dr christian hubicki from florida state university from his rob who runs a robotics lab there to talk about robot controllers and this i'm hoping is going to launch a whole new series eventually have some coding challenges on the coding train for simulating robot controllers so that will be happening on saturday at 11 am i've got to go i'm already a minute late to my next meeting no kittens today sorry everybody next time i'll bring you a kitten maybe as i'm playing the outdoor song if i can manage it i'll show you a kitten thanks everybody i will see you next time on the coding train do so you
