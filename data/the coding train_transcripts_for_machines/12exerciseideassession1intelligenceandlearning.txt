hello welcome to a video that comes at the end of session one of intelligence and learning this is a video that goes along with the course that I'm teaching at New York University ITP to School of the Arts okay so I'm making this video just if you happen to have watched this entire playlist you're following this course on my youtube channel a mouse time where you could try to make a creative exercise based on the variety of different search algorithms with grass systems that I've showed you so this page here I will link to it has some of these exercise ideas I'm going to talk you through some of them so one of the things you could really do is you could take any of the examples that I made maize generation with depthfirst search binary tree and just visualize them in a different way in an artistic way it's 3d you're really interesting to see could you do a star path finding in 3d you could actually even have a terrain that's 3d and you're trying to like you don't want to go up and you want to go down this is a viewer actually submitted a project like that which I will try to link to in the description of this video and so so I'll talk you through some of these possibilities so you could make your own visual design you know just as a technical exercise one thing you might try to do is have music in the hallway again take that binary tree example which just puts ten random things in the binary tree but allow the user to enter numbers and have those appear in the tree so it builds up slowly maybe it animates in some interesting way add some physics to it you know the six degrees of Kevin Bacon example I use the sort of dummy small dataset you could try to use build that exact same example but with a much larger data set maybe it's not movies and actors the animal guessing game is so is oh that's when I didn't make a video for I should make a video about that so if you look at this animal guessing game example it's just a little node program that tries to get an animal that you're thinking of and it uses a tree like structure to do that and so making an interactive version of that you know something that I think if you look at the a star example and you know all it does is show you that path that it solves for but if you actually use some of my animus agent examples that have steering agents moving through a space actually look like they're little mice trying to find the finding it oh this was this idea of you know how do you think about the space that you're pathfinding in you know it's really just my examples are just a pure maze I should pull one of them up so I pulled up the a star example and also this maze example now first of all it could be interesting to think about combining these two that's an exercise I actually have a solution to that if you look at the links I created a solution to that but here you know you could really think about the maze in two different ways that wall is it a river so I think just re imagining other ways to visualize these spaces and thinking about this as a terrain there's a lot of possibilities I think that you could that you could explore just using the algorithm verbatim but thinking about the actual space that the algorithm is playing out in a completely different way and putting your own design spin on it what else we have here so you know another thing you could do is I never made a video about like say for example Dijkstra's algorithm and you could investigate that and create something so if you do any of this if you do any of these assignments and you're watching this video share links to what you make in this videos in the comments or tweet them at me at Schiffman and oh it's a variation on one of my examples that's on the github repository you can add it a link to it in the readme file in that directory I gotta have a better system for this so I'm working that out thanks for participating in this session one of intelligence of learning and maybe you'll move on and watch Session two with genetic algorithms
