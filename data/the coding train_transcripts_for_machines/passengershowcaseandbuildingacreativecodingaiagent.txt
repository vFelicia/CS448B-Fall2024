e n he n well uh good morning everyone at least it's morning for me uh how's everybody doing can you hear me okay I'm about to get started here had a few little technical hiccups right before I was about to start and I'm just checking one more thing here oh boy okay hold on we're going to turn on this X and three two one ah good morning oh my oh my good morning hello uh happy Sunday on the coding train uh yes you hear me okay I um have a little screen here where I'm looking at the chat I'm I'm I'm strangely uh uh or I think as usual somewhat under uh prepared here but I'm happy to be here live with you I have um this stream will go until approximately 12 noon Eastern which is an hour and 53 minutes from now uh the first question that I have for you please let me know in the chat where you are watching from one of my favorite things about hosting the coding train here on YouTube is discovering so many viewers from all over the world um I have this desire maybe uh at some point for a future time maybe if I retire from my uh teaching job at NYU I would like to travel the world and visit every single one of you there's so many places I have never been uh and so so um let me know where you're watching from um Finland is in the house you know my son uh that is oddly enough one of his number one I mean maybe it's not odd that is where he always says like let's go to Finland when we talk about where we going to go on vacation this year Finland um Charlotte North Carolina Germany Nepal Korea India strawberg Hungary Algeria Sweden Morocco Germany Brazil Mexico California it's snowing Meek wuk Village California Jeff that sounds uh where in California is that Algeria Nairobi Kenya this is incredible see this is why I asked the question um this is one of the things that um is just wonderful about the community is how Global it is um so many different experiences and backgrounds and points of view that you all bring and I see L is coming from France Whirlwind says Antarctica I would like to believe that that's true and I don't mean to be skeptical but I wonder uh Lithuania Lithuania is where my well thank you mooner from Syria uh thank you for that support um Lithuania is where my grandfather um was from uh interestingly enough okay um my all of my grandparents are immigrants to the US mostly from Eastern Europe areas I could talk about that if people are interested at some point um uh Whirlwind was joking okay thanks for that clarification but if there's a scientist hold up in a some type of lab in Antarctica with the coding train on well that would be it I would be done end scene coding train is over um close to yosity interesting wonderful so the other important piece of information that I would like to know from all of you is how is my audio um I have been working hard to update drivers fix settings I have a empty room which is very echoey I have a a nice high quality lav mic here which I could get really close to and speak into um but um it's not this room is not sound treated but I'm using Nvidia broadcast which is a piece of software I can run on the streaming PC uses the graphics card and a machine learning model to remove the Reverb so um I'm curious how that sounds in the past uh it has uh there there has been glitching clicking and popping so let me know if you hear that great thanks everyone um so I've I've got a pretty good close uh look on the chat here uh I've got my monitor over here so I can see what I'm doing let's yes uh and some of you I know deom made a a comment here in the Discord uh around that there was not the deafening whistle in the opening animation I muted the audio that is a part of that video I'll have to still some glitching uh let me know if other people hear the glitching oh occasional CLI I don't understand so this is really odd let's think about this let me just explain something to you I spent a couple days ago hours in this room recording the video with exact recording a video um you can see what is coming next on the coding Train by looking at this whiteboard here so I spent hours in this room recording the next coding challenge with the echo reduction on not a single click or pop in the audio and suddenly when I come here to stream live it's all of a sudden back why would that be the one thing that is different which kind of makes no sense to me is I'm running uh when I was recording that coding challenge I wasn't actually live streaming I didn't have I don't have they didn't have the soundboard hooked up why should that matter though I was running a different instance of OBS because I run multiple instances of OBS on my computer uh one has a bunch of settings for recording the dis one one has a bunch of settings for live streaming what could it be very frustrating yeah everyone's tell okay so you don't have to tell me anymore I'm aware so the question is uh I'm going to turn off the echo reduction and you can all tell me which is better very frustrating so I thought I was good hi yeah so let's just turn it off for a second um all right my audio is now without the crackling uh so a bunch of good comments one is 2001 Hearn says GPU is doing more work so some Hardware bug is getting triggered that's possible do you need multiple instances of OBS instead of just multiple profiles probably could be done with multiple profiles but I set it up this way a while ago sometimes I actually run both instances of OBS at the same time because I'm trying to record different things and do different things again probably unnecessary but that's my setup um it's definitely the cosmic rays yeah so I think probably the echo is uh better than the glitching so I'm going to just stick with the um echoing now it's also very cold I'm I'm quite frustrated with the world right now because it's my this week it's over now last week was my uh spring break from NYU where I uh have my teaching job and I I I had intended to use last week well I and in fact I sort of did so let's talk about uh some goals that I have I like to put these out there um and I'm sorry I'm uh I'm looking at the chat and thinking about too many things first of all welcome it seems like looking at the chat most of you are familiar with the coding train but I expect there might be some new viewers there uh out there uh maybe you're a little quieter if you are new if you've never watched the coding drain before but you somehow wandered in here please say hello in the chat I would like to know I would like to know where you came from how did you find this um but the coding train is a YouTube channel uh where I uh upload uh tutorials around learning to code in the socalled creative coding space so a lot of graphics and animation sometimes working with text but creative exploratory projects um a lot of physics simulation um some machine learning topics a lot of beginner friendly tutorials the kind of bread and butter of the coating train if you will are these coating challenges marser says first time in the live stream um so um my goal for 2024 is two new videos per month coding challenges uh and uh as well as at least one live stream per month so I was really all set to catch up I was like spring break I'm going to record a video I'm going to do a live stream um but uh I didn't it last week was it just like became so busy I barely got to anything but I did record the next coding challenge sneak preview of what is left over on the Whiteboard here uh this video will come out I want it to come out in March because then I would have gotten my two videos out in March but more likely it'll be early April not April 1st I don't have an April Fool's Day idea a few bunch of years ago I was like I got this idea for an April Fool's video I'm going to do a kind of parody of an old 1980 s Live sketch and I uploaded it to YouTube and nobody watched it small number of people watched it um so oh and nnn says recently admitted to ITP for fall 202 24 uh very excited to meet you um this fall nnn that's wonderful yes so if those of you aren't aware uh my um my day job if you will is teaching at a program called ITP an IMA in New York New York City in Brooklyn New York actually it's a a part program at Tish School of the Arts uh New York University soft body physics crashing Thunder says I watched it okay good so one person in the chat watched my April Fool's video anyway it's supposed to be spring break it's literally 20Â° fhe outside freezing in this room I had the heater cranked up but the heater is very loud so I like to turn it off when I'm streaming we'll see I might have to turn it on a little bit because I'm quite cold I do a little jogging here to warm up some jumping jacks uh um but so I'm very disappointed with my spring break uh which is just freezing I have this little cushion that I stand on just wearing socks though I should probably put on shoes my toes are getting cold I don't know all right so I gotta get a hop to it so what's gonna happen today I have a list of things uh look at me so organized for this live stream I uh let me get let me give you the agenda real quick just want to tell people about shift bot in case you aren't aware of it I want to talk about the passenger showcase and the recent coding challenges I've released um and how I am embarking uh um there's another train riding along Instagram so I'm going to talk about that I want to talk about Discord updates that are going on I already talked about my monthly goals and then I have a project to start working on so the project I'll just get to the project uh more recently um I used to more recently I've been using these live streams to try to work through uh different kinds of projects uh a lot focused on working with different kinds of language models and seeing what kind of shenanigans and experiment I can get up to so I have a project and I am soliciting for anyone who's interested this project it needs to be completed by April 14th I'll talk about what's happening on April 14th uh honestly I need to complete it like with a week before so I can practice with it um and uh it's going to be open source on GitHub so anybody who wants to contribute and help me make this thing uh you're you're you're invited okay so um first thing on my agenda I'm just going to briefly mention it uh if you hadn't seen I've been oh you don't see my screen uh if you hadn't seen this I've been working with uh some researchers at Google uh experimenting with their uh Gemini uh language models and I have made uh with them this goofy little uh p5js helper chatbot I don't know why it's not showing up I got maybe I got to turn it on on come on shift bot where are you there you are this little come on wake up you're very blurry and tired there you go there you go okay this is uh shift bot here in the corner uh who's a friendly little chatbot who um you can ask questions to like um what will be the next coating Challenge on the coding train let's see if shift bot can recognize I mean I just realized it I actually wrote what the coding challenge is on the top there so not too much of a mystery here but let's press enter and see what we get ah Peter Ferell fellow not oh oh I should update about the nature of code book uh that's a good thing to add to my list uh nature of code I got I want to mention that plug I am a robot and don't have access to that information but I can tell look shift bot knows what's on my agenda this is perfect because I need this link because I'm going to talk about the Discord thank you shift bot so anyway I did a whole stream where I played around with shift bot there's lots to say about it but I just wanted to uh what I'm really looking for and what my friends at Google are looking for is feedback and testing of it um I have heard from so many people that it's an ex that they're interested and um perhaps even been intrigued uh to see this uh experiment in a kind of custom bespoke chatbot assistant for Creative coding um and people are really interested in asking about how it was made and all sorts of questions but what I haven't really heard in is about people using it so I know that it's not available you have to join the weight list in certain countries you can't get it but if please join the wait list uh if you have access to it you should have got an email with like a there I think you can write to I I have to find the email there's like a a support email like support at shiot with Google I don't know somebody there's an email you can write to with your feedback uh and so please please do that um astop penguin writes did you become the coolest dad now that you are a robot no my kids have zero interest in this so like the like the ey rolling is at like the top height they height of their eye rolling Powers my teenage children are like uhhuh yeah uh cool robot right uh yeah no you might think that I'm cool H nobody in my family that they they know me as just like the loser that I am that that was too harsh I'm just you know okay uh what else do I want to say all right so I talked about that let me just go right to nature of code um uh so uh I'm going to go to natureof code.com okay so this is my uh book um called nature of code um you know the many of you might be familiar with it uh natureof code.com you can read everything about it but uh you can read all you can read the entire thing it's done I mean actually finished the website is not finished so this is mostly a placeholder design for the website uh hopefully in the next few months there'll be a whole new uh website design with some more features and different things um but this this is a a big expensive project that I worked on and um I would if you're interested oh and there you can uh actually buy the the hard cover and use the coupon code preorder to get 25% off oh download look at this oh cool oh look at these now this is cool I this is new on there look at this some sample Pages this I love this page so this is one of the uh pages from the neural network chapter where I'm talking about a neural network that could be trained to predict the energy use of a home based on different uh properties and you can see this nice little illustration by Zanna Marsh of showing like a single family home a large apartment building so um and I guess we can download chapter 7 um here for free that's cool so please if you're interested of um in physical books uh you can preorder this um today wherever books are sold as well as on the not I think you'll get the I think this 25% off is only available from the no starch website I have gotten a lot of messages from people saying oh the shipping is like you know too much or whatever so um if um the the book will be sold internationally through all the usual channels so if you're looking at this and you're like I can't get it in my country just wait uh it'll probably be available through a local uh retailer um at some point but maybe it just isn't for preorder just yet okay so I mentioned that uh what else all right let's talk about something that is going on now uh I am going to take the next few months to to experiment a bit more with uh Instagram platform uh Karen who is a contributor to p5js is helping me with Instagram and we are launching a a um an initiative to feature passenger showcase projects on Instagram so if you go to uh you if you follow uh the coding train on Instagram at thee. coding.com um if you oh yeah yes pet so hold on a second I'm noticing this comment in the chat from Peter saying book frequently books are counterfeit so I haven't investigated this this is a huge issue happening right now I've um been listening some podcasts from different authors who have been lamenting the fact that there are a lot of these AI generated books uh selfpublished books which which again self the selfpublishing there something that is a good thing nature of code was originally selfpublished I support and encourage people to selfpublish but the the ability to publish quickly and easily and the ability to use generative AI has caused this issue with um you know counterfeit plagiarized or fake books and even these things like I've heard that a lot of popular books will then have these workbooks AI generated workbooks which are not made by the author but Amazon's algorithms will bundle them together anyway so if anybody sees um any counterfeit or uh fake versions of the nature of code out there feel free to let me know I'd be happy to I'll try to do something about that if I can the book is licensed under creative co uh creative commment so the book has a very permissive open Source license um and you can uh read the entire thing for free online there's no reason the only thing you're not allowed to do is resell it I am the only person who can no starch really because I I'm working with them as the publisher who can sell it commercially also a lot of people have contacted me about doing a translation of the nature of code I'm actually uh uh now is the time to ask me about that so maybe write to danielthe codingtrabla would love the book to be translated into as many languages as possible and conceivably that is something that I could do on the website as well that if it's on the doing that myself but I'm more thinking about translations of the print book but maybe I should be thinking the other way around anyway back to Instagram I want to get to working on this project it's already 1030 I'm getting very very very cold I had to do some running in place here I need one of those I I should get like go a treadmill here and I could just live stream while walking on the treadmill okay so um um so every two twice a month every two weeks you will find a post on Instagram that is highlighting a coding challenge uh most recently we highlighted the Souther automata coding Challenge number 179 um and it is uh when we highlight it it's a call for people to submit their projects to the passenger showcase so if you go to the coding tr.com and you go under Community under showcase case you can see here these are all the projects that people have submitted and Beyond just submitting them the point of this is for you also to look at and explore them because my videos just show you the nuts and bolts of a particular concept or algorithm without a lot of kind of creative interpretation and it is my hope that you the viewers will learn something from those videos and inspire you to make your own version and then the Showcase is a place for people to share those back and look at them so um under guides under passenger showcase guide there is a form here and I realize I'm kind of standing in front of it uh where you can submit your work um if you go to any particular video I'll go to the wolf one um then you can also see whoops I don't know what's going on there you can see the uh projects that are submitted for the wolf CA here so um so please um when you see the announcement on Instagram if you hadn't already watched the video it's a chance for you to go back and watch it uh and then you can submit then what we do and uh you know obviously unfortunately we're not able to share everyone's project uh but picking a selection of them you can see them here then um uh uh uh the now this is a selection of them that have been shared uh here's a nice collage of them and then um I'll just show you so this is the wolf Elementary CA rings I love this interpretation of taking the wolf from CA but uh rendering it in a radial pattern uh Kathy here made a version of the wolf from CA with these swirly designs that I absolutely love um this is a version of it with a different kind of rule that I think you could find if you that I didn't explore in the video itself but um coal has explored it uh and then this from Greg kaisman I wonder can I get the audio here hold on I have to turn this on on this is wild to me it's basically rendering the wolf from CA and each cell is a note and then so it's the wolf from CA is playing music really really incredible okay uh and uh here's one with uh adjustable parameters from Ruben King and uh a 3D one from con HF NZ so the other thing is when you are you don't have to to have an Instagram account not at all required but it's not if you happen to it's nice for us to be able to tag you so when you go to the Forum I've lost where it is uh guides passenger showcase guide um here um this is where if you enter your Instagram handle in here then we'll be able to uh if we're able to feature it on Instagram be able to tag you for that but that is um not at all um required I also by the way you know you there is this little box here on the offg you're submitting it to the website but you wouldn't want us to feature it somewhere else um you can check that box uh by private by the way I I have a bad habit of trying to put train buns everywhere in my materials if that bothers you then uh my apologies okay so I am probably so the um this literally just got posted yesterday um I think that for the next uh Instagram passenger showcase feature I am going to feature uh showcase projects from um from of the appoloni and Gasket so now is your chance to get your apponi and Gasket uh projects in I wanted to look at this one just live though th I I can't believe I didn't think to do this during my actual coding challenge video itself I don't know why this isn't loading yeah okay so what I love about this particular one is how it is uh the the actual original Orient so first of all what what am I even talking about if you missed it wasn't one of my more um this the appolloni and Gasket video which is this particular fractal pattern uh was one of the lower viewed challenges in recent months the sand falling one has you know exploded probably had 10 times the amount of Ed I don't know why I'm talking about this it's not that important but um uh my most recent coding challenge is the appoloni gasket it is a fractal pattern where circles are placed and then that are mutually tangent to each other and then smaller circles are placed mutually tangent to those and so on and so forth and you can see a beautiful rendering here in Trevor Sergeant's uh passenger showcase submission um there's lots of this on some level and I say this in the video to me this is uh you know if you wanted to learn about how to do recursive fractal patterns uh this is what I cover in chapter eight of the nature of code and in fact if I scroll down you would find uh you know a pattern like this which looks quite similar to the appolloni gasket in the sense that it's circles inside of circles inside of circles this particular pattern right here here is this much code I don't know what's that 15 20 lines of code one recursive function very basic idea and oh this is uh anyway there's some bugs in the way the the comments are rendered here on the website but regardless of that I kind of thought oh the appolloni and Gasket will be not so uh will be like this but maybe a bit more sophisticated it turns out that the appoloni gasket fractal involves quite a bit of uh pun intended here complex math specifically around complex numbers that's why the video ended up being an hour long but if you're interested I would suggest please go back and watch that video what I love about this one here is the fact that the interaction As you move the mouse around you are arranging the original uh PL the placement of the original circles and I think this is very clever I love kind of going off to the edge and seeing these uh like this like Crescent Moon uh kind of pattern here just uh really nice I the gray scale looks like is mapped also to the original orientation so anyway this is a really really terrific interpretation thank you for sharing that um I look forward to sharing it on Instagram uh yes Circle inversions oh yeah this is circle inversions it's related to that is there I didn't I actually not have not seen this number file video that prep is referencing in the chat okay so that's what I wanted to talk about around the passenger showcase one thing I'll mention is when you submit the form it creates a poll request here and uh I think the this is a poll request from maybe you're in the chat uh the kid um this is your uh Angry Birds uh uh coding challenge submission which I have yet to look at so this is my fault it takes me sometimes like a week to get to reviewing these poll requests and merging them but I will be I will make sure to do that uh after the stream today but we can see there are a bunch there's one actually appolloni and Gasket one oh this is another ah this is actually the one I was looking for I just didn't merge it yet they're two Trevor and also Omar's so this also uses the mouse and look at it ah this also like the original orientation is animating in this rotating way this is wild so this is also this is what I was actually thinking of when I was looking at Trevor's I just hadn't merged this one yet so this is not on the website yet because if it's in the poll request uh CU then so it does take some time for it to PE appear we do moderate uh to make sure you know there's no inappropriate materials in the coding challenges and also I this you know I like to look at all of them so you know I don't read every comment on YouTube I don't read every chat message in the live stream but I look at every single passenger showcase a submission I should be so lucky to have so many that I can't look at them all anymore but um uh we uh but that's not the current state okay so that is me talking about oh I'm very cold the Showcase uh I might just turn the heater on okay everybody uh won't bother you so much and it but let's see if I can go a little longer without it okay so let me close some windows here let's talk about Discord oh so the the the primary platform for the coding train is YouTube uh as well as nebula should mention nebula don't forget about nebula so uh nebula if you go to uh go. nebula.com I really want um I have the opportunity to pitch a nebula original which could be a different something different than what I usually do on the coding train I'm still looking for an idea uh anyway so uh the nebula and YouTube are the primary platforms uh for the coding train um but the I would say the second most important platform for the coding train right now is the Discord so again if you go to the coding train.com and the other thing nobody responded to me here but I'm trying to decide I recently let me go to the website I posted an issue about this so if anybody has thoughts about this please uh pipe in but I recently was able to get uh when I originally was creating the coding Train website coding train.com was not available it recently came up available I had to spend $300 on it which is maybe maybe I overpaid I don't know but I feel like it's there I got to buy it 300 is not like insane so let me just get it um so uh so I have that domain now and I'm trying to decide right now if you go to Just coding coding tr.com will just redirect you to the coding train.com but I'm wondering if I should actually move the whole site to coding train.com if you have thoughts on that um let me know that's not the important thing here uh but the important thing is here is if you go to the coding tr.com Discord that will take you to this page uh which gives you all the information about the Discord you can see we are 10,000 Plus members strong apparently there's 2,000 members online this is a place where you can get help with your code um you can uh connect with other people in the community you can share what you're making you can get notifications from me which is what I'm going to talk about so you can join the server and I am going to go into the server now and look at some things that are new okay so first of all uh Noob Dev 54 who I think is in the chat oh and Nicole is there hi Nicole I have I have the chat here um the cold 314 people live pie people live okay I gotta turn the heat what do you think I should turn the heater on properly right why is it so cold it's supposed to be spring break no I feed my dog Gloria pickle outside because if I feed her inside she often we have cats she tries to eat the cat food so last night it rained overnight I went to get Gloria's Bowl which I had left outside and the bowl was a block of ice it was full of completely frozen water okay um so what am I talking about here ah yeah so Noob Deb thank you so uh uh Kobe that many of you might know uh from the Discord was the manager of the Discord for many years thank you Kobe for your incredible service to the coding train Community uh uh Kobe has moved on from managing the coding train Discord uh onto New Opportunities and Adventures and noobde 54 has now taken it over so one is uh nubd has been doing a lot of work to reorganize the channels rename roles um if you have ideas and things you'd like in the Discord please uh send them to nodev um and also you can always tag at station manager that is the group of moderators volunteer moderators if anybody would like to volunteer to help moderate the coding train community in Discord and on YouTube uh you know that there may be a possibility for us to add more moderators as well um David Smith asked what languages are discussed on the Discord well there's no restriction I assume you're talking about programming languages there's no restriction as to what languages uh you can or cannot discuss I would say because I'm tending to use processing and p5js and nodejs and different creative coding Frameworks that's kind of what you what I see more people talking about but I can go poke around the channels there's different uh you know people are talking about other things and you're you're welcome to okay so um what do I want to say the here is so when you join the coding train Discord there's a new onboarding process um and the I think the thing that I want to mention the most so you can go up here and look at the server guide so the server guide will kind of give you a bunch of links uh talk you know you obviously there's some crowdfunding stuff if you want to join that you can um there's a Code of Conduct um but what I would say the most important thing for me to feature here is here under channels and roles so even if you're already in the Discord if you've been in the Discord for a long time go click on channels and roles because because if you want to get the notifications I might still use I will so I've been using at everyone which pings everybody in the server I am moving towards a model where I will only use that for really critical urgent announcements maybe no more than once a month but for like today's live stream or a new video or just some interesting thing that I want people to test out um if you want to get notifications then if you click on this little button here under the customization question um then that will give you the signal bell roll which um you can get a notification so if I were to go right now under um I don't know where to put this I'll just do go under announcements uh where you can see I posted I did at everyone yesterday to post about this live stream uh if I click at sing Bell hi to everyone whoops hi to everyone oh my my hands are cold I can barely type watching right now I can't type watching right now you can't even see what I'm typing because it's at the bottom there okay um I don't need to publish that okay so you will get those um notifications so I wanted to mention that there's some other things let me just see uh I I I made a list of them them here I think so ah so we removed a bunch of old rolls we renamed renamed some roles so red cap is another role that you could have for yourself if you're interested the Red Cap role um I don't know if this is just a us thing but in Amtrak The Helpful people who helpful help you with your luggage on the train are wear the Red Cap so that's why it's not a MAG hat I just realized hopefully no one gets in confused with that anyway I can't believe I even like said that but it popped into my head okay uh the Red Cap role is for people who are generous helpful members of the community um who have just been around and are are help answering people's questions so um uh track crew uh Community Caboose is for the uh there's some private channels for those of you who are subscribing to the membership on YouTube or patreon but the signal Bell that's the important one um there's a new role for conductor ameritus for uh folks that have worked on the coding train but no longer are removed a bunch of channels and revised the onboarding process okay I think all right all right I'm gonna turn the heater on let's put on a little music give myself a little break here wait what happened to the music weird oh there now it's going I wonder could the clicking be Rel no it's makes no sense all right turn the heater on woo to be honest the heater it's less an issue it's less an issue and it takes a bit for it to realize it needs to turn on it's less an issue for um you watching like a little noise in the background and I could try putting on the noise reduction um it's very loud and it makes me start to like speak really loud and then I start to wear out my voice but you know signal Bell signal Bell signal Bell Rock that's really good I like that do have a nice warm drink here some little warm coffee here in the morning people always surprised to hear that I drink coffee they're like isn't that dangerous for you you're already such a ah the heater has come on okay uh all right the heater is on I could other I could um I'm just looking over here at my um oh you know what I have the noise suppression on so the OBS noise suppression is on so you probably don't even hear it wait could that be causing wait a second I think I might know what's causing the glitching I have OBS filters audio filters on anyway I'll just investigate that later can everybody hear me now you don't hear the heater okay hi vivec thank you uh and happy holy Festival of Colors okay let's I let's take well I think you know my brain is starting to freeze all right let's get started working on this project that I want to work on um I don't have a lot of Ambitions for today my goal is to um get a very primitive um Visual Studio code extension running so I'm GNA talk about what this project is and all the things I want to build for it but to be clear if you're trying to decide you want to stick around for the next hour of this live stream or go on with your day what I'm going to look at and I've never done this before so I have no idea how to do it you're going to watch me try to figure this out as we go is build a visual studio code extension because because the project that I want to make is a AI agent that codes in visual stud Studio code um automatically without any intervention um and I am doing this not for the purposes of actually making something useful but for entertainment purposes only so um many of you uh if you watch the coding Trend I know this from looking at my YouTube analytics one of the things you can see is like what other videos are viewers of your channel watching so I do know that many of you watch the you YouTube channel uh standup maths from Matt Parker and Matt Parker runs something called an evening of unnecessary uh detail whoops uh which is um he's been doing it and here we go oh that's scheduled twice one in August as well oh uh so um uh Matt Parker has two of these I I didn't know about this one so but I assume it's right if it's on the bellous schedule Matt Parker is hosting two of these in Brooklyn New York uh at the Bell House 1497 street it's actually very very close to well it's not really where I live in Brooklyn but it kind of is where I live in Brooklyn I don't really live in Brooklyn anyway the point is uh I will be uh performing in China quotes um at this uh night uh Sunday April 14 I think it's sold out already maybe there's a way to get tickets uh in the future but if you already have tickets um yes Devon I want to make my own uh Devon AI but silly um and so this is my idea I think I only I think I'm doing like a 10minute I think all the guests um it's Matt parker host the evening it's um um on the website let's just click on this um it says I don't think my name is listed here but uh how do I uh sold out follow view event details let's see but so but apparently Grant Sanderson from three blue one brown and Emma Haruka ewow now I'm wondering this when I saw this name when I saw Emma heruka ew's name on this page my head exploded with excitement I don't know if you all know who this is but this is the world record holder uh the person who has written an algorithm a piece of software to compute the most digits of pi ever so I'm very excited to see whatever she is presenting about um and uh my idea AA is to do a little competition so imagine I'm going to set the scene for you you know uh imagine um that I'm up on stage and I have Visual Studio code in front of me and I I might probably have to pick something in advance but in a in a sort of dream world to get a prompt from the audience like program a fractal tree and then I set my coding train a agent working and I start to work and we have a little 5 to 10 minute competition with a little banter back and forth to uh create a fractal tree uh with p5js so you know one option that I have been thinking about is to create something like and I don't know why shift bot keeps going away like shift bot uh shift bot is a Chrome extension and um yeah funny Devon AI yes so shift bot is a Chrome extension and shift bot can uh kind of operates within the P5 web editor but I thought as an experiment for this maybe I would actually work with a visual studio code extension um and perhaps I could even create so my thinking is that with Visual Studio code I might be able to have two window panes open one where I'm coding one where it's coding and two like even preview windows with like a local server so you could watch them both so let's talk about um let me just make a list this a little silly just to use well let's create a gith let's create so I want to make a list of the features so that's the idea the idea right now is to make a Devon like AI coding agent but one that is um maybe a little bit I don't know I don't know what its personality should be just yet but I want it to have personality and I don't necessarily need it to be efficient or good at its job it just needs to and I probably will artificially slow it down because I want it to move at the speed of typing otherwise I think it might be unfair but I don't want it to just like spit out the code I want it to be able to you know write some code think about it talk about what it's doing edit the code run it that kind of thing so uh to really ulate the creative coding exploratory full process so what I would like to build today I kind of think that I won't be putting in I don't think it's realistic in the next hour um for me to sort of build you know I might finetune train a custom AI model for this I just want to get a basic VSS code extension running that can uh uh type code into a text file and run that code in a preview pane that's my starting point um so I want just the skeleton of this so let's begin uh let me go to uh terminal um and actually I I would like to do this with a local on device model so my goal is to not use any model in the cloud although I we'll see um and for that um some options I'm thinking about are using uh olama um which is a way of running llama locally on a Mac another option is using something called local AI um which is a way of hosting a bunch of models locally on your Mac and then another option is use Transformers JS which is a way of running machine learning models in JavaScript local on device models so those are those are some my options uh so let's go to let's start we're I'm going to start this project I need a name for it too um whoops no no no I'm not uh make directory uh what's a pun what's a good pun with Devin but would be like coding train related coding train related uh pun I don't know I I'll name it later uh Devon Chuchu why was it called Devon in the first place um okay so let's get this going here so the first thing I'm going to add is a read me file I'm so glad I turned the heat on by the way and I'm going to let copilot GitHub copilot work with me here conductor Devin yeah conductor yeah oh Dev in that's why it's okay anyway I we I'll get a good name for it later um all right so um okay so here's what I need um autoedit autorite code into uh sketch. JS so I'm just making a list of features that I need um narrate its process of writing the code look at errors and fix bugs which is that's kind of and that's really sort of like uh so incrementally preview uh pane to show uh p5js canvas and with auto refresh Okay so these are uh core behaviors um uh audio I don't know what to call it um intera features so it should uh use whisper to listen to what I am saying uh narrate and talk and an narrate the process answer banter with me uh using a text to speech model oh it should also be able to uh receive canvas as input to look at what I am making okay so these are all the uh so that's more of a AI feature okay and then uh ml model okay so probably a finetune a model these are questions uh retrieval rag with nature of code book or other coding train challenge examples um and multi modal so it can look at the uh canvas okay Dev out it's a zealot about commenting every single line uh okay no so D I'm I'm just trying to get started in this project and to be honest like I'm gonna be working on this mostly not while live streaming although this is motivating me like it's this is three weeks away this is very ambitious so um really what this is is is uh Bizarro Devon um so but this is just my list of features so my goal for today honestly if I could just get a Visual Studio code extension that's Auto writing code into sketch. JS I would be happy with that um so um and I'm not too worried um so um models under consideration uh so uh Gemma uh transform these are not models I'm going to say models Frameworks transformers. JS models um llama via o llama and then local AI models these are what I'm thinking of um my my preference is for on device and finetuned model okay okay all right so now uh thank you to deom who is a very I think a red cap if not dbom should be uh a wonderful helpful coding train uh member uh who did a little bit of research for me uh around how to get started and sent me these two links your first extension now it looks like Visual Studio code in its documentation recommends using typescript but you can also use JavaScript so I'm really trying to decide this is a good poll where do I put this poll out can I put it here let see can I create I'm going to create a poll uh types TS or JS so I'm GNA start this poll so the and i h f you know I'm quite well known for not for going against whatever the poll is just be aware so I um so the reason for me to use typescript would be a lot of the documentation has in typescript and I it might be good for me to learn typescript the reason for me to use JavaScript is I might move I might be able to develop this more quickly because I know JavaScript and I don't know typescript also if I want people from the community to be able to help develop this project is writing it in JavaScript going to make that friendlier and easier for people uh and so far so far it looks like JS is uh winning I'm seeing use JS let's avoid typescript Madness JS is easier use JS so I'm starting to feel the JS as if you use JS you're actually supporting typescript that's interesting so also like is it I guess maybe it's is it kind of true that like I don't have to feel so locked in right now and if I just start with JavaScript I'll be fine I don't even know how to begin with this js+ JS St all right I'll let this poll go for another minute or two all right well I'm going to read through this page color theme file icon Tree View web view custom editors is custom editors what I want I know there was also a um hold on using JavaScript let's let's go here so this is a Hello World minimal sample commands register command window show information message npm install run extension okay so let's look at here what are types vs code extension um JS to avoid overhead typescript can be an improvement later okay I like this okay I and and JavaScript is winning the poll so that's kind of what I wanted to do anyway all right so but honestly like I don't even know how to get started uh let's see uh first extension okay all right so I think though I don't want to do this because this is gonna this is first use yman and vs code extension generator okay I mean I guess I could try this if you do not want to install yo yo man for later use I'm fine with installing it globally so let's try this uh okay all right let me do this Global oh so I think think I need to I'm GNA get rid of my package.json I got to start over Okay so let's install this um okay and okay all right so while that's installing I'm going to wait here so it looks like this is is a way to create the project and then I see okay got it got okay so this is how I'm going to run it okay okay installed so now let's try yo code oh welcome to the visual studio code extension generator oh I can make a JavaScript one yes new extension it is Bizarro Devon oh now I need a name I can rename it later right they call it Bizarro Devon P5 conductor Bizarro Devon I'll just name it that for right now uh sure uh uh I don't have a description forehead uh creative coding uh let's see unhinged creative coding AI agent enable JavaScript type checking sure oh no I didn't know initialize a git repository yes I'm GNA use npm okay ah I see it made its own folder do you want to open the new folder with Visual Studio code sure okay so now I have it here and I'm going to just grab my brainstorming features and put them in the read me do I need anything here okay I can come back to this later so let me replace that okay okay now to run the hello world command from the command pallet in the new okay wait inside the editor open source extension. TS and press f five okay so if I press F5 okay so run the hello world command from the command pallet that must be this hello world from Bizarro Devon hi Bizarro Devon all right that's awesome okay so that's working change the message okay run developer reload window okay this by the way is definitely one of the things that I'll want to have to you know a lot of things that I'm that when you work on codewise you really need more monitor space because clearly I'm going to be writing the code for the extension in one window and then I'm going to need to look at another Visual Studio code window on a separate monitor to see it running and reloading but it'll be a little awkward here um but um I can rename it later famous last words I know uh so but let's see if I can make a change uh congratulations hello work so cho cho so I'm going to say change that to cho cho from Bizarro Devon uh and then reload window in the new window huh how do I reload window hold on let's make a change run developer reload window in the new window ah okay okay and then Choo Cho okay and now if I change the command oh I see we got the terminal here oh let's install the extensions that wants me extension test Runner okay that seems useful uh hold on this is too much terminal window for me and let's can you see my code let's move this over behind me so I have a little more space and where do I create the hello world command where is the command name command R is the shortcut to reload okay but what I'm looking for is where is the name of the command hello world okay the command has been defined in package.json file okay ah so if I want the command to be Cho chw I can change this here and then in the code I would change this here and then command R reloads the window and there's the command Choo Cho from Bizarro Devon okay I'm up and running with an extension awesome um so I code comments are wonderful but sometimes the boilerplate comments are not as helpful um so I'm gonna take this out okay I'm Gonna Leave This so I understand what console log is a shorter message is fine uh the command has been defied in package.json okay I'm G to leave those comments here okay okay great now I prefer here's another sort of like setup question I prefer to use es6 Imports so these days so if I were to add type module is that going to work or am I am I losing the plot here by focusing on this um um okay all right let's see and then this would be this and this is this silly for me to do uhoh uhoh I broke something so maybe I shouldn't do that ah read the comments uh hold on register command yeah I think maybe I can't do that all right let's back out of that was a nice idea that that's it's really unnecessary we should be fine now let's see but why is it how do I what did I do wrong now how do I get it okay well I need to know how to debug this so I need to figure out where I get the errors okay so let's let's hit refresh Choo Cho ah okay it's back and working again okay we're good I forgot to reload it thank you for everyone telling me I forgot to reload it okay so now here another command debug oh no look it's in the example here it's showing this import so I don't know why it didn't let me do that I can deal with that later okay debugging vs codes builtin debugging functionality makes it easy to debug extensions set a breakpoint no no I'm not going to use a breakpoint are you kidding me have you w have you ever watched the coding train you think I'm going to use a breakpoint no no I'm just gonna console log here that's how you debug where do I see the console log is it just I guess it's just here okay so this is where I this is my debug console which I realiz it's hard for you to see can move this over a little bit it's very tiny okay there it is okay that's good enough uh that's typescript okay so maybe I can only use the es the import whatever with typescript okay so now what is it that I want to do let's look at this command Tre what do I want to do what is it I want to write some code which one of these things would this be a custom editor custom editors allow extensions to create fully customizable read write editors that are used in place of vs code standard text editor no offering alternative visual renderings this doesn't seem right uh notebook file chat overview let's look at overview uh virtual documents virtual workspace no Source control vs code. window. active text editor is the current text editor you can use copilot okay uh so let's see let's try using copilot oh first of all what the heck okay uh fine good uh all right okay interesting okay so who needs to read the documentation when I've got copilot here so it looks like I can get the active window editor and um I can add code to it using this okay do I just do this in activate like this is when you but no this is I don't want to do it when I activate I want to do it when the command runs so this is when the command runs okay so it should go in here so let's do that here so let's make this its own function like run AI agent I just want to like put this in its own function all right so let's see if this works again I really need a second window here so and actually let's I should have put that um display message that there to create a text file first okay so let's just do that so let's just okay so if I go now this is really a pain is there a is there a key command I can use to switch between Windows really fast because this is a pain okay so create a text file first awesome that's what I want okay whoops let's just put this on the desktop right now okay look at that all right so it's adding something all right this is all right so what if let me just add a let me add a um p5js sketch real quick uh what is going on here to close all this no okay insert here this string uh I need to close this parentheses right what am I got wrong editor okay this is a function this two arguments the string here curly bracket curly bracket close parentheses and then ah close run AI agent there we go okay okay fine um okay so let's see now uh I'm eventually I'm going to need it to like create ultimately what I'm going to need it to do is create the index it should do everything but for right now what I'm going to do is um let's make a um let's make another folder oops and then um let's open folder let's manually add index HTML and let's just grab this and then let's manually create sketch. JS so now and I don't need the sound library or style.css so now what I want it to do is coming back to here oops no coming back to so confusing all these different Windows uh this is good oh so now go back to here and hit uh refresh run my command okay now how do I get it to Auto format I just wanted to do that now this I don't know if this is ultimately what I'm going to want it to do but let's see editor insert run auto format awesome so I'm going to execute the command format document now how can I have it create a preview window let's see if we can do it like uh run live preview extension oops um I don't have enough like space here open developer tools that doesn't seem like that's going to work uh so I'm looking at the chat here uh command if exposed by that extension okay um so let's see do I have let's look at this okay uh live preview start server let's try that okay all right we're going to try this didn't format it and it didn't run the live preview did I get an error okay hold on uh did I I I probably forgot to reload I think I I forgot to reload is there is there no Auto reload ah okay at least I got an error now okay rejected promise live preview start server not found so what is the command for that um so how do I find look can I go here copy command ID title no uh copy command ID ah live preview ah live preview start okay okay let's try this oh wait I have to I have to reload okay it's fine uh all right but why did it not hold on is this a onetime issue oh added it again it's not autof formatting but I'm not too that I I'm sure I could fix that bug oh okay okay so what do I have so far it's let's review what I have so far right now when I run the command it checks to see if there is a text file so things that need it needs to do uh to do uh so first uh to do receive a prompt to get started uh um to do um create index.html and sketch. JS run live server and then also set up the window panes properly so how let's see can I move live preview above the editor I cannot be right how do I get the preview window what is this called like basically I want to do I want to do I I think want it to appear I mean maybe the layout is not the most important thing right now but I think I want it to look like this because ultimately I'm imagining creating a like I'm gonna have one computer and one projector so I'm kind of imagining seeing this on half the screen and then another duplicate on half the other half of the screen I'm typing over here the agent is typing on the other side that's what I'm imagining probably figuring out the layout stuff right now isn't super important and I could do that so I'm trying to what would be what what is something that I should work on next um like maybe I should just try getting an AI model in here to generate the code based on a prompt let me look at my features ideas so I have this okay well I need to okay here's what I need to do I need to have it have some kind of back and forth so um and that seems so uh so maybe I should create some type of time Loop is what I should be working on next and I by the way I only have about 20 minutes left and so um uh actually I should probably just go for about 10 you know what I I'm gonna wrap up soon I'm gonna file some issues and I'm going to talk about how I might like people to contribute to this if you're interested so let's let's do a couple things one is let me let's see if I can I just haven't decided if I'm going to use transformers. JS so I'm I'm a little hesitant to just add that in there but let's think about this so I'm getting the active editor window ah vs code window I see how can I get a list of windows where do I see that oh here it is so this might be hard for you to see I'm G to try to zoom into it so this is the list of Windows document edit hide selection so somehow I'm going to have to like look through the documentation and figure out how to get the preview pane window and arrange them but that I'm not going to work on right now what I would like to do is figure out like should I just use set interval right now let's try using set interval no that's not I mean I guess JavaScript is kind of multithreaded on its own so I don't have to worry about it oh but this could be an async function yeah so I could await certain things let's just try this uh okay so why is this an error oh okay that's fine um I just want to try this so I'm going to need to have there's going to be like API calls or whatever so I just want to see like a wait pause agent 2 seconds oh okay hold on I see hold on this should be this should have been outside of this just curious and then well let's see how this does so basically I wanted to create this is I'm just testing this out just going to write a little bit of code start the live preview then uh pause for 3 seconds then add the draw function let's see if this works just trying to understand so let turn this off delete this this here refresh run the command 1 1,00 2 1,00 3 1000 oh it added it whoa what just happened whoa who okay hold on oh because I used the position okay hold on let's fix that oh no do I have to make how do I get the current position okay can will that work did it hallucinate that or is that actually correct okay so back to this close this delete this refresh run my command 1 1,00 2 1,000 3 1,000 yes okay now I really wanted to add those characters one character at a time I know this is silly but this is important to me so I'm actually going to uh always use this can I will this actually work uh okay uh insert four like I'm going to try adding it one at a time and then await pause agent yeah okay so let's try this and this needs to be async so I'm just seeing now if I can add the code in like it's typing it okay and just out of curiosity can I put in line breaks I'm just curious okay let's see if this works um okay and Bruno is asking is it safe to write one character at a time while a auto reloading the sketch yeah so I'll definitely have to watch out for that the other thing is I could not I could just use a different local server that's not live preview and refresh the sketch automatically like and have that be a piece of the code but let's just see if this works so let's go here so I need to close this oh insert oh no I forgot to refresh I forgot to refresh refresh wait what just happened it didn't work ah okay because this all right hold on let's take all this out let's take this out for right now so I'm probably going to have to I'm I wonder if edit do I really have to call editor. edit I wonder if you can't call insert multiple times in here but anyway let's just try this one more time just want to understand how this works yeah rejected promise edit is only valid while call back runs got it so I think what I would need to do is this has to happen here ah yeah so this happens out here I can refactor this to like write this in a more thoughtful way but let me just see right now what would happen um okay so this I think this might work right because I'm going to do one character at a time in the loop here so refresh run yeah awesome okay now I love that okay so uh now if I put in let's put in live preview here and let's add just for fun uh let's add this in here uh and also um uh just one okay let's do this one more time okay uh so now I go here and I refresh and I run the command again oh fill zero I forgot to fill the background with white okay one more time okay this is now how do I get it I really wanted to run that auto format but I don't know why it's let's try having it run that here and then just just to finish this off this is going to be the last thing I'm going to do and then I'll kind of talk about okay here's my coding agent it's coding some hardcoded P5 sketch yay okay but it doesn't run I I've done something wrong in terms of executing this format command but I can figure that out later okay so let me put this on uh GitHub now um let's put it in coding train Bizarro Devon it's going to be public uh create Repository um okay so now oh where am I here I don't know where I am oh I'm in bizar okay ah okay okay uh I guess I want all of this stuff let me look at git is there a g ignore let me also add DS store um okay oh uh then I need this oh seriously okay great okay okay so I am uh wrapping up the stream for today uh I have uh successfully created a proof of concept Bizarro Devon uh needs a title needs a name um and I would welcome any of you to contribute to this project so for example um here are some things like uh when um create 5js sketch when the command is first run it should create uh index.html and sketch.jpg Windows the extension should uh focus on sketch. JS and the preview Pane and put and place the preview pane above the sketch. JS editor okay um so I'm just filing some issues of things that I'm thinking about that people could contribute to um and uh development window is a very lightweight editor without any extensions installed ah okay got it um so uh run code formatter fix bug where format uh run format document after some code has been added um okay and uh let's see um okay so um all right so basically I'm GNA continue to work on this um I would my kind of thinking is to try to get it up and running and sort of built in a thoughtful scalable way without the AI models first so even if like as a starting point what I might imagine doing is just putting like the answer to what it's going to build in a local text file and have it basically like basically creating a script so I I think actually so this is what I think would make sense like create a script create a script and run that script so basically write into a Json file a script that that includes hardcoded narration p5js sketch fractal tree maybe uh this will show then once this runs and plays plays out the script will be replaced with an AI model TBD so this is kind of how I'm imagining building this so I might create like a Json file that's kind of a script that basically says like first say this then write this code then say this then write this code and if I can just watch that play out in the editor while I'm also coding in the editor then I'm ready to have the AI Model come in and replace the script so I think there's a a lot of work to be done before I even bring in whatever model I might choose to use all right um so I am going to uh finish up for today um thank you for joining this live stream I have about five minutes left oh here's an important thing for me to tell you one of the reasons well there's a lot of reasons why I need to finish at noon personally but um one of the reasons why I wanted to finish at noon is because uh I want to plug two other creative coding video makers and streamers so uh in five minutes I'm going to send you all to Raphael's twitch stream but before I even get there I just want to mention um I've been following uh let's see if I can go to YouTube um uh Pat Vera's channel so if you're looking for more coding tutorials and creative coding examples Pat um I I found on YouTube uh recently I am actually subscribed to Pat it's just not showing that because I'm currently not signed into to YouTube in case people are why are you not subscribed um but um if we go to Pat's Channel you can see that they are releasing a ton of videos Monday Wednesday Friday so if you're looking for somebody who was kind of like I mean I feel like this was me I'm not I me Pat is a completely different person so don't get this twisted or confused but 10 years ago when I was starting to do this I was kind of making three or four videos a week and doing it in a very agile way um and I think that's actually really a wonderful way to create um coding tutorials and videos and engage with the community and Pat is really doing that so if we look at Pat's recent videos there's just like two days ago 4 days ago six days ago and you'll actually find like a lot of topics I have also explored so I think like I have a video on the mener sponge but I assume if you watch Pat's video on the mener sponge you'll get a different perspective Pat also released a video on slime molds um this is actually one that I uh I want to do myself so um I think it's sort of interesting to have multiple takes on these different algorithms so I really wanted to just mention Pat's Channel everyone should subscribe watch those videos um thank you Pat for bringing a whole new perspective and energy and way of doing things to this YouTube creative coding space um so uh now oh and uh Raphael is in the chat so that was me plugging Pat's channel the other uh person there's plenty of people you should be following I'm sure I'm missing people but um why am I blanking on oh Tim Roden Becker is terrific and does a lot of videos and courses but if I go to twitch.tv I think Sable Rafe Sable rafh I don't know why I always insist on saying Rafe even though I know it's Raphael I'm sorry Raphael I can't get it right uh Raphael streams on Twitch on a very regular good schedule I don't know what's the topic today Rafael you're in the chat um but if I go to schedule um uh we are in a creative coding challenge review um every Sunday 1200 noon to 300 p.m. Eastern I don't have a way of sending you there there's no uh transfer Auto transfer what do they call that a raid but um as I wrap up now in the next two minutes U meso American design is the theme of um the challenge um creative coding weekly creative my brain is completely melted right now I cannot speak words anymore so if you're not done with your consumption of Internet creative coding streaming and you want to see somebody with much better audio and a professionalism uh that I uh lack uh you should definitely switch over and uh go to uh uh Raphael's twitch channel so twitch.tv Sable WRA all right any last questions in the chat uh I'll put on my little music uh I would be uh happy to answer any last questions if you would like to so if you would like to contribute to my Bizarro Devon creative coding AI agent that I just published the thing that I would ask that you do is that before you open a poll request or Implement any features please open an issue and propose something you want to work on or you know write a comment to one of these things so you can see here we already have this um that way I just want to reduce somebody working on a feature that's not really going to align with something that I'm thinking about that I want for this project or duplicating work um so but again you can also just I don't mean like this is the thing that I'm going to make so I'm not not requiring um but that okay so awesome job uh thank you mini jimmmy uh thank you digital Studio thanks uh Raphael two songs am I playing two songs at the same time I don't know what's going on oh yeah what is going on oh it's because oh oh it's because I've got Raphael's music going remember I used to do a lot of like dancing I got I turned 50 and I thought maybe I have to take this more seriously how this for taking this more seriously okay also I have this hip problem I think I need to get an MRI I'm doing physical therapy stretching every day I'm a little bit worried that I have this like a bulging disc thing going on supposed to run the Brooklyn half marathon I've signed up for it I don't think I'm be able to do it anyway this is not what you want to uh hear about I was looking for any questions all right it's noon everybody should go to Raphael's stream I'll see you later have a great day love you all thanks for tuning in uh stay uh look out for the next coding challenge video join the Discord all of the above and see you next time on the coding train as always I always forget the this dot this dot this
