welcome to another p5.js JavaScript video tutorials thingamabob that I'm making I you might be wondering oh my goodness that's the processing website I thought this was a p5.js video well the reason why I'm referencing in this is that there is a nice tutorial on the processing website I say it's nice but maybe it's not whatever it's a tutorial and it's about twodimensional arrays and you can sort of see if you're working in a programming language like Java that there's a very specific way to define an array as two dimensions because I say I want to have integers and I'm gonna have not just one set of square brackets meaning it's an array a list of things I'm gonna have two sets of square brackets meaning it's a twodimensional array but in JavaScript there's it's a little bit weird and funk funny and I don't really know how to do it I mean I've kind of done it before I'm gonna see what happens with this video to talk about twodimensional arrays in JavaScript but I might reference you this tutorial to look at just sort of to get some context if you want to take a look at it so first though before I start looking at code let's think about what what we mean what do I mean when I'm talking about a twodimensional array so this is kind of like a visualization of an array this array has four spots in it it might have numbers like four negative three seven eight and each one of those spots has an index zero one two three so I can reference I could say give me you know array index two and what will I get I will get the value seven because that's what's in array index two now in a lot of programming scenarios your data appears to you in your mind or in your on your pencil a napkin sketch more like this you know pixels look like this if you're programming any kind of board game that's a grid base type thing a southern automata lots of things kind of work like this in which case you kind of want to think of columns and rows and let's just to make them not the same right so I might want to think of a spot like this as three comma one and if this were an array this would be array index three index one so instead of a single index into a linear one dimension list I have to into indices one being the columns and one being the rows and they're the first one followed by the second one but what is this really in the computer's memory the thing that you have to realize and be aware of is this structure doesn't really exist like so this is a nice way of us to draw B my drawing skills are terrible but that aside visualizing the grid is helpful for our human brains to be understand it but really what this actually is if I were to do this is to say let's take this array which has you know five things in it and let's put it in another array that has two things in it right this is an array of two things and each one of those things has five things in it so a two dimensional array really in the computer's memory is simply an array of arrays and if I were to come back to this particular oh I left that tutorial two dimensional array shoot why do I close that window if I come back to this tutorial you can see the idea here that this is a one dimensional array and here's a two dimensional array which is just really an array of a bunch of arrays but you can kind of look at it like this to think of it as a grid which is very useful so how might you make this work in JavaScript now let's go and actually look at the code some JavaScript code so I have a JavaScript sketch which is doing really nothing here and let's say what I want to do is I want to have some amount of columns like 10 and some amount of rows like 10 and I want to be able to say look through all of the columns and all of the rows and what I want to do is I want to draw a rectangle I'm using some hardcoded numbers here but I want to draw a rectangle and I'm going to say stroke zero fill 255 okay so I don't have any array or twodimensional array at all whoa what did I do wrong here look at that so first I've got a problem here that I did something wrong oh this has to be j j is not defined this would also have to be j thank you very much i'm trying to get a nice nested loop so i can see just the grid pattern so now what i want to do is i want to have a twodimensional array which is a lookup table which has a color for every single one of these cells in this grid so i want to be able to what i want to be able to say is something like this fill colors i j right i want to be able to say there's some 2dimensional array structure that looks like this and you know in the array red is here pink is here purple is here right those colors are stored in that twodimensional array so how do i create this structure well the way that you create an array is like this this is now that's creating an empty array of javascript and you might think okay well this is what i do this does not work that does i don't even know what let's see what sort of weird error we get unexpected token so it's just like that's just totally a syntax error so that doesn't work what i can do however this is a little bit crazy and let me um comment this out for a second and actually i'm just going to use the console here to show you some possibilities so i'm going to make a variable called r which is an array okay so that's now if i go here and just type r we have an empty array now if I were to say our index 0 equals 5 now you can see that's the array it has one thing in it if I were to say our index 1 is 15 now I can see the array has 5 and 15 in it now let me make an array again now look at this what if I say our index 0 equals an array and our index one equals an array and now what do I have I have a twodimensional array I have an array of two arrays now those two arrays are empty so they don't have anything in it but if I had done our index 0 equals 1 comma 5 comma 9 and our index 1 equals you know negative 3 comma 9 comma 15 now I have to I have an array of two arrays in it so this is now the data structure it's really about creating an array and each spot in that array or multiple arrays this sort of explains the idea but what's a nice elegant way of doing that in code well there's a few different approaches we could take number one I could say in setup right I I want to have this loop where I go through all the columns in the rows oops sorry I've got to comment this stuff back in everything's gone out of crazy whack okay so I now have this loop what I could do is I could say for every column colors index I is an empty array right now let's look again I want to keep that let's go to the sketch and let's look at what colors is it's now an array of a race but all those arrays are empty so what can I do here in here I could say colors index I which is that array index J is random 255 so now if we do this again and I look at what colors is you can see I now have an array of an array so and they all have a number in it so this is now a twodimensional array an array of an array it's hard for me to visualize it in the console the way I want to sort of like think of it as a matrix but we can use it as such because now I could put this code back and instead of having fill 255 I could actually get those get those values from the array and here we go and you can see now every single one is pulling a color from the array randomly so that's one way of doing it let's think about another way of doing it another thing I could do is if I know in advance I could say new array calls and then I could also say new array oh and then I don't have to say this here right because well hold on a sec I lost my train of thought this gets confusing right I couldn't advance specify the size in that case I know there's an array with a number of columns and then I could say here yeah yeah sorry and then I could say colors index I is a new array with the number of rows in that case I wouldn't actually even have to put anything in it in a way we could refresh it I'm going to get some errors because there's nothing in it but you can see now the array is already filled it's already sort of there has no default values but I can use the I can use the new array function to to kind of specify the size in advance which is just something to sort of see the other thing that I might consider doing I kind of like the way I had it before better was sort of somehow less confusing to me but there's another thing that I might consider doing is I might consider writing a function called something like make 2d array and and give it the arguments column and rows and then I could say var a row R equals new array columns and then for VAR I equals 0 is less than R dot length I plus plus R index I equals new array rows so this would be kind of like a generic function I think this is kind of a nice thing to maybe have in your code which you could just write a function that you give it a width and a height essentially and it just makes an array makes it array with the right number of columns and then for every single column it makes an array with the right number of rows and so then if I were to run this code and I were to say things like make make 2d array you know 10 comma 3 you can see oh I didn't return it I got a they returned that array you can see that I'm automatically getting a twodimensional array I could say make it you know 2 , you know 100 and you can see I've got an array of 2 arrays with 100 so that's kind of useful to that anywhere in your code then suddenly you need um you need a particular two dimensional rain I think this I just see in the chat this this this particular suggestion is coming up so ok so these are some more about twodimensional arrays in JavaScript it's probably going to be the thing that I would say if you were looking for an exercise to try at the end of this is fill your array and and let's actually let's actually let's actually do this sorry I'm going to I'm going to do this I'm going to say now colors equals make 2d array calls rows and just make sure this still works so that still works so now I've kind of like made this generic function that I can use I think that's pretty useful and I was going to say for you what I might think about doing is instead of just saying random 255 here how could you make a cell object or an optic what would you do if you have a twodimensional array of objects what might you store in those objects that might be an interesting thing to think of yes and there's some other suggestions in the chat of how you could use different data types for the array and it can get filled automatically with zeros and stuff like that but there you know those are sort of a side comment so hopefully this helps you and that you'll be able to use this function to make a 2d array in your p5 GS or other JavaScript project thanks for watching see you soon
