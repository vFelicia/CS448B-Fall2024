hello I think I am live this is how every live stream starts I'm going to keep an eye on the chat so welcome I'm kind of I'm about to introduce what's going to happen in this very special extra kind of a surprise but not really a surprise live stream please if you happen to be one of the first people tuning in live to this if you could let me know if the audio sounds okay in the chat and not spoiler alert I have a guest with me Jade if you could just like say hello my name is Jane just to hear if your mic is working hi my name is Jane okay so let me know in the chat could you hear me and could you hear Jane I see that there's a Trevor Clarke in the chat okay I'm gonna assume yes perfect great okay so I think I'm just gonna get started wow this is like the fastest I've ever started a live stream ever it hasn't even been one minute yet so my name is Dan this is yet another live stream on this YouTube channel that currently doesn't have a name and this is very special episode for those who have been following my channel one of the things that I've talked a lot about I've talked about a lot but haven't done too much with but I've done a little bit of experiment fourth is having more guests as part of this YouTube channel so the first I had an interview that you may have watched with Claire Kearney Volpe and Chauncey Fleet about accessibility and code and just today I published a tutorial by tiga brain about working with physical sensors and and Appy 5gs so now so now today what this is the firstever livestream guest I even in fact have two microphones working working so that's a pretty big innovation for me technically and today's guest is a right here well she's not right here but her name is right here she's right over there Jane freaked off with his awkward thing which is standing out of the camera and we're gonna change places Jane freed off Jane is a independent game developer I encourage you to check out her website which will be linked in the description of this video after it gets archived online to see the games that she's made and the other kind of research and data and visualization projects that she's she works on and so I think what's particularly exciting about this for me a is just to have different voices as part of the channel talking about code and projects and things that that make and then also you know I've done a lot of tutorials about how to program stuff and yeah graphics and animation and logic and even a few quick and dirty like hey let's make space invaders or let's make flappy bird type type tutorials but I think thinking about the broader context of game design and what it means to actually build a game to release a game what kind of themes and what kind of stories you can tell with games and what goes into actually being an independent game developer I think is a exciting and interesting different perspective than something that I have to offer so I'm going to take this laptop with me over there and I'm going to interview introducing game but I'm going to bring her in to talk to you she'll talk for a little bit and then what I'm going to be doing over there is watching the chat so if you have questions or things you're thinking about that you want to ask Jane when she finishes a short presentation then we'll just have a brief conversation I'll ask some of the questions from the chat this is the first time I've tried this so we'll see how it goes so thank you for being here and watching Thank You Jane for being here and trying this experiment with me and now without further ado uh Jane welcome thanks for having me damn awkwardly slide in here hi everyone thanks for joining us on the live stream it's really amazing to be here I love dance videos um and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about some of my influences to become a game designer uh when designers talk sometimes we just stick to individual games that we like and like I grew up in arcade games my earliest memories are all in arcades um like like The Simpsons or Marvel or like Dance Dance Revolution um but we don't necessarily talk about like exactly what spurred us to either like me just saying that I love Grand Theft Auto which I did for a really long time doesn't really explain why I got into games and I feel like it's really interesting to hear about what inspires us about the field that we're in and so hopefully this will shed a little bit of light on the stuff that I do maybe you'll notice some own themes some themes like in the work that you all do um but yeah so let's let's get started so uh like I said Jane freehoff I'm going to talk a little bit about my interests and my influences and one of the things that was really exciting to me and thinking about this is that sometimes you don't really get the chance to talk about what inspires you especially if you're a person uh you know maybe like a woman or a person of color in games you know people ask you a lot about like what's it like to be you know person in games rather than like what brought you here and I love hearing the stories of what brings people to this field and one of the things that really brought me to this field was this belief that games can tell stories maybe their narrative also through mechanics in a way that really affects people like deep down that really gets them right in the gut and there's a kind of communication that you can have with people the same with like an amazing song or an amazing book where you realize that this thing expresses for you something that you didn't even realize that you fought in the first place and I think that's super exciting right like to me that's why games are as much an art form as any other right because they can do the same thing for us I'll tell you about the thing that did that for me in a minute Oh where's my mouse um first live stream okay cool so so also as game developers we don't really talk about the ways that we mess up right sometimes we make some really bad games and although I have many prototypes that were like true garbage um the one I'm going to talk about right now is a something that I realized later on was a game there was something that I used to do when I was a kid so like if you asked me when I actually started to be like a proper game developer I'd say okay well maybe when I was 17 I was interning at games companies maybe when I was 22 and that's like when I started to really like have stephane shows um but sometimes I think back to this uh game that I used to play with myself where I kind of thought about it as this game called face mush and the idea was that uh so you take your hands and you try to get your face to look like a model space right so high cheekbones like big eyes and all those sorts of things right and you sit in front of the mirror and you try and you try and you try to look like what everyone tells you that you should look like right and the wind condition for this terrible game was that you do it for the rest of your life right and it's not really the kind of game you could but I realized it was the kind of game I was playing with myself all the time and it wasn't because I grew up with people you know with like bad influences or anything I had family that was super supportive lots of people who took zero guff but there was this kind of messaging that was affecting me and maybe it's affected some of you too I was telling you that I wasn't enough you know something about me had to change that there was this bar and I was down here right and something something had to give right and it wasn't going to be the rules and you know whether that's through advertising or whether that's the messaging that you get through society you know that's there that's there for most of us in different ways so I would like try and try to get this performance right and feel less and less real as I screwed it up and I really hated it but it was really hard to see any other options it's hard to imagine any other way out um this may not seem like it links up to games but I think you'll see the link in a second so I don't know what changed right I likes I was this kid this insecure kid feeling a lot of pressure from the outside world and a lot of messages from society telling me that I had to be you or not being a certain way but one day I just had this like series of revelations out of nowhere I'm going to use Keanu Reeves tell me demonstrate them so that the right direction how do I not go into Keanu space so I knew that I didn't meet a lot of these standards right that society had set for me but all of a sudden I also realize like most people don't right kind of never see anyone where they hit the standard and then they're done they win you know those standards can always change the rug can be pulled out from you at any time and the wreck can be pulled out from you at any time it means okay well there's those things that are expected of you I don't really matter you know they shift a change they go back and forth and decided arbitrarily by other people right they're sort of just done because they can and so if those people were able to make up rules for me I realized that there wasn't any real reason why I just couldn't go ahead and make up my own rules right so like my rules for how I want to live for what I think is important right not win right like we're not like living under the under the like unite stay Jane or anything but they would at least be a respite from a lot of this other stuff going on through rules through my own valuations it kind of create my own little world and if I could make my own rules I can value whatever right uh I got told a lot that I was too loud or too weird or my hair was too curly or my nose was too big but in my world with this rules creations I can make it so that being loud was good and taking up room was good and have him curly hair was good I actually haven't made a game about curly hair yet but maybe I will so I realized through this rule creation I could create these sort of like alternate settings in which case in which I could value the things that I wanted right and if I am super stoked about this which I was this idea of creating this sort of alternate world for a period of time where I could be myself if I was soft about that there is no way that other people also weren't super pumped about that right I think most of us can relate to this idea of not always being able to be or express the people that we want to be and so if I'm super excited by the idea of using rules to make a separate world then probably a lot of other people are into that too and so if I can do that then I should do it right and it just like hit me all of a sudden it was like my like Keanu Reeves like whoa a moment but I looked like this so it's kind of like this okay I don't know if I'm doing it right so my mind was blown it was ridiculous um I don't know exactly why it happened but it did and I had this series of Revelations and I was super like totally drunk off it it felt like my role had been shaken up in this fundamental way right this idea that through the usage of different like rules and different settings we can create these alternate spaces for ourselves in which we can play with things in which we can be ourselves and do the things that we want to do and value things that we want to value and at the same time I'd no idea what to do that I was like 15 years old I don't know what to do with anything at that point uh and the closest thing that I could think about was sort of like the epoch of punk or culture jamming but those didn't really seem to like connect with super hard for whatever reason uh there we go but not after that I discovered riot girl and right girl like totally blew my mind it was super transformative for me to come across a group of other people special I think it's pipes okay filming live from Brooklyn um oh no we're in Manhattan aren't we looking all around um is that place check you're going yeah probably I don't see anyone [ __ ] does anyone else hear that water sound awfully coming from your computer look no I don't think so this was gonna be my big day in LA yeah it's getting yeah they do hear it in the chat hold on I don't hello everyone we're taking a brief pause for a second to figure out what's making this crazy extra weird sound is it let me see if it's something on this computer yeah because it's coming out of this computers hold on I can't matter what would be over here Oh oh my god what weight is this what's that livestreams now what is that sound it's let's check for the sick let me mute some of the audio sources sorry I'm like I'm like totally like a loss for what to do no it's the weirdest in the service area I don't know why but I had something running called airserver which is like I wonder if somebody's like white noise iOS app was like air playing into this oh my god that was a little bit crazy which maybe is appropriate for this law yeah okay we can go on and continue everything should be okay that was why I learned my mic back off okay okay cool whoa like what already kill your momentum no no it's fine it's fine no worries um but so basically um for me what this thing was was riot girl right and riot girl was this sort of punkrock feminist movement that was very much about women making art that represented them and represented their lives and how a lot of issues right like I was kind of its target demographic like it had like race issues class issues but still for all of its faults it really like gave voice to the set of emotions that I had about the world that I didn't know how to process and these values that I didn't really know how to articulate um and so there's this thing called the right girl manifesto and for that that really like totally hypnotized me and there were a couple of lines that really spoke to me I really like the line because we girls want to create mediums that speak to us right this idea that we're going to create art music and zine zand that sort of thing that's speak really to us as people because anytime we get anything done we are creating the revolution right which is really nice and maybe the most important went to me because I need laughter and I need a girl love right this idea that these experiences can bring us together right and so seeing these people try to cultivate these things made me realize I wanted to do it too but uh for me like if you know me in real life you definitely don't want to hear me play music I'm not a very good artist either all of the art and these slides have been done by an artist friend of mine because it's not a good when I try to do it and for me what I had been really interested in up to that point was game design right and I don't even mean like super artsy artsy fartsy game design right at this point in my life I was like planning a lot of Grand Theft Auto I was playing a lot of like Katamari Damacy playing a lot of rez a lot of like weird little games but these ideas or well grant that thought it was in a weird little game but you know what I mean a big span of games um there weren't necessarily about this but I sort of had a moment where I wondered could there be a meeting point here right in games basically a lot of what we're doing regardless of like the content at the game regardless of whether we like dubbin an art game or an indie game or a serious game we're trying to use mechanics to tell some story about the world right our mechanics value certain things maybe they're like a little bit more wild in one game a little bit more tame in another but regardless they're sort of pointing at a world that could exist right or that does exist for a little while and to me why a girl also pointed at this right you go to a riot girl show you hop in the mosh pit you sing along you kind of have this feeling of connection that you're in this alternate world for a second and so I kept wondering like there's not really a lot of like right girl game it's right this happened in the 90s so I mean probably some of you are younger than me to be that's like you know when I was growing up and I really started to wonder you know not a lot of people were making you know it's like a flourishing indie culture back then so I started to think what how could we combine this right how can we mash this up and so this question nagged at me all throughout college into law school and then out of law school a year later when I dropped out and then finally into design school and then the indie scene if anyone ever like pretends to know what they're doing I can promise you that 99% of us don't uh but uh when I sort of arrived at design school I realized I wanted to take the things about the genre that I found so transformative and start applying their ideas directly to the mechanics of games and so for me what that meant was to make games that had certain values right like I was talking about with the first terrible game that I made I wanted to create games that had particular values that cared about certain things like the weird little game world that they created focused on these things like deliberately being messy sometimes all right giving yourself the space to be messy you ridiculous view over the top we don't really get that a lot creating these like very expressive spaces goes along with messiness sometimes being expressive is messy creating relationships through art not just with me art you know I didn't really want to make stuff where people would just look at it and then walk away I wanted to make something where people would sort of interact with each other through it like being in a mosh pit or a girl show and I really wanted to communicate with my audience directly not trying to like explain them to anyone else so I'll show you two games that I made I mean I've made a lot more games other than this but there are two games that I've made that I think really kind of speak to this spirit and this ethos so this first one is this still from a game called screw mom up and screwup is a basically a twoplayer knockoff of space invaders but with two very crucial differences so let's play with the Kinect and a microphone it's twoplayer you work together so in order to move you hold this mic in your hand and you're tracked by a Kinect so I don't know if I have enough space over here so you have to run laterally up there I go into the void across to move your ship and you have to scream into a microphone in order to shoot I have a video let's see if this works yeah this is kind of like where's my head's in the way oh nice too hot I'm gonna awkwardly slide that video so um so you know I could talk about like the design choices in this game and the ways of hooking the tech up together and all of that is important but for me what I really wanted was to create a win condition in a game right in a wind condition just meaning something that you do to win oh I didn't make this video um uh I'm gonna close that cool then I'm gonna that cool okay so um so one condition is just something that you do to win the game right you want to score the most points or or whatever and the thing about them that's kind of great is that they sort of inherently justify whatever mechanic you used to achieve them right like if you think about it most of the games that we play a pretty silly right why don't we play golf instead of just picking up the golf ball walking over the hole and dropping it in right why do we use missing golf bets oh my god oh why do we use whatever using right like why do we use drivers and putters and that sort of thing when it's totally ridiculous right well we use them because the rules of a game require that we use them so we're gonna use them of course right we have to if we're gonna win we got to use them to hit the thing into the home and so reveal I sort of realized like I could take all these things that I really liked people being loud people being messy people having fun with each other people like running around in real life slamming into each other and I could kind of justify creating that alternate little space if I just made a game about it right and so um what I really felt was you're especially being told as a kid that I was like too loud it took up too much space or I decide too much uh I could take something that I felt selfconscious without in real life and just translate it into a game mechanic right giving me and other people this sort of release valve and this place to explore that kind of expression and I remember it was um was really gratifying because I brought this game to an outdoor festival and I was sort of like as with every game that I make I was like maybe only I think this is good maybe everyone else will hate it um you know people people in that hatton are cool you know they walk around and they look like they don't really care whatever uh but this like really steady flow of like initially you know very cool hipster people came by they would play it and all of a sudden they would like turn into feral animals right and screaming climbing on each other laughing shoving pushing and that was something I noticed didn't really end with the end screen the end screen would come up and they would laugh they would be hoarse uh and they would look at each other and they would look at me and say thank you and you could see that they had this kind of glint in their eye really excited like they had unlocked something and you know I don't want to say that games you know totally influenced behavior don't totally influence behavior but I think they can give us little spaces to be ourselves and to like discover different facets of ourselves and so it was really nice for me to grow up as a riot girl in mosh pits and that the see people leave my game with the same kind of like glint in their eye that I had coming out of those shows um my most recent releases a game called slam city oracles and it's really really tried to like infuse the whole thing with this practice one of the reasons I made slims to be oracles which is a two player arcade game is because installation games are really hard uh uh it turns out sometimes if the Sun Goes Down you're connect will break and no one tells you that in advance and there are 50 people who want to play your game in an outdoor festival and you figure it out so I really wanted to make something that could run on its own just go off into the world not need me to attend to it but basically the idea behind slam city oracles is that sort of like if you mashed a GTA and Annamarie dama she so you and your best friends the twoplayer collaborative game smash up this city to this riot girl soundtrack done by a local band so I'll play you oops not thank you yet soon they're not yet I'm gonna escape that I've done with my nuts they're spoilers uh plenty o like try to do it over here where's my head okay good oh by the way if you have photosensitive epilepsy please look away because there's lots of blinking lights thank you you one of my like proudest achievements was that I actually released on time which I really did not think was gonna happen at all um that was kind of a miracle thanks to everyone who helped me do it because I definitely do not do that alone I'm gonna put the presentation back here alright so um this was a really great experience because I got to work with and pay paying people is great a lot of people who had a lot of the same values as I did with regard to like making art that feels very much like this bright girl experience and again if you couldn't tell from the video the way that you win is you cause as much chaos as you can so you slam down make things fly around when you go up higher from aslim you can slam down again that makes it go even higher more things fly all around you have two minutes basically to cause as much destruction as you possibly can and again for me I really enjoyed this process of making a wind condition that valued the things that I wanted to value right like one of the major tenets of riot girl was taking up space right this idea that you don't shrink back you don't try to like lower your voice you don't try to just accommodate people around you you take up space uh metaphorically often obvious in some cases literally right like in this game it's all about taking up space all about like the impact of your physical self um in the world and another thing that really inspired me about this too is uh and I feel like this is a facet of the way that we think about like games that are serious or emotional or artsy but um this was actually a game that was really inspired by feeling like really vulnerable right really lonely there are a ton of women game developers there are a lot more now which is awesome and I mean I love all game developers have been amazing like mentors and influences on my life but there was a period of time where it felt really strange to be a woman games and I kind of fantasized about this place where I would just be invincible right you know cool me better Jane wouldn't be afraid to take up space you know would have would basically be invincible to anything else around her and so for me it kind of like with scream up which was all about giving yourself the excuse to take up space and be loud and basically better at it scream like you probably haven't done since you were about five or six this was very much about reclaiming a moment of feeling powerful feeling connected with other people and getting to miss things up and so so I think it's funny like you know we have this really like intense delineations about like what is art what is like serious or emotional we tend to think about it as like oh it has to be super autobiographical right but to me I really enjoy games that are sort of born out of the ways that people want to see the world right like and this is just the way that I see the world I'm sure that the people who are watching this channel all have their own influences and all have their different ways of seeing the world and I think one of the really exciting things about games is that again through this process of making rules through this process of sort of setting the narrative and through this process of determining what is it like what is the lane condition what's the main condition for you like what makes you happy what would be an interesting thing that you would want to do like it sounds kind of corny I get it but I think there's something really cool about making games about that because they kind of create these weird little like temporary utopias right where everything is different and in examples like this it's only different for about two minutes two and a half minutes it's a short song also it hurts to just slam the button over and over again by the you get to kind of create this alternate world where the stuff that you like that you value that you care about matters and what's even better is that with games you get to see other people experience it and see when they care about the things that you care about that you think matter and for me whenever I see people get that feral glint in their eyes for me that's my judgment for knowing that I've done something right so that's pretty much what I had to say um I appreciate all y'all bearing with me through the technical difficulties come on okay one question Zach yeah yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna try we're gonna sort of like just rearrange ourselves you can no leave that there I mean we don't need just I think that's a nice background I'm gonna don't stand a little bit off to the side here yes so I'm gonna try so first of all in the CH I'm kind of keeping an eye on the and first Thank You Jane this was awesome thank you I love I've seen some rework before it was so great to hear like stories behind it and I think really just like super fun and interesting themes and exciting exciting stuff so I have a boy now there's even more people lots of positive feedback in the chat people really like the scream em up game and so so okay so fine so people are staying lots of thankyous now so I think what I'll try to do this is we haven't tried this before so I'm kind of learning how to figure this out but I'm going to ask I note it down a bunch of the questions so I'm just gonna kind of go through them in sort of I'm gonna start with some of the technical ones first yeah um so bunch of people that had asked like what kind of programs what kind of programming languages what tools do you use to make these games or other games yeah totally should I look at you sure I don't know both yeah kill get me if you're the audience have a preference let me know so this is good so um I used unity unity 3d is a game model as a game development engine um you can use a couple of language of the community I use csharp because I've been working in like C++ before and it seemed the most natural to me right um I primarily chose it because as a development team of one uh unity I guess one of the reasons why it's called that it exports to a lot of different platforms so you can make a game and then it exports to Mac to PC the iPhone to Android right like I think I like to blackberry I feel like I've seen that oh maybe I'm like super hallucinating um but for me it made a lot of sense because it really streamlined the workflow and let me like I was able to make a Linux build of this game right that works right like without any hassle which is not a sentence I've ever said about Linux I know that unity has like a free in a pro as well stuff you're doing like works under the free or you need primo for it yeah yeah yeah even the exporting is so you don't need the pro for that yeah I think yeah I think it like change used I think I'm like thinking about in an old way because I think it actually is now kind of like all free I think it's also like if your thing makes a certain amount of money then you have to get pro right um I haven't faced that like no uh and and the other thing I know like in particular with like slam city Oracle's here it looks like there's a lot of physics built into that game is that stuff that you're using from the built in yeah yeah so unity has really great physics both for 3d and 2d I know some people make their own but for me it was definitely definitely good enough it handles it pretty nicely there's like some garbage collection that I end up doing but um yeah it just kind of works it'll figure out where like so if you like have colliders and stuff objects like the characters you don't have to like trace that manually like figures it out for you that kind of thing I started building it in a different platform that didn't have like GUI right everyone's like show us the code well not not today god you don't want to see the code trust me all right so let's see I'm gonna I've got some more thematic questions by mistake with some of the technical stuff so so we've covered this on Holtz I'm trying to like use people's names from the chat but that first question by the way came from Jose came from Jose Thank You Jose and then um so one thing that I think is an interesting question that been asked in the chat um so it in particular for like the screaming up game yeah that you showed it like a festival it requires the Kinect maybe you built that with oh that was your open framework though we prorate you mention that open frameworks so how do you like is there oh dude does this does the Kenda game find an audience beyond this sort of like Festival or conference kind of circuit or just like an installation have you thought about that or is that been like part of struggle for you or yes what's it what's your thoughts on that no it's a great question and it totally depends I think it like again I think it depends on what your dev team sizes right because it's just you know the more platforms the more like overhead you require people to do right so the process for running screw up if I remember correctly cuz I made it a couple years ago you have to get an app on your iPhone because the iPhone transmits the sound data to the computer you have to hook up the connect to your computer then you have to make sure that they're both on the same network so OS seek communicate and have to make sure that like the port numbers and the IP addresses and everything all match up and like you know write that is intense that is a big ask and automating that kind of thing is like totally possible I'm trying to think about would have done that before but for me it just wasn't really feasible right right also like I'm very selfish and I mostly wanted to see people play the game yeah well there are like a lot of you know you have to you have to work at it you've got to apply but there are a lot of opportunities and a lot of times a lot of these games are the most fun in the sort of like crowd public simulated context totally but I think it's an interesting to think about you know a like finding the audience what's the right context for the audience the economics of like all this stuff like I'm just putting the stuff out there for people to feel joy which is a good thing but also like you know you want to be able to have a sustainable practice yeah this is why I don't make my money in games primarily thanks I have other jobs so this is kind of a related question I think which is from Kirpal from the chat rightz how would you recommend someone in high school who likes coding and gaming to sort of get into the game industry or get into internships College address that question that's a really good question so I feel like the thing that's nice about games at least nowadays is that it's such a wide field that it's not there's not necessarily one path right um I obviously took a pretty untraditional right there right I wrote down in my notes school question oh yes my like if I was gonna have any questions were at law school no idea that you went to law school that's crazy oh my god it's like this is the thing through is that I feel like um when we like our professional you know we have our CVS and our portfolios and it makes it look like we had anything figured out at any point in time I definitely did not like any way that's like a motivational speech for another day um so what was the question again it was no for a high school so how to begin yeah yeah so I think probably one of the best so let's say two things come to mind um one thing is actually they're both related so if you haven't done a game jam before I would say that's actually a really amazing opportunity I one of my first after interning in the games industry I kind of got back into games through game jams and if you haven't heard of a game jam before basically it's when a bunch of people get together for usually between like 2448 hours some are longer some are shorter I went in a onehour game jam on stage which I almost had a nervous breakdown but um but it's really nice because it kind of forces you to make something like at the end of that 48 hours you'll have something you'll have made your first game or your second game or your tenth game whatever and it also gets you out in meeting people right it's really tempting I know I do this all the time as a developer to kind of think I'm the indie developer I gotta like do everything I have to make the art I have to make sound is that and you'll find in these communities which are bigger than you think probably other people who are also interested in other people would probably think your idea is like awesome uh so so doing that together like gets you a portfolio piece it gets you some experience prototyping iterating and to me that's the most important thing actually the way that I got um the internship that I got in high school in the first place I mean it's a very different time ten years ago but uh but it was because I had made a game with a team over I want to stay like a six week program and some people from the games industry came and they saw it and they liked it and they liked me and they're like hey do you want to intern for us it's sort of like getting scouted as a model except like way different high but uh but yeah and so so I think that's one of the biggest things you can go to like conferences and conventions those are super helpful but I often find that the people who um who show up there also show up to the game jams it's a little bit easier I guess someone who's like stood around with my little name tag and my drink like wanting to talk to people but being too shy it's a lot easier to go to someone at hour 36 at a game jam and go like hey I know you I like your work and get a conversation started they're cool um a couple of people were just asking now because you mentioned like you don't necessarily do independent game development fulltime what is what what's your other like work that you do yeah I do all kinds of weird stuff uh so primarily what I do is um I do I protect tools which is not the most descriptive answer uh but uh so right now I work in a place called the office for creative research which is super amazing basically we're a studio that does a lot of like data and data analysis and data exploration in a very like socially oriented way so I just got off a project doing doing like a visualization of a census of elephants that took place over all of Africa oh this is like the Congo no that's that are lots of different yeah yeah those why my boss almost got like attacked by a lion which is a sentence I never thought I would say but uh I'm staying here yeah good cool um but uh but so uh so it is like weird and different um but I find that everything I do kind of orbits around people playing with each other like sometimes it's really explicit like the like the scream em up where you're like literally screaming and laughing and diving on each other like it's a game of football um but other times it's a little bit more subtle and it's about like how do people get curious how do people explore things um I'm really interested in that I actually sometimes think about myself as more of like a play designer than a game designer cuz that's what's really compelling to me and there's not like there's not a value judgement there yeah yeah we all need each other but uh but I find that that's what ties my practice together so um okay people are talking about game jams yeah there's another question why I've got so many okay gotcha we're we were to go for it well we'll go for a little longer answer somewhere I want to make sure I get to some of these um what this comes up a lot in with my tutorials and stuff that I've done people are always asking what we'll just turn a little background yeah yeah um what um like do you find that how much does like I'm rephrasing the question a little bit for my own question but how much does like math play a role in what you're doing and how much is that a struggle or how do you how do you deal with that you guys pay attention and trick please pay attention in trig because I didn't and I regret it so hard uh no it plays it has a huge influence actually um way more than I want to admit and that's probably honestly why to some degree I rely on outside sources um to get stuff done right like I'm not I'd like to say that I use your knees like engine because oh I didn't have time to write my own like let's be real I probably would not be able to write my own physics system but but uh you know you don't need to to realize your idea and I think the totally point is liked it you have something you want Express and so they want to communicate and you know sure it's an interesting academic exercise but if you understand I work so you can make it rip totally Express the idea then that's great totally totally but like definitely um it helps a lot uh I'm gonna help everywhere the way that I see it popping up a lot is what am i well my partner he does a lot of work with Perlin noise I hope you cover Berlin yes I have a nice tutorial Alice and so that is a way of making things seem really natural yes so sometimes like if you want and it means to look like they have a eye or they're moving around in a particular way you can add that and it doesn't feel so static you know what I mean it's sort of like you know if I walk around like this it feels a lot stiffer than me moving how it usually do so like using noise for example it's really important that same partner has a unit circle tattooed on him because that's how much he loves so uh so yeah I mean it's important but my attitude towards this is that one you know you realize your idea how you can no one no one who matters probably is gonna be like getting angry you about your code for no reason if they have nothing to do with it and like there's always Stack Overflow like you know it's there for a reason and you shouldn't feel like you have to figure this out all by yourself in the start yeah awesome okay so I want to ask question which i think is particularly relevant especially like in light of things have been happening in the world in this country the ones the last week Jane and I are both wearing safety pins here so a jew jew jew writes in the chat she wants to know if you've dealt with sexism in your career and also what you think you your our role as as developers might be in resisting oppression and marginalization yeah that's an amazing question and I should probably preface it with the fact that like I can only speak to my own experience and there are some amazing critics who like come from different backgrounds than me like I obviously like I have white privilege right like that's just a fact I went to like design school that gives me like a certain level of closeted education privilege so I'm coming from there I can't speak for everyone obviously um but in terms of sexism yes there it's interesting because it's pretty rarely um you know it's usually not people coming up to and being like get out of our playground we don't like you right but it's things like I remember I was at a conference once I had developed a game with my partner he's a man I'm a woman we both were at the booth we was a PlayStation Vita game we had Vita in front of each of us and I noticed that people primarily men would line up to talk to him so it was like a line like six or seven people deep to talk to him to fly his Vita and literally no one would come to me and even when people did maybe like oh are you the marketer are you the artist I was like I did the AI like yeah and don't get me wrong again god bless artists I cannot lie I not make any of my work without them this is not to denigrate artist or marketers but it was I would get this over and over and over again this sort of people call them microaggressions but this sort of like constant chipping away that's like oh I was at the Game Developers Conference lunch wearing a game wearing a badge from NYU Game Center has game in the title the Game Developers Conference which has game in the title and developer in the title um where my title said developer and someone came up to me and said oh sorry are you in games like would you ask my boyfriend like so it's very weird and it's something you kind of people can get better at it um to some degree you just have to like let it roll off your back a little bit um but it's hard and I mean it's it's really nice if you're a merchandise person of any stripe to find a community that understands you and that's super helpful and like you'll also find Ally's allies like where you don't necessarily expect like a lot this sounds like the famous like sentence but truly actually a lot of my most amazing allies are men right who have gotten me like the most the most help and the most opportunities um but it is really nice to have spaces where people understand you know I remember talking to people and then being like oh oh I guess I didn't realize that right um in terms of what was the exact question I mean I think I have a couple followup yeah that's well one I guess it's like so one of the things that with p5.js which is a JavaScript framework that I do a lot of tutorials about started by Lauren McCarthy really started with this ethos of you know the tool know tool is neutral and a tool like has the sort of biases of the creators and it's really important to have all voices of the table and also creating like this place that can be a community for people who might feel like I'm not include in opensource projects this could be a place where I could feel that way and I you know I guess I'm wondering are there some or they're like um you know online communities or web sites or like a conference I know there's like initiatives like Phoenix Perry's coat Club which we're kind of information are you cofounder that twosecond gain and Phoenix s a code liberation which is a wonderful organization are there other things that you can I mean to put you on the spot like a gov there's a time we can answer the links in the description yeah that's a really great question the ones off the top that I had off the time I had that I know it again they're mostly like women oriented because I am a woman and that's what I was looking at like I know pixels this girl this good girls make games is good we code liberation did a like collaboration workshop with black girls code which is an amazing organization I keep thinking I'm not totally sure in terms of tools though like that's actually the most exciting thing to me about um the last while in indie games because like when I was the first game I ever made aside from the way I talked about the presentation one of the earlier like program games that I can remember is like a text adventure really some language that like super doesn't exist anymore like a lot of the people that I know maybe their first games I'm like msdos and I'll tell you it's not the most userfriendly system uh and what I think it's great is that there's been this real explosion and tools that are available and they really work with like a diff different um like genre so you want to do it but also a lot of different learning styles and thinking styles so like your twine for text games is very much about like connecting passages or even like game maker has a sort of logic blocks and actually you can have code blocks in there too so as you start to like feel more comfortable maybe you rely less on the logic blocks and more on the code blocks maybe you start watching some tutorial to thank you uh but I think that's really amazing like I I think that's totally spot on that no tool is like a political and I actually think that's like it's really exciting when people make their own tools but I think having like a biodiversity of tools right is really great like it only supports more people making games awesome let's see if I'm going to just try to like wrap up and there a bunch of questions people are in the chat let's see it is an interview about interactive fiction yes interactive fiction okay um so one other I guess the so one other question I think is kind of actually is a good one to ask also asked by Jose is just about how long it takes you two for any of these projects look at these games how long did you work on them yeah hello how do you allocate the time for that totally what's that process well mine is usually very unhealthy uh so um it really depends there are a lot of small like there are a lot of games dynamic at game jam so to take a very short amount of time there are games where all do a lot of work on them at first and then kind of like letting life happen and then pick them up later slam city Oracle was kind of a totally ridiculous like thing that I could only do because I was young uh it was like two years ago anyway yes it counts um but I I made it in like six weeks because I had a deadline that I couldn't mess so I took a week of baking like I took one of my weeks of vacation from work and I just worked on it the entire time I wouldn't really recommend doing that um it's definitely really important to like balance selfcare um I can show like so what's kind of interesting if we have a second I'll show it cuz I kind of love it where do my video go where's my oh there it is great so um something that I something that I really like talk to people a lot about is how important it is to prototype and how like weird it is how sorry okay so so the thing about slam City this is a blog post of mine called finding the fun which you can see on kamasutra um where is my awesome uh so this is what slime city oracles looks like now but what slaps on your elbows look like when I started was this like literally that's it this is not the most inspiring thing in the world right I I refer to typing this and being like I'm a failure I'll never make another game this is like what how is this all loops it's just good yeah that means a half an hour has passed shuts off on man gotcha gotcha and like this was it this is where I started and if I looked at other games it was like how does this stack up to journey like that's bad um but it's kind of necessary to start here you know you find what you find is fun right like I was playing this with my partner we kind of realized that this ridiculous little bouncing ball game we kept doing it we kept throwing each other up and slamming each other down and so it can take a really long time to get through that iterative cycle but it's and how you'll get there how do you fold in like user testing like so yeah you try to do that like continuously you just like gather your friends it's can you put stuff online to user test like yeah uh so what I typically do it totally depends on like how big your audience is and like whether you're coming out of your bedroom or whether you have like a legit game development shop but uh but uh I user test it every turn and usually the way I frame it is for each prototype I try to have that prototype address something right so is it fun to slam down is it fun to throw other people up turns out that that second one was not fun it was just confusing right so I try to think of a very specific question that I can answer through code I see if people respond to it if it works and if it doesn't I throw it out um and so it's a lot of iterating you buy a lot of pizza and beer for your friends ah my facebook messages about testing got way let's go here and as the development went on um but there are also a lot of play testing events uh I guess not all obviously not all of you were in New York City but for example in New York City there are play testing events that happen at Parsons The New School for Design at the game center I believe play crafting also has events basically if you look up like indie game development in your city or play testing in your city I think I'll probably be surprised at what you find and you can also send your prototypes to people here and I mean yeah yeah especially if you know them and you like their work usually they'll be down cuz they were also like totally insecure about their projects ones I know I was in continue to think okay so wait now I realized that I forgot that there were some questions posted on Twitter because I was like oh that's good I have some questions just in case there are no questions but there's so many questions in the chat so and some of them came from Angela who I also see is posting in the chat so let me let me go see if I can quickly go to my Twitter notifications here and let me find some of these questions ok so I think we've talked about some of these but there are so Angela I'm gonna ask two questions from at Angela Wineman on Twitter one from Twitter and one from the chat one is that do a kind of like nondigital games card games roleplaying games board games how does play a role in your thinking and your practice I mean I know for me like I just love playing oh my god those kind of games and often I'm thinking about making computer versus of course I never do that but yeah I love them so I don't I don't tend to make a ton of them but they were definitely how I learned game design and I feel like one of the reasons why they're so hopeful is because they really forced you to strip things down and when I've taught game design before I'll run into students and I totally get it this is why I got into games where they're like on make a game it's gonna have this art and this music and this narrative I'm like that's great what's your like what's the what do you do right or do you just have like a theme um and that's not bad but I feel like starting with analog games really helps you like understand what mechanics work and what done right because you can't you can't be like oh this deck of playing cards is going to be like so emotionally resonant that it will do all the work for me so that's really great it really teaches you like about how to manipulate systems and how to like create those systems I still make um card games and like public space games occasionally I made a game recently called musclebound glory uh and it's a game where if you've ever seen like haze ever seen like an 80s action movie yes where it's like okay just making sure where they have like the really cheesy lines when they like finally like how the bad the bad guy you know what I mean like I want to treat you like garbage doesn't like kick you into this puzzle or whatever um so it's a game about that so you draw three cards it's like a situation a villain and a weapon or something like that I don't totally remember and as a group you have to try to or well individually you compete to make the best cheesy punny line that you can write and you kind of deliver them with like these you know poses and these like props and stuff and just really goofy and ridiculous I love I'm actually it you know it sort of strikes me to that one thing that it's done I think it's kind of interesting to think about is also like if you're planning to make a digital game like is there like a paper prototype version of it oh yeah oh yeah really great way to think through an idea solutely to like get user testing yeah you know I always I know like I doing all these tutorials this fall about text analysis and I'm often talking about like it actually is really good to just like get the physical book open it and like do the text analysis by reading the text that's in your line and like making notes with a pencil because that will sort of give you the clues to how the algorithm how the code has to be written yeah and allow you to kind of like slow that pace down to like think through the problem that's totally just like pencil sketches and like swapping them out and that's the kind of thing that I think is easy to forget when you're just like I'm gonna program this I got a perfectly well it's so like relatively speaking well both in terms of materials and time that's so much more low cost right like I I felt way working ideas than I do and it's really nice to not waste you know a week a month programming something and then find out that it's not any good than to just do it in a paper prototype yeah go this definitely doesn't work yeah and be done with it and move on yeah oh boy so many questions we're gonna so I think we're probably need to wrap up soon I think like an hour is a good amount of here for these two you know to not overburden our guests here um but let's me on Twitter let me yes and so but will looking at all that second at the end oh yeah no no you give that now yes you definitely do hit ask more questions to Jane on Twitter but I do you want to ask this other question from Angela which I can't seem to find right now but I saw it anyway so are there some people that are your kind of like major influences or people that you really admire I know this is one of these like pajamas all right yeah I mean we're so many you can think of them later and tweet these names you know it's okay I can do it people that you admire other I guess another way to phrase this question that might feel less like awkward to answer is like hey if you're interested in games also check out like these other indie developers oh my god that's also a really hard question sorry I'll start with my influence because or with my like inspirations because I've thought about that a lot because I like like oh what am I ever gonna be as good as them but uh so um Keita Takahashi is amazing he is the developer of kata married Amish oh yeah if you've ever seen it he did an amazing installation with baby castles where he basically dreamed up a bunch of like super weird installation games and they executed them in this museum so one of them was like a sidescrolling game and if you play a sidescrolling game it's like maybe you're a ship over here and you move through space in the background with behind you except this is rural about that Hey there you go um by that this sidescrolling game actually instead of having the background scroll the ship scrolled across about five or six monitors scattered throughout the space oh that's cool and to me that was just so like so I love that kind of stuff that plays with the forum and the medium I forget the the guys name the developer of res res is uh it was like on the Dreamcast which like oh my god so uh but uh it was a game that really attempted to sort of create the sensation of synesthesia which is like I don't think I'd come up with a dictionary definition of synesthesia but like the blurring of senses you know and and so that was really amazing that was one of the first like music games that really like totally struck me so there's a lot of things like that yeah I can probably write a whole post on like the weird old games that I like oh man in terms of current developers this is way harder because I would be heartbroken how can I plant this this Twitter yeah yeah yeah define okay so first of all sorry there's a lot of questions that shot about like what programming language should you start with what program language should I learn and so we did if you some of you might be tuning in late you can kind of roll back at when this archive gets published and we did discuss some of that stuff about different tools that Jane is using so um somebody said I think I was like scratching the mic by accent okay I should stop looking at I have a problem of like looking at the chat and I get very distracted by it's kind of a problem I also have this Bell which I don't know what to do it but I thought I needed a Bell yeah I'm using this Bell as like it's a thank you to Jane yeah um so this is really awesome and like super inspirational and like really fun a good experiment and challenge for me to sort of think about guests and interviews and that type of thing which and I think I would say thumbs up at least on your part you didn't write man so if you guys are interested in learning more about Jane's work yeah you can go to her website which is Jane free.com and also you can see her Twitter handle right yeah see my name yeah that's it so feel free to I could look up feel free to ask questions to Jane also you can ask questions with me on Twitter send us your feedback write in the comments and maybe you know I'm gonna have more guests maybe you could come back and we can make a new game show it or you can you know maybe we'll I'll think about if there are some I don't really do unity I like sugar and everything but if I can think what I like to sort of think about too is if there like some themes that came up I can do some tutorials kind of like around those themes I'm young think about that so if anyone got an idea of like oh how do you do X from this video then you could let me know so that's my parting words I have this really ridiculous thing that I do which is that I'm just gonna put on this I'll play you out with the redacted edited blurts he was talking and trailer one of these days we'll have a new one and um thank you for tuning in thank you again Jane I and um so this video by the way as soon as it finishes you won't be able to see it on YouTube but sometime later tonight or tomorrow we'll be back and I'll post on Twitter and will appear in the feed and that sort of thing so thanks for watching I'm always like I can't ever stop yeah but does are look it says 59 minutes and 11 seconds which is just like perfect so and I apologize if I missed your question please send me up write it in the comments send me a tweet send the tweet to Jane uh hopefully we can well hear from anybody who got missed okay so I'm gonna hit uh oh no whoops first I'm gonna hit this okay did you that learning coding would be really rough throw your hands up in the air and saying nothing not do you was allergic code and make some awesome stuff learn it anyone can when you're coding with Dan whether you're a power this is open you Burnie overarching concepts and some fun stuff too and with Dan as your guide come along for the ride make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect your face you can make it jump to Lightspeed into outer space you can generate a maze that can go on for days you can make your own terrain and some purple red you can make a retro game to see how it's done and then tweak a piece to make it yours for everyone make some fresh deleterious or Twitter but if you please and when the scissors right the colors of code
