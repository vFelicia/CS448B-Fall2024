thank you thank you foreign foreign foreign golly I hope it's working because the timer says 20 seconds left thank you thank you foreign here we are back on the coding train it is B I'm back baby doing this a lot like streaming and then not for several months and then having a big thing where I'm packed so don't get too excited because I might just do this again a couple of months ah so nice to see all of you I mean I don't really get to see all of you but I feel your presence there uh if this is your first time tuning in oh my goodness welcome hi my name is Dan and you are watching the coding drain the coding train is a YouTube channel it's as if I have a script in front of me and yet I don't I just have a view of myself um uh new glasses by the way I don't know if anyone noticed that I'm wearing new glasses uh I have a new prescription new progressive lenses I've gotten quite a bit older since the last time you saw me and my vision is really um I'm really struggling actually I think that I might need a specific set of glasses for using the computer I'm sure this is what everyone is interested in hearing about uh let me see if I'm just looking over this way because I've got my monitor to the left I'm just looking at the chat to see that everybody is there yep um I have the um supporter member whatever you want to call it Discord chat right over here to my right so um I see Simon is typing dot dot dot Simon writes it is indeed a channel on the YouTube website on the internet that is correct all right so what is the coding training what is happening today what is happening for the coding train in the future I saw a few people in the chat just say uh I just stopped in to say hello thank you hello um should we try a different pair of glasses we've got a few different pairs here let's try this pair there's the same prescription I just I just got two two new pairs this is the sort of new style this is more like my old glasses this is one this is two oh should we put a poll how do I how do I do a poll why do I have got to come over here uh to this computer uh let's see start a poll uh one or two one or two ask your community okay the poll is now running oh I can't see the chat this is one this is like you everybody this is the I coding train welcome to the eye doctor this is one this is two now again this looks these aren't my um old glasses they're different but they look much more like my old ones I think I see better with these the same prescription just different uh different glasses maker this is one and this is two okay I think I'm seeing better with two right now so looks like one is kind of winning though in the poll one is up up to 52 percent um all right don't you have bifocals bifocals uh asks uh fishy uh bifocals I have progressives yes and so what progressives do if you don't know again this is clearly what everyone is tuning in for Welcome to the coding drain is when I look at that through the top of my glasses it's for distance and when I look through the bottom it progresses the lens progresses down for reading if I don't have progressives I cannot read at all however the computer to me is in the middle of those distances it's kind of like not far it's not close like reading and so I feel like with my progressives having trouble like seeing the computer I can pull it up here so you see what I'm looking at let's make sure everything's working yes oh no no no no we don't that's like the oldest do not go to that link sponsor link that was I mean you could go there sorry I don't I don't mean don't but it's just not not no official connection anymore right now during this stream I hate by the way when I have to make myself smaller that my hands get cut off if I uh could redesign the studio I would try to have like a really wide shot that is actually what you're seeing not just the camera shot trunk down all right uh two is winning now boy it's really close though uh the new style one is subtler uh I prefer to stare over the top of my glasses in a judgy manner yes all right um I made a list of things that I want to talk about today today is mostly going to be a update and hang out with the community Stream So if you were here for a specific coding tutorial that's not necessarily going to happen it's not going to happen however I will be updating you just to get this out of the way real quick on things like the nature of code book where I will show some new examples and talk about them so there is some learning that I have planned uh I will also be talking about uh the ml5.js library um and some updates about that oh I want to talk about um processing four and my uh updated tutorial series about that making a note I want to look at the coding Train website and some new things that have appeared uh and look at through some pull requests merge them look at some showcase projects ah I want to talk about the memberships let me just let me also get another thing out of the way here and by the way um if Simon says I feel you've already redesigned the studio enough I know that's why I'm not going to just saying I could um one they're gonna show it again yes the poll is still there this is one I actually prefer this style I think but right now these glasses are like a little smudged so it's a little blurry for me this is one and this is two let's go with one but let's see if we can clean them I have I have some of those like lens cleaners somewhere in here but I'm just going to use my tshirt also how do I look just without glasses by the way I cannot wink with this eye my kids like to make fun of me because I I cannot like this is me trying to wink with my right eye oh it's been a long summer oh I'm so happy to be back here live streaming I mean to be honest I'm kind of tired I got I'm old I'm tired I don't know what I'm doing with my life um but I I think that one of the things that brings me tremendous Joy is sharing my love and enthusiasm for what I like to Now call artisanal handcrafted code with the world through YouTube so let's do that okay what was I saying ah so I want to say something right off the bat which is that um I still can't tell the difference that's Walter um uh thank you to everyone who supports the coding train and especially now given that you haven't seen anything new from me since may I think like the entire summer and so um so one uh if that's not what you're happy if you're not happy about that please it's fine like you don't need to support the coding train I'm doing my thing but you know if you want something different this is not what I meant to say what I meant to say is I've actually been working very hard I've also been taking some time and kind of regrouping and lots of other stuff going on but I have been working quite a bit on two projects that have no uh that don't have a lot of visible progress so those of you who are supporting the coding Train by watching old videos sharing videos on social media some of you have signed up through YouTube membership or GitHub sponsorship maybe some of you signed up to nebula which is a streaming service for creators that I am a part of all of those things I just appreciate so much especially during this time where I'm not actively publishing new things that support is really making it possible for me to have spent a lot of the summer working on these two larger projects that I'll talk about today one is the nature of code book lots of updates about that all good news I I feel like I didn't want I didn't want to have a stream until I could really confidently say that I have made significant progress with the book which is a lot of ways let me stream this week no I don't really have a lot to say I haven't really gotten over this hump yet and then this uh which and then another the nature of code many of you might be familiar with although certainly I hope there's viewers are never even heard of the project today because then I get to show you about it show about it to you and then also um I have been working on a reboot of my intro decoding series with processing it's a little over five hours of material so uh and the reason why I mean in olden times my previous practice has been as I'm working on it publish new parts of it so if it's five hours of video uh maybe that's every video is 15 minutes that's five times four that's 20 videos maybe I'm publishing one or two per week as I'm finishing them up so this time I am going to publish it as one five hour long video on YouTube with time codes and annotations we'll see how that goes but that's why it's been uh that's why there's been kind of a dearth uh of stuff also like I'm just kind of I don't know like I don't know how I used to do I don't know how I used to do it all teach Family Travel coding train it's I've been struggling um just kind of balancing and juggling things and project management I'm not very good at it um so I hope um that maybe this fall can be a bit of a reset button nature of code project can be completed the learning processing five hour video could be completed I can go back to some of these other things on my list all right um all right also the Apple episodes was a bit of a Direction but that was quite a while ago now looks like glasses two is at 52 percent um all right I'm seeing some nice comments in the chat the project management yes uh ah let's do something fun this is totally random but um this is sitting in front of me so um uh let me switch to it's gonna be a live unboxing of a project called time since launch this is a completely spontaneous right now because I just saw it this is not planned but um okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna tell you about this uh artwork that I have uh purchased so first of all let me shout out some friends of mine I mean I don't know it's okay if they don't want to be friends with me I just some some some people in an organization that I really admire which is uh sfpc uh let's see school let's see if we find it uh the school for poetic computation ah no this is the new website sorry about that so no official anything here I'm just oh you can't see it so let me go back to it wrong wrong button all right so school for provided computation is an experimental School in New York City supporting interdisciplinary study and art code hardware and critical theory it's a place for Learning and unlearning so first of all I teach at a behemoth of a essentially corporate University NYU uh there are many wonderful things about my job uh first and foremost would be the students um I think that probably the uh worst thing about my job is the cost of tuition and you know we could get into I I could be here all day talking about all the things in between and so I really admire and want to support organizations that are experimenting um in educational practices outside of the sort of corporate Behemoth universities like NYU and um you know there's obviously a lot more to schools around the world there's State schools in the U.S public universities there are schools around the world that are have different funding models and uh um but you know I I have this wonderful job that I am very grateful for that I really enjoy but I also um have conflicted feelings about it that's not what I wanted to talk about today the reason I have this is because sfbc did a fundraiser uh where there were different things you could buy there was a coding train uh train whistle in the shop I don't know if you happen to be watching uh uh and happen to have purchased it if so say hi in the chat and one of the things that I got is an artwork from some friends of mine and also alums of the program where I teach uh cwm let me see if I want to make sure I get the name right let's see if I can find their Studio uh uh here we go CW and T uh and this is their project time since launch which you could get your own I mean I got it through a fundraiser um and it is I'm going to read to you from the description time since launch is a single use long scale launch clock use it to Mark the beginning of your personal Epoch wow this feels very like a very big deal right now that I'm doing this time since launch counts up to one million days by one million random numbers book and I would pull this book out it's got the processing Community catalog on it too but it's holding up uh it's holding up my iPad that I could see the Discord chat and Joseph says nice I'm a fan of cwnt by the way um if you're writing something in the member supporter chat which I'll guess I'll talk about when I get to the membership program I might read it out loud so if you don't want me to for any reason um maybe don't put it there or just like say like please don't read this or something uh okay time since launch has marked thousands of moments around the world has been used to celebrate marriages business launches births graduations habit changes career changes or just to elevate an arbitrary Tuesday to awesome sets so this is more in the category of arbitrary Tuesday to awesome status I guess I could have used it for like um I should have used it so one thing is I I should have used it I recently turned 50. you know I'm not asking for any like birthday wishes but that felt like a big thing and a lot of you might be thinking geez you're old and yeah although you know in some circles that's young try being a faculty member at a large corporate University 50. I'm like spring chicken how that hurt okay um once launched there's no reset option use caution when taking time since launch out of the box be wary of letting your kids or friends fiddle with it prior to launch the batteries included last for 150 plus years backup capacitors temporarily keep time since launch counting during a battery change at launch your moment zero is forever burned into the electronics I'm feeling really anxious about this right now oh my God uh yeah by the way if you're in the YouTube chat you can write please don't read this but I'm going to read it so the YouTube chat you don't get to like uh I'm gonna if you're typing in the YouTube chat I might read it live I mean I I don't mean to be aggressive I mean isn't the most friendly loving way towards you I can't possibly manage like somebody putting a a private message in the public YouTube chat for this live stream that they don't want me to read loud most likely I'm not going to see your message to be honest I mean sometimes I go I mean I'm a weirdo who sometimes will go back and look at the chat from a live stream because I'm curious to see if I miss something interesting but for the most part while I'm live streaming I'm not able to follow the entire chat I wanted to have um right and it's 200 000 random numbers it's one million random digits well that's one million random numbers if the numbers are randomly zero through nine Simon okay if something goes wrong with your time since launch as long as the main chip is physically intact your Epoch can be restored okay storage all right there's a lot more information time since launch.com let's go to that I feel like what better time to launch this than since I I live streamed on the coding train um on an arbitrary Saturday there we go well how do you do that heart thing is that a heart okay wait do I I want to hit start oh no this is just like oh start oh I see you can make your own time since launch just on a website thingy order a physical cop right so I have the physical version so um I'm gonna unbox this now I have not opened this maybe I will switch back to this view so you can see it a little bit better I want to be very careful with this how does it open oh it's got like some very mechanically challenged I have some slight arthritis in this finger which makes it I have to by the way my kids are now like basically teenagers and it's an amazing thing that happens in life now as you get older and my kids are getting older I need need them to help me like open the jar you know it used to be me now Daddy Yankee please open this for me that's the little babies and that was a little bit weird that voice they didn't sound like that um okay so I took off these I'm gonna be very careful oh wow this is beautiful um I don't know that wow okay so I don't know how well you can see this with the green screen I'm gonna go over here to the Whiteboard oh dear that camera is off why did that happen turn this camera on it's possible that the battery I just thought that I might be able to give you a better closeup look at it uh through this camera there we go although I don't think this camera is on auto focus so it's going to be very blurry look at me trying to like highlight this beautiful I could change it to like auto focus but I stand back here you can sort of see this is probably giving you a really nice view of how beautiful this is made so and I don't know if you can see um there is a uh one of those like uh what seven segment displays here which I assume will show the counter once I get it started so single use so how do I start it let me come back here um come back here okay I could also one thing I could do is there's a well this camera is autofocus so I wonder if let me see if I walk around here I could also just show the raw view with the yeah uh there we go this should work pretty well um I mean the light is kind of shiny but now you're getting a nice view of it you can see the batteries it's absolutely beautifully constructed um I love it okay all right coming back around so now we have to figure out how to open this how to start it are there instructions single use help me I don't know let's see look at the box here single use are there instructions does anybody know I mean there's like this little sticker there so I assume I take that off it says single use do I take the top off do I turn this I'm going to take off this label that says single use I assume I'm supposed to take that off um are there instructions online let me go back to here uh let's go okay well I can get a wall mount for it I don't have a wall mount well this feels like oh pull the pin to initiate the timer got it pull the pin there it is look here's a little video okay everybody ready for this okay ready by the way I have uh if you're wondering what's going on here uh some of you might remember that I was in a bicycle accident a bunch of years ago and I have multiple surgeries on my elbow so in case you're wondering what's going on okay uh okay here we go oh drum roll good idea um I did it I'm so cool look it's counting can you see it by the way if bark this time down in history you were here for this moment so cool so I'm just going to consider that this is marking the time of my first live stream since turning 50. that'll make that like a thing it's um okay uh all right uh there we go or or Orion sending you were here Alka it's so nice to see you in the chat like old friends I mean a lot of you that I've never met in person um but I I consider you old friends of people who have been sort of following me and participating in live streams for many many years I will I will work on fixing this up later look at this pen it's like uh uh there I'm gonna put it back in um and I'm gonna just um I'm gonna put this if I put it here can you watch it during the Stream yeah so now you can oh so this will by the way this would be a nice they always have on during my like streams or videos maybe to Mark time okay so let's put this off to the side all right let's get back to some of the business at hand because um so I'm gonna be here uh um no longer than noon I would love to finish sooner it's my last weekend before the semester starts now you might be saying like you could have streamed all summer what's wrong with you I mean on the last weekend before school starts sorry I was working on these two big projects which I will talk about today um all right let's come back to here and let's start digging into some of these things um I think I can probably turn off the poll now um yeah oh Bartos is a young young man of 46. okay let's how do I end this poll end poll because all right so let me get the chat back up here sorry for my arm disappearing um uh okay um all right so we've covered the glasses um put this over here um all right so I haven't done anything on my list because I did a whole thing about the time since lunch uh so I'll put that on my list and check it off time since launch and then future plans so I'm checking one thing off my list okay so things that I have maybe let's start with the code um you know the title of this video says nature of code or this live stream so maybe I should start with that how do people feel about me just starting right off the bat with nature of code maybe that makes the most sense harshi I am so glad you are here too Hershey says so glad to be here and Simon Says classic Dan spends the first 30 minutes of the stream not talking about anything on the list by the way uh again I think I meant to say this if any of you are in the member chat on Discord which I have over here and you see a meaningful or interesting question in the YouTube chat that I maybe miss or don't see which will be most of them please copy paste it with the YouTube person's name into the Discord chat progress let's hear about it okay so first a little bit of History here let's start off here so this is if you I I I expect that if you search online for nature of code the first thing that's going to come up is this web page right here so this is uh the active live published version of the nature of code book the nature of code is a project I mean in some ways I would say I started it in two thousand two but uh so like 22 years ago or 21 years ago whatever the however the math is but um I didn't uh the first time I think that I ever called it the nature of code because I'm talking about my Learning Journey really started in 2002 but the first time I ever called it nature of code was 2008. um media's 2006 somewhere in there when I taught a class called nature of code and one of the things I I don't want to I'll be here all day if I go through everything but one of the things I would encourage you to read if you want the full story is this acknowledgment section which talks about um the class that I took in Spring 2003 like so maybe that's the date that I should have given um 20 years ago a class taught by James 2 called Dynamic bodies there's some other references and a little bit of the history in this acknowledgment so then in 2012 and by the way this link goes to Nowhere buy from create space where does it take you now yeah it CreateSpace is now Kindle Direct Amazon bought them so um uh in 2012 um the material that I had been accumulating over many years teaching this class I put into a book the book was selfpublished um it's still it's available right now I don't I don't suggest please don't buy it right now please wait but I mean if you can't help I mean you could buy it twice whatever you want but if you can't help it of course you could um is available um through I originally selfpublished it through a company called CreateSpace after a number of years Amazon acquired that company so essentially it's now it's selfpublished through Amazon which I do not love which is one of the reasons why I uh I'm making a big change with nature of code two it's not called nature of CO2 it's just nature of code again I don't know what to call it anyway um so in selfpublish and for free online so uh you can read it uh this is the um original version of the book The the examples are all uh processing code so you'll see this like Java syntax um if you don't know what processing is well boy do I have a whole video series for you that's about to come out but um and so uh probably I don't know anywhere in the last five to seven years it's like I'm gonna make a new version of the book so many people sent me good feedback um in particular this neural networks chapter I can't even like bear to read some of this stuff it's so out of date and weird and like not in line with the world of machine learning and neural networks today um so I was slowly inch by in updating the book over a many years and at some point I was like I gotta get it done and then I wasted another year and they're like I really had to get into it I wasted another year then I had a sabbatical and I'm like oh I'm really gonna get it done and I made some progress actually over the sabbatical quite a bit of progress but I didn't finish and so it's been a struggle to try to do coding train and work on this project in parallel and so this summer at a certain point without any Fanfare or announcements I just kind of made a mental decision like you know what no coding train I'm not allowed to make do any live streams make any videos until I have finished a final draft of the nature of code second so I don't want to call the second edition because I don't I know what to call it the new nature of code and so I'm here also I think we could use this to Mark the occasion I would have liked to have like maybe marked its publishing or something because I don't I'm not here to say it's done it's not done there's a lot of work left for me to do but what I am here to say to you is I have written an entire every single chapter now has a finished draft so there is an entire first draft and most of the chapters are essentially done but the reason why I say that is I'm still doing some editing and updating some examples there's some placeholder illustrations think just only thing left to do is go back and fill the gaps and fix things and edit so the announcement here today is that there is a full version that you can read online today of the new nature of code and if you're reading it online today you still have the opportunity to provide feedback and and help towards the final version that will go into the print version of the book now I have also another even more not anymore in parallel also exciting announcement where does this go goes here to make um ah Jesus Oh G suddenly is in the chat okay great so Jesus thank you Kathy uh who wrote us who transferred this comment over I remember your nature of code class in 2006. Jason first of all Jason wonderful student from IP uh that I've kept in touch with over the years I'm so thrilled that you're in the chat I didn't see your message but thank you Kathy for transferring that over do you recall it's two thousand when you took the class in 2006 was that the first time I taught it that would that would match my memory but I'd have to go back and look and see in NYU records if there was an earlier uh version of the class I definitely taught it very early on my first class I ever taught at NYU was um sorry I have this thing that I'm standing on because it helps my back it got old um and it just slid away and I was standing on the hard floor I'm Barefoot see wearing shorts suffer ah there we go okay oh that also hurt um what was I even talking about uh uh like the first class I ever taught at NYU was 2004. um so 2006 would be about right uh it was 2007. ah 2007. okay um okay anyway so let me show you the new draft uh so right now it is on uh well let me go to GitHub so if you're looking for where everything is oh I was going to talk about the print version sorry let me talk about the print version I'm thrilled to announce um that I am partnering with no starch press which is a wonderful um I do have a misspelling of my name though [Laughter] I guess I better let them know no C no C in Chipman I mean there are other people that would be a very a normal way to spell the name uh for whatever reason when uh my answers that's something sounds like that was a long time ago but not even more than like you know in the in the um when would the shipment to come through um I think in in the early 20th century like first of all I can't believe like talk about the 20th century like it was so long ago like I graduated from college in 20th century but anyway uh for whatever reason when um things got transcribed at Ellis Island uh no C was put in my version of shift man which means boat Man by the way uh from the German that's from what I understand anyway that's not what it's here I am here to tell you that the nature of code uh book The Print version will be available through no star address so first of all just to be very clear nothing has changed in terms of the licensing of the book it is still open source create a Commons noncommercial so that means it is a freely available the entire thing under the Creative Commons license the only restriction is you can't print and sell your own version of the book so a non you can't use it for commercial purposes I mean you can use the uh that doesn't go for the code examples and the concepts the code examples are uh MIT license or whatever kind of much more of license I would choose to use so that if you use one of the code examples in an artwork or a commercial project and a place where you're working that of course is allowed I just mean the content of the book is not something that you can resell um so um but I in order to one is um well first of all no starch is fantastic to work with it's I think the primary reason why I'm actually getting it done because they assigned an editor of the project they're doing technical review they've given me a deadline like all the LA the deadline actually for everything else that I need to do is October 1st so I don't um even the the draft is done of all the chapters but I do and everything else has to be done by October 1st so this is happening and the book The Print book will be available in print in 2024. this is something you could do today uh to support the project if you want um you can uh order it now one thing I'll just say I'm thrilled for people to order the Early Access ebook um if you want to support the project that way I don't see a strong like me personally I wouldn't do that because a I'm only paying for it if I really want to have the print version because to be honest ebook is available for free online right now I mean it's not as like a PDF document that you would have to pay for it through here although if you're uh if you are um what's the word I'm looking for where everybody is good at figuring things out if you are come on someone help me with this word this is what happens when you get old I can't pull out like words I used to use all the time not ambitious if you're uh somebody will help me with this word I don't know why I can't think of it ah this is driving me crazy uh teaching interactable saying I'm teaching physics using p5.js at a university in southern Chile thanks to you amazing I hope this book is a helpful resource I hope that once this gets done I can do we can do translations of it so especially if you are somebody who speaks another language um and is interested in helping to publish a translation of the book in another country in another language don't get in touch right now with me in touch with me after October 1st uh not tech savvy not eager not ingenious like oh there's a word I'm looking for Intent no I don't know maybe it doesn't exist I shouldn't technically inclined no you're um okay somebody will get it uh the link to preorder is uh nostarch.com nature Dash code it's right up here I'll put all these links will end up in the chat so um but uh certainly if you want to preorder the print book um go go ahead it's going to be longer than 536 Pages by the way that last chapter 10 which I think I need to break into two chapters got very long bored Frugal no um I want to say like God this is gonna drive me written by coding Train YouTube Star I'm a star baby um uh also misspelling of my name um learn from an expert I'm an expert and a star these are not ways that I would ever refer to myself but I'm fine you know you got to sell books somehow uh so this is happening uh placeholder cover uh pragmatic Pro industrious resourceful yes resourceful I think is what I'm looking for if you're resourceful yes that's the word I think I was looking for uh the print paperback on Amazon right now entertainment is the oh let's see it might actually be available for preorder on Amazon let's take a look I don't know how this works just yet so this version is the 2012 version you know if you purchase it it's not a total loss in the sense that um uh I receive royalties from it so you're supporting me the book content is still uh I would say uh most of it a lot of it is the same or it would be value but but I certainly would suggest don't don't buy it um now the question is can we find uh well so maybe somebody who's resourceful we just use that word over and over again can find if the there is a preorder on Amazon for the new version but at present it might only be available through no starch um I don't know about International so Joseph is actually asking about International I mean no starch certainly distributes their book internationally uh State Province country looks I see no reason why not all of the countries are here uh hello to Tomas uh G Sun Li I hope to get a chance to translate the new nature code book into Korean yes let's talk about that uh I would love that um but again I I can't I can't even bring allow myself to think about that until I'm done so now if so I talked about how you could preorder it now everything for the book currently is in this GitHub repo so actually the entire content the entire draft of text of everything is just here in these like HTML files um and you can also find information around how the book is organized I'm using notion which is something I would like to do some videos about at some point um you know I follow Thomas Frank who is like the world's leading expert on notion I would love to do a collaboration about how the how I've done this book publishing with notion um or just be inspired by him you can actually build the PDF yourself uh if again if you're a resourceful and want to try running um you might be missing a few things like I am using a licensed font for the PDF so that font is not in the repo so when you build the PDF it might be a different font um and so but what's more important for me to show you is if you see this link right here uh we'll take you to and I know it's a second edition I I think I'm not supposed to say second edition it's just like a I don't know I don't know how it's going to work but this is the current draft of the book and I believe if I click this by this book it'll take you to the preorder page so this is the link right here I'm sorry for its sort of clunkiness that you should all eventually this will just be at natureofcode.com but until it's finished it's going to live at this preview link and thank you alga for putting it here in the chat um okay uh all right so um so a couple things that I'll point out one is uh the what I call the introduction in the previous book is now chapter zero Randomness if you could come up with a better title for that I'm open to changing it because um yeah I don't know what what the title of that should be I could also just call it numbers but that didn't really seem to work um so uh I'm gonna just like you can see here uh the book design so Jason gal uh hello shout out has been who's an Alum of ITP who has been working on this project with me for probably over a year now and and many other people have contributed um uh that I'm that I'm not mentioning here as well and I'll try to as I remember mention everybody but has worked on this whole build process so this is the current website design the website I'm kind of not as worried about right now because I have in I have the rest of my life however long I live counting through time I can work on refining and improving the website but the PDF the print version has to get locked in you know in the next month or so but um if you scroll through you'll see this design of the book you'll see the code is now uh JavaScript um I plan to maintain uh processing versions of all the examples so you can read the book and you know in a fantasy land I might like have a little button here that I can just click a button and it has the book in processing but I don't have time to implement that right now um you can see that the examples are running right here on the page and then you can click this button that takes you right to the example in the P5 web editor look at the code run it there so that's a wonderful um there's new illustrations that Zanna Marsh is working on um and yeah so you know I could keep going through this but you can basically see what the book looks like um let me click through the chapters vectors it's pretty much the same as the first edition just with updates and improvements uh forces pretty much the same updates and improvements oscillation pretty much the same updates and improvements particle systems pretty much the same updates and improvements I mean there's been significant work on each of these chapters I don't mean to minimize that but um I want to get to where there's much more substantial changes uh autonomous agents uh pretty much the same I would say that uh this last section um has had uh has some new uh new examples um one of the things actually if somebody wants to work on um you know Jason is working on all this stuff so if you really wanted to work on this please open an issue so that there's not redundant work but some of these examples run very slow on the page not because they actually run slow but because the web the web page loads many many many many any examples so there's many canvases all running on this page so they run very slow there is I believe lazy loading meaning that the sketches don't load until you scroll to them but once I've scrolled all the way to the bottom they don't unload further up so things start to run quite slow so if anyone wants to help with optimizing that lazy loading that's uh that's something that I'm looking for help with yes new cover art Joseph I have yet to figure out who's doing that and how I'm doing that I have a lot of different people like who work on coding train illustrations who work on the book illustrations book design so I have the uh somebody who did the original cover design so I have to figure that out um but um but yeah so that's one sort of major issue with the book but you can see there's a new section on the quad tree example I'm referencing a lot of coding train videos a new sign and cosign lookup table example so there's a bunch of new things in all the chapters I'm just highlighting here in a Time series now physics libraries this chapter has had a major rewrite because the original version of the book If I go to here and go to physics libraries uh is mostly about a physics Library called box 2D which is a wonderful um a physics library that I would encourage everyone to continue to use it's just quite involved and a little tricky to use in JavaScript so I have been using more recently a JavaScript library called matter.js um which um is now the sort of Base Library for this chapter I also am still using toxic Libs which is in the chapter and then I also want to give a major shout out here to see if I can find it P5 yes so I also you know I you know if I'm being completely honest here and thank you to Quinton who I believe I owe some emails or Discord messages back to who's been very patient with me um P5 play is an incredible library for uh P5 specifically that was initiated by Paulo predicini and is currently led by Ashley one of the work one of the huge things that Quentin has done from the way I understand it with P5 play is added rigid body collisions all built on top of box 2D so in many ways I think you could make a really really strong case for why this whole chapter should just be written in P5 play but there's just not the state of play if you will of where I was when working on this so Quentin has very generous in answering my questions and porting all of the examples that are in this chapter to P5 play so um so yeah so I also wanted to mention P5 play and when the book gets finished and released um uh expected to be able to see uh through Clinton's hard work version of all the examples with P5 play Okay so this chapter is about the physics libraries uh Southern automata is a chapter of fractals is a chapter evolutionary communism is a chapter I'm just looking at the time here we're already at almost 11 o'clock and I'm only on item number one on my list so I gotta move through some things here um um there's a need for intersection observers on sleeping and waking them would be really nice yeah lots of lots of things okay um neural networks this chapter is where I have spent the most amount of time just in the last couple months so this chapter is is almost a complete rewrite and I'm going to just go through the table of contents for it um if we have time I wanted to demo some of the examples maybe I oh when I get to ml5 that's what I'll do the examples are now using the ml5 library I will demo those examples when I get to that on my list so let's go through the table of contents um first section is just about the sort of background in history of artificial neural networks I start code wise with making a perceptron so for me sometimes something that I really like to do is go back to the origin of an algorithm that's used today in really large scale and complicated ways so for me like if you're you know just to pull out an example out of thin air if you're using chat GPT chat GPT the text generate through chat GPT is coming from a large language model which is a Transformer architecture of a massive neural network of many many neurons and connections and all sorts of sophisticated learning and out and activation algorithms that have that is the result of you know now what is we can't do the math the 70 close to 70 years of research and probably longer if I'm probably getting that wrong but to understand it to me I like to go all the way back to what is the unit the single foundational element inside of these largecal systems and that is a neuron and in 1957 at the Cornell aeronautical laboratory the perceptron the idea of a perceptron the simplest neural network one neuron with inputs and outputs that was uh that that history of that research can be traced back to to um to that work and so the code example goes through how to build and the theory and practice of a single perceptron so that's a large portion of the chapter and it finishes with this example that looks at classifying dots in a twodimensional space above or below a line using a perceptron okay uh so walnuts asks uh I'm hesitating to answer your name to answer your question here but walnuts asks why is the library why are the libraries ending with five P5 ml5 uh anybody know I know the answer let's see if somebody knows I can answer it in the chat but then I'll answer it if nobody knows uh okay but I'm gonna keep going here uh then um I go into a little bit of theory about why a single perceptron can't do very much and the concept behind a multilayered perceptron but then this is where I make a huge skip forward so I want to go I go in the chapter I go through the theory um and algorithm behind the sort of like nuts and bolts the base Foundation of what a neural network is but then I jump to ml5 which is a machine learning library which has neural networks baked into it so I could just say make a new neural give it this data train it look at the output so that's where the chapter pivots and I go through and I explain uh class of classification and regression I look at the sort of M the idea of mnist in neural networks these are all placeholder illustrations as you can see so if you have ideas or thoughts about and this is borrowed from uh Hogan's material just as a sort of reference point for when I actually do the work with xanna to create the illustrations you can see my like chicken scratch here so I go through code and uh one of the first example I make is a simple gesture classifier uh ah okay oh I love a wire reference well thank you for the wire reference Crossing I've got so first of all no no no no no no no no no no no there's a definite misconceptions here in the chat which I want to correct processing is an active project it's funny that you would think like that's interesting to make that theory like oh there's processing four and P5 no no that's just a coincidence that processing happens to be on version four and P5 is called P5 is only on version 1.7 so there's the version numbers and then there's the actual name so so far nobody's gotten it let's see uh chapter 10 is not available in the Early Access PDF Jason but that's going to be remedied like on Monday uh so that that that will be remedied uh um I just I finished the draft like literally like two days ago so I haven't generated the PDF and given it to no Starship not HTML5 although that's interesting well it's gonna be a while somebody's gonna get this uh so Joseph's got it in the Discord so um and Kate k uh okay we which I really work hard to pronounce Steve I never do it right asks any plans on including stuff about chat gbt in the book so I mention generative Ai and new architectures and make the connection to those uh Concepts and those those modern techniques but I'm not going through that in detail in the book I do have plans to do more educational materials around generative Ai and Transformer models and working with ml5 but for the nature of code book you'll see I'm kind of limited in scope um uh okay so so Joseph has got it in so Joseph wins as the coding train sticker whatever I mean it's not actually nobody wins anything I'm just saying you know uh um alka's now got it but I'll wait for it to come from somebody uh in the YouTube chat we'll see or um all right so uh I look at building machine learning model and this is the example uh all the way through um where it's trainable you could see like also this computer this is not my current laptop this is my old um 2019 MacBook Pro I still just use it for as like my now it's now it's just like permanently sitting on this desk for live streaming it's also struggling I think here to run some of these things but okay so here's the gesture classifier so it already ran um but basically I can make a gesture and it classifies it and we can see like if I do this I got right like how much down so I want to make a point here which is that of course you don't need neural networks to do this you could just like use some if statements and some math to evaluate like which way what angle is the heading of the vector um but I like to have an example that kind of that's very uh obvious and trivial so that you can see all the steps so you could do something more complex and that's like what some of the exercises are here so the exercise here which I hope take a solution for is you know my gesture is just a start point and an end point but what if it is a sequence of points what if I could have like a figure eight gesture versus a circle gesture and that kind of thing start classifying shapes so um and what if I use the hand pose model so um so there's that um then now here's the thing that I would love to hear feedback from all right so Karen got it uh oh coded design program being launched at your school Stig that's wonderful so I'd love to hear more about that um I still have a shout out to Stig in the audience who is was one of the organizers of processing Community Day in Copenhagen uh by the way there's a PC Taiwan that's happening I think the first week PCD by the way is processing Community day which is something that anybody can run one of their own it's a way of organizing an event for your your community around processing and creative coding um so um and and in case you're wondering what's in the box what's in the box it is a um authentic Danish train whistle from the 1950s I believe um lovely little sound there um so ah but I wanted to say that there's PCD Taiwan is happening I don't know the exact date but I think I'm speaking remotely I will be in Taiwan just for like 10 or 15 minutes so tune in for that next time I'll be appearing online oh I also wanted to mention I was on a podcast recently about AI so let me come back to that I'm making a note here all right so ah So currently it's chapter 10. and uh and chapter 10 I make a pivot to the concept of reinforcement learning and specifically neuro Evolution which is like a Twist on reinforcement learning it's really long I think it's about if I in the print PDF I think it's about 70 pages right now so I'm curious any of you who just are looking through this today or anytime the next few days love to hear from you I think that should be two chapters it was originally supposed to be two chapters but I was having such writer's block and it was such a mental hurdle to get this thing done and I was like let me just make it one chapter and I'll add something about neuro Evolution on the end but then once I went to do that my neural Evolution section became really quite long so I think maybe now I can go back now that I've written the draft and break into the two chapters but I'd love to hear about that from you one thing that I'm struggling with which also uh suggestions would be great and by the way if you're wondering like how do you give me these suggestions join the cutting train Discord um yes and and K weakbond is making a very good point neuro evolution is not really reinforcement it's not reinforcement learning and um I would love for you to read this over and I make that point and and and make a transition to it but um I would love to any feedback you have about if I did that off you know in an accurate way the book is is having a technical review process which people are being paid uh one person is being paid to read over it but but I I welcome additional uh technical review um I I don't wanna I don't want to take advantage of people's generosity in time but certainly feedback as well okay oh point zero you made the January 2023 pull request I did I'm sorry about that let me I'm not good at managing this let's can you tag me in Discord and maybe we can chat about this I just gotta remember to go back and look at that um okay so this will probably get broken out into a separate chapter um one thing that I'm struggling with is I I have like this ecosystem project at the end of every chapter prompt and it makes a lot of sense what to put at the end of the neuro Evolution section but if I don't get to neural Evolution I don't know what to put here but anyway um the counter thingy was initialized yes you can see it over here right now but I guess the light makes sense you can't read the time maybe now you can see it okay so going through uh these are not these are placeholders the actual uh we'll have new illustrations made uh for the book um but I go through the game Flappy Bird I talk about evaluating the game Flappy Bird in terms of features like the position of the bird its velocity its distance to the next pipe the location of the pipes and then I look at how a neural network can use those features to decide whether to flap its wings or not I look at how you can do that in ml5 and then build a neuro Evolution example so first of all I just create the Flappy Bird clone which I'm going to attempt to play here clicking the mouse it's running so slow so this is me playing it by clicking the mouse and then I go through how to do it with neuro Evolution um and all the ml5 stuff it's a lot of stuff here and then you'll see here this is neuro Evolution uh um so I'm seeing comments in the chat um and I'm not able to answer all them so sorry about that so uh right I do not go into so Dominique is asking a question about the specifics of reinforcement learning don't get into it into the book yeah so goodness my iPad with this chat um okay I would love to just like I I realized in life I can't do it all this like system I have or like trying to hold this iPad in place it's not really working very well all right then I'm just gonna get through this quickly then I look back smart Rockets is one of the examples in um in chapter nine with for genetic algorithms and I make a neural network version of it and then I'm really excited about then I do as neuro Evolution steering example there's a lot of examples there's a cat here I talk about sensors I look at how to like build sensors into a um like a little creature that can like you know that they sensors light up when it gets close to an another shape and then I kind of have this final example where I can speed up time here and these agents evolve to learn to effectively use their sensors to find and eat this food so let's see if I can run this for a little while well sometimes they all die out and I did something to uh I did something to the example which didn't make it in yet where you can add more but I can just reset so I'm still finetuning the parameters of this so uh so I think they're all going to die out again it's funny of course I'm having bad luck here while uh streaming maybe this one is going to lift come and clone yourself you're doing so well just clone yourself yes yes okay that was great so it made a lot of them and they're really quite good now so I can slow this back down and see that basically they use their sensors to be able to detect the food and they stay on the food eating uh until it's gone and then they wander around but they've learned this Behavior essentially through the process of neuro Evolution so this is like when I first thought about the nature of code in like 2006 or whatever this is kind of the example that I was dreaming of making and I finally got through finishing this chapter and have it here so I love neuro Evolution um I should also shout out David ha who is a um let me go here to uh his website otoro.net who has done a ton of work uh in uh I mean this is like a huge inspiration to me um let's see below machine learning projects I think you can find here yeah a lot of all the papers on uh you can see how similar a lot of these are to what I'm doing uh you can see directly like inspiration coming from here Hardware accelerated neuro Evolution so if you want to go even further this stuff um you can look at David ha's uh work as well um okay so that's really just about everything I have to say in nature of code oh one more one important thing here uh 1110 geez 50 minutes here for the rest of my list but the main topic I want to talk about was nature of code so first of all if you are teaching this fall and want to use the new nature of code um please be in touch you could just don't need to be in touch because it's just there but I would love to hear from you uh and then you know if you're teaching in the spring and using the nature of code maybe your students maybe you could order the book for your University or School bookstore just saying okay um then uh okay um I think I'm wrapping this up oh yeah I remember what I want to say so let's say here's an important thing let's say you're reading the book and you have a comment you want to make uh uh a suggestion so first of all proceed with some level of understanding that I'm really trying to get this done and I I've put Blood Sweat tears over many many years into this it's I've dragged it out more than I could ever possibly drag it out so I am I don't want to say taking shortcuts but I'm the Kill Your Darlings I think is the uh is it Hemingway or Alan Ginsburg whoever made that phrase I having to kill my darlings which which is a phrase that sort of means like I just sure it would be great to include more about reinforcement learning in the book or use a different physics library in chapter six or uh include an additional example I just can't do that so if you have uh you know so what I'm looking for is more feedback about parts that are especially confusing things that are really but clear mistakes in terms of like how I'm describing math the math and physics Concepts um and typos and and that kind of thing um you can probably ignore like things like oh the figure number is wrong I mean eventually at some point I need that feedback but you know it's in copy editing and that kind of stuff hasn't gone but unfortunately right now you cannot pull request fixes even though the content is in here um and you could make a pull request to this HTML file that is like all of them the content of chapter three but this is actually coming for motion so this is an automated process where these HTML files are built from notion dot pages that I'm writing into so your best path for uh offering suggestions or Corrections is to open an issue and my preference would be that you open it sounds like uh uh individual issues for uh for different comments so rather than like here's one issue with like 100 comments about the book I mean again you're giving up your time to do this so if that's the way you want to do it that's like I'm not going to stop you but for me it's easier to then see the issue go and make the fix manually and notion myself and then close the issue and it's just keep project management wise helps me keep track of the book so I just wanted to make that clear to anybody uh watching okay uh all right so uh let me answer the question about the fives so processing when it originally was invented the URL processing was not available so it was called processing with two Prof processing with two fives and I believe if you go to that URL it will still take you to the current processing website so Prosper fiving was kind of the it was an alternate name for processing it was often written that way so P5 used the five from the original processing as an homage uh to processing so that's where the five comes from in ml5 the five is there just to say that this library is meant to be used with P5 okay uh Simon yeah the moving left thing um is uh is related to the way that I'm initializing the neural network weights and I could do something to get around that but in the end they kind of like learn how to move backwards they still tend to like have a moving to the left trajectory but I didn't I couldn't figure out an elegant way to talk about that and fix that in the book maybe if I add to chapter 11. yeah so that's that's um yeah okay ah MB lab yeah that's is asking about um first of all I haven't taken a break and I'm talking continuously I need a moment to breathe while I think about the next topic okay all right I'm gonna go right down on my list and talk about um coding training website and membership program any questions about uh um oh yeah so um so I haven't all I would love to make a series all about git and Version Control high priority on my list of things to go back and do again uh realistically when I would get to it I don't know uh some things about the old videos are still useful and apply they're quite out of date um but you could try it uh I mean yeah I would love to love to do that um an interactive also says it was helpful to them in the last week so that's that's nice to hear um but yeah I rebooting old things is is what I'm doing and my first priority was learning to code with processing I think my second priority is updating some old P5 tutorials and then probably my third would either be the ml5 videos or GitHub getting GitHub those would be kind of but you know I'm slow to get to things these days okay so let's talk about the coding Train website so this is not new anymore uh designed created and designed by Design Systems International uh put together by so many people from the community um um uh that um so I took a little break to pause there and I I just realized like wow I'm tired I'm exhausted from and all this energy and excitement about nature of code and now that I finished going through that I'm feeling a little bit like uh tired okay um so coding Train website so if you're brand new to the channel this is your place to start this is where those tracks that I've been referencing of like oh you want to learn to code from scratch oh yeah here's a p5.js track uh you want to learn a little bit more about git and GitHub for poets if you want to learn about I just called it that because it's not trying to be nontechnical and we use a poem I use a poem as the sort of like canonical example tracing through um but this is the one that's kind of old and out of date I mean look look at that beautiful young face there in those glasses there's like no gray in that beard amazing oh Memories by the corner of okay I got a little dizzy singing there okay um so this is your place to get started now most people come to find the coding train through the challenges the challenges are single videos where I work through a particular project a lot of them are mathematical algorithms that I am attempting to visualize you know probably like a prime example of that is something like uh the heart curve and if you look at that you'll find uh the video um some this one's in two parts so there's two parts timestamps uh the code examples here so I can click here and I can find the code example which is right there and then I don't know if that's the appropriate use of that term of the website the passenger showcase so the passenger showcase is the place where you can submit and thank you to Kathy who I see has some submissions here who has been doing a lot of work in helping to curate the Showcase um it's where you can submit your own versions so I'm I'm going through this quickly because I can get now to the Showcase page in the Showcase page and by the way uh is where you'll see all of the projects um in uh reverse chronological order so we can look and you know the idea of the coding train uh you know Raphael uh decorville does an amazing job of this with his weekly creative coding challenges and streaming every week and looking at everybody's work I aspire to be like that I haven't been able to keep up with it I want it I would like to if I can get back into the habit of live streaming more often every week go through some recent submissions but I'll just do that now we can see here's one from uh Pana or sorry Tamaki uh Pana go around by Tamaki komatsuzaki which I guess is this I don't know if this is like a known character or a creation of an original character but you can see if I had to guess this is maybe from like my polar coordinates video let's see uh from no 3.6 graphing sine wave so we can go here we can see ah this is the video that this project was made with and you can see it's the only showcase project with that video now the thing that's really exciting that's new and a huge thanks to deepam who uh if I'm missing somebody apologies I think depalm did the bulk of this work um and depalm remind me if I'm pronouncing your name correctly uh if I go to the guides and I want to talk about the membership guide this is something brand new also if I go to the passenger showcase guide this is the submission form where you can submit a project now you can submit your project through GitHub uh with a pull request and Kathy noted to me that it's a little confusing how to do that and I should spend some time going over how to do that but I might have to cut that for time yeah thanks for reminding me we'll play this song in the background is it really loud I really messed that up because okay just enjoy this for a moment autotune and the internet was successful all right all right thanks for that reminder where was I ah so one of the thing uh the last time you might have looked at this if you haven't looked at in a while you could only submit showcase projects for the coding challenges through the website you could otherwise do it through a pull request in a somewhat convoluted process and I need to update the tutorial for how to do that to clarify that process but now you can actually pick which track you want your project to go with so for example there are some videos this is left unfinished because I'm focusing on the writing somebody I'll get back to it for example if I go to Nature of code this will now populate with all of the nature of code videos so if I have made a Project based on the arrive steering video then this is where I can submit it title of the project URL an image your name your website your email is optional and I'm not I don't believe I'm store I'm not storing it anywhere I think to fact check this but um I am um it gets used to link to your GitHub account so you can get because it this automates a pull request so if you put in your email associated with a GitHub account in that field then you will get uh tagged as the uh creator of those commits on GitHub and then social media handles are nice because again I we I haven't kept up with this um uh Katie Chan who runs Cody train social media accounts currently um uh is we'll get back in the habit of this hopefully but we like to tag people on social media about their passenger showcase submissions okay so that is up so I think Kathy I'm sorry I know you um mentioned this there is some information about how you can do this process through a pull request but it is a little it's changed a little bit let me see if I I don't need part of me is I don't even know how this works but let's look I think the challenge is that is finding where the file goes so on the website uh uh under videos maybe yeah I think like so for example I think if you wanted to do it through a pull request and you're doing nature code and I forgot what one I said but like if and you have to like find the video yeah so it's just like tricky you just have to like uh find the path of where the markdown file um for the video is which can be a little bit tricky you've probably a little bit of detective work it requires you to be resourceful today's word of coding train is brought to you by today's word of the day resourceful did it did it pop up here and like was there an animation and a sound effect no I guess it only happens when I hire people to do that in postproduction okay um so so this is where you would want to put that manually you just have to create the Json file in an image file so I kind of went over it but I glossed over it okay let's get to the next and give me a second here I totally forgot just give me can you bear with me for a second here polar to coordinate let's play a different song Pearl and noise song so this is random oh that's very loud pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like okay seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this two three I had some slides to show you I don't have them six seven five six seven I have them available in Discord well this is like I'm opening Discord it's hard but it's like updated I could read random numbers the issue is how to add this oh add the Showcase Kathy is clarifying for me something um really important which is uh uh I'll just say it um which is that if you want to add a showcase project for a video that doesn't have any that are part of it already then you have to create that showcase folder which is a little bit tricky but uh just get in touch tag me or tag station manager maybe or engineer on Discord which are um people who can help uh answer your questions about how to do this stuff okay uh Discord now I have to log in it's going to give me a QR code yes so just bear with me one more minute log in I'm in I'm gonna look for my direct messages here and just give me a second oh I should have done this in advance I'm so sorry everybody one this oh this is probably not worth it but I'm gonna do it anyway yeah you can listen to the song again with curly noise I might pick numbers like this three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five purling noise that is purling noise so this is hurling noise that is so this is hurling noise that is hurling noise so this is hurling noise that is hurling noise this is this is hurling noise that is hurling so this is hurling noise that is hurling noise apparently but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five okay I'm back to you uh uh there we go all right so uh the other thing that is new on the website that I wanted to talk about is coding train um for lack of a better term membership or support so um this is always tricky for me to talk about or think about a coding train is not not a fulltime coding trained YouTuber person I do not rely on uh crowdfunding uh and other revenue from ads for my primary source of income I have a fulltime job with benefits as a at New York University so I really hesitate to ask people to support the coding trade that said I'd spend a tremendous amount of time on the coding train and at any given time they're anywhere between like two and ten people working on projects uh that I hire to do things like animation video editing on the nature of code book I've been investing a lot of funds into for illustrations um you know I will hopefully recoup a lot of that through royalties from the book but it's all out of pocket right now uh building the website doing design so those of you who are who want to or are able to support the coding train um it helps so and it I kind of you know honestly like I try to budget to basically Break Even sometimes I come out a little bit ahead sometimes I come out a little bit um a little bit under um I you know I'm trying to get better at accounting so I actually just hired a bookkeeper so that's where some of the funds go to as well um so but I have not done a great job at uh keeping up with the benefits and perks and rewards if you will of subscribing to various things like get up sponsorships and YouTube memberships so over the last over this summer I've been meeting with Katie Chan who helped run the social media accounts and and uh Jason uh hegland who has designed a lot of the logos and and and and makes a lot of the like stickers and things like that and we have worked to streamline and consolidate uh and clarify the ways that you can support the coding train and what types of things you get access to for doing so I want to just kind of go through a little bit of that right now if you'll indulge me doesn't interest you because you click away you put me in the background whatever it's fine so hopefully this will just take a few minutes um I will on the website there is now under guides this membership guide which hopefully explains all of this um and I'm going to show you these images that Katie worked on that'll go on Instagram I've tried to use as many train puns as possible in here so please enjoy that um I cannot confirm or deny the use of any AI large language models to help me brainstorm Fun Train puns but where am I going here uh membership okay so let's let's go through these okay membership announcement and not as exciting as you might think but still pretty exciting okay um oh my God a computer system what are the changes so the main thing is I am trying I'm only going to have like two levels there's different ways you know buying the nature of code book is a way of supporting the coding train I know that there's like super chats and all sorts of other things and uh I I would say also um donating to the processing Foundation is another way to support the work that I'm doing uh it's you know uh in indirectly I suppose or maybe in a way that's more needed like I I always say like if you're going to support one or the other like support the processing Foundation um but uh I tried to simplify and so there's only like two levels so you know if you have I'm only thinking I think it was two levels so uh uh passenger or conductor so most platforms have five dollars a month or ten dollars a month the and I'm trying to streamline what the uh rewards are so for uh the five dollar a month um uh passengers um is access to uh some uh unlock some Discord channels it is a public open Discord server but there are some member only channels um the rewards I used to do them piecemail so when somebody signs up I would send them a sticker pack and I would get behind and those of you who were owed the train whistles like waited like two years to get them those have been sent out so now the way it's going to work is once a year I'm gonna send out a coding train sticker path to everybody so any for every year that you're a member once a year are going to post a form in Discord tag everybody post you know communicate on all the platforms so I'm not collecting people's addresses and information when they sign up once a year I'm gonna say hey if you're a member and you want the sticker pack enter your information into this form it's all going to go out that mailing will probably go out by the end of September that's a goal we've ordered all the stickers um so now is a good time to sign up because if you sign up you're gonna you're gonna get that sticker pack pretty soon if you've been a member for five years you're going to get it if you remember for one year you're gonna get it everybody again everybody gets a sticker pack who signs up um and I decided to give out stickers for free to people in person and events and things when I can obviously I would love to in an Ideal World I would just mail stickers to everybody but that's not realistic okay and then uh I haven't done these in quite a while but sometimes when I'm recording videos that I'm not doing as part of a live stream uh there will be behind the scenes and Q a sessions for smaller groups so those are the main perks but uh in the end what I'm saying is do not sign up for these I'm trying to give these out but sign up only if you feel like you have the capacity and want to um yeah and then the only thing different is I will I'm able to like produce more than just stickers if you sign up for a little bit more um so I I think we're doing I mean I guess I I don't know if it's meant to be a surprise or not but I'm doing a like um like us I don't know what to call it like an uh I actually don't even know what it is but it's a special more like physical enamel pin like lanyard type thing with like a uh you can and a lanyard coding train lanyard thing that might be like a ticket a train ticket design like try to do something special every year like this custom laser etched train whistle uh for the 10 a month okay great I don't want to belabor this too much so existing members nothing changes uh but hopefully this is good news because you get you're gonna get something every year um wrote some more about why um mostly the thing that I want to say is like if you feel like hey I signed up a while ago and I never even got you know if you have any questions about this this is your email address that you can write to and now the sort of ways you can support so I've decided to take the approach of like huh I'm just gonna like offer up whatever platforms exist um some platforms have specific things that you get for that specific platform honestly my favorite one at present is GitHub sponsors so if you go to github.com codingtrain I think there is a sponsor button here which has uh these levels that you can and um the reason why is the GitHub uh takes I think the least amount of fees from it um uh and it seems like a nice system but YouTube membership is might be the one you want because if I post anything that's like a Members Only video on YouTube or you get the badges and things G suddenly just well I have to do my old my old thing how did I do this I used to do this the live stream Jason Lee you have just just climbed aboard the passenger car of the coding train welcome for your membership you get don't let you get a little badge a little dot a little purple purple dot next to your name if this wasn't all like like very you know if I could manage to do this I might like pull this out and read you a random number but you know all that stuff thank you for joining um so these are the platforms that exist um you can look at them there's links to them I also want to mention that uh nebula like there's a lot I have more to say about nebula because uh when I get to my uh processing updates um um so I I I'm I'm uh one uh there's a question which one gives you the most money I think it's GitHub sponsors I think GitHub sponsors just I don't know if they still have this promotion for a while they weren't taking any fees and they were matching I don't think they're doing that anymore that was like when they first started GitHub sponsors um yeah um so but I'm gonna talk nebula is another way of supporting the coding train that is really incredible and you get a lot of stuff nebula is an incredible streaming service that um is part of uh that is a new company independent streaming uh independent creators it has a show called jet lag that I'm obsessed with um so many amazing channels that I could name that are on the nebula platform and you can sign up and I um so that is a way of supporting the coding train I don't at present have all of these things linked if honestly you ask me to choose what I think you should do I would say sign up for nebula through my link that's I might not get the most money from that but that's my most favorite way for people to support the coding train because I'm really excited about nebula and want to do more with nebula but I will be talking about soon away I will be um posting my processing video series on nebula as an exclusive first so if that's something you're really interested in and want to look at it in advance of it going to YouTube um Netflix thing you want to sign up for and when it's ready I'll talk more about that in a live stream okay oh on GitHub organizations have a six percent fee so what do individuals had because I switched over to an organization from an individual but six percent is I mean YouTube takes uh 30 I think I think it's 30 percent that's a lot more than six percent okay um all right and then all the details are here at thecodingtrain.com membership okay oh deep Palm okay great back to one thing so that's about the membership stuff that's all I want to say about that if you have questions I'm happy to answer but I don't want to spend too much time on that it's not my priority um okay I want to go back to the um the guides and go to the passenger showcase guy oh no I'm gonna go to the uh tracks so let's go into um code program with P5 and I believe like shapes and drawing maybe has a bunch of Passenger showcase oh no how does it not have any passenger showcase projects color maybe interesting I guess these beginner projects it's sort of new that you could do this well let's get random yeah random has a bunch of Passenger showcase projects so one of the things that I didn't realize thank you to deepam who pointed this out is if I click submit to the Showcase here first of all don't you love that the the buttons cycle through and you hover over them they they like cycle through like all sorts of different colors yeah look at that it's like cycling through rainbow colors I love that so much okay um so if I click on this it Auto populates Auto popular oh no populace that makes me so happy okay cutting Train website membership showcase all right I have to get back to my family and the weekend in about 15 minutes things left on my list some of these are like things I can mention in just a minute let me maybe I'll go through those and then come back to ml5 towards the end oh great zero percent oh percent on GitHub sponsors that's very helpful zero percent fee but honestly like I really to me the membership program is more about building Community I mean sure like who we don't why give dollar fifty to Google when it the dollar fifty could go to me I suppose but um if you really enjoy um the uh having the sort of perks and features on the YouTube membership stuff you should feel free to do that okay all right now what what do I want to do so let me come back to ml5 I'm thinking about what I want to okay uh all right let's talk about um I don't know if anyone's watching okay you know I should maybe I should do Emma I'm going back what I said maybe I should look at ml5 right now and then uh I'll just go through quick things at the end okay let's do that okay so what's happening with the ml5 project so um I've worked on a lot of different open source projects over the years most notably uh processing and uh then working on helping to start the processing Foundation um these days my focus in terms of the actual open source work that I'm doing is mostly on this project and the reason that is um well for the processing Foundation has expanded and there's a lot of people working on P5 and processing now and lots of announcements and things to come there um but for me uh I have this is something that I'm actively working on for my teaching at NYU I'm able to apply for funding and work with NYU students to build out this Library so that's become kind of my uh research if you will work while at my day job at NYU the ml5 project it also is tied to that chapter 10 of nature of code so I've been investing a lot of time over the summer in this project so there's lots of announcements about ml5 to come I'm not going to really necessarily get into everything but what I wanted to point out to you is if you go to the GitHub you might notice that there is this repo called ml5 Next Gen so proceed with caution this is not ready for prime time there's no release of this um that's ready and documented if you are teaching with ml5 and you have class next week you know nothing has changed for you but if you want to take a sneak peek and poke around and follow what's going on um this is the repo for you so let's just see I don't know how far I'm gonna get with this I I've been working on this a ton but on my uh work laptop not on this streaming laptop so I don't know what's going to happen when I try to uh run this but let's let's first like what version of node am I running 17.3 so that might be a problem do I have NVM yes so I want to use NVM so NVM by the way so by the way if you are a beginner programmer or you just kind of wandered in here from who knows where I'm about to do some stuff that's a little bit beyond probably where you are in your journey um so feel free to follow along but be aware uh um you know I have and I can help if you join the Discord or you ask some questions the community will hopefully help answer what's going on here but um essentially like just as a reminder if you go to thecodingtrain.com and get started with code those would be where some of the beginner tutorials which would ramp you up towards the sort of place where I am right now but right now I'm going to do something which is high degree of difficulty which is attempt to follow some instructions about how to build an open source Library uh for and see if I could run it in a testing way so this um so NVM is a particular tool that stands for node version manager node is a way of running JavaScript code sort of on your computer and developing web applications and different things you know outside of P5 and the world of the web our clients at the world of the web browser I should say so if you want to try to follow along here the first thing you would need to do is install NVM I'm skipping that step then I would need to go to a terminal and make sure I have the correct version of node that's compatible with ml5 let's try doing that and I wouldn't be surprised if I don't get all the way through with this but let's see if an error comes up okay so now uh and I think it's having me use that version so if I type node version yeah I'm actually already using that version so I don't even need to uh say uh use 18 but I could do that I'm still in 18. um okay now the next thing I need to do is install a global package Dash G is for a couple called yarn what is yarn your crochet but here in my artisul handcrafted code I think I'm going to Rebrand the coding strain to artisanal handcrafted coding train um um yarn is what is known as a package manager and if you've used a patch manager before probably used npm because that's node package manager but yarn is a different one that's maybe a little more recent new I mean it's probably not that new anymore people love it and there are some aspects of ml5 that require yarn so install yarn uh okay did that work so now I should be able to say ah so now I need to clone this repo hopefully that's going to work so I'm going to grab and by the way um you can use GitHub desktop I'm finding it more maybe that more and more people are using GitHub desktop maybe I should do some tutorials with GitHub desktop there's a GitHub command line interface Etc but I'm using this particular way of authenticating into my account when working with GitHub but you probably if you're going to be following exactly what I'm doing you're not an owner of ml5 so you probably need to use this particular URL this will only work if you own or have access to ml5 and so I'm going to say git clone the next gen repo okay so now uh if I look at the desktop I should have a folder called ml5 next 10 and it's got a lot of stuff in it so I want to CD change directory there and then I can go and by the way this is not something anybody needs to do when working with ml5 this is a process for developing ml5 and would be required now if you want to test the new version but soon won't be so I'm going to run this command yarn does that is that just the generic yarn install I don't have to say install I guess of everything yeah so now this is installing all of the other dependencies and things so ml5 Library depends on all these other packages and things so now the the working on a project with JavaScript with the node ecosystem is entering into a world of a million different libraries and dependencies and packages and functionalities and as you can see one of the things that's getting installed is all this tensorflow stuff so tensorflow is Google's open source machine learning library that ml5 is uh most of ml5 is built on top of okay so now I should be able to say yarn start and it's gonna build the library run a web server and open up a web page open up a web page open up a web page of the current examples so oh did I not merge oh shiftman okay so it's okay I'm gonna I'm gonna show you something even more crazy in a moment um but let's just start here so first of all you can run um any of these examples so I'm going to show you an example that I made recently with the new uh ml5 and um this is by the way this model was created and brought in by um uh Peter Lynn um and let's see if this works so look at this by the way okay if you're like me and you're an old timer and you are learning creative coding in like 2001 and uh and you and somebody said is your homework assignment make a Graphics application that tracks your index and thumb and draws a circle where they are I mean you would have spent year the next full year of your life trying to figure that out now we just have in the web browser on the internet it's running a machine learning model that makes a prediction about your hand and draws something in real time at like 60 frames per second like this is insane the world we live in and by the way foreign now here's an exercise for you can you make it so that it shows two of them could you make it so that I can throw one so many possibilities here so just to be clear this is using a hand pose model um and the Hand pose model uh gets all of these points for both hands look at that that's amazing um but that simple example shows you a little bit more easily I do it so this is coming soon um there's an example that shows how to do it with a single image um I think that's bomani's hand Bomani uh did a ton of work on the ml5 project for many for a number of years uh thank you to Bomani and more examples now um I can't remember if the post post detection is a new model I I don't have time to get into everything about this um okay so now what do I want to do okay so here's something else I gotta do I'm gonna hit Ctrl C here and I'm gonna say git fetch because my uh neural network examples that I was demonstrating to you as part of the nature of code are part of ml5 but they're in a different branch so I think if I type git branch come on isn't that going to fetch me all the branches do I have to say like verbose or something no anyway well let me look on the ml5 uh pull requests it's this pull request the neuro Evolution one that I'm working on that's the branch name okay I don't know why get fetched didn't bring all the brands in somebody can probably tell me but it switched me to the neuro Evolution branch and I can pull down all of the code for that uh maybe because I already fetched it was up to date I have no idea but now I'm going to run yarn start again I'm rebuilding the library but from the branch and what is the branch well my GitHub video series actually does go through that but it's essentially my like parallel track version of the library that I'm working on and when I'm finished it's happening it's a branch because it's like here's the ml5 project and it's going that way and I'm going to Branch off for a little while to work on my own neural Evolution examples and when I'm done I'm going to merge that Branch back in into the ml5 project but now we should see yes we should see more neuroevolution examples like the neural Evolution steering example and let's just run this one for a little bit what you'll see here is the um a neural network is learning to calculate a steering Force to follow this dot that's moving with a purlin noise random walk so this slider just speeds up time so that I can run through many many many generations you know I've done 22 Generations now if I slow it back down you know you can see that the most of the agents are much better at following the dot now one of the things you might be wondering here is like about it looks like they're kind of doing a bad job and to some extent they are um you know it might get better over time I'm sure I could tweak different properties and parameters to improve it but my goal with these examples is not actually to have these agents do a perfect job of following this dot I want them to appear lifelike and have this sort of like improvisational sort of quality to how they move and feel really alive so um so that's uh that's kind of the goal of these examples and you'll see here the neuro Evolution steering example during the um which sensors example which is the one that I was going over um this has some more uh it's a little bit further along than nature of code one has a restart button um so if it runs out you can restart let's see if we can let's see if we can get some good ones going we can get lucky yeah so this one by the way you'll see doesn't have Generations because in this one so one of the things that I mean this again merits a longer discussion and I'm running out of time here what two minutes left uh but I'll probably run a little bit over as I always do um in all of my other evolutionary examples the entire population lives for a fixed period of time and then I start over a new what this one is doing is ah welcome toothless XD you have successfully interrupted Vicky Mid thought midstream talking about this coding example and join the coding welcome aboard thank you support the farm goes on oh great thank you uh thank you gray DHD um um thank you for the really kind comments that is very sweet um and I really appreciate the support um okay so uh what's Happening Here is these agents die out slowly over time unless they're able to eat the food if they eat the food it boosts their health back up which you can see based on their size so as they die they fade out and get smaller and so um and then every moment in time there's a chance they have to reproduce now I could do something where as they come into contact with each other they reproduce and make a little baby creature and oh that should be the exercise and they could even like sense each other and that that could be part of their what they have to learn to do both eat the food and and bait but that's not what's happening right now they just they're just like a probability factor a very low probability that they'll clone themselves with some mutations and one of the things that I'm really trying to do with this is figure out um how to find strike a balance so I'm going to hit restart I hate just I'm gonna hit restart and you know the amount of food is fixed whenever they finish and and here they die out so in a lot of cases like they just don't randomly mutate their neurons and find enough food and they all die out but after I run this a few times you know I will often find that one or two of them start to really do well at finding the food and then reproduce themselves a bunch of times and then we get the situation of overpopulation but at some point there's a limited amount of food so that overpopulation should balance itself out so that's one of the things I'm really interested in it's not something that I've captured perfectly and Jason Stevens I have to reply to your email I was thrilled to receive your email Jason Stevens well the ITP alums are showing out in full force today Jason Stevens also a former student in an earlier incarnation of nature of code a wonderful artist in his own right please check out their work and uh thanks so it's actually I'm sorry I haven't replied your email I'm I'm not good at that but I am I'm good at but but I I it was really cool to I read the whole thing I just didn't I should just replies that I read the whole thing it's so cool I'll say more later um but I'm doing it now um okay but you can see how the population has exploded um and it's kind of running pretty slow but it won't explode much more than this because at a certain point there's a limited amount of resources what I was saying is I want you the viewer of this channel the person learning to you know if you if you feel so inclined read the entire nature of code books you don't have to you read the parts of it that you're interested in whatever I want you to try to make your own version of this and think about how to you know basically code the universe into this you know uh so what can you do to expand beyond what I'm doing here I would love that that makes me that would I'd be so excited to see that okay all right ml5 that's all I got to say about elma5 stay tuned for more about that all right let me run through some quick things in the fall I will be teaching at NYU ITP uh programming from A to Z uh let's see that is the class I am teaching if you want to follow along a bit there should be a new if it's not I haven't done any work on this at all um other than post it uh there should be this is so unnecessary for me to show I should have just mentioned this anyway there's there's a syllabus that I'm working on for this class one of the main things about this class there is another new member there's another new member I think that just joined that I missed the Little Dot a little Little Dot Thank you new member with a little dot I'll look and figure out who that is later it's yes a course about programming with text not a beginner course um I should maybe that was a bad name for it but um Discord bot examples are going to get updated and if I can get my act together this fall I will be recording new Discord bot tutorials so stay tuned for that the Oregon Trail project let's see if I can get this to come up I spelled Oregon wrong sorry for that GitHub it's on GitHub oh there it is it probably was the first one I just um this is a project I still really want to do uh and I noticed that there was a pull request oh wait is there another repo for this because I got some pull request notifications very recently and I don't see them here did they get merged two days ago oh it was closed I don't know I'm confused but I saw some oh maybe this was an issue that was open yeah this was anyway I still want to work on this I haven't had any time to get back to it I don't know when I will uh if anybody wants to help maintain this repo and push it Forward uh file an issue and and raise your hand but uh I don't imagine that that interests anybody as much as it does me okay so I wanted to mention that come back to processing okay uh so I don't know how to give you a sneak peek of this hold on I will I'm gonna give you a sneak peek let me just go back to here I'm going back into my Discord generate dot Collective generate.collective thank you you have climbed aboard the coding train and you will be receiving you will be seeing where did I share this I shared it in the oh I showed it in the main Discord okay hold on where's sorry I'm trying to get to my Discord uh oh Jack I see your message in Discord let's try to figure out a way to get you the book um Jack is writing that in Iran there's no way to buy the book there's no access to global payment and shipping uh let's sidebar when I'm done with the book sidebar is that a word my brain's melted let's wait till I'm done with the book but then get in touch with me I will I would love to send you one myself if I can if it comes to that let's see if we can figure that out uh no one should be locked out of the nature of code if they want so uh if you're not in the Discord this is what you're missing me uh so this is a screenshot of the video series that is coming out uh it's about five hours of material there's the table of contents it is a celebration of the new processing four that um I know that Ben fry and Sam pottinger and lots of other people Rafael De Corville have put in a lot of time and effort um two um and so I wanted to when that all that work has been happening over the last year I'm way behind I wanted to have this out when processing four was released clearly that didn't happen but this new set of tutorials so if you're a teacher of beginners um who uh is using processing for your curriculum or in any context this will be this will replace what is currently um on sorry hold on uh on YouTube here so these are the video the versions of I basically made new versions of all these videos that I made like over 10 years ago as you can see by the change in hair color but otherwise I'm kind of the same maybe in 10 years can we do another one of these or I'm like over here I'm sure someone could use some generative AI to age me and just keep making that then you can go back backwards Benjamin Button style okay um so I wanted to mention that's coming out ah but that will be just so you know my plan is Go nebula.tv slash coding train my plan is to first publish those videos on the nebula streaming platform so um there's a few reasons for that one is it's a good way for me to promote nebula and generate some revenue for the channel by having people sign up for nebula as part of the launch of that new series also when I upload something to YouTube I can't ever make any changes so nebula is a platform that I am part of the Creator the Creator community that owns and operates uh nebula and uh I don't I'm not gonna redo the video in any significant way but if you know it's five hours of material I think they're going to be small mistakes and things in it so if I upload it to nebula and people are watching and learning from there and I find little mistakes and things I can correct those and replace the video file on negla so I want to have like a few weeks to be able to do that and then upload it to YouTube now nebula is a paywall um you won't be able to see so you could sign up now if you want but I'll be promoting this when the video is ready um I also by the way have some exclusive content like this other course about coding with the Apple II and you know there's so much wonderful other stuff on nebula so um but uh what was I gonna say uh if you are a teacher and you want to be able to use this video series with your students this fall uh and you know it's not there's no way for you to like have your students like buy you know I'm not asking to tell your students to buy nebula that would be uh that wouldn't be appropriate I don't think so um get in touch with me maybe help at thecodingtrain.com because I'm also happy to allow preview access of the video series to uh students in different contexts but but you know it won't be that long the whole thing's going to be on YouTube and available uh for free okay um so that's that's what I wanted to say about that um so I'm gonna hit I'm gonna check that off ah let me mention something um just because I was on a podcast recently so I'd like to plug it let me see uh post show Recaps dot com slash strike I think well that's just the RSS feed so this is the RSS feed that's really helpful uh let's just go to postshowrecaps.com um so post your Recaps is a um podcast network of uh uh podcast about television and different things and they cover all sorts of different shows I'm just like a fan and a listener and you probably you may remember me from the podcast about Severance but I was a guest on it a couple times that I made all these different uh projects related to the Apple TV Plus show uh Severance but they are also doing a podcast series about let's see uh the current writers strike well the entertainment uh strike stag after a strike the WJ strike I'm just looking for a page that has called strike up strike up something strike up the podcast break up the conversation there it is so there's a feed for strike up the conversation which is poached showrecaps.com strike but um I was the guest and I guess if I keep going down through this you'll see on we talked about sort of generative AI with the host Dr Amanda who is doing an incredible job so I'm plugging this because I was on it but not really for you to listen to the episode with me uh I don't know if I said anything that useful or interesting about AI mostly because I because I was when I was asked to be on the podcast I started listening to the previous episodes and they're really incredible and interesting with great guests uh Michael chernus is one that I'll highlight let's see if I can find it um who is a an actor who is in I think uh SpiderMan movies and this and Severance and really talked about the rate it must be a way for me to filter this by only I think a terrible job um so but you can also go to uh twitter.com does twitter.com still work uh Dr Amanda R I think um is Dr Amanda's social media where um you will find Oh weird Twitter does this thing if you're not logged in it doesn't show you their actual tweets it's showing me other stuff anyway okay just really ruined I mean not that Twitter was that great to begin with to be perfectly honest it had a lot of problems but it's a lot worse now anyway so if you listen to that let me know I'd be curious to hear I I said how I did I can't listen I watch my videos back sometimes because I have to but a podcast stuff I can't listen back to I don't know why okay so I wanted to make that and then future plans so let's finish today first of all questions don't forget the time yes 12 15. it's okay I'm barely let me just check my phone make sure there's no like you know the kitchen is on fire kind of messages I mean I think I would have heard about that through other ways time to revive the Mastodon server yeah um so boy I'm tired so let's talk about future plans I have this running list that uh dipomsem started uh at least it's still 2023 Simon likes I don't know if Simon's still watching but Simon likes to point out how I make these lists and never follow up on them but we're gonna check some things off so I did get to these challenges I gotta do this is next on my list I'm hoping to get to this um let's do this I am doing a live stream more nature of code uh okay I can't check this off yet but this still get a check once it's published it'll get a check uh I made a new video about the coding Train website I want to work on the software for the severance TV show it's called MDR macro data refinement uh uh in the Oregon Trail that's it I'm only checking off one more thing almost checking this off so this is my running list is there anything else I want to add to this so what's what do I need to do next so first of all there won't be another live stream until at least kind of two weeks from now I have a very busy first next week is the first is orientation NYU then I have the first week of teaching so the next two weeks uh are completely packed for me so I wanted to make sure I'm really progress the last minute here today was really like the last day I could do a live stream before I start the fall semester so that's why I'm here today over the next two weeks before I do a next live stream I want to finish the nature keep working finish the nature code book and finish and hopefully have at least released on nebula the learning processing series those are the two priorities for me right now then I want to get back to this and I guess I should star some things because let's start what I want to do next so Discord bot tutorials I've got to start because I really want to do those next any P5 yes tutorials I want to do next because I'm teaching intro to P5 this fall and the processing intro series will be done I guess I could put a star there because I need to work on those nature of code book I could put ml5 there but I can only star so many things and then I want to make sure I'm continuing to do coding challenges so Wolfram Elementary CA and I think what I'm doing now just so you know is I'm I'm not doing the cutting challenges during my live streams but I do broadcast the recording sessions for them so that's one reason why you might want to sign up for any of the membership things um uh I will be posting about those in Discord okay I think that's it starting those things updating the gist uh that's it I have this song that I used forever as my like outro song um so uh I'm gonna let that play for about two minutes if you have questions post them in the chat or comments post them P5 geometry I know what that refers to uh but it's probably something that I want to take a look at so we can add that to the Future that future goals for sure um so yeah sorry I've run out of steam here I've been doing this for 14 623 seconds this is my wow I really can't operate my favorite time it's launched time since my first live stream back after turning 50 slash first live stream where I talk about the draft miniature code um we need you in Python maybe someday I mean it would be fun to do like a series like maybe I could just do this as a live stream of like kind of like uh nonpython I mean this would be like a good click bait sort of thing like JavaScript programmer learns python or something like that I could do that as a oneoff I like that idea foreign thanks everybody for tuning in this is I really feel glad I mean one thing that's looking at my analytics like people still watch the coding screen no I haven't published anything new I think since at least May can't remember when maybe the website video came out after then let's look still a minute left on my summer oh I forgot YouTube changed something oh no there's no.com oh by the way logo Rebrand for the coding train there it is we'll stuck that in there you'll see it's here too little little catchphrase traveling with a world of code artisanal handcrafted code that's my new country oh yeah I gotta talk to Jason about that okay uh but if you have ideas for a catchphrase or thoughts about this logo let me know um last thing or two months ago so you can see the uh the last video was two months ago before that was four months ago the last live was three months ago there's very little stuff if you look at my Analytics I'm it's like less than half of what it usually is it's going way way way way way down so I really uh it goes to show that you really need to keep fresh and new content online but people are still watching um the videos so I'm pleased here with that okay if you ever want to post a video about more um so I saw on my song ran out but I'm gonna look Boutique code if you will um geometry coding challenges open Frameworks Arduino gaming okay so the bunch of there's a bunch of questions I'll answer um Arduino open Frameworks all things I would love to do on the channel I just I have this list of things to get to I don't know how to prioritize or whatever but absolutely those are things I would love to do probably not going to happen soon because I just other things I want to get to um do you ever want to post a video about more advanced stuff Ray tracing sounds is a different yeah so I would like to do in the if you look at my coding challenges there is a fairly wide variety of things some of which are quite uh quick and easy well I'm looking at some more sophisticated like the prime spiral I would sort of maybe categorize as fairly beginner friendly it's you know very little code uh just to look at calculating prime numbers and draw this spiral pattern with them a note where they appear on the number line in a spiral whereas the wave function collapse algorithm is very sophisticated and involved in this video it's close to an hour long uh the Mandel bulb is quite uh elaborate sophisticated threedimensional fractal this video is you know pretty long so I like to do a balance um so it would be great and thank you Bruno for your nice comments 666 sorry you missed the start as soon as I hit stop this will be available in the archive so I'm gonna go uh thanks everyone for tuning in I'm just checking the Discord chat thanks Alka thanks everybody for watching thank you to all of you the new people who joined the membership today those of you who just watched if you share things from the coding train on social media if you contribute to the passenger showcase if you read the nature of code all those things uh support the work that I'm doing and I really really appreciate it so you won't see me for at least another two weeks this is what I was going to mention the days my teaching schedule is Wednesday Thursday Friday Tuesday I probably need to be doing a lot of prep so this fall Monday is probably my coding Train Day or a weekend live stream but I think Monday is going to be better so I hope to do either every week what I would like to do is every week you know assuming the nature of code book is done so that really has to happen first so there might not be anything to lock first because that's my deadline for that but as soon as the nature of code book is done I would like to spend every Monday either live streaming or recording more video tutorials like Discord bot or coding challenges so hold me to that friends in the Discord and um hold me to also the fact that the member sticker mailing should go out end of September early October those are things that I am really hoping to do and ask me about those remind me about those but be aware that I am still I didn't allow myself to live stream until I had a full draft in the nature of code book which I now have I think I probably shouldn't allow myself to live stream until I have turned in the finished shaft to the publisher and the deadline for that is October 1st okay goodbye everybody uh hope to see you again soon on social media Discord YouTube all the places the streets of New York City the Wilderness of the Hudson Valley I don't have any travel plans anytime otherwise so those are the places I'll be uh goodbye and goodbye as always I always forget that this dot this stock I don't have a new out animation never forget this stuff I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this start this Dot Song never forget the this Dot somebody could post that song for me I'm gonna say once again Here We Go sing it with me thank you autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me coordinates importance unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it again kittens I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of ease what else is there unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes that was invalid syntax I forgot uh there was one other thing here that I think is important that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and duskadonia
