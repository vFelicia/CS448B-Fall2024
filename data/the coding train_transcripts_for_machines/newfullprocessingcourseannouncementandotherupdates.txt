thank you foreign foreign thank you foreign foreign let's do it foreign still checking my audio here I'm gonna try one more thing and I'm just going to leave it as is okay here we go hi I'm still here the train is departing I'm not ready I'm gonna switch the camera to being on me though uh what was loud um who is in the chat let's see uh oh boy uh let's see okay okay okay hi everybody oh this was a mistake My Life currently hi hi by the way I'm Dan uh you're watching a live stream of the coding train you're watching a completely unhinged unready person on the internet who just happened to turn on this whole streaming setup but is not at all uh ready the train whistle was loud I don't know what you were even hearing where did that come from so I don't something is wrong with the audio setup I let's just let's just set the stage for a second why am I here I don't know why you're here to be perfectly honest as my phone is beeping now turn that off um you should probably turn this off right now because I really wanted to live stream because I wanted to make sure I got a live stream in before the end of September and this was the last day that I could possibly do it and I was busy with all sorts of things all day today and I didn't get into this room until about 10 minutes ago and I'm completely not ready from a technical setup standpoint from a mental and emotional standpoint but I'm here nonetheless um the main thing here and I'm glad that Daniel teffra is saying that I'm excited for the stream and that hexagon has a curiosity I've got at least I've got this extra laptop here with me with some different new stickers on it that uh I can watch the Youtube chat uh go by here so thanks for bearing with me um I've got a short list of things I want to cover you'll you might notice that the title of this stream was just choo choo because I have no idea what it's supposed to happen during it but um if you could just give me a minute here to get organized uh I think everything's going to be okay so I have a question uh in terms of the audio and uh hello from Norway I was about to go to bed but I guess it will wait no no go to bed go to bed sleep sleep is important and the recording of This will be in the morning what are you really missing I mean yeah you you do you decide but you know just just if you want my advice sleep is good um question is my audio good enough do you hear a very substantial Echo I'm wondering I'm streaming from a cathedral audio is five by five I don't know what that audio is good so um so all right so I think it's fine I so in this room where I am it's a pretty open space in a garage and I have all these sound blankets I never sound treated this room but I have these like sound blankets that I was hanging for a while to try to keep the echo down and then I started using this piece of software called uh Nvidia broadcast which has like in real time uh remove the echo from it uh and it doesn't seem to be working right now but everybody's saying the audio is fine some of an echo okay slight Echo slightly muffled it's definitely this microphone I'm tapping on it we're just gonna go with what it is I don't understand there was a different time on my life and I know I said this probably the last time I live streamed more I was able to manage all the different kinds of things that I'm working on in uh in a healthy and productive way now is not that time uh uh uh and um I I can't seem to get it together and I think a lot of the reason is because I have been working on and you have to bear with me for a second I'm just downloading some stuff here that I want to show you I have been working on a couple projects I just noticed I haven't been in this room because I haven't been live streaming or recording videos and the spiders have spun webs that are now around me that's so sad uh hold on I'm downloading some things that I want to hopefully show you um let's see if I got them um I have been working on a couple big projects one is actually complete and the other is on its way to being complete so I feel like I need to get those projects behind me and then I can return maybe back to more of the rhythm again of small coding Challenge videos and other tutorials I don't know I haven't been able to keep up but I thank you I I wanted to live stream because I need to talk about these projects that I'm working on check in with you folks and say hello to the YouTube community and that kind of stuff so um when my hand covered the mic the echo went with it ah Keith signed up as a lifetime nebula member well thank you for that support that's actually the first item on my agenda so let's talk about something that is coming out now that is out right now that you can watch on the stream platform called nebula but we'll be coming out in a week so let's see if these downloaded uh uh let's see if this works all right I'm gonna go over to here and oh my God he's gonna eat me uh this is a little teaser of a project I've been working on let's see uh now let's just see if the audio goes through so I'm going to mute my microphone the audio does not go through so here in real time let's I use this piece of software called loopback uh which this should do it if I turn that on I believe now to learn program yes okay here's a great thing that's going to happen right now because I'm a complete mess and disorganized I'm going to play you a little teaser video about my next YouTube video that's coming out that is over five hours long and I'm gonna talk about how you can watch it today right now if you want or you can wait till October 1st when we'll be on YouTube let's see all right so I need to get rid of myself although it'll be funny for me to uh so let's see I think if I uh get rid of myself over here I have a button for that don't I uh should say laptop here there I did it okay oh you can still hear me uh I saw this big like red thing happen hold on all right everything seems fine okay so let's see let's see if I can make this happen this is a disaster wait I don't want to be playing picture in picture what is going on okay full screen view I can't use a computer here we go you have no idea what it means to program have you ever wanted to learn programming do you have no idea what it means to program do you want to break free from the bonds of the tools that other people have made for you and learn to build your own software to make things with code one way that you can learn how to program not the only way not the only way you can or should but it's my favorite way and that's with something called processing I've divided it into different chapters organized with a table of contents it's a bunch of lessons all sequenced teaching you the fundamentals of computer science and programming with processing and at the end everything culminates with the mini project that I'll show you how to build that synthesizes all of the concepts from the series I can't wait to see what you learn what you make and what you think of this series um this is all going wrong okay okay let's try it let's so all right so what was that was a little teaser video about my new processing course so one of the things that I have always done for many years is uh teach beginners how to code so I've done that in all sorts of contexts um and I have a lot of video tutorials on this channel that start from no experience and hopefully build up so the original first videos I made and I'm going to show you some clips of them in from um that I made them I think in like 2012 or with a piece of software called processing and I have redone them all and let me show you a little clip about uh showing you a little difference between then and now wish I planned this better okay uh here let's see let's see if this works so I really was just asking myself the question should I remake those videos the quality wasn't so great although I did look much younger over 10 years ago but enough time has passed a lot has changed in the landscape of tools for learning to code processing most recently came out with version 4 which has many new and exciting features so I figure why not let's just do it all again okay so um you can see this is basically these are oh don't don't I don't want to hear the volume the the I want to scrub through this now just so I can talk about it let's turn the sound off so I can't believe this this is nuts this is me and I I don't actually know the exact date of this I'm pretty sure it was around 2012 drawing our Cartesian plane and explaining the x and y axis and how to draw shapes in a canvas in processing and now here I am doing it again and so I'm hoping that this new version of these tutorials I've learned a lot in the years since um it's a bit more streamlined it has a whole set of new examples and you might be wondering how can you watch it now how can you support this work that I'm doing um and I don't know if anybody who's actually watching this live stream happens to be a beginner or haven't learned to code before doesn't know what processing is is the actual target audience of this thing that I've made unlikely I would say but you might be people who know somebody who might want to learn to code that you might be able to recommend it to so let me talk about how you're going to find out more about this right now yeah okay I've got to go to a web browser here computer is not at all set up for this uh and let me make this chat window a little bit bigger so I can see I don't know if anybody is in the members Discord chat well I got it I got it I got it Chrome I understand what's going on here so let's go to uh github.com codingtrain um and let's take a look to see if we can find what I'm looking for uh all right so let's look for oh I should pin this one but I'm just going to go to it here so this is the GitHub repo for the creative coding processing full course and I have to give a big shout out to Melissa Rodriguez who did I call her uh producer researcher organizer reminder amazing amazing person uh creative coding uh artist who helped me organize and create a lot of these code examples and a lot of the materials that are in the course itself you can see the outline uh here in this page of the full thing with some time codes so uh there's a there's a introduction that I start with where I talk a bit about my history and the history of processing and you can see all the various things that I'm showing are all linked here on this page as well um then the uh video opens with teaching about how to learn to draw with code and the various reference Pages the different examples I'm going to run through a bunch of these right now I look at program flow I look at variables conditionals Loops arrays functions classes and objects at the four hour mark and then at the end I essentially do a little mini coding challenge at the end to build this confetti project a little bit of a conclusion with other resources and references for things that you might go further and node head in the chat appropriately says ew Java and I say Java I actually I I I don't know how strange this is but I do really enjoy the Java programming language um one of the one of the things about processing though is even with all the quirks and difficulties of the Java programming language itself processing is this wonderful environment and ecosystem that hides obscures a lot of the painful parts of java and allows you really to creatively make stuff with code so I'm gonna I'm gonna pull up a bunch of these examples but um what I'll mention here right now is uh so one hey this is coming it will be out on October 1st on the channel the YouTube channel it um but and you can see here's Melissa who's uh just a shout out Melissa who did all this work um but uh one of the ways that I am funding this project and this work is through um uh releasing it early on nebula so there uh last time I did a live stream I talked about different ways that people can support the coding train through YouTube memberships and GitHub sponsorship and that and the like but um uh currently I am part of this wonderful streaming service called nebula if you go to go.nebula.tv codingtrain um this uh oh look and my new header image which is something I'm going to talk about here the new logo um this is a uh this is the link that you want to look for um and the video is currently on the processing course is currently on nebula right now uh if you click here you're gonna it's gonna take me to what the different options are so this is a little bit of an odd thing this is a special promotion only for September so you can actually buy a lifetime membership to nebula you might be wondering like what the heck what so a couple people left this comment for me which was oh I don't want another service I have to subscribe to I just want to buy the class well guess what essentially this is your way of buying the class uh I mean you can also watch it for free when it comes out on YouTube but um what um this is uh this is this is a onetime only payment you never have to think about the subscription service again you just have it forever one of the reasons why I really love nebula is because it is a incredibly incredible curated collection of YouTubers that I regularly watch and a lot of them have exclusive and original content that is on nebula itself let me see if I can pull up the um some of the originals here so if I go to nebula.tv just go to here and if I go to videos ah yes so and then I go to Originals let's take a look so this is what I'm most impressed with about nebula um these original projects um for example I mean video SAS like Lindsay Ellis or on you on our nebula I'm trying to look there was this project called the prince that was amazing oh I love these uh City beautiful videos are really fantastic so if you like eposvox has an original I really would like to make one of these I don't know what it should be I'm open to your ideas but um there are also uh these wonderful classes that are on nebula that are exclusive to the platform we can kind of like scroll through oh turn data into stories I need to watch that one I have one of these I don't think I'll pop out up here if you're interested in music in all sorts of other kinds of topics especially about video production and animation there's a lot of really great stuff on here uh Patrick Williams I'm a big fan of has a wonderful course how to make a movie I need to wear a beret more in mind so anyway so nebula is this great platform um the uh the you can read about I would suggest you read this post from the CEO about uh lifetime memberships um the sort of reason for this program it is a way for the platform to increase the budget of nebula originals and it is also so um by the way you know it's all explicitly outlined here about onethird of the money goes to the Creator whose code you used um and more about um the the originals and different things that the streaming platform is trying to work on improving so all of that is to say that uh if you are interested in supporting the coding train if you want to watch my new course right now before it comes to YouTube you can go to this URL I pin I I don't think I pinned it but go.net I'll pin it in the chat go.nebula.tv codingtrain you can sign up for a monthly subscription an annual subscription or a lifetime one to be clear the lifetime subscription is not your best value right if you're looking for the best value that would be just buying an annual subscription and of course a monthly one is a nice thing to do if you just want to sort of try it for a month and see but the lifetime subscription is the best way to support the nebula platform and independent create outside of you know the ad supported model that is YouTube and me in particular so anyway I didn't mean to belabor that so much that's kind of one of the main reasons I'm doing a live stream today I'm starting to make turn this into what is essentially an ad but I've worked well I I think I started this new processing course uh in January of 2023 so I think I'm about eight months it took me about eight months to finish it in terms of all the recording compiling all the examples all the postproduction so I'm very excited for it to finally be on YouTube and see how uh what new audience might find it what people might create through code with it um but I wanted to make sure I took the time to tell the core audience here in the live stream about how it is available right now on nebula and how you can sign up today and go and watch it great if you have questions about that I'm happy to take them into the chat I think I will move from uh focusing on the this to show you a little bit more about what's in the course all right so couple things that let's let's take a look at so one is let's download uh let's clone this repo let's see here again I have no idea I haven't like used this computer anytime recently it's like remind me later for all these updates let's just clone this to the desktop um if you're if you're a new uh to get and GitHub and all these things I might suggest just if you want to try out all these examples just downloading the zip file uh uh and but I'm gonna do it this way and now I can uh find the folder hopefully on my desktop and go here whoops that's not the right place I want to go to I'm going to go here okay so this by the way for if and when you decide you want to watch the course and code along with it every there there's essentially 10 chapters I wish I had my learning processing book but just to tell you just to complete the full story about this I have this book whoa 9.99 look at that what a deal um so uh it the second edition which is uh published by elsevier I'm sure you could find this on wherever books are sold um but this is a book that the second edition came out in 2015 I believe the first edition was I want to say like 2008 so that's the first time I ever tried to tell the full story of learning the code with processing was through this book I did an updated version of it in 2015. I don't I never I don't think it makes sense right now to do another updated version of the print book but the video course the five hour video course is essentially this or at least maybe most of the book itself um so I'm mostly moving towards producing my educational content through video right now than writing although my other project I'm going to talk about nature of code is not that so that's kind of where a lot of this stems from so and you can essentially this outline with all these examples are the newest version of those learn to code examples with processing that I've made let's open up some of them to take a look so I don't know what what interests people uh Barney codes is in the chat everybody should check out Barney's YouTube channel 30 minute course on shaders yeah can't imagine how long it took a five hour course yeah well the funny thing is the original videos I made were just recorded extemporaneously like I just turned on the recording and talked and made some examples and hit stop and then uploaded them they took me the amount of time it took me to make the original videos was the amount of time it takes you to watch them I mean I'm not factoring in the mental preparation in years of learning this stuff before I just turned on the recording but this for better or worse this five hour course has is more somewhat more thoughtfully made it's still kind of me just talking but it's edited so it moves a bit faster there's uh some postproduction so additional examples and reference materials are just kind of shown next to me that I didn't have at the moment of recording so I'd be curious I don't know how to a B test this properly but have somebody watch the original ones have somebody watch the new ones what's their experience uh which one's better which one's worse okay um so let's just look I don't know let's look at some of these examples here let's see what's in there let's look at drawing and let's look at a spaceship color I don't know what this one is whoa that is some big oh that's just because I zoomed in so you can see by the way one of the things is I just noticed I remembered I should probably take these out a lot of the examples will have this line of code that says pixel density 2 in it that is a way of rendering what is essentially double quadruple it's four pixels for every one because it's a anyway for like high for high density displays like a Mac retina or other high density uh uh displays the actual pixel dimensions versus the number of pixels that are being shoved into your eyes it's different and I for capturing them I wanted to have the extra density of pixels the extra resolution but for right now that actually shouldn't be in there let's take a look at this spaceship so yes there it is if you want to learn to make spaceships like this that is though that's where the course starts in terms of drawing stuff with code moving along um it moves from there to looking at animation animation oh you know what I just realized I think I don't know if this is true no this can't be true is it true that it's the extra examples that are in here but the actual examples are not I have to double check to make sure I have all the materials here so but you can start you could see these are all these I'm just going to skip ahead and the and go to the end and look at the very last example that you learn if you want to learn like what brings everything together at the very very end of the video uh it is making amazing uh confetti explode with color and rotate and spin in beautiful ways I actually don't cover translate and rotate specifically in the course but that's a addon towards the end there but sort of building up to this idea of objectoriented programming and how to create a system out of code so that's the full course I encourage you to take a look at the examples I'm going to double check to make sure everything is there and check out the GitHub repo which has all of the information if you want to watch it now you can um find the link here to nebula now uh one thing that I do want to say is also in addition I have at the moment this um Reddit post so if you want to add you could obviously join the coding trade Discord um but if you want to uh chat or ask questions um this Reddit thread uh as part of the um nebulous subreddit is where you can do that I would encourage you to come and say hello in there because it's another place to say hello I'm following this very closely because oh I forgot why the most important thing this is here's an important reason why I need some people to watch the thing on nebula so one of the wonderful things about the nebula platform being owned and operated essentially by a collect a group of creators is they have a lot of agency in terms of the platform and if there's a mistake in a video I can correct it and reupload the file but that is not something that I can easily do on YouTube well it's not something you can do it all on YouTube so one of the reasons also for having this prerelease on the nebula platform is that I could get a little feedback if there are any mistakes or things that I want to tweak or fix before the final version comes out um I would love to hear so to be honest now I haven't gotten one single which correction which could mean that the whole thing is just perfect but I'm guessing um maybe people just don't know that they could tell me or that not that many people have seen it yet but I've got about a week left before I plan to release it on YouTube and that is kind of you know once once I have errors or things I need to fix they just will essentially go in the description so if you are interested and able to and end up watching this on nebula and you notice anything please reach out to me the Reddit post uh social media the coding train Discord all of those places you can go to speaking of which let me just make sure I'm just going to take a peek into the coding train Discord here to see if there are any important messages I am now monitoring the chat that has Simon in it the sound is found oh the train whistle's in the intro that's what's loud and uh yeah I'm monitoring the Discord chat now uh to uh to for the members who are there in that as well okay so let me see if I can keep that open and the YouTube chat um have both of them oh it's so hard to manage so many screens uh minimizing some things don't worry any minute now oh my God are you serious okay great okay this is good this is good I'm good now I'm good now all right what else ah one more thing about this let's go to thecodingtrain.com let's take a look at oh well actually let's go to the GitHub so this is the coding Train website if you haven't seen it before now you see it I'm gonna go over to uh the coding train GitHub I'm gonna and this is I'm gonna look at the pull requests and boy there's a lot of submissions here that I need to take a look at and merge um which maybe I could do some of that today but let's look at this one for a second let's see if the preview is still built great so when the video is on YouTube um here on this page you will also find it here so every um video well not everybody most of the videos that are on the channel have an Associated page on the codingtrain website with all of the relevant metadata for that video looking for a code example looking for a link to something I reference in the video it's all here did you make a project that you're excited about related to a video I made there's a passenger showcase a place for you to submit that I have talked about that many times on many streams I could again now and maybe I will but that's not why I'm here one of the things that I also that I have on the site are what's known as tracks a track is essentially a sequence course probably what I had typically Point people towards when they are first learning creative coding would be this track code programming with p5.js you'll notice it has track stops those are the individual videos um that some of these are really quite old for each of the different concepts that then have you know the code in them a description maybe a um a showcase project so this particular processing course this new track if I can get back to the tracks is different in that it is one single video it's not there yet doesn't exist on YouTube yet so this is very much of a placeholder the website was not designed with this in mind the website was designed with the idea of the courses being sequence tutorials and also for those of you who might be more familiar with my challenges uh this sort of collection of these independent specific project videos that you can go and watch and enjoy and create your own versions of whenever you might like to so at the moment thank you to um uh uh uh dipom sen who I know is probably sleeping right now because it is at the middle of the night in their time zone but created a sort of BandAid version of a track page for this single video which will just time code the various sections and um and include the metadata here so I haven't figured out the best way to organize that but um when if and when you watch this course and if you make something from watching it you will be able to submit it here to the passenger showcase so I wanted to highlight that I want to encourage anybody to plan to do that um yeah so var19 makes a sort of funny joke there in the chat saying ah yes uh did I pin this already oh I did pin it okay paid beta testing that's great oh wait the testers are the ones paying I know I know I know I know so here's the thing if you really feel like you want to watch it to see if I have any errors and it's not accessible to you because of the way I'm releasing it on nebula just come on to the coding train Discord say at schiffman tag me with this uh request I will think about a way to see if I can figure out a way for you to be able to help watch it and provide any feedback so I by no means am I hoping to lock people out of this process um just it's the way that I'm have set things up to go okay yes Oktoberfest as chat is reminding me all right so I think I have now said everything that I need to say about the new processing course that's come that's already out on nebula pinned chat message you want to watch it right now and we'll be out on YouTube soon enough uh soon so I think I've any other questions about that please uh say them in the chat and maybe I will see them or join the coding train Discord uh which you can just go to thecodingtrade.com Discord it'll take you right into it and you can tag me in there I've been a bit more active in some of the in in the channels there the last couple weeks trying to answer people's questions okay um I fear that I have a new mention already um so I will take a look at that after I finish with this live stream which by the way I'm not going to be here that long this was kind of just like a check in say hello and announce and update you on some projects all right what else do I need to talk about I made an agenda and I put it in the description of this video and nowhere right now do I have the description of this video available for me to look at so I'm gonna just remember things that I want to talk about and then you will look at it maybe and remind me in the chat um it's not about current theme but do you plan to release new coding challenges yes is yes yes yes and yes uh is processing just for learning um processing is not just for learning processing is an incredible platform that you can use for Learning and uh also build uh projects on from a variety of different you know for a variety of different contexts and scales uh and many uh artists use it many creative agencies use it many schools use it and you can also work with its sibling project p5.js which is a creative coding library for JavaScript which would allow you to run things like you might do in processing right in the browser um so in terms of the um uh thanks for the agenda Matthew nature of code updates Oktoberfest new logo great okay um I think I remembered all those things in terms of the challenges I've got to get back into the rhythm of doing them again and I have a list of things to get to I just it's like the walls are closing in on me these days with the various things that I'm working on and the very very busy teaching semester this semester so I'm struggling to find the time to dedicate to the coding train that I have in the past and that I want to but the coding challenge is not the coding challenges is a lifetime project that I hope to get more going with that I have yet to complete so stay tuned all right where should I go next let's talk about uh some quick okay so I'm going to write this list down I want to talk about nature of code where I am with that project I want to talk about hacktoberfest which is coming up and that relates to the showcases and maybe we'll look at some showcase projects and then I want to talk about the coding train logo and ways that you can make your own variations of it okay um I know anybody anybody out there feel like they want to hear about one of those topics first let's go check in on the nature of code um all right so speaking of projects that I've been working on for well over 10 years the nature of code book is one of them and I know that I'm about to repeat some things that I've done on previous live streams but I can really tell from this chat uh that there's a lot of new names here so let's let's let's let's recap in a sort of hopefully a succinct and efficient way if you knew nothing and just happened to search for nature of code this is probably where you would end up this is the website for the version of the book that was published to be using this year a lot in 2012. you could actually click and buy the print version please do not do that you could also uh click here uh you you know you could also slide these down to zero and click here to download uh bundle which includes PDF ePub and Kindle formats the Epub and Kindle formats if I'm being honest I didn't do such a great job with them they're kind of they're kind of so the PDF though I can stand behind but all of this is old and you shouldn't look at it I mean you can look at it I'm sorry there's there's there's something there that's still meaningful because it is a doc it is a thing that came out in the world in 2012 that's important to look back on and think about but if you are looking for the latest and most uptodate version of this the ideas that started in this particular book then this is not the place for you the place for you on some level is this and I'm going to at the moment actually just trigger a quick uh GitHub action where do I run this did the interface change or is it just because it's not there what's going on here where's the button for running the action oh I'm not signed in I'm like what's going on here it's because I'm not signed in okay sorry everybody oh speaking of being unprepared at least the password is kind of saved in there I'm gonna have to two factor in though give me a moment here Talk Amongst yourselves I am reading the comments while I can steal away a moment I don't really care that you're seeing this right now it will expire before you can hack into my account okay let's go to the actions this takes a little while so that's why I wanted to run this run workflow run workflow okay so this is the repo for the new version of the book now this is actually your um the the sorry the build system for the new version of the book the content of the book is actually in this repo but where the content is being worked on is not in this repo it's actually being worked on in a collection of notion documents and what I just did there very quickly was I ran this GitHub action which connects to the notion API by the way I'd really love to do a whole video it often likes to time out so let's try running it again this is going it's going remarkably well uh it is um it is an action that uses the notion API to go and collect all of the material that I've written reformat repackage it and bring it into this repo so that it can then be built and published to a website I wonder if there's actually uh it often times out but I wonder if there's something else going on no request a notion API failed with status 502 does anybody know what 502 is notion client maybe then is the API just down that's probably rerunning the job I'm gonna try it one more time this is something I will certainly look at later on my own time figure out why this isn't working so that process would bring in all of the written content to these HTML files it brings in all of the code examples to these uh other collections of JavaScript and HTML files and it also brings in all of these images which are all of these uh screenshots and various illustrations and things that are in notion and then all of that goes to if I go back here bad Gateway server error response serverwise get received an invalid response from the Upstream server so to look and see what that is that's what error 502 is someone's telling me in the chat to here uh this does this actually go somewhere it does now excellent okay so here is the most recent version of the book in progress why my desk is really quite high today um and my green screen is all a mess but whatever I'm just I'm doing my best here my best is quite inadequate these days on so many levels just trying all that I can do and uh so this is what you should look at now uh what's exciting about where I am with the project is all of the chapters have been drafted even if I go here into whoa this is a I have a formatting error that's fine though uh even if I go to this very last chapter it is now written the thing about it is there's a lot of placeholder stuff in here uh the illustrations aren't finished this is what they ask you to look for you can see there's some sort of like notes in there like what do you think about having uh what do you think about having a little illustration here so um just be aware this is an inprogress draft but you can read it now if you notice things that are wrong mistakes you can file them as issues in the GitHub repo and if you want to support this project there are a few things you can do one is you could go to this sponsor button right here and you can sponsor uh the coding terrain through uh you know GitHub sponsorship patreon uh YouTube membership and also here's the nebula link and then um you can also um preorder the physical book so I think right here if I click on this link um again the book will be Creative Commons licensed and available for free online but if you want to have the physical version um I'm I'm thrilled to be working with no starch press who will be work Printing and distributing all of that and you can preorder it right now can you do the Halloween stream that is such a good idea no flap um I would love to do a Halloween stream I don't know how or when to do that but um I mean I should do it on Halloween I'm never going to remember this right now so let's uh people in the Discord and on the internet on social media just bug me around midoctober actually why don't you wait can you wait till after like October 16th or 17th maybe after October 20th wait till after October 20th and start bugging me about doing a Halloween stream okay good we got it yes okay deal uh you love the costume that was so long ago I used to do such silly things like that every okay so Richard Gill asks everything in P5 and thank you Richard Gill for supporting through membership everything in uh nature of code is it p5.js so correct this version of the book like if I just go to chapter two for example and start scrolling through let's actually go to like chapter seven because it's uh maybe a little more interesting to see something a little further in um there's like a weird bug here where these images are cut off I don't know what's going on there so many things are going wrong today but if I scroll down to where I get to finally one of the examples here it is so when I get to one of the examples this is an example oh this is the next coding challenge I'm going to do too which is the Wolfram Elementary CA what you'll notice in the book I'm obviously writing and describing about the concepts and how I'm writing the code then there is an embedded example that I can reset I can pause reset Etc um got a code snippet here and then I can click right here and it will open a new window and now I've got that code example right here in the P5 web editor if I want to experiment with it so yes the reason why I'm using the main reason I'm using p5.js for this iteration of the book is to be able to have all of the examples easily Run online embedded inside the book it is my intention it is my plan and I love that Robert Richard are just saying hello to each other in the chat what a wonderful thing it is my plan to Port all of the examples to processing as well most of them already are so I will be uh you know I gotta finish a lot of the details I need to get done but the idea like the materials that would be part of the book's materials would include processing and p5.js version of the examples and then I do expect people will report them to a lot of other environments as well I have a GitHub a document that's actually keeping track of a list of ton of ports that people have done over the years of the earlier verses of the examples okay um so um so yeah so that's what's happening with nature of code book uh I welcome your uh participation and enthusiasm and encouragement for this project in any way that you can stay tuned the things that I have left to do before it's really done I need to write the introduction the acknowledgments I'm just doing this is more for me right now uh there's going to be an appendix about how to draw make creatures thank you to Zana marshes doing all the illustrations for this it's gonna be appendix a couple of appendix in the book that I need to finish uh in collaboration with her um there's a lot of illustrations that haven't been finished got to finish the cover or think about the cover some stuff for the interior a lot of things there's a long todo list uh I need to close all seven 75 of these issues so there's a lot of stuff uh that needs to be done but that's that's kind of where I am uh and and I would say this to me is the biggest roadblock right now to me really working on the coding train because this has to get done it's got a deadline I have commitments to it in terms of with the publisher and every free moment that I have that's not something that I am doing with my family or for my students at NYU usually that's where I would turn to the coding train and these days that's where I turn to the nature of code book so that's the way things are going right now um okay I talked about nature of code let's talk about hacktoberfest and maybe there's even something related to the coding trade logo that we could work into that so hacktoberfest what is it this is no uh let me let me take a look let's see there I I forget who runs it I think it's is it by GitHub itself is it okay so 10th year oh it's presented by digital ocean Ila and app right so I have no official um participation with uh I'm not I'm not a official representative of hacktoberfest uh I have no sponsorship relationship with them nothing like that I mention it because it's a nice initiative to bring people into open source and uh part of my mission with the code and train is to help people have a friendly place to be able to participate in open source as well um and so it's there's a nice alignment there and thank you Eric for your nice comments and I hope your second year of university is going well all right so what is hacktoberfest I don't actually know September is the perfect time to prepare for hectoberfest get a jump start by finding projects contribute to adding the Oktoberfest tag to your projects or familiar exercises yourself let's get okay so first of all step number one I don't have my bell which would be useful I do know where it is I'm walking over to get it right now I'm also going to bring bring my little time since clock by the way since my last live stream do you all want to know how many seconds have passed I know this is probably hard for you to see uh it has been 3 million 700 oh no no no oh no wait this is minutes hours I should know how this Clock Works anyway that's how much time has passed I love this project time since launch you should I I talked a lot about it my last live stream you can you can look that up okay I like to put it here so people can see it but then I have to raise the desk a little bit otherwise it doesn't show up and it's not going to show up anyway back here maybe focus focus shiftman okay get a jump start by finding projects to contribute to you found a project to contribute to the coding trade adding the hacktoberfest tag to your projects all right is that a thing I should do right am I supposed now I know there's some complicated discussion about this that we've had internally amongst the coding train team um Jennifer Nesbitt I do I do have a designer helping me on the cover but I'd love to hear from you about what ideas you might have and I'm open to um hearing more so please uh best way is to join the Discord you can send me a message there um uh all right so first of all I'm just curious which is a quick peek and see if I go back to the nature of code repo did that thing go just curious if that action completed no so I'll have to investigate why the actions aren't working later but back to hacktoberfest so let's say let's take a look let's so so let's look at the coding train uh repos let's start let's start by making a new well I I'm trying I have about a half an hour I'm trying to think of what I want to do but these are this is the kind of all right can I please finish the sentence apparently not okay oh let me just check ah oh oh I'm getting act uh start bugging you my mailing okay okay okay all right by the way there's a wonderful question that I forgot to address uh by interoctave all in the Discord member chat so first of all members any disc any members people who have signed up through YouTube membership or patreon or GitHub sponsorship the stickers have all come in I have a whole new batch of coding train stickers with the new logo and some new stickers and there's a glowinthedark sticker there's a holographic sticker the mailing for that is going to be going out beginning of October so stay tuned you you make sure you're in the Discord and you have the supporter role that way you'll get the message for how to get your stickers and if anybody's really interested in the stickers you know now's your time because I'm gonna be sending them out very soon once a year mailing it's our new thing okay now Oktoberfest oh the translation I want to address this because it's a wonderful question from interactive all I would very much like to have translations of the nature of code book I have to finish everything I have to do with it before that can start but I'm we're getting very close to there uh I don't remember what date I said to bothered me about a Halloween after October 20th that would be also a good time to bother me about the translations uh I got it I would think November 1st let's put it on November 1st start messaging me if you're interested in doing a translation in the nature of code book and um I what I will probably do is put you in touch with the publisher there's really two questions there uh one is can I get the website translated and have like a a a really easy system of doing that a night so that maybe you know in a fantasy world uh you know there might be a language button on this page here where I could just change it to for example Spanish and the website which only be in Spanish so that's a that's one aspect of this that is something that I have a lot of agency over in terms of translating for a print version of the book that will be something that um that no starch will uh the no search press will lead the process of and I know they're excited to do that so um in terms of partnering with translators and other Publishers and other countries um all of that I'm excited to work on but that will um that way so the stickers are not there's no really there is one place where you can buy some stickers for the coding train which is in the nebulous store I have a coding train page which has a sticker sheet there um but none of the new stickers are there the stickers are really something I send out as gifts for people who subscribe to some of the crowdfunding options for the site or I give to people in person when I go to an event or see them so if I happen to have them on the street with me on the street I can get I mean I often have stickers just my backpack so if I run into somebody else the hand of a sticker uh all right now so that was the that was about the translation oh did you see that my reflexes I still got it still got it okay uh all right now hacktoberfest so back to the coding train so any of these repos in my mind are fair game for Oktoberfest and they're all have varying degrees of being active actively being worked on versus an old thing that's just kind of languishing there and also you're you know in terms of documentation and request for actual help so if anybody sees a repo here that they want to ask about um let me know I've been doing some some new things I just started like for example um I you know this is brand new as of a few days ago I started like working with some experiments with the YouTube API um you can see some other things on here all everything's fair game as far as I'm concerned but I think probably the most important place for you to think about contributing would be here at the codenttrain.com website so uh hopefully there's a lot of wonderful people in the community who help to maintain the website um and you can and and maybe if we can uh do some work on this I'll try to add maybe some issues or some information as a guide somewhere to some suggested things you can work on but one of the nicest ways that you could if you're a total beginner to this world that you could do a pull request that's part of hacktoberfest would be by adding a project that you've made related to one of the videos that I've put out to the passenger showcase the passenger showcase as I may have mentioned is here this is part of the website where it's just essentially an infinite scroll of sorted by uh chronologically of projects people have contributed so number one this is a wonderful place for you to look for inspiration and see what other fellow Travelers in the coding train Community are making you can also do things like I noticed Kathy has made many many so uh oops that goes to how do I oh no I I thought we were gonna that's a feature we were going to add where you click on somebody's name and it takes you to all of their showcase projects but right now I can filter by somebody so if I filter by Kathy I can see all of Kathy's showpace projects on this page and essentially it is a you know portfolio page for any given if you want to have a little portfolio page of your peop your sketches and projects you could kind of use the coding trade website for that it's not really well suited for that there's other tools like open processing and all sorts of other you know build your own website things but on some level you can collect all of the things you've made related to coding trade videos onto one page so how do you do that the main way that people do that under the guides here you can find this passenger showcase guide so if I click on that um then here is a form so this forum allows you to first pick like oh what collection of videos did you just watch was it a coding challenge you never just watch it it's basically the way that the the system works is every project is associated with a video and I know it's sometimes tricky to figure out like does it make sense for this video or that video but you know we we just all use our best judgment and try to make it work the best we can so for example if you were watching a beginner's guide to machine learning you would find like oh here's all the videos here maybe I made a video that was used um you know object detection and so I'm gonna click on that and I'm gonna submit my project to there now most commonly people are making projects related to the coding challenges for example I think it's the 10 print I got 178 of them really slowed down uh the 10 print I don't know I don't know I think was it like 82 no that's a Chrome extension does anybody see it here and it doesn't matter I don't have to pick it here um I could just pick anything like double pendulum and then you can enter all your information so what this form does I'm getting the point here this form generates a pull request to the GitHub repository for the website however if you want to so if you want to get your project on the website this is your easiest path to doing it however if you want to participate in hacktoberfest you can actually do you can submit your project without this form through GitHub itself I want to show you a little bit about how to do that right now and that will then give you a hacktoberfest uh accepted pull request so let me see if I can walk you through a little bit about that right now so a couple things one is ah one is on this passenger showcase guide and this is a mental note to myself in the community we could probably improve this um you can also we have some instructions here for how to do that so the form will do this automatically but the manual way of creating the pull request for Oktoberfest is here below these instructions might need a little updating I'm not sure I'll have to take a look at that but let me show you a little bit about that right now and I'm just checking the uh checking the chat okay um all right so uh coming back to here so let's say the first thing so let's go let's pretend we're going to do 10 print and I'm looking at the time so I'm going to uh 10 print is I believe the coding challenge that has the most passenger showcase projects you can see them all here on this page that includes the video the code example other references an archive of the live stream where I actually originally did the challenge and things like that so you know if you're new to the coding train and you're wondering is there a lot of stuff I can go back and look at there's a lot there's a lot personally okay so if you wanted to submit to this of course you could use the form but if you're not using the form and you're participating in hacktoberfest what you would do is you need to find the video first so content is the place where all of the individual files directories for the videos and their Associated passenger showcases live so I'm going to click on content then I need to find ah then under videos is where I'm looking there's other in stuff here that's useful but videos is what we're looking for and here now is this becomes a little bit of detective work but it's pretty easy if you're doing a challenge so that the folder naming is a little wonky all the videos that are everywhere on the site but for the challenges it's not too hard I can just go here and I can see ah there is a directory for every single one so what was 10 print what number was 10 print 10 print was number 76. so back to here I'm going to go and find number 76 scrolling around I've got it and we can see here okay so what is here on GitHub first and foremost just so you are aware there is the JS this individual Json page this is the metadata for the videos and by the way one of the things about the system that I have built with I I barely did any of this work so I know that depong in particular has a ton of work on this this Json file there's a script that's part of the repo that will generate the YouTube description for it so this is all the metadata for this particular video and this is another thing you could contribute to for hacktoberfest some of them could might have typos uh in the time codes maybe the the they're missing a link it could be improved there's all sorts of things you could think about to improve and and I was gonna say punch up these pages to give them a bit more but what you're looking for is here showcase notice now here that there are all these files contribution number.json contributionnumber.png some of them have what like a much larger number some of them have a smaller number all you need to create to submit your project to the coding Train website is to add to this directory and most of the directors won't be this full and if you find a video that doesn't have any showcase projects you have to create the directory but most of them do at this point you need to add to this directory two files a Json file and a PNG let's just look at what these look like let's look at contribution 12. and your Json file just needs to have a few things in it needs to have a title of your project an author name a URL of the project and a time stamp for when it was submitted using this particular format and the coding train Discord the GitHub issues these are places where you can post and ask about to get help doing this if it's confusing cough is asking if I do a coding challenge but use Unity would it be valid Not only would it be valid that's what I'm hoping for the whole point of this is not about using the tools that I'm using and following the way that I do things but sharing the way that you do things and the tools that you use with the community the fact that the Showcase projects are linked to their videos is just a way of organizing them by theme and I don't have a great way for people like I made something I want to share it but I don't it's not associated with a video there's no place for that right now on the website but um but yes absolutely um okay so um so this is the format for the Json file by the way the author name can also have a URL so you can have a separate URL which is of your own social media or website in addition to just this URL we looked at other ones we might see that um and then uh oops which which one was that was that number 17 I don't even remember now which one 12 not 17. then if I look at contribution so you need a file called actually it doesn't even have to have the word contribution in it I don't remember somebody might know this in the chat uh the instructions are good for the challenges still okay yeah um so um I don't remember whether it actually has to be called contribution but it just needs to have a unique name uh with a number so the um the form uh has a I don't know if I forgot what it uses a time stamp or something for naming the file but if you create your own through a manual process for hacktoberfest you just need to say contribution some number that isn't already listed so and then you need to both name your Json file and the PNG the same name so now you can see this is the thumbnail image and if I were to go to the uh that page I've already lost it oh this is the deploy preview do I have the I'll just find it again 10 print go to this page you can see here that by the way this the order of the projects on this page is random and different every time I load it if you're wondering like well how do I get to be first refresh depending on the number of challenges eventually you'll be first so if I go through at some point we're going to see that one um I saw the name but it looks like a different thumbnail so yeah here it is so we can see this is the one we were looking at um and it shows up here and by the way if I were to click on it it's going to take me to the page for the actual project the wonderful uh I love these colors I love the ones and zeros what a wonderful job from hater Ali Punjabi so um so that's the process I'm not uh you know as you might uh be realizing I'm not and I would love to to find a different time to maybe do this if that would be helpful but if you've never used GitHub before I kind of told you about how it works and I showed you where some instructions are but you're going to have some trouble probably you're going to want you to ask questions so you could get help the places where you can get help is you can file an issue so you can type new issue title it I need help submitting my passenger showcase project write about what you need help with what your questions are and someone hopefully hopefully I or somebody else from the community will be able to answer your questions and help you out there the other place is the coding train Discord where there are help channels uh and lots of other people there who are available to answer questions and help you get your project into the passenger showcase so to summarize the easiest way to get your project into the passenger showcase is with this form if you want to participate in hacktoberfest you can follow these instructions for how to do it manually through a pull request but if you're new to all this that's not going to be the easiest thing in the world for you to do so raise your hand ask for help the coding train Community is here to help you figure that out I would like very much for it to be a welcoming and friendly place for you to make your first attempt at a pull request regardless of how many times you fail or how many mistakes you made that is the point um okay now what else do I want to say so I'm I'm closing in on the end of this live stream and I want to talk about something new which is and I'm going to minimize some things which is this so this is I can't remember if I how much I showed this the last time I was live streaming I think I did now that I think about it but anyway uh this is a new logo for the coding train um with this wonderful little uh ASCII art like illustration of a train it is made with simple shapes lines and circles um also a little a catchphrase traveling the wonderful world of code another idea for the catchphrases artisanal handcrafted code but um anyway this is what it had so far um and you can see that inside this scene in this wallpaper the reason why I'm bringing this up and one of the reasons for this new logo was to have something that could connect more directly with p5.js and processing and so for example if you go to the processing website you'll notice here this is the processing logo and if you click on open editor you'll see this is code to draw this particular logo and you can do things like you know change the color I could change a number actually and it's going to like change how it looks the design all of that so I am now going to go to the p5.js web editor and by the way the new stickers have the logo and all sorts of other stuff which is very exciting the other thing I'm doing with the stickers is a lot of the stickers the new stickers are just literal visualizations of some of the examples so there's like a whirly noise sticker like end body simulation sticker but let's see if I can log in here uh and do open and look for maybe logo copy copy I don't know why there's a copy copy in this one but let's let's try this and here it is okay so here is now the P5 sketch and by the way as much as I said artisanal handcrafted code the way I actually generated this is the design was made with uh I don't know whether Jason actually used illustrator or what tool he used but I have an SVG formatted file of the design and I used a large language model to convert that into uh the code with just drawing every line individually so it is a little bit ridiculous like probably the example for this doesn't need this level of precision for all the pixel values but this is my ask for you and I think this is a good place for us to for me to start a new repo that could also be part of hacktoberfest so let's think about this I would love for people to remix this logo maybe I should do like a video about it giving some ideas and some techniques or like demonstrating it but right now all I have is the literal a hardcoded values of the design but what would it mean for it to animate what would it mean for it to break apart come back together what kind of creative things make it sound responsive change the colors I would love to see what people who from the community could do remixing this logo and playing with it and I think there could be a lot of fun stuff and and I just want to say um Jeff Wagner who I know has been posting a ton of stuff in the chat uh thank you for all of your kind comments okay and gisha thanks for asking how I'm feeling honestly like I know I'm feeling good but I I'm I'm I feel like I'm really struggling to keep up with work and by work I mean teaching and the nature of code book and the YouTube channel and all these emails that I have to respond to so I feel very out of sorts and disorganized like my um they just I feel off and some of that might just be getting older can't do as much some of it might be just the last few years of everything that sort of changed in the world some of it might just be this fall semester is particularly busy but I think it's mostly just that I'm trying to really finish the nature of code book project so anyway but thanks for asking okay uh now um all right so what do I want to so I think maybe what I'm going to do this is a spur of the moment idea uh let's create very quickly a GitHub repo for this for the logo and I don't know what should actually go in it but let's give this a start okay so I'm going to call this I'm going to put it in coding drain what should I call it a coding train logo unfortunately there's another name like anyway I'll just call it that it's going to be public it's going to have a readme file it's going to be for lack of a different option right now that I MIT license I mean the design I would say is maybe Creative Commons noncommercial but I'm not going to worry about that right now and now ordinarily what I would do which I think makes sense maybe I should do what I would ordinarily do so order there's so many different ways to create a repository on GitHub what you saw me do just now is manually create one during using the interface and honestly what I was thinking is like oh let me just add some new files to it like I could actually add that let's just do this this is kind of wacky but let's add index.html and we're just going to go here and we're going to uh paste this in there yeah yeah why not I don't need the sound library right now and I feel like it should but you know the whole point is that people can improve this so I'm not even going to worry about it and I'm going to say uh creating index.html that's perfectly I'm committing to the main branch just just going with it then add another file I'm going to add a file called sketch.js and uh I'm going to put that in here beautiful I'm gonna commit that and say create sketch.js I'm going to go into this file I'm going to you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to make an empty style.css file I'm going to create add a file called uh style.css but I'm not going to worry about what goes in it just yet somebody's asking about quaternions in the chat hilarious okay so now I have this repo if I add do I add to the topics is that where the thing that yapa put hacktoberfest topics is this where the hacktoberfest thing goes is that what I'm supposed to do let's just put it in there and see okay so now this is a hacktoberfest repo I'm making this repo specifically for Oktoberfest as well I might regret this later we'll see what happens um and now what I want to do and I'm going to just I so I have my GitHub linked to netlify and I like to build so I could use GitHub pages to host this sort of main page that um has the logo thing I mean I should just use GitHub pages right now and I'll switch it later but I just don't know what this is going to reveal if I go into my settings so um let me I'm doing this without you being able to look at it um and where is I'm just going to go down to GitHub pages um and I'm going to do it from the main branch employee from a branch I might switch this over to like a netlify build or something later but right now I just uh oh you can't see this hold on let me just finish what I was doing and then you'll be able to see it I lost we're okay uh where is the pages GitHub Pages ah Pages there it is sorry sorry sorry sorry I don't understand I uh all right I'm just gonna assume that this is working now I'm going to come back to here usually okay so now let's see if I go to codingtrain.github.io coding train dash logo did I get that wrong or maybe just hasn't built yet so I once I get this working the sketch would appear here so what do I think this repo is for now here's what I think couple things one is so you know uh just I'm gonna I'll make like a uh live stream brainstorming list uh these are things I'm looking for help with for hacktoberfest later I should break these into separate issues so first of all what are things that might improve this repo um that you might like to suggest in the chat I'm keeping an eye on it um all right so first of all uh read me that explains what the coding train is an image of the logo and what this repo is all about so you could work on the readme um create the the best uh or like any changes that improve how the code reads for beginners and makes it easier to build upon maybe a system for people to add their own variations of the logo this is a bigger project um what else uh ports of the logo to other languages what else so this is the idea I'm trying to think of a list of things that people could work on for this particular repo so I'm going to submit this issue and there we go so this is a repo that I am setting up without much of a plan if I'm being honest which share and and also let's put this in at least in the in the readme let me um just put this here so it's there um this the idea for this repo is maybe I can maybe it can be a friendly place a sort of small low stakes project that people could kind of practice using git and GitHub with like you could pull requests all sorts of stuff here and we can sort of play around with it similarly to my uh that rainbow the poem repo that goes along with my git and GitHub video tutorials so that's the last thing on my agenda for today um besides so I want to talk about the new processing course out now on nebula pinned comment if you want access to that I wanted to talk about the nature of code book which is coming along you can read it online you can preorder it and I wanted to talk about how I intend to hopefully participate in hacktoberfest and how you can submit to the passenger showcase and start this new repo maybe to help people play around with their own variations of the coding train logo did my um now before I go it did just happen to notice here that there are a lot of pull requests right now in the actual coding train repo itself so one is from me that I forgot that I did so one thing I did by the way here's something that you could do uh also with the website all of the videos are associated with topics and languages and I was noticing when I was searching for some Pi Day videos like I have a video about the leibniz um uh formula for approximating pi the uh how Pi in the mandelbrot set are related buffon's needle all these videos related to Pi approximation and Pi Day but the uh topics list was not consistent between them so I was updating that so that's the one thing that I am that people can contribute to if you're looking for a nonshowcase way to contribute to the website is to look at um you know if I go to the challenges for example and I search by like fractal I wouldn't be surprised if there's a coding challenge that deals with fractals that maybe I missed or that some topic or tag is sort of inconsistently Applied so that's something that um people can help with I'm going to go ahead and merge this one I think I was waiting for the tests to pass and I forgot so I'm going to merge this pull request that I made um then you'll see all of these shows oh Kathy who does a wonderful job curating uh the featured showcases and challenges that are on the home page uh apologies for missing this um this is from a couple weeks ago let's let these update I'm going to merge Kathy's work here um and let's look now and then oh updating ah so this is uh Depot Sam who is working on updating some of the contributing guides so hopefully this will as this gets updated it'll help with more instructions information for Oktoberfest but let's look at these showcase submissions right now there are five of them and let's see if I can get through them so I just clicked on one and I don't know what happened where am I I've lost I have too many tabs open let me close all these tabs here we are so this is rampana who has created quite a few contributions as of late let's take a look at this so one uh let's take a look at their work here um oh look at that what a fun spiral with rotating rainbow colors great work Pana so I since I'm doing this live I'm just going to merge it often I try to write a little nice comment an encouraging friendly supportive comment it's going to go ahead and merge this one and we'll see hopefully these appear as I merge them the website will rebuild takes a little time let's look at this heart curve one hey wait a second it's Panna again welcome to the coding train Pana hour uh let's look at this uh and oh that is a very cute little bear bear with a heart pulsing and a bone or is it a puppy I'm not really sure but I love it I love all the variables I guess that's meat I don't know that I've seen a variable called meat before but I quite enjoy that um and let's go ahead and merge this wonderful project and now let's go to ah wave function collapse what are we gonna get here oh interesting Dorian makza and Apologies by mispronouncing name created a PHP tiled wave function collapse so let's take a look at this so here as you can see very legitimate and encouraged to use um to use nonup to use other platforms besides P5 and processing the PHP is quite shocking like at least on made way function collapse with PHP that's incredible let's go to their website to see oh this is incredible wow circuit board oh this is so cool simple demo oh wow this is incredible let me try doing 50 space station that's oh 15 is the max okay amazing wow I love this um so if you're not familiar with wave function collapse there's another algorithm also that from many years ago called Model synthesis which is uh very very similar in terms of the tiled model um you can watch my video on it I don't know I don't know what you'll think of it but certainly there um and you can see that this I this is a really incredible documentation and really incredible work so um now let's see here I am going to yes and this is linked to Dorian so I'm going to make sure I leave a comment here this is incredible emerging live okay I don't know if that will make any sense to anybody but um maybe later I can time code when I looked at this um for Dorian to see if they're not watching live right now okay so now there's two fluid simulations sometimes we get redundant ones let me just sort of check so I I didn't finish my thought wave function collapse is an algorithm that looks at a grid and essentially fills each spot of the Grid in with one of some number of options of tiles And Then There are rules for what tiles are allowed to P appear next to each other and with those rules you can generate all sorts of different kinds of patterns so this is from EG back by Rockstar based on the fluid simulation which is one of which is wild uh to see that someone actually was actually able to make something maybe from watching that video this looks like oh there's a nice MP4 this is made in processing hey let's download this I want to just download this because it's the processing why not open it up uh download and we can look at the sketch so first of all there's a nice MP4 in here that's pretty cool that is pretty lovely so my guess is maybe so one of the in my fluid simulation video I create perhaps what is the least optimized slowest version ever of fluid of fluid simulation so I don't know and we I'm guessing when we run the processing sketch if it's based on my code it will render every frame very very slowly which then makes sense to render out a video so you can watch it more quickly that said this person might have improved the code greatly and optimized it because it is possible to do fluid simulation with all sorts of uh Excel Hardware accelerated and other techniques to make it work better hello Elkin in the chat uh thank you for your support Elkin are you in the Discord with the supporter tag because the stickers are going to be going out very soon to supporters so check and message if you're not okay let's open this up in processing and see what we've got uh keep it keep it keep it not not right now I do want to get the so I think I messed something up probably let me sometimes processing it's in it it's able to handle this more elegantly now but it's probably my fault sometimes having the um it works better if the pde name is the same as the no and still so I'm not sure what I I wouldn't be surprised if I'm doing something wrong here but I'm not able to get this to run right now maybe somebody can help me figure that out later but this is excellent documentation and we were able to see the video um oh and this is also combined with the purlin noise flow field coding challenge so it could go with that coding challenge as well I don't have a way for showcase projects to be tagged for multiple videos right now so you just have to pick one but this is incredible a minute let's see if they're uh yeah this is incredible I'm reviewing it now during a live stream but I had trouble getting the processing code to run the video is perfect the video is perfect um did I miss something I'm just going to put a little screenshot now of this and attach that to here and one little another little trick I'm going to show you is when you upload an image to like a GitHub issue it's going to do a lot of nice things for you automatically and that image is right here in the issue but one thing it will not do is generate an ALT tag that has any meaning it's just using the name of the file so screen so I like to adjust that when I can for accessibility screenshot of processing IDE with error message and then what was the error message so this is a good fluid cannot hide in closing type fluid cannot hide enclosing type so I'm going to add that in there and now um anybody who's reading this issue with a screen reader will have a description of this image of course my description was not comprehensive I didn't list all the code but I edited down to what I felt was like made the most sense for this context I suppose I'm inadvertently training somebody's large image generator model by labeling images for them but it's worth it for um accessibility and James Haskin uh five years ago wow that's amazing thank you so much for watching and tuning in and supporting the channel okay now uh let's merge this pull request I'm gonna merge it I am going to get back to the pull requests I'm going to look at this one which looks like this was a duplicate so I'm I'm going to say I merged this happened sometimes with the form uh this is one two one two two nine so one two two eight uh closing this one so let's do that excellent just doing a little maintenance here a little cleanup of the old coding Train website um and I'm gonna go here and yeah there's a few so now now we're now we're in good shape there's only six open pull requests this is um for the new logging processing video won't be in it it finished till that is on YouTube um this is something the tpom is working on this is somebody who really gave a heroic effort to try to manually add a showcase project but um we need to fix it up still and then I forget what these are I think there's some open questions about which videos those go with but I'll have to deal with those another time okay um so uh thank you all for tuning in today to this live stream I am going to turn this a little this little song I'm Gonna Play in the background down um I'm sorry that this was kind of short on structured disorganized messy unhelpful boring I don't know whatever criticism you want to lob at it I'm sorry for that um I wanted to at least turn on the equipment fire up the old camera machine to take pictures of me and beam them out to you on the internet live just to update you on what's going on at a minimum I always want to have a live stream at least once a month on the coding train and I'm excited to see what happens when the new beginner processing video comes out on YouTube if it brings more people back to the channel My Views are declining at a rather extreme Pace but it kind of makes sense because I haven't published anything new in quite some time it's fine I don't it's no problem we're gonna get back to it gonna make some more challenges get the get the old grind the gears of the code machine make it happen write some artisanal handcrafted code it's coming uh Daniel Rubio says thank you for the channel uh Barney says no need to apologize and cough says it was an amazing live stream I love your energy oh you're all saying such nice things to me it's so nice also I I don't know if any of you notice but the Baltimore Orioles are in first place in the American League East they're leaving Tampa Bay hoping to go to one of their last games of the Season got to make the trip down to Baltimore to catch them it has been there I think it was was it 86 when I was a kid and they won the World Series or made it to the World Series I was a young lad back then in the 19 the 1900s I have like this new hip pain thing I gotta go to physical therapy for that I look so young people always you know I don't know what's happened let's can I show you this I find this a little distressing like I don't uh let's just turn off the sound here we don't need the sound but you know this is me now I look energetic healthy I look all right look at that young whippersnapper with no gray hair and Perfect Skin no bald spots no back pain you know what happened to that guy oh that's that's more like it there you go I do have new glasses do you like that but go go Orioles come on all you tell you don't care about baseball nobody cares about as well you might as well root for the Orioles oh the song ran out um okay I'm gonna answer this question I think I've seen in the chat maybe a thousand times has there been a challenge about make your own Gan uh no but I did a bunch of live streams with an auto making an auto encoder with tensorflow.js so you might go back and find those uh can I make Super Mario Brothers Olivia am asks I would really like to get back to oh in suik thank you for that very kind uh Super Chat there it's very kind of you um and uh they're moving to Vegas the A's are moving to Vegas not the Orioles I hope that's what you're talking about but um I already forgot what I was saying but oh yeah if you're interested in that go look at the auto encoder videos oh so what's coming up next I am teaching in my class in just a couple weeks how to make a Discord bot so um next time I'm back in the studio I'm going to be recording new Discord bot tutorials if you have ideas and thoughts about that come into the Discord the Cody frame Discord and chat about that um I guess there was another there were two there was suik and there's another like I can't really understand there's like a couple different people's profile things I don't understand how this YouTube thing works um this is this is all too much for me okay let's just go back to here if we could all look so please try something with that coding train logo and share it with me on social media I would love that uh if we can remember Kathy if you want to help with this you're welcome to but you don't have to you can try to like time code and um put um time code and put like various links and things that I've talked about in the video description I'll have that up uh if I can get my act together pretty soon um and the next live stream will maybe be a Halloween one what should I wear what costume should I have what should we code let's do a spooky Halloween okay thanks everybody I'm gonna head out of here now and see you all oh what's a catchphrase okay uh All Aboard no that's not a good one that's that's at the beginning All Aboard oh uh what do you say when people get off the train have a great trip no thanks for riding I don't know don't never forget that this Dot s .com let's do this dot this stock this stock s never forget this stuff I'm going to do this stuff this dot this dot this dot this Dot Song never forget this Dot somebody compose that song for me I'm gonna say once again Here We Go sing it with me coordinates thank you autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me Cartesian coordinates let's look forward to Cartesian coordinates unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it again the kittens again kittens and kittens I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound effect foreign that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens at dasada
