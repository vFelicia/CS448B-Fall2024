hello welcome to another guest tutorial today we have for you Val head val is a web technologists she is the author of designing interface animation I highly recommend you check out her book and with Sara Dresner who you might have seen in another guest tutorial video she and Sarah traveled internationally to do workshops called learn web animation from the experts web animation workshops comm so you can check out the link to Val's book and web animation workshops we're tough in the video description look at this next workshop is in New York u December 8th that's tomorrow so if you're I don't know if you're probably kick travel back in time and fly to New York but check out here for their next location and hopefully want to check out their workshops so umm Val's going to show you how to make a nice little springy animation using p5 GS which is a framework that I use in a lot of my videos and we were just talking about how a lot of times when people do is go and try to find this like complicated physics engine to do that but you can actually do it quite simply in a way that Val is going to show you how to do which is really exciting so we hope you enjoy the tutorial yes so hi everyone I'm Val head and in this little short tutorial I'm gonna show you how to make some really easy spring animations a lot of times if you wanted to create things maybe that looked like this or even like something that follows your mouse a little bit like that people will pull in like a whole physics engine or an entire library just to get a little bit of springiness to make it like real physics but i'm going to show you how to kind of fake the physics and make your own spring easing yourself in a very easy way and I'm going to show you this using p5.js so it'll be in canvas with JavaScript but really you can use this technique anywhere you kind of have access to like run a function every frame so you could do it in like regular JavaScript with a function running on requestanimationframe or any other programming language where you have a function running every frame because we're basically just going to update some math on every frame of the animation so right now to start out I have this little pink ball and it is following the X to the x position of my mouse so it's just following my mouse along the x position wherever it goes and it's kind of well boring because it's not doing any fun stuff like springing yet so to make it that happen right now we've just got a target of our mouse position which is the mouse x from p5.js and we're just saying like hey ball go use the position of our mouse for your x position so we're drawing the circle at you know the mouse position and 200 so it's just moving along that x axis but let's make this a little bit more springy so we have two values that we're going to use for the spring and they're just up here we've got one value for drag which is a value that needs to be less than one for it to work because we're going to take this away from the velocity of each frame so if it's one nothing gets taken away and if it's less than one a little bit gets taken away if it's like point zero one a whole ton gets taken away and that probably won't look good but we'll see that in a second and then we have this variable of strength which essentially represents the strength of our spring and that has to be very small or it doesn't have to be very small but it looks best when it's very small a good way to think about it actually if you are doing these sort of spring animations you can imagine the thing that you're animating is like attached to a fixed point with a spring kind of like this image from the wiki Commons right here where this rectangle is attached to something with a spring and when you pull it away it just kind of like oscillates back and forth until it eventually gets goes back to rest so a lot of the physics engines or if you want to get super physics see about it you might use something like Hookes law and know the spring constant but we're not gonna do any of that we're essentially going to create two forces one pulling the spring away from where it wants to be and some forces pulling it back as well so if you're into really exact physics sorry all right so back to our ball and we'll have our two variables for Dragon for strength so let's start actually using dragon strength while we calculate where our ball should be on any given frame so right now we have our position equals studying the position equal to Mouse X but I'm going to get rid of that so we can make it more interesting and we'll start calculating exactly the position the ball should be in kind of like the velocity it should have for each individual frame because you always want it to be heading towards the mouse position and then it'll get closer and closer and eventually rest there after springing around a little bit we don't want it to get there like right away we want it to be kind of a little bit behind where the mouse is so I'm going to start by creating a variable called force and this is going to be our target which is is the position of where our ball is right now the idea being that this particular spring animation is based on the mouse position and when the mouse moves the ball is going to go there if the mouse moves really far we'll consider that stretching the spring really far and have it'll have a lot of force if we move the mouse only a little bit we're just stretching the spring a tiny little bit and we don't have as much force so that's kind of faking that sense of the the force that's pulling the spring apart or the action that's pulling the spring away from where it wants to be so we'll take our other force and we'll actually like x equal it to our strength so what we're essentially doing is saying our strength equals itself times the force what this is gonna do since our strength is a very small number it's gonna take a little bit away from the force which makes sense right if you're pulling the spring and the spring is a very strong rigid spring it's gonna take a lot more force to to pull it apart so we kind of faked that better the physics by multiplying the number of force which should be something somewhat large if our mouse moves far by a small number of our strength which was point one I believe so we'll multiply that by our strength and we have some strength there too so now we want to adjust the velocity of the ball because for each frame in that ball can have some velocity when it first starts out it'll be zero of course it hasn't moved at all but as soon as we move our mouse and the ball starts moving it'll have some existing velocity and we don't want to completely wipe that out so we'll use our velocity which is a variable we declared further up and we're going to times equal that to our drag so that's going to do a very similar thing to our force the velocity is how far the ball wants to go but drag is kind of taking away from that velocity can remember our drag is equal to 0.75 so whatever our velocity is we're taking away just 0.25 of it on every frame so it's getting slowed down a little bit on every frame then we'll take our velocity and we will add our force to it plus equals force and that's going to since the force is what's pulling it kind of a way are like lengthening this spring if you want to think of it that way I'm the velocity and force are working together in the same direction so we'll add that force on there after we've taken away the drag and then once we're done those simple multiplications and additions and totally fake physics we can set our position which is the x position rather of our ball to what we've just found out for velocities so our position is plus equals our velocity the idea being that for every frame our velocity is going to be some you know essentially positive amount or some amount that it makes the ball move further than it is right now or maybe the other way you know it might go in either direction but by adding the velocity the current position we just keep moving along in our spring whether it's left or right or however it is so then once we have that in our draw loop we're also drawing our circle like we saw before and we're drawing it at the position which is the thing we did all that kind of fake physics math for drawing it right there and at 200 pixels so if we save this and run it assuming I did everything right Oh run now we have a little bit of spring to our ball so it's following our mouse position only on the x axis but we have a spring just on that x axis as well of course this is a lot more fun when you do it on both the x and y axis which will you know give you something a little bit more like this and in this particular one I also did it with p5.js and I use vectors to do the x and y coordinates together at the same time because that's pretty fun to save that time but by doing it in both the x and y axis it's a lot more fun to show you a little bit how the drag and the strength factors work together I made this little pen so this is the one that we were just looking at with our drag factor of 0.75 and our strength of 0.1 it's kind of you know soft springy if we raise that drag even more so we take less away from the velocity every time we get a very much more springy spring this one will make you dizzy if we increase the strength of our spring which is essentially like the spring being so rigid or just like made of really you know something that resists being pulled and we get a much more like staccato kind of spring with this little s with this little drag it looks kind of like we have blurred vision so mo you might take our drag down a little bit and this is just like a really subtle one so you can see even with just these two variables of like dragons strength you can create some very different Springs just with some simple multiplication it's not real physics it's not you know emulating any particular spring in the real world but it does look pretty springing and it's really responsive so why not some places is pretty good for we saw it as like a mouse chaser thing that's fun anything that's like scaling up and down on interaction this was a particular fun one to make that could be like a menu or something where you just have various thoughts bringing out of each other out of the same position there's a lot you can do with Springs and Springs don't have to be hard you can kind of invent them yourself just with a little bit of dragon strength multiplication so I hope you found that tutorial fun and it was really great to be on this channel with you you
