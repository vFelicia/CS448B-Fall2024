sound check one two three uh now i have my mic unmuted but the caption system that i'm working is still going hello everybody i'm muting my mic again let me know how the audio is i actually was just noticing i think the music was a little bit loud do do do do so so hello welcome to another saturday afternoon here on the coding train i was wondering what my um live captioning system would do with the train whistle but it doesn't seem to have um i guess you're seeing the captions over here so when we're looking at them i need to look this way but my monitor to see them is over there so hey how are you all doing it's saturday it's february 13th tomorrow is valentine's day i love you you're my valentine the internet people who watch the coding train are officially my valentine um i don't know what that means why i'm saying it or if this is how i should be beginning the coding train today but that's what's in my heart and i'm just taking my heart out and showing it to you here that's also weird where am i going with this i just want to say that i love you you're great um so one of these days maybe um it won't a saturday we'll roll around and i'll feel like i had a really good night's sleep and i spent the day just leisurely like thinking about the kind of things i do in the live stream getting things set up and just turning things on and being here fully present and with all of my energy and enthusiasm today is not one of those days i'm definitely feeling scatterbrained quite tired it's been a long week it's been a very long year in the last year um and it is the dead of winter here in new york um there is lots of snow out there it's quite cold and icy i'm ready for that and i'm ready for the springtime but nevertheless um i am here um to be with you and before i go too much further let me briefly take a minute to thank today's sponsor of the coding train and those are my friends over at oh my too many buttons to press um let's try this curiosity stream okay wait wait everything's gonna be fine people i've got a way to move things around here nope nope wrong one no no no not that nope this one yep that's right no now move this up here oh now move this over here oh nope nope sorry i'm really i'm really uh in trying to work with some more captions here there we go there we go there we go so launched by media visionary john hendricks who founded the discovery channel back you know when there was actually documentaries there's a lot of reality tv on there now i kind of like reality tv but you know your honesty stream is the awardwinning destination for documentary films and tv shows covering every topic from space exploration to adventure to the secret lives of wild animals so you can sign up with that link that's up there and in the chat actually pinned the comment in the chat and wait a second wait a second i have some breaking news coming in breaking news oh it's in this year breaking news because of valentine's day that discount that was previously 26 off is now 41 off just for today and tomorrow so if you sign up it's 11.79 for an h for the entire year that's the entire year by the way and you will also get access to the streaming video service nebula which is a streaming video service that i am a part of that i've talked about before on the channel when you sign up for this curiosity stream bundle using the link up there and in the chat so thank you curiosity stream for your sponsorship um moving back to um my this view over here i'm let's let's talk about for a minute what the plan is for today and let me see if i can get the chat back over here um i'm trying to be a bit more organized and i'm clearly failing at that quite quite a bit today um so what do i have on the docket what's on my coding train todo list for today well the focus of the focus of um if you only knew the things that are swirling around in the back of my mind while i'm talking woof it's very hard to keep two entire sets of conversation in your own head going on at once i have a really difficult time with that um but this spring as i have mentioned many times before is i'm really dedicating myself to the nature of code and let me come back over here and have to move this back up top here um and so uh most recently on the channel i have been releasing i'm on chapter three right now so i'm putting out new videos uh several per week with lessons related to topics in the nature of code book and you can see that i'm almost done and i think i can maybe just go over here to learning nature of code and scroll on down there are two more um videos in the three point x series which is all about angles rotation trigonometry um angular motion um and polar coordinates lots of things there um and so um what i um what's coming up um next is um let's see well i'll just show you so this particular video ends with this example i'm gonna run it for you right now oh that's actually not the example i end with um this is the example i believe i'm not really sure but i end with yeah so just looking at graphing the sine wave graphing a sine wave in motion with animation now one of the things you can do with once you have this idea and you're able to graph a sine wave is you can take two sine waves and you can have different frequencies of those waves perhaps different amplitudes of those waves you can add them together and you get a new wave so let's see if i can pull up that's what the next video that i haven't released yet will be about it's already been recorded it's just about finished just haven't released it yet um this doesn't look like the one from let's see um from the actual video but let's see if i can three is there a 3.7 is there anything here that says 3.7 does anybody see basic polar 3.4 oscillating motion timer i'm playing with 3.8 i see a 3.8 uh 3.3 3.3 weird what happened to i guess it's not uh add no additive wave wave sine wave graphing wave wow i wonder where this uh example went um let's look at this one this is not the example this is this is the visual result but this is this is code this is the example from um 2012 basically and i have updated it with a class for a wave and all sorts of things um i'm seeing some interesting questions in the chat that i would love to address but so this is the idea once you have multiple waves varying periods varying amplitudes add them together you can get results like that so stay tuned that's what's coming next now while i'm here let's foreshadow what's coming in 3.8 so the prompt the homework assignment from week 3 chapter 3 of the nature of code one of the ideas is to think about how you can apply an oscillating motion to a particle moving around a canvas so this is the idea of like okay i have this idea of particles that are responding to forces and moving around and then they have this little arm that kind of pulls itself uh forward um as if it's maybe a wing or an arm or an appendage and i'm using an oscillating wave uh that's mapped to the object's velocity to um to visualize the locomotion of this particular object so that's where all this is going and if you want to look ahead those are the videos that are coming out but if you're kind of following along with the course that i'm actually teaching right now which is all here in this github repo what the actual homework for this week is uh this try using vectors so um if you want to kind of follow along with the course um where am i i'm actually in the videos for this week are the one the one point x series what are vectors vector math random vector static methods unit vector acceleration gravity and win oh no no no no just to 1.6 so um what i'm trying to do on my saturday streams is kind of do a quick homework assignment and i think what i would like to do for my homework assignment is continue what i did for my random walk homework assignment which was uh the selfavoiding walk so i'm gonna get to that um i'm looking at the um some of the chat messages here and people are asking about the um automated captions so um i um let me just speak to that for a minute um it's very important to me that the live streams that i do are accessible i have tried many different uh systems for captioning nothing honestly really beats a human um captioner um the there are automated youtube captions you can turn those on right now on youtube but there's a little settings and it will um it's an overlay through the youtube player itself i have not been too thrilled with the quality of those um and so right now i'm experi i noticed that through um nyu where i uh teach um nyu's zoom account through i think believe a service that's ai lot called ai live i can turn on captions in any zoom meeting so right now what i'm actually doing is i'm in a zoom meeting right now and i have the captions running and i'm just in open broadcast studio capturing that as an overlay i wanted to see how this worked um i know it's a big discussion i would love to hear from the uh community of anyone who actually uh uses watches videos with captions on i know there's a um there's different points of view i believe around whether captions should be i believe i'm going to get this wrong which is why i'm kind of stumbling over my words here but whether the captions should be always on or an option that you could turn on or off right now i'm gonna leave these on for today um just to sort of like see how good they are and then i might look into seeing if i can with an api get these captions directly into the youtube system so they could replace those and they could be something that people could turn on and off um so that's kind of what i am um thinking about and experimenting with um just to be clear it's just an overlay so i have a button right here they're gone they're back what i love about this which is kind of funny i'm gonna mute my microphone for a second ready sometimes that's what i mute my microphone for if i'm talking to my kids who came up to ask me a question but now the captions will still go i can i do have a button over here which will mute me in zoom so i can now no captions appear no wait a second that didn't mute zoom zoom mute button not working well i can manually mute myself and zoom all right all right enough with this i don't know what's going on anymore um okay so uh yeah hacker says in the chat yawn and that's exactly how i feel today i have to just be totally honest with you i didn't really feel like live streaming today some days it's just like it's hard people always write in my uh i get a lot of the um when harry met sally kind of um comments in my youtube videos like i'll have what he's having because i have a lot of energy and enthusiasm and that's a genuine feeling that i have when i record videos and i discover something and make tutorials i really do feel that genuine enthusiasm and excitement and passion for this kind of work that i'm doing but i am a human who gets tired and um especially during the semesters when i'm teaching and there's a lot going on family wise and you know i don't know if you noticed we're living in a global pandemic i definitely have a lot of privilege and a lot of things in my life that make things very comfortable and easy for me and i'm very grateful for that um so anyway but here i am i'm gonna i'm i'm um thanks for being here with me and let's get started and actually do some coding stuff uh oh so uh this is why so so um i wanted to just mention that actually i kind of am looking for some help here i feel like this assignment does isn't one of my better sets of prompts so this is the assignment um it's really this week is if for if you're if you're in the course it's kind of about oh you've never used vectors before you have used vectors before maybe conceptually but haven't used p5 vector or thought of the way that you're moving animating elements in a creative coding sketch with this concept of vectors so but i'm not so sure about the prompt here um all right so if you have ideas for that i would welcome that what else did i want to show so oh i also just wanted to mention i don't know if i have time for this but it is tomorrow is valentine's day and i have these wonderful i mean i don't want to call them wonderful it's up to you you decide whether they're wonderful or not i have these um coding challenges that i did um quite some time ago i guess two years ago in 2019 um about uh heart this is a um this is really kind of insane i don't know if this heart curve is actually a mathematical function plotted with copolar coordinates that produces a heart there is this is one of my absolute favorite patterns in um kind of mathematical visualization the cardioid that appears when you visualize a times table um over around a circle um and so though i was just going to encourage people if you're looking for something to explore this weekend you know valentine's day is obviously like not a real holiday it's some kind of like you know such a capitalist trick to get us to buy things you know but expressing love is a nice thing i do also like chocolate just saying dark chocolate you know low low sugar now that sounds weird low sugar i just like i like you know what i really like is a good organic nut butter chocolate cup i'm such a loser i live in brooklyn and so when i when i think about like a reese's peanut butter cup which i'm sorry to buzz market reese's pieces not a sponsor i like to think about some artisanal handmade dark chocolate almond butter organic cup that i that costs like 7.99 at the local store all right i'm off on a terrible tangent here um tangent so take a look at those uh heart curve heart curve oh you know and by the way this is also a nice um excuse for me to look at some community contributions um this by the way i was just poking at this this morning on this beating heart with interactive equation editor by elizabeth hudnot that was submitted um this really is a cool website um i'm just gonna actually get rid of this preset uh link and take that off this is and i'm gonna go down here and say let's go this i discovered this just today by looking through the community contributions this is a website that has several different mathematical algorithms uh visualized um it's created by um elizabeth hudnot let's see we can go over this is um their github there's a codepen link here and lots of these i don't know that these are all based on my videos but there's a lot of crossover certainly between videos that i've made and what are here but if i go here to this graphing calculator one um click on this oh select i guess i have to click um oh i see i need to let's go directly to back to here and let's do let's go it's really cool like the equations can be just plugged in here and then it graphs them and then i can like do cool stuff like rotate it i saw it when um and play with all the various um parameters here so like what if i just change this from 16 to a 15. does it regraph it i don't know what to do i don't know how to make this work close path do i have to like set set i don't know i don't know it's too exciting so play around with this it's really cool um a really excellent um a wonderful community contribution um that i found on the website so take a look at those uh i also wanted to just highlight um and maybe i'll come back to this uh in a little bit but one of the things you know the community contributions come in through these pull requests you can just um find them on the website if you go to any particular video like for example you could be right now watching this um the very first person to submit a community contribution of a creative project that you made from this video does not exist yet but i recently discovered it let's see if i can find this again i was looking at this this morning yes someone took uh this was from seven days over ago um m awesome forever who is definitely awesome forever took the bees and bombs gif recreation coding challenge and ported it over to roblox and we can see a gif animation of it right here in roblox which this just thrills me to no end i haven't actually shown this to my kids who are avid roblox enthusiasts um and i really feel like i've gotta get into this and learn how to do this a bit myself this is wild okay so i'm yeah so good suggestion oh this is an interesting idea i haven't thank you for this um suggestion i'm going to try something a little bit interesting here so i'm putting this here and then i'm going to move myself here we go there the captions are right below me let's see how that goes um let me just go over to p5 web editor it and it i think if i do this then uh the reason why i didn't put the captions over on this side was because i wanted to make sure it wasn't blocking the code if i look at code but now i'm realizing um this could work pretty well also a little bit higher up i feel it's giving me a little boost a little boost of confidence today live streaming it is blocking the console but i will deal with that when the time comes all right i really do need to get the captions like natively through an api this is just a window capture and you can see i actually it's very small i mean i don't mean to go off on a tangent here but the way that i'm capturing this from zoom is i act zoom i can do a window capture in open broadcast studio um and to see what that looks like i'm just going to show you this right now let's do oops no no let me show you what this looks like i'm going to go to window capture and i'm going to type in zoom test and i'm going to hit ok and name is already in use i already made something called zoomtest zoomtest2 and then oops it's getting this stream chat which is fine let's go to here zoom meaning so this is actually i'm gonna hit okay this is actually the zoom meeting right here and the captions in the zoom meeting are showing up right over there but they don't show up they're like this extra transparent overlay window that's part of zoom and obs just for what i actually spent like an hour today trying to get obs to find it and it would just not find it um so what i had to do was actually capture my entire display and then crop it around where the captions show up and then i'm sort of like blowing it up a little bit so they're kind of pixelated and not the best quality um but this i don't need anymore so but that's my zoom meeting that i'm in by myself what happens if i turn the video on there you can see exciting exciting times here on the coding train uh all right let's um let's remove this remove remove okay back to um the topic of today so my homework assignment for the random walk week and i by the way this is one of the strange things now about my live streams it used to be the opposite the live streams were where i would try a coding challenge and then um i would that would so people who watched the live streams would kind of see the sort of raw unfettered unedited hours of debugging coding challenge which i still think is something that i would like to get back to doing more of then i would edit something out of it and later like there would be a video um that would sort of like take that segment out of the live stream right now i'm actually recording the coding challenges not live streaming and then i'm coming in like playing around with them when i live stream so you can essentially getting a sneak peek on something that's coming out hopefully in the next week or two so let me go and grab the code for this and i have some things that i want to discuss and think about related to it um self yeah here it is coding challenge self avoiding walk and i think i might have showed this last week i actually i did a new version of it since the last time i showed it um and okay so what this is and let me move this up a tiny bit that'll help this is a um selfavoiding walk and what is it what it is attempting to do is there is it's taking the canvas and dividing it into a grid and every spot on the grid um sorry i'm like reading the chat and talking which is i've learned my lesson i shouldn't uh i shouldn't be doing that um every every cycle it can go left right up or down you know it's my own fault but everyone's giving me a lot of suggestions about how to improve the layout the captioning system and i'm paying attention to that while i'm trying to talk about selfvoting walk i just i think i should stop paying attention to that see i told you today was just gonna it's i'm a little bit off i mean i'm i don't know what my on is but today i'm definitely off there are more people than i imagined watching this all right so but i'm going to get to doing some stuff with this in a second so i actually want to just um change this right now to make the spacing 50. so if the okay so now the spacing is 50. and i think i would also let me duplicate this actually because i want to explain what's going on here a bit more walk vectors homework and i'm going to try adding some vectors to this as well let's talk about vectors okay so first thing i want to do is change the spacing to 50 and then i think i would like to draw some more information so people could see the grid here so let me do the following i'm going to say 4 let i equal 0 i is less than the number of columns and i'm going to use j for the rows i've learned my lesson when i have auto refresh on be very careful about typing loops so you don't get it stuck in a forever loop then if i do rectangle i i'm spacing j times spacing spacing spacing i should get a grid of rectangles oh that's kind of crazy looking and i want to say stroke 255 fill 100 stroke weight let's give the stroke weight one so i just wanted to i wanted you to be able to see this grid because the walker is moving and i think i'm going to do this and um let's have it actually be spacing minus one and these are all squares so i don't need this extra variable oh i don't have enough room how come that didn't work do i have to say square explicitly square is not defined by the way one of the things i've discovered is that my sketches tend to be using very old versions of p5 and i should really make sure i update them i think 1.1.9 can anyone fact check on me that that's the more recent version uh let's go back to the sketch um there we go i guess i can just leave that at zero i don't know why so i wanted to see this all right so the idea is that the random walker it starts in the top left spot it can go from here one of three one of two to the right and down oh i should try this let's see what if i let it go diagonally this is essentially a graph each cell is a node and the edges are the connections just horizontal or vertical connections and so it's it's randomly walking and is and it not and it's not allowed to go back to a spot that it's previously been so eventually at a certain point it's going to get somewhere and be stuck so when it's stuck it backtracks and tries to go a different way and then backtrack some more if it gets stuck and tries to go a different way so in theory this is a brute force algorithm and eventually it's going to hit every spot and fill the space it's not doing that very quickly it takes a long time let's change the spacing to 100 to see if we can at least wait it out now with with a four by four there we go so we can see with four by four it just took you know i don't know what that was 10 seconds that was just a few seconds there to make its way through every single to hit every single spot in the graph without crossing over itself so what i've been trying to figure out is what is the big o notation for this particular brute force algorithm so this is for how many possible pathways does it need to check so if n is 4 there are n squared cells and then if it starts with one i mean how is it factorial like either it's kind of like the traveling sales person algorithm but it but it's it's not that exactly because it can't go from one node to any node um so the most recent version is 1.2.0 everyone's telling me okay okay good to know good to know good to know 1.2 .0 and i don't know why i'm going to just get rid of the sound um and let's so i would love some help from people watching um hamilton right so the hamiltonian psycho oh joe bennett says o2 to the end and simon let's see if i can bring this up on the screen simon posted a nice message in the chat with a variety of and unfortunately it's too long for me to fit and the uh this system that i'm using which is called this stream chat which is wonderful somebody posts a link to it in the chat so people can find this it's a discord bot and a chat bot for live streaming works better with twitch but i use it with youtube that's made by some coding trained community members um uh simon here has posted a um a helpful explanation of different big o notations as well as instead of big no reminding me about p n p p space and exponential time so um i'm getting suggestions from joe of o2 to the n um sarob writes oh it's not o n squared so an o n squared algorithm would be something like um i was going to say blurring the image like an image processing algebra would be n squared assuming n is one of the you know if we're talking about a square is the width um and then the pixels goes is squared and thank you david for posting just stream chat evor is saying oh three to the n squared max three possible new cell and two for 2d grid that's kind of interesting but you have to think about like it's not just a matter of anyway it's it's a very very uh large number i was kind of thinking of it as like worst case scenario if i got rid of all the rules um is it really equivalent to n squared factorial because uh like it's ultimately something like the traveling sales person problem where i'm trying to find the most efficient route through n number of points which is an n factorial and then i'm kind of taking n as the width of the square so n squared factorial but you know here or there um so um but you'll see very quickly just even if i just go to um eight by eight like what is n squared factorial of eight by eight that's 64 factorial anybody know that off the top of their head um that's a one with 89 zeros so if that's really true there's no way i'm ever going to be able to see i mean without getting extremely lucky there's no way i'm ever going to be able to sit here and wait as it checks one possibility you know 60 possibilities per second i was experimenting with this idea and you'll see it commented out in the code like let me have it try 500 000 per frame so this is obviously going to move much faster but even so uh worst case o three to the end says heka um the the j sua roop says o two to the n squared yeah that i have to think this through and probably thinking this through while i'm live streaming is not the best idea but i wanted to point out that essentially um this is a um sounds like a question for brady hair and numberphile or matt parker yes indeed so i would like to explore this further but i'm noticing that there i you know there are particular techniques for making smarter decisions about how you can more up you know if we have obviously like i could no i think this is what the hamiltonian path gets at it's like it's very easy for me and i'll see if i can kind of like zoom over to this where i could just decide like well obviously if i start going down then over then up then oh then hey wait i have to if i start over here and just go up and then over i don't have very much space to work with and down and then over then up like i could actually design a path that i know would hit every spot with a kind of rule for any particular 2d uh space that goes in two dimensions you pro chris writes you probably need to estimate the average branching factor per cell yeah that makes sense um all right so what i wanted to explore so beyond like and we could see that beyond trying to uh solve this um i wanted to explore first of all i rather just enjoy the act of watching it take forever to try to figure this out it's quite pleasurable to me to sort of see it i'm doing its work um but what i wanted to explore here are two things one is i wanted to sort of like look at change the example around a little bit with vectors that was kind of my idea recursion i probably should i didn't use recursion for this if you could believe it although it definitely would have made sense too but um i wanted to look at um i believe i don't know if anybody knows any other keywords i can search for but hamiltonian path um let's take a look at this so this is a path uh hamiltonian cycle uh and i've never i haven't looked at this really other uh much beyond just this moment um okay are named after william rowan hamilton who this is not from hamilton the musical that's too bad um who invented no no it's hamilton puzzle blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah where is there some pseudo code here uh is a path that visits each vertex of the graph exactly once a graph that contains a hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph a graph is hamiltonian connected if for every pair of vertices there is a hamiltonian path between the two vertices so i actually really like um one possible hamiltonian cycle through every vertex of a dodecahedron is shown in red like all paclionic tiles the dodecahedron is hamiltonian so this i'm kind of fascinated by and i'm almost more interested in starting over now with a new sketch and trying to look at visualizing um a hamiltonian path um through just sort of an arbitrary set of vertices the herschel graph is the smallest possible polyhedral graph that does not have a hamiltonian cycle interesting so um an algebraic uh solve so what is an algorithm ooh night tour is something i always have been meaning to explore on the channel i'm seeing a lot of things that i've been interested in that i haven't bothered to look at before so how how do i solve it um okay hamiltonian cycle hello look up shrom loner evolution it has a lot in common with random walks okay by the way i'm giving myself the first half of this live stream to play around with this in the second half i'm going to look at how to have a node sketch like render a p5 sketch i mean i don't know that i'll succeed at that but that's what i wanted to look into um okay whoa this looks like quite an interesting um visual result i like anything with a rainbow color as you know um this is an interesting this would be a cool coding challenge i'm gonna have to look at this a little bit on my own um but this definitely um this image appeals to me very much evolution on the upper half plane with hue indicating log of this formula fascinating oh i definitely want to um keep this now was this what was it called shrom has anybody suggested this no so let's make a quick uh issue always looking for new like this summer hopefully is going to be the summer of lots of new coding challenges once i'm finished with this semester no not a new repository i've lost my mind here issues new issue um and from evolution came up in live stream on saturday february 13th 2021 and dare i say copy image address how do you do this in markdown is it this no i forget how in github markdown you show an image let's see um image oh it's just the image in parentheses with the exclamation point before it of course of course of course the exclamation goes here and then rainbow hue strom loner image let's see great all right so we are going to submit this issue when a walk gets stuck search for unreachable regions and then backtrack until all of them are open interesting that's what octopus is suggesting uh okay let's see here whoops wrong wrong wrong spot uh not what i meant to go to uh all right so i'm i'm in this hamiltonian path so let me look up hand oop ah what happened what happened um selfavoiding walk hamiltonian path hamiltonian let me just this is what happens when you live stream with absolutely no plan whatsoever to do uh square filling selfavoiding walk this is interesting polynomial time that fills a square grid with a random hamiltonian path starting at a particular point see this example right interesting that it looks like exactly what i want to do the following people by umans and len hart gives a polynomial time algorithm for finding a hamiltonian cycle in solid grid graphs for general grid graphs the problem is np complete whoa look at this nathan klisby's generator as cited by whoa this so this is what i want to do wild um what did i use does anybody remember what i used for my maze generation um um this page is not appearing does anyone know what i used for my remember what i used for my maze generation coding challenge i feel like this is i'm redoing something i looked at years ago this is really cool there's also that like pivot algorithm what's the i i feel like when i was reading up on this there's a pivot algorithm let's look at this the pivot algorithm works by taking a selfavoiding walk and randomly choosing a point on this walk then applying symmetrical transformations on the walk after the nth step to create a new walk oh boy i don't know if i'm realistically going to be able to read a paper about a particular algorithm while i'm live streaming and then implement it depth first search think hilbert curve yeah i did all this mazes have splits on the path which you don't want okay that's why it's a different problem thank you depth first search i've done let's hold on depth first search coding train a breath ferch have i not done a depth first search on coding train self avoiding walk scaling concepts and graphs theory selfavoiding walk on fractal complex networks i just want to see a picture if i see a picture of what i want to do then that's the time to read the paper okay this is looking good whoa yeah ooh the two by two flower and the two by three flower in the first second and third generations each line is replaced by parallel lines of length u and v in construction of the next generation fascinating okay this is definitely something that looks like i would want to implement looks really cool selfavoiding walk okay uh oh look at this in euclidean space the number of paths of length k which is written as ck on r to the n is believed to behave as uh okay and the mean square distance of pathway okay so this is there's hypotheses about how many whoops paths there are boy i'm really ah i've really gone down a rabbit hole here on my live stream okay okay interesting i'm gonna have to come back and read this paper a star was for finding the shortest path yeah uh i used a star yes yes i use breath for i've done breath first search but these are all for finding the like looking to get from point a to point b i'm not looking to get from point a to point b i'm looking to get uh to hit every single point without ever revisiting a previous point which is quite a different problem um all right i might have to give up on this right now and move just on to making this more interesting pivot algorithm and the selfavoiding walk introduction all right i'm going to have to read more on this later and come back to it um because i'm this is you know i i think what when i see what when i find like some clear written pseudo code for an algorithm that's when i started to feel like i could implement it live i could definitely imagine making up a way that i would imagine a hamiltonian path working but i think actually what i would like to try right now is rather than let me close this one i'm just curious what happens if i allow it to go diagonally so what if i write a selfavoiding walk but allow it to move diagonally and then could using p5 vec p5 vector help me with that so that's what i'm going to go look at how perfect snake ai is written when the snake is at max size it is just a selfavoiding walk that is such a great point from chris manny but i'm kind of running out of time that i allowed to play around with the selfavoiding walk so let's try to at least expand on this a little bit um this is my exercise so one of the things that i wanted to note here that i did is that i made a class for any given step that the walker would take left right left right down up and i think what i would like to just sort of see is if i actually have this extend p5 vector what will this get me so i want to just first be i want to be using uh vectors in p5 so i've leaped bounds ahead of where i am in the nature of code course because part of the nature of code course will look at object inheritance so this is if this if you're kind of more of a beginner in p5 and you are in javascript and haven't worked with objects inheritance this will seem quite strange to you but already existing in p5 is a class called p5 vector which has which stores a separate x y and z so rather than make my own called step with an x y i can just extend inherit from p5 vector and now though i did something sort of weird where i i called it dx and dy so i'm just going to look for wherever i'm using that and move this over to give myself some more room um cannot read property okay so where do i use the dx of the step ah here it is this should now be x and this should now be y and by the way so i go through all of this code and what it means and why i'm doing it in the actual coding challenge and then this is also x and this is also y okay great so i just wanted to do that because i want to be back to where i started so let me hit save but with vectors because now i think uh i guess i'm not doing very much to add vectors to this but i wanted to see what happens like will this just work the way i've written this did i write it in a scalable way where i can now add diagonal options yeah look at that i can't believe i did that like i just gave it i wrote it in such a way where i'm allowing it to go diagonally just by so now i can go diagonally now let me and i kind of in a way i want to take out this extra because i want to see what it looks like like this um and let's now also um let me add two more and yeah now i think oh boy oh so it can cross itself because it's not about not being able to it couldn't cross itself before because it could only go left right up or down but it's just about going to a spot that it hasn't been before and when it's allowed to go diagonally it can do that so what if now i go back to making this something like 10. whoa this see i this is pretty cool um the question is does this make it harder for it to succeed or easier for it to succeed i would think harder and shreyaas asks does extends in javascript refer to inheritance and yes it does let's allow it to um just do like a bunch more per frame where is yeah interesting craziness what if i give it a much bigger space to work with this i apologize that this hasn't really gone anywhere it was it's like a big curiosity of mine i guess i'm just bringing it up and maybe later i'll get all sorts of interesting comments on the video of things i can research or look at but i do find these patterns to be quite interesting i have to get lucky basically for it to go get pretty far let's um let's let it try a hundred thousand per frame i feel like there could be some interesting things in terms of playing with color here with this um i feel like this is kind of also like some kind of like alien hieroglyphics like i've discovered some strange alien language here uh it will never cover all the points if it goes diagonal i think so says udeep that's an interesting question right so simon is pointing out that there's a difference between a walk that visits every edge like that goes along every connection between the nodes versus visiting every vertex every node i did want to investigate this further um but i think maybe i'm gonna have to move on from this right now it could detect when it gets stuck in a cave and backtrack out yeah that's can it move in arcs okay i love this thank you all right let's so uh let's try this is a really really awesome idea um so the way that i'm actually rendering it is with um vertex and i could use curve vertex and look at this that is really pretty wild looking now interestingly what happens if i just go back to the original way that it was without the diagonal options and keep in curve vertex actually i'm kind of curious about that didn't well yeah i guess you just get a kind of wonky string moving around almost that has a little curvy so that adding the diagonals in it really gives it a much more strange quality um there's also uh what happens if i use um bezier vertex that didn't work oh because bezier vertex a bezier curve by definition is always four points so it's the two end points and two anchor points and two control points um i'm just curious what if i um go back to something i know it can solve so um yeah it's pretty interesting to see this path that it's trying to do and the other thing about curve vertex which i always forget about is the end points are entry and exit points of the curve so what i should do here is duplicate them so i should add a curve vertex for path index zero dot x path index zero dot y this is the path there we go so i have the opening spot and now i might also a path path dot length minus one so i get the n spot duplicated this is pretty wild um like i would love for it to finish just once but i think i might need to go back to um there we go wait why didn't it finish the curve i did something wrong ah i put it after n shape there we go so this is actually quite interesting because i didn't intend to do this but i just created uh like almost like a glyph designer wow this is really cool actually like this is not at all my intention this is what so first of all i am so excited right now because i felt like this is basically one of my worst live streams ever and in a strange way i just made something that i really love i almost feel like this is some kind of like stylegan ai generated glyph and yet it's just random walk selfavoiding random walk paths and they're not it doesn't actually selfavoid and that it crosses itself that hits every spot now if i could optimize this algorithm to do it higher resolution like i really want like could i can i double it i mean the thing that i could do is not worry about i could just let it get stuck and not backtrack so if it's stuck like what if i say no loop just curious to see what i yeah so this is actually quite nice because i could just let it get stuck i'm generating these paths these are really quite amazing what could i do with color with this well you know this is my sort of like the limits of my ability to design with color but i'm going to say color mode hsb and then what if i were to say and oh i like watching it draw it also that's much more fun and and i think the dot at the end should go away right this yeah and i wonder if it should start at a random point right it's always starting in the top left so what if i have it start in a random point i had no idea that this is where i was going to go um so the spot always starts at grid zero zero so um let's do let's start at a random spot each time uh and so this is where we're going to start let's see if that works i feel like it's why is it losing the last one do you see that like it's oh i think because it's it deletes it because it's still doing one aspect of the backtracking um so let's not let's not backtrack yeah okay so this is my glyph generator i was going to add color to it right so um where is the color so if i have color mode hsb and i say like 100 255 255 100 is that how oh no no these are 100 100 oh no no sorry 100 oh it goes up here sorry this is for that point okay so it's green good so this should be um oh this should be in here and then um let i equal oh let oh so i would like now i need a counter here so let's do let i equal i is less than path dot length i plus plus and then uh spot is path index i and then the hue is just out of curiosity i modulus modulus 360. oh i can't do oh it won't do a different color for each segment that's weird it's just doing it for the whole thing i mean that's why is that i thought i could do different colors for different segments so that's unfortunate i mean i know how i could do this by just drawing manual curves well am i missing something different color different segments begin shape and shape uh does this work in processing if like all right so i always thought this is how it worked let me open up processing yeah it's one shape somehow i thought you could internally change i know how i would do it with lines because i could just go back to drawing lines but let me just check how processing works so i'm going to make some vertices here it's going to make a quick triangle okay it's a quick triangle i'm going to say close actually i'm not going to say close stroke weight 8 and stroke 0. oops no fill stroke 255 this is what i meant to do okay i'm just testing this so if i were to say here stroke 255 0 0. i'm just gonna i thought i could do something like this and it would interpolate the colors i don't know why i always imagined you can do this okay apparently not if you do a fill does it do it okay it's all the last color maybe you have to use like p shape in processing yeah i completely imagine this so i i i change renderer processing will let you multiple colors in one shape yeah but um oh vary the line thickness so that's the other can i vary the line thickness between vertices i don't think so oh well now i have a fill what happened to my okay yeah no so i it just takes it just does whatever the last thing is so i would have to manually draw them as separate curves the way what happens if i allow it to have a fill it's pretty interesting gradient could be it create a new so i could use arcs yeah i could use arcs i i could that's an interesting idea i do sort of like where this ended up though so i'm kind of fine with it um i i think i'm going to i'm going to let other people explore color on their own and i'm going to get rid i'm going to say where did i put the color but it is interesting to note how i can have a fill um i don't think having the clothes is quite unnecessary i think in the phil i'm going to go back interesting to explore but i um all right and one thing could be to have it keep going until it can like get back to itself so it always creates like a closed shape but i'm going to go back to no fill and just generate these patterns okay um i will save you could use a gradient i don't know about this gradient uh is there a gradient fill or stroke within uh p5 this is not something i'm aware of by the way what i want to do so first let me link this code where i wanted to go in the um second half of today's live stream i'm going to take a break and get to the second half now um so by the way if you're wondering what i'm showing you here this is the coding train discord i'll put post a link to it in the chat um this is this is a where this is where the community gets together and chats so if you need help with code or want to join the community and check out different things going on in the discord i highly encourage you to come and join um but also i tend to post like links to the code and different things that i'm doing here in this channel under live called links i also haven't been doing a good job of this but if you're looking for to get notifications um where do i find this under videos you can subscribe to this notifications role and then you will get notifications whenever i post a new video or schedule a new live stream so you can see this morning at 8 34 am i scheduled the live stream for today this is the wrong thumbnail ignore that um and so if you're if you want um notifications i think you just do exclamation point subscribe as a command bot command in the discord one thing i will say about the discord if you're about to join we're trying to see if i could get discord partner and you have to reach a certain number of members with a certain amount of engagement and so it looked it our engagement numbers go down if a lot of people join but never post so again don't post if you don't want to but if you feel so inclined to join post an introduction engage a bit with the community that will boost the numbers a little bit maybe i can get um discord partnership all right so where is um there is a gradient function in p5 that's an example go set gradient is this a function in p5 or just no this is just an example of drawing grading for the line okay is there like a gradient fill prim's algorithm oh yeah i've used prim's algorithm i did a um a video on prim's algorithm unfortunately i did it kind of way before i was doing the coding challenges um and it's sort of buried oh but here we go yeah and like the code's not here i wonder if i can find it so yeah like you can see how this is so old that um it's using this old deprecated desktop editor i look quite different there but yeah i should revisit prim's algorithm um um as something to look at through for this as well um but i just i never occurred to me to render with curve vertex um the path through a graph space so this is quite nice all right all right so i need to take a break so uh it's time for me to um thank today's sponsor um curiosity stream i have something fun that i'm gonna try so um just give me a second here i gotta pull this up um so i have a wonderful little 30 second spot uh from curio oh wait hold on a sec oh let's see here oh i messed i messed up um well this is not the sponsor segment yet because i'm totally having a technical issue how do i uh studio mode i need to do something real quick uh and then welcome it's not oh yeah why all right this is gonna play for a second okay hold on now we're gonna come back out of studio mode and we're gonna go here welcome to no not here not here not here where am i back to here no here here okay i'm really excited about this sorry um so i have this the sponsor today is curiosity stream and i'll talk a bit about curiosity stream right now um and you can go check out curiosity's stream at curiositystream.com codingtrain the discount by the way is for today and tomorrow only for 41 then it will revert back to i think the usual 26 but um i have a quick um ad i want to play and um last week when i played this 30 second spot um the i got a content id claim on the live stream so just from the audio so i am going to um narrate it i i wrote down the script and i will be the voice of the spot now this is very exciting here we go from the founder of the discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service curiosity stream home of groundbreaking documentaries an awardwinning original series follow your curiosity this is curiosity stream okay um coming back to me here all right i don't know that might have been a total total fail there but i'm excited to tell you about curiosity stream so i i've talked about this before i'm part of a group of educational creators that teamed up to build a platform where creators don't have to worry about demonetization or the youtube algorithm and it's called nebula um we're partnering with curiositystream um nebula has adfree content and experiments with different and experiments with different kinds of content so if you've never seen um nebula i'm going to just open up the page here nebula is a streaming service that's owned and operated by a group of creators they have nebula originals which are not available on youtube there's even nebula plus now that a lot of creators are doing with extended cuts and extra footage um and so um there's a nebula originals like tom scott money um and so now why am i why why is the sponsor curiosity stream but i'm talking about this streaming service called nebula well the reason is um curiosity stream loves educational creators and supporting more educational content so nebula worked out a deal where if you sign up with this coding train link that's at the top of the screen not only do you get access to curiosity stream but you also get nebula for free so this is not a trial this you're going to have this forever as long as you're a curiosity stream member so for a limited time actually today and tomorrow only curiosity stream is offering 41 off their annual plan that's less than 12 if my math is right per year for both curiosity extreme and nebula right it's the best deal in streaming that's the entire year it's like one dollar a month i think if i'm doing the math correctly um so uh you know a curiosity stream just to um open it up for a second here i'm just going to bring up the website so you can see sort of a range there's thousands of documentaries there you go um and um you can this weekend only get the 40 off you can see you can't see it because i have the banner up there um and now you can see it there get 40 off um through the link curacao stream dot com slash coding train um it's a great way to support um my channel coding train and educational content for a whole year um since you know these days a lot of us are staying inside a lot more than usual you might as well be soothed by david attenborough's voice or watch chris hadfield in the space station or just watch tom scott torture your favorite youtubers on nebula the recommendation that i would give is dr hannah fry has a wonderful documentary series about maths on curiosity stream that i've been following and watching it's a really excellent i'm a huge fan of hannah fry so um that is something one that i would particularly recommend so click on the link in the description it's pinned in the chat um and i hope you check it out i'm going to take a short break if you want to go poke around and look at it right now maybe sign up and then i'll be back in two or three minutes to look at seeing if i can take my example and bring it over to see if i can render it from node we'll see if that works okay i'll be back in just a few minutes do do so do do do all right i'm back here let me so people were asking in the chat um who i was talking about so this is the series that i was watching um it's a series called magic numbers and this particular episode um dr hannah fry uh goes down to zip wire to learn more about newton's ideas on gravity so highly related to the i was watching this one in particular because it's related to the nature of code so i just wanted to like highlight that again thank you to curiositystream for your sponsorship you can get it once again this weekend only for the whole year at 41 off plus you get nebula too okay um returning back to what i am here to do which is some coding stuff um let me close all these windows and get to here so this is my p5 sketch and what i would like to make happen is if i'm in discord i want to do something like type a command exclamation point generate and then i want to see come back to me a um an image that i generated obviously so so this is what and i've done this before and i know how to do this not with discord but i've done a series about doing this with a twitter bot to have a twitter bot generate a random walk image for example one one per hour and um the way that i did that is by running processing behind the scenes but it's quite tricky um to deploy processing generically to any sort of server environment it's got to have java you often have to set up a bunch of weird settings to like have it run in headless mode with no like windowing system so i would really like to look into and i know this is other people have looked into this and maybe i'm just missing like the post on the processing forum that explains how to do this precisely but i would like to look into um how to do this and so i think what i i think a way to do this would be with node canvas so this particular package is it is this actively it's from automatic industry interesting is this actively maintained i think chromium might be another way to do this um some kind of chromiumlike thing um oh do i have to like install or to all sorts of extra weird things i can just say npm.install can oh i don't need to compile it okay build from source if you don't have supported os or processor architecture so what's supported hopefully whatever i use would be supported and then i can make a canvas and draw to it all right let's just try this the question is could i then once i do that could i use p5 anybody have any ideas of something else i should try um okay so let's i'm gonna start just a new node project i will you know i don't know that i'll get to integrating this with the discord bot today um this by the way where where is this coming from this is all part of my project to generate to give everybody in the world or at least one million people in the world their own random number from this book that is then paired with a custom random walk design using the sequence of numbers in this book starting with their number and then have that etched onto a train whistle what's gonna happen this is what my life has become all right so do i want to install let's just remind me later about this let's go to uh the desktop and let's make a directory node cam let's just call this uh um walk generate walker generate bot i don't know let's go yeah sure generate bot uh and let's do uh make this a node project and open this up in visual studio code and uh make a file what is going on here new file no why is this not safe i'm just gonna do something really weird here just ignore me okay um so then let's just try npm install canvas let me look at the documentation here npm install canvas oops not here my sit am i sitting in front of the code i might be what oh all right let's see what happens this might take a while if it's got to install some weird um dependencies all right hold on i'm getting fun playing oh discord.js.guide has a neat guide on how to install canvas okay that's good for me to look at uh whoops um discord.js guide canvas oh interesting interesting so this is definitely what i want to do uh basic image loading canvas oh this is great to see thank you this is super useful for me so this is good okay awesome um you know i could just do this with native canvas i'm just using stroke and curve vertex so i don't necessarily need i would like to have p5 but i think that i can get by without it um so let's let's go here and let's just try this example for a second so i don't want this example exactly so i don't want load image i'm not going to do that i'm going to create a canvas 200 200 and get a context that's 2d um let's write on this is fine let's draw a line under the text sure let's skip the image so if i just run this right now and let me make this somewhere where you can see it okay it ran so how would i use this oh so i want it's gonna save this to a file but i guess what i can do is i can do canvas to buffer and send it as a message attachment but what if i just wanna before i add the discord bot i want to just like look and see what i've got so how do i node canvas save image how to create and save an image with node.js and canvas uh install canvas get the context fill the rectangle all this stuff okay hey i know how to draw to it right buffer to buffer right for oh oh how easy oh this is this is going to actually be much easier than i thought i mean without minus the part that i don't have access to p5 there's got to be a way that i could easily use the p5 functions though i could use p5 as a node module um i'm getting that comment um i will see if i can do that um the question is will that be compatible with this i guess maybe if i use instance mode with p5 so um let's try this okay oh i need to um require fs oh this is going to be good for whenever i eventually remake those twitter bot videos all right awesome okay amazing so now the issue is make my own random walk design here the thing is what i'm doing is very little in terms of drawing so let's just let's not worry about p5 right now let me see if i can make this work and i'll i'll figure out coming back to p5 later um i am going to go to my i mean should i do i suppose i mean the idea was to try to like keep this weird algorithm pattern thingy this seems like a little bit much to do right now let's just try to get this to work with a regular random walk so um like where uh random i have that random whistle project um which i think could be a good place to start i'll just grab that code um which does this all right this is very silly what i'm doing but the point is anything can go here i'm just gonna do a random walk so i need to i need to learn uh html5 canvas so to do can uh fill rectangle uh canvas fillrect method oh i hate w3schools i don't know why it just it makes me crazy that uh so let's go here fill rectangle x y width height okay so this should be um context fill rectangle 0 0 200 200 so let's let's make a variable with let's put these here so how do i set the color examples fill style equals green okay so i can do this fill style equals black let's comment all this out and let's see if this works all right do i have great okay great there's our png excellent now i'm going to make a variable x and y with divided by two height divided by two oh okay i'm gonna have to work on my random number generator let's not worry about the random seed right now um and i'm saying context fill oh that's the wait a second here oh because it's white i i forgot that that's how i designed it a white background and then fill style equals black let's see and then and i would say context oops fill rectangle x y step size step size okay then stroke weight all right let's skip that no stroke weight random okay so then i need to say math math.random times 4 and floor math.4 with that that would be without p5 move x and y and let's see do is this is this right let's try running this okay look at that is that my random walk i think so but um what was the dimensions i'm using in the random whistle project because the dimensions are specifically related to yeah um let's do this this is a little bit silly but let's uh i mean why not make it high resolution all right let's see what happens now so i made random nodes there we go look at that i generated that with node cool and this is what's going to get etched onto the whistle um so now i just need to add this to the discord bot i'm just looking at the chat here um all right okay so now oh boy can i really make this i've got oh i've got a half an hour here i think i can make this into a discord bot so we got to go to the coding train discord bot uh discord bot choo choo oh and i'm in this number database branch oh and i forgot that someone help okay so let's go to a new branch uh so i'm gonna go back to maine uh random generator and i don't know if david or kobe or somebody who's a moderator in discord can lock down the um bot testing channel again but that might be nice and i am going to go on to glitch where i have this deployed um choo choo bot discord and i'm going to turn it off on discord there really needs to be a button on discord i'm not on glitch to just disable an app but as those of you who've watched the way i disable it it's just by commenting it out um so let's head on over to uh discord and i'm gonna uh throw caution to the wind here and go to this bot testing channel i don't think i don't know if we have any discord moderators who are actually like actively paying attention right now so let me see if i can do this i'm going to move over to here um and let's see if i can do this i just want to go to bot testing and i'm just checking and people are typing in there so let's do edit channel permissions everyone does not have the ability to send messages anymore okay so i think um i think we are good to go oh nico is typing maybe because you're a station manager um should be oh nico did it should be locked now okay um let's just okay let me reenable the bot make sure it still works okay all right i'm coming back to uh there all right so here we go so i'm on decoding train discord i am in the bot testing channel and if i say the two commands that are active as i say choo choo i get a message back and if i say gif i give it a keyword i get a gif back okay so now the next step that i need to do is disable the bot on glitch run it here and hopefully it's working now i'm gonna make sure it's still working uh gif okay so it's still working and i assume it came from here i guess i don't have any console logging going on all right um so now i need to install i need to get this going here so where where am i here uh let's go back let's um oh npm install canvas oh no i need to give make it a brand get branch uh image generator image generation get checkout image generation okay now i will uh npm install canvas right so i want a new command oh i need to open up this all right so this is this is all in preparation of me eventually adding this to my discord bot tutorials so i'm just going to sort of work it out now i want to add a command which will be called oh no okay in commands we'll add a command called generate.js and let's just go to chuchu.js and copy that in here and i'm just always going to say reply generate so now where in commands.js i need to add generate and add a require so i should have a new command here just called generate and let's see oops and this is called generate is that like okay yeah all right so i hopefully now if i run the bot and let me let me just run nodemon so it just restarts okay so i'm running the bot now locally on this laptop and if i type in here choo choo i get my message back interesting is it running in two places i'm running it in two places i'm running it in two places cancel that one i got two messages back now let me type generate uh why didn't i see a reply oh i got an error at least i got an error what did i miss replies is not defined well didn't i have replies in there still oh i forgot that this is here okay great so this is good oh no no no i forgot that i have nodemon going so restart it automatically that's weird oh was it not running yay okay so that works so now i believe this is really as easy as let me get my all of this code and i'm going to write a function generate image and then instead of writing it to a file i'm going to say return buffer and then here there was that discord guide attachment so i think i should be able to just do this now attachment is okay so let's say constant buffer equals generate image and let's put this stuff at the top and i actually don't need the file system i'm not going to save it to a file that's an interesting idea so constant buffer equals generate image then create a new message attachment with that buffer and call it uh random walk walk.png then say here is your random walk what's member is that like the person's name um you know what i'm not going to bother with that um send an attachment sen oh yeah and i need to say message.channel send what is the chance that this actually just works restarted typing generate well i got an error discord is not defined at generate.js line six new discord message attachment so what am i missing here in terms of the require i need to require discord.js okay very reasonable um let's try that this is gonna be really exciting if this works oh my god oh is it is it ready okay basically got it oh as you know viewers watching you want to bring me a cat uh this is greta she's about to appear in front of the camera she didn't auto focus on her she was very blurry i'm being brought a cat uh this is greta oh my god she is really attached to me right now oh okay okay okay here let's let's bring her a little closer um hello grandpa she is my valentine you are my valentine she's a very very very uh patient and tolerant kitty cat so as you as i've mentioned before my kids take a baking class on saturdays between 1 and 3 p.m what did you make today chocolate truffles that sounds good and they're ready so i have to go downstairs to eat the chocolate truffles i will be down in 15 minutes um coming back to over here this is amazing that this worked um i am very excited to demonstrate this to my nature of code class so now what needs to happen is that any member well all right so there's i i what's next here i don't know how to even like proceed with this um i just like blowing my mind that this is now possible and it was so much easier than i imagined or it could it would be much easier if i could make this work with p5 so how hard would that be this is a great start so first let me just commit this um so let me just add basic uh canvas image generation i can't believe how i'm just like for some reason in my head this was going to be kind of like basically impossible to do um and this was much easier than i thought um okay so now let me get push origin image generation so this is i don't want to deploy this yet because i have to think about more how this is going to work but um so generate random walk pattern uh this branch is where i am working on the random walk pattern that will be generated according to the uh um members assigned random number oh god what what am i doing all right so that's there i'm gonna leave that there for right now i'm not gonna merge it what is it that i want to do i wanna see if i can get this to work with p5 because i would really like to be able to make examples that are direct ports of my p5 stuff so people are telling me that i can just do that p5 is available as a node module so this is the actual p5 official p5 yes project and i can npm install it but can i work with it in node um well let's just see what happens uh well let's try npm install p5 now if i were to say well i should go back to you know what i should go back to my other test let's go back to this test here so i'm going to go out of the discord bot code and just go right to this um let me move this over so it doesn't cover any of the code let me go let me let me try it with this so bear with me i got 10 more minutes here um generate bot okay so this is i now have p5 installed then i can say const p5 equals require p5 console.log so i definitely need to use instance mode but how do i tie p5 to create canvas's require canvas can i assign can i create the canvas with node canvas and then use the p5 functions to operate on it how would i do though uh oh we have a new member perfect timing i've been really plugging the membership stuff but wrong wrong button wrong button welcome shop i don't even know if you're somebody who's watching right now you might just be some random person oh no chef is watching you have just joined the coding train which means you will now have your very own random number assigned from this book 1485 that is row 6215 on page 125 column three okay um so how all right let what if i i mean there is somebody made let's look at this node p5 no no no no canvas no this is um canvas p5 node i've seen this is it p5 node this okay it's this that i'm looking for but it hasn't been updated in a while so how does this work basically oh it's the whole p5 library but it's requiring some other canvasy thing um got to be a way for me to do this does anybody know and nico's asking about the mongoose pete pull request i will i will uh attend to that before i sign off today um the question is all right well what happens when i just console log p5 the whole thing is there right this is ridiculous what i'm about to do but no window is not defined ah okay just by requiring it so how do i replace window is p5 this can i override it i just get an error just from requiring it this is bad all right what if i um let's see what's that error message does anybody encounter this window is not defined okay no.js okay so could i create like if i were to say this is silly but if i were to say like const window equals fake window and now run it i mean obviously i need to put something real there i i still get not defined let's get rid of this hold on window is not defined at p5 node modules p5 lib 5 min min there's no way i'm going to find out where that is this is this is where all all all fails so this might be a prompt to viewers um say global.window is that how i would do it oh like do i just need to do like global.window is that how you do things in i just wanted to like show up as not not defined obviously ah yes cannot create property request animation frame on string fake window no problem okay i just gotta like hand it this other canvas somehow global.window uh equals make it an object can i do that cannot read property now of undefined like is that another like global variable it's looking for property now of undefined so what's the property it's looking for okay at constance um color never uh yeah i have to make a face so this is this is going to be a harder problem it's one that i'm not going to solve right now so i would love i'm going to i'm going to post this as a project so let me um let me comment this out how to make p5 work with the canvas from node canvas um i got a to do and also a clue is probably in this p5 node module but no no node p5 this this has not been maintained but a clue is probably in here but the issue with this that i have is that it looks like to me it is rewrite not prefix preload to work yeah i want to be able to make this work by pulling the actual p5 library and then just adding some stuff onto it i think this actually has the whole p5 library in it so it doesn't really help it might be good enough right now but it's not going to be able to stay in line as p5 changes jsdom oh it is usually used to test browser things in node okay right fake a fake window um yeah so i'm looking at the comments is super helpful so i wanted to try to avoid making a fake window but that's also a perfectly fine option i'm gonna just put this aside right now i'm going to say npm init and not npm in it uh git init uh um hold on let's go to github.com codingtrain let's make this a repo that people could play with um new repo um under coding train this is uh node node p p5 test uh public um skip this step i am skipping this step and then i need to do this um i don't know what i'm doing ah i no no no oh that was so bad i forgot that i need to get ignore um so hold on let me let me get rid of this get repo no nope nope nope nope what's the key command to see hidden files on a mac no there we go delete that um let's make a uh very quickly dot get ignore with all the node modules does that say git ignore it does say git ignore get init then git add okay git add everything yeah okay git commit oops git commit testing node canvas with p5 then this is what i'm remembering get branch main okay then get remote at origin and get push ordermate okay so if you want to play around with this right now it is here oh i didn't make a readme um this is terrible what i'm doing i'm just going to do that and i will post this project into here so if anybody wants to explore this and comes up with a solution that might be useful for me please our suggestions please add it to if you have suggestions or ideas please add them to the issues uh here and certainly if you have uh if you get it to work and want to um post a solution through a pull request that is welcome as well and now um let me what was the last thing i want to do let's look at nico's um um this is the last thing that i'm gonna do here before i say sign off for the day uh random whistle is that what i was looking for no the discord bot um so the current the discord bot at present the way that i implemented it if i go to the new command oh oh i have to be in the in the branch that is the number db branch i added a new um i added a number a connection to a database and then nothing really i don't really do anything here um i'm just right i didn't actually implement anything okay so i just implemented the client and then i heard from people that i should be using uh mongoose which i still don't understand what that is so there is a wonderful pull request here from grueselhouse for using mongoose and what is mongoose because my understanding was that this was going to make it simpler object or mongoose is an object data modeling library for mongodb it manages relationships between data provides schema validation is used to translate between objects and code and the represent representation of these those objects in mongodb okay so that makes sense to me in the sense that uh i i'm not i'm thinking about the database as just a place to store objects that i would have in my code to sort of save state and then come back to it so that makes sense um jawwad is asking about discord here's the uh okay so so but when i looked at the pull request if i'm being honest it made it look like oh this is confusing to me it seems to be adding a lot of extra stuff and that's what i was kind of trying to avoid but let's take a look at the new code so this here is um there's some other stuff being added all right okay so instead of so this is good instead of this goofy numbersdb connection the numbers database in this particular collection i'm looking at a model so i guess what is a model a mongoose model is a wrapper on the mongoose schema a mongoose schema defines the structure of the document values among interface of the database for creating querying updating so that sounds good i think i like this okay um all right so this makes sense and this i can oh mongoose js elegant mango okay so uh mongoose require mongoose oh i sort of think i'm understanding this now okay writing mongodb validation casting and business logic boilerplate is a drag that's why we wrote mongoose okay i'm starting to understand this now if i get a model of a cat then i can make a new cat with a name and save it to the database okay where's that pull request i was looking at um so this would be finding everything there's a number model and then if i want to save something i put a value in it so i think though i need oh oh like why do i need this whole extra database.js file it's time okay so i'm gonna look at this more this is what i wanted to avoid was having like this seemed like oh my god i'm adding all this extra stuff this whole extra javascript file it's loading models locally like um maybe this is only because and then i have this like number schema thing uh which seemed like a whole extra thing i'm doing so i have to look at this a little bit more but so is it true that i can eliminate this whole database.js file if i'm connecting to a mongodb in the cloud on atlas that's what i would like to do justin is reminding me that the kids are waiting and in fact they are you don't have another cat for me all right everybody so i'm going to investigate this more i'm going to have to um and um mongoose makes it easy to make no sql schema and retrieving the data so niko this is i just did it i wanted i want to be able to very easily what i imagine having in my tutorial is just like set up your mongodb online get the uri to it and then we have to learn something about what a mongoose model is and we can do safe safe save retrieve retrieve retrieve but this to me is there a way i can avoid this extra although maybe i maybe i shouldn't maybe i do want to have a manager and i need to make a whole video set about that that's my question here okay everybody it's been two hours thank you for joining me today in this live stream um if there's any last a few i'm going to let this is going to take me two minutes and 50 seconds to say goodbye here as i play this uh goodbye song i'm going to turn that music down um i am also just going to do a last thank you and reminder about today's sponsor curiosity stream slash coding train uh please check that out um only today and tomorrow 41 off the entire year subscription plus you get nebulous food for free um the channel asks do you still teach at nyu i do i definitely do and if you want to follow along what i'm kind of focusing on i've kind of got way off track here um uh check out the nature of code syllabus spring 21 um i am currently in the semester working on this particular week so this is the stuff that's active on recording new videos uh glenn says goodbye and thanks for the motivation i appreciate that very kind of you i'm glad that this is motivating oh finished with my uh do a video with cj i would love to do another video with cj again as well thank you for that suggestion riz lots of waving um this is it's nice to spend my saturday afternoon so stay tuned what's coming out next many more threepoint x videos you should see the look on my daughter's face staring at me these puppy dog eyes opening wide sad face bye justin bye shreyas um i tend to be streaming on next saturday there will not be a live stream for sure um because i have another commitment on next saturday so i don't know when my next live stream but it has been recently on saturdays between 1 and 3 p.m it will definitely not be next saturday so hopefully there'll be another one is there another saturday in february after next week that'll be probably the last one i should also i should be doing the baking class right i should be doing the baking class not live streaming during your baking class would you agree with that there's a big nodding of a yes there uh gloria pickle um angel angela bell asked can we see your dog gloria pickle is not available she's not up here um i can pull up a picture of her probably but um but she's not available do a discord bot with some sort of front end um mini jimmy is programming pinball this afternoon thanks everybody i have to say goodbye now i will see you next week or not next week but stay tuned for all the videos that are coming out write things in the comments i really like reading them share your projects that you're making i really like seeing them and see you next time on the coding train goodbye everybody as always i always forget that this stock this stock is this dot this stuff i'm going to do this this star this dot this dot this dot song never forget the this dot i'm going to say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me cartesian coordinates unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids and kittens and kittens kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens bye everybody have a good weekend
