Dan is on a train and forgot to bring his mic today's prompt is lava lamp one way to simulate a lava lamp is with metab balls a pixelbased approach is demonstrated in coding challenge 28 it's quite computationally expensive a geometry based alternative is marching squares a technique that generates Contours for 2D Fields here's a quick overview of the algorithm itself marching squares operate on a grid where the corners of each cell are assigned a numerical value like Z or one you can assign them randomly across a full grid There are 16 possible configurations for each one a line is formed between midpoints based on these Corner values instead of pling random the values can be generated with noise or for metab balls distance to an array of circles since these are floating Point values you can interpolate them
