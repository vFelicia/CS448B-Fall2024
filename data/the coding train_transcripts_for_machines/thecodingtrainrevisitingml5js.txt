so so foreign so so so so so test one two you people can hear me oh that is so strange wow is my audio on because the mic is muted is it this mic no test one two i'm talking directly into the mic this is so strange i can't figure it out huh all right hold on okay the music is off wow the laptop this mic this computer's mic is on hold on we did it no wait no this is so strange hold up now now you hear me okay hold on i i gotta start the stream here to figure this out good morning the music is off i know i turned it off i gotta turn the camera on me let's see if i can make that happen hold on a sec i have to blow my nose which i would normally mute myself for but i have no way of doing that am i further away from the mic i must be further away can you hear me going further away from the mic i do not understand um all right hold on let's get the camera on me hello good morning oh no i just filled a bottle of water welcome to the clothing train where i stole water on my laptop look everything's unplugged oh my god okay now can you hear me you can still hear me this makes no sense this makes no sense hold on is this the microphone i know how to mute it because i see the audio input but i have to put my mask back on because i i am here if i just leave the room will you still be able to hear me i have to go get some paper towels i'll be right back i can't play music i can't do anything just look at the coding train scene is very little water actually got on the laptop it mostly got on this uh cable and dongle not the mic what light could it be all right we're gonna figure this out but first i'm gonna get some paper towels i will be right back so so okay i'm gonna wipe this up here actually i also have this magic green rag it's my invisibility cloak i will also use to wipe this up then let's have a look here at the computer it's just a little bit of like a little splash on the keyboard i think it's fine we'll find out soon enough whoa what just happened there oh this camera went on that's particularly weird why is this camera on this is going super well so far okay i think i know i mean i don't really know but let me take a look here so first um the sound is great so why change it does it actually sound good it doesn't make any sense this is my microphone good morning by the way what you're actually watching is a sneak preview of what you get to watch if you become a member of the coding train because i actually do usually these friday sessions just with the members and i record uh video tutorials that later get released for example um the last week i did one on github pages and that's going to come out this weekend um since i can't live stream tomorrow from my my usual saturday live stream i thought i would open this one up to the community today it's the camera mic is this much louder now all of a sudden me talking showing you my like be like i need to like do some trimming here and get some like shaving things going on is it is it the camera mic oh this mic is it this my oh it's this mic okay hold on uh that is so strange where is this plugged into i don't need this i'm not using this camera i'm gonna unplug this okay i'm going to mute the audio so in case it makes a horrible sound no it's not this mic it's the other camera mic okay so strange oh i know what it is i got it i got it i got it without it i got it yes okay the audio source on obs okay mystery solved now i'm talking into this mic the audio should be better uh this doesn't need to be viewable and also now but why so when the music was playing was the music really sort of like faint and poor quality because it was actually just coming out of my laptop speakers and oh my god um this whole stream might end up getting shut down any moment if like my laptop doesn't work or if something terrible happens yeah it's whoops it's been long enough that a little bit of water is now no long dried from whatever dripped onto the end of this dongle so i think we should be okay okay now audio being quieter is easily fixable because i can just move the volume up now that should be better is this laptop going to come alive oh it's not it's not plugged into power the power did not and you know what i just realized what i should do let me plug in on the other side of the laptop just in case i really need this coffee here much clearer but could be a bit louder okay that's no problem all of that is manageable okay let me uh 9 10 a.m that was very recent so let's let's go into the settings here and we'll make it a little bit louder whoops settings here sensitivity uh this should make it louder no that makes it quieter i think now it should be a little bit louder and even a little bit louder still and there's even a dial here i can turn up so maybe this is better now oh boy okay uh i'm not going to worry about the music right now come back to that uh let's see if uh the laptop is viewable by you there we go we are here oh oh and hold on if you will humor me for again one moment please i will be right back again i'm in a hermetically sealed room but if i leave this room um i must wear my mask and uh which i'm going to do right now i'm going to go into the room next door where my backpack is and get something be right back you can probably still hear me um and now at 9 12 a.m eastern time live from brooklyn new york it is officially the coding train i don't have the belt i managed to remember to throw this train whistle into my backpack this morning so where am i what's going on what's happening um i am uh here at new york university uh where i uh in uh about 100 years ago i used to spend you know at least 75 a large percentage of my waking hours um i work at a program um called itp and ima the statistical of the arts nyu um i have i have been here for the last week um in and out but i hadn't been here since march when uh the covet pandemic really uh reared its head in new york city i've been doing live streaming from home that's my new and actually that's not going away my new system is actually to do side project saturdays um inside project saturdays are a twohour live stream that happens from home last week i worked on uh programming an arduino inside of simone yetch's everyday calendar you can go back and check that live stream those are typically sponsored so i'll often have a sponsor for those um and will happen from home and are informal and hopefully fun and educational and i have all my equipment there um i use this room to record video tutorials for my nyu courses which i also release to the public on the youtube channel um and those my system for that is i'm not monetizing those and i've i'm trying to clean all this up and get sort of organized but those are video tutorials that hopefully anybody can use and access they're all captioned for your curriculum for your enjoyment um and i even i'm i'm open to offering those outside of youtube for any schools or organizations that can't get the content through the youtube platform so um so that's kind of the deal with my fault that's the sort of new schedule i've adopted and to help um sort of keep me going frankly uh you know moral support financial support all those kinds of things um the membership program which you can sign up directly on youtube with join i bro i broadcast the friday recording sessions to the members as um and that's kind of what i would normally be doing today but with the yom kippur holiday this weekend i'm not available i have some family commitments and i'm not available to live stream on saturday so there will be no live stream tomorrow and instead there is today's members and and i i probably shouldn't like talk about this plan in such detail because every time i ever made a plan it lasted about two weeks and then i ended up just doing something different so we'll see if this care this is what i'm hoping will carry me forward through uh at least until december um uh you know assuming that i have access and safe access to this building it's very empty in here um and i actually am tested uh nyu somebody was telling me is like one of the largest testing providers in the country but uh i just had a test a couple days ago and i had tests two weeks ago they're testing us every two weeks so um i'm just looking at the chat here we've got uh chatanya uh um and and sanjeev tandon who's 13 years old and makes many games from tictactoe sanjeev i i got confused looking at your name because the school here the nyu school of engineering is called the tandon school of engineering and that i got kind of confused all right so just to be clear though all of the content then record to disk i'm not yes thank you all the i don't need to do it yet um all of the content that i record on fridays uh will be released and you will be able to see it even if you're not a member um it just will you'll be able to see it a week later or so depending on how long it takes to kind of get that out all right now i only have till 11 a.m this morning because uh half day the school where my children go in here in brooklyn um has half days on fridays which by the way a half day ends at 11 30 a.m that's not that's like me having my breakfast and checking my email but instead i'm here with you and i've just turned on all my equipment and i'm live streaming but i gotta just jump in i wanted to acknowledge something i want to work with the ml5 library today and i wanted to um acknowledge some of the work that uh in particular several uh processing foundation ml5 fellows worked on over the summer and that that unoriginal pun that recorded disk reminder i want it again in just like a few minutes so i don't need to record this part to disk yet although you know what let me start recording to disk so i can double check to make sure the recording is working so um and i see more messages into the chat you know unfortunately i'm not really i kind of respond and check out the chat randomly so um i appreciate your messages there the best place to engage with the community is the discord i think do i still have that discord button no this is a different i don't have my my just i only have this tiny stream deck that has uh 15 buttons i have the one at home has like 34 or something okay last sorry i'm setting up the record to disk hopefully i'm seeing all my presets and i'm hitting and so now i'm recording to disk i will check those files in a little bit um so unfortunately i don't get your question i would appreciate if you didn't post it multiple times because that kind of makes the chat harder for other people to engage with know that there are some moderators and they'll they can record your question and if you join the discord hopefully somebody can post the link to the discord that's another place to engage with the community and get advice there so um but there's something else i wanted to say that was reminding me i was recording to disk i was looking at that oh well i'll just never mind let me go uh let me go to where i meant to go so i'm going to go to processing foundation medium let's look under fellowships and i wanted to highlight there's a lot of things to highlight here of course but i specifically since i'm going to work with ml5 today i wanted to highlight the work of fellows emily martinez who is working on a project with an ml5 community starter kit um i want to look at bomani's work which i definitely have referenced making ml5.js accessible bomani is one of the sort of lead maintainers of the github repos um so check out his amazing work his own artworks as well in addition to his open source work but what was uh um mentioned to me was to highlight was um andreas refsgard work because there's some i'm going to try to create a sort of goofy ml5.js demo today and that's the project that um uh a that andreas worked on over the summer so this is teddy rhymes with steady one of the examples combines image classification from ml5.js with the rhyming algorithm in rita.js that is awesome i got to show this to my class uh so um check out this work i i would love to sort of click through and play with these but i as you know if you've ever watched me before i get really distracted and i ah that's what i was saying about half day friday is only until 11 because i gotta go pick her up um and i i like i have to leave you know when i say 11 like if i'm here until 11 15 i'm like fine but uh 11 is when i need to be wrapping up and starting to say goodbye okay so keep help me that um oh no so we need a video i need to work on my pronunciation of andreas refsgard which is how i always say it which i'm sure is incorrect i'm really working on christian vekman no question question shoot i had it down the other day and then simone yetch i've been like that that one i've been pronouncing simone has a whole video about how to pronounce her name i like by the way that people were like on the internet were like oh it's so great that my two favorite youtubers know each other i'm like well actually we have net in person we did this like brief panel thing at the thinkercon thing but we i mean we're not i mean uh that what i did was just like an unofficial like i'm just playing around with the um uh uh everyday calendar which i which i'm hoping to do more of but i can't do that today because i don't have it with me all right and all right thank you to oh boy a uh a name that is written in cyrillic who is a number one fan thank you for the super chat uh that is very kind of you um and i don't have any of my i don't have my sound board all i have is the train whistle i was able to get that and bring it from home so i'll blow a train whistle for you um but i'm going to move on all right so i think what i need to do here to figure out what i'm going to do is the following um i don't know if i'm logged in on twitter or what nope here we go this is what i'm looking for all right so this is what i'm hoping to build today and i suppose if you would now if you wouldn't mind um just giving me a minute to check that my record to disk is working um and i normally i would actually let's and also why not figure out if i can figure out the sound thing so in theory if i play this you can hear it through this mic and i should be able to pipe it out via loopback what's this no that's terminal right so this is what i'm doing by the way i'm picking up the audio from the finder and i'm sending it out via the speakers which i could turn off but i'm also sending it to pro capture that's the capture card on the streaming computer so let's turn this off for a second so we know it's not going through my any mic in the room and now i just want to see if i can figure out which input that is in the obs properties for you to hear the music zero i thought it was o2 no oh that's whoops what just happened cancel oh laptop audio sorry that's what i'm doing uh properties um audio one audio two okay that's it now but that's what i had i thought so now you hear the you hear the audio you hear the music correct but if i mute my mic do you still hear me you still hear me it's like combined it's picking up multiple feeds that is crazy all right i i can't deal with this right now we're just not going to worry about it okay i i'm i'm not going to get my laptop audio today and i'm not going to worry about it i don't know why obs is picking up both i guess the capture card it has multiple inputs into it and they're being combined somehow it's just not worth worrying about okay so let me get everything that i want to do more where's teachable machine here it is digital machine and let me just make sure i want to make sure this code example still works this is a code example that's doing image classes funny i trained it on this train whistle it's a good thing i have it with me today and did i mirror that if i flipped the image no let me just fix that um because that's sort of important for me to do so i'm just getting myself ready ml5 teachable machine image model i think this one has the flip video code in it yep so i need flipped video and then i need flip image there and then whenever i classify i flip the image here's the classify function and i assume i classify the flipped video and then i can just draw the flipped video also let's see if this works oh shoot um boo preload flipped video oh wait a second no that's the same i mean i could just use this example as my basis why don't i just use this example as my basis because this i'm just going to use this example i don't need my fancier one because i want to code this stuff anyway so let's just use this example to make sure it's working and let's also go here and i think this is how you do css no i don't know there we go okay okay this is working oh great okay and all right everybody record to disk let me check the recording i'm gonna look has it been a half an hour because it makes a new file once it's a half an hour um and what's today's date the 25th uh no i have i started at 9 18. so i'm going to stop the recording and restart it just to check the files i'm going to do that real quick stop multicorder and then let me look at one of the files just to see if it's stuttering i need to see some place where i'm moving around a lot i see your audio in it and it doesn't look like i'm it's stuttering okay so i think the recording to disc you know i just have to say my recording to disc prayer and um here we go oh did i forget like yeah thank you i guess i need that and all right all right everyone i don't know what the pink artifacts are but i'm hoping what i'm about to do will be accomplishable in about one hour um and oh let me log out log in great still working i am ready to go okay uh i did i start recording again after i checked it yes thank you for asking that question that is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me worst case uh you know first of all i'm trying one of the things that i really want to avoid doing is the live streaming then reediting the live stream for a separate upload so that's why i'm kind of separating the friday and saturday but today i'm going back to my old ways but worst case scenario if the record to disk stuff doesn't really work i'm making this project we're doing it it's this live stream will be archived forever i don't necessarily need an edited version that gets released it's a coding challenge but let's see if i can make that happen and here we go pink noise all over the place can somebody in the uh discord chat tell me whether i can ignore these messages that are in the in the main chat um but probably it's like my keying is bad or something okay oh in the search bar oh yeah oh oh yeah why is that so guess what i am not seeing these on my laptop screen i am only seeing them in the output to obs which i can only which i can only surmise is due to the fact that this cable had water spilled on it i don't have another one but i do have a solution which is i can record to disk my um but let's see if unplugging it and plugging it back in fixes the issue that's still there weird hold on i'm looking really close i don't see it on my laptop screen um the sad thing is i could totally record my laptop screen separately but i was going to do something else specifically for recording my laptop screen for the later edited video but let's just because i need to i can't require it's going to use obs i guess i can use quick i can't record my lap it's going to be fun it's going to have to be fine is it always there or is it no it's actually in that doesn't make any sense that's really weird all right i definitely need to ignore this but i i you know i have a problem where like little tiny things drive me crazy um optimize for pro capture standard refresh rate that seems weird why is it why is it 59.88 um definitely don't want to change it to true tone it's funny that true tone got rid of it i think do i have a filter on in obs oh that's possible i have been mucking around with my obs settings let's just quickly oh i know another way i can check this my record to disk has a separate feed of the no it's there it's there in the separate it's not a it's not a filter in obs and it's much more apparent also oh this is driving me crazy everyone's telling me to ignore it but i it's making me crazy i let me have four minutes it's 9 30 eight i have to stop looking into this um oh yeah i was looking for displays that's what it's at 1080p 1080i no whoa much worse right what is going on so strange um what's confusing me is i swear when i just turned on is this like is this did that get rid of it that got rid of it right i don't know why but like there it is it's gone right so for whatever reason this pro capture color profile is doing something weird and then no no it's still there no it's gone did that fix it i can't it's so hard for me to tell it's gone okay just let me believe it's gone that's better anyway uh it's good now okay i'm gonna move on all right 9 30 oh i i took two more minutes i gave myself two more minutes sd170ma was better i don't believe you is that better all right let me double check to make sure there's no filter in obs but i'm kind of that's me that's the audio that's the laptop filters no filters on sd 170 whatever is better okay so i'm going to use that and hopefully this will be fine i'm just going to look at it in my record to disk software it's still like there faintly but whatever gotta move on gotta move on to two all right i'm gonna be using the whiteboard today people okay faintly there all right hi everyone no that's not a good way to start restart i don't think it's chrome i really don't think it's the chrome browser welcome to a coding challenge let's get ready to coding challenge 9 38 all right 9 38 here we go hello everyone and welcome to a coding challenge the first one since march of 2020 and what i am going to attempt to do today is make my own version of this project this is not my idea uh this came across my twitter desk the other day from cameron hunter who created a video lens that uses hand gestures to show comic book style messages instead in a video called you know i don't know if you noticed in this year of 2020 lots of stuff is happening but many of us including myself are spending a large amount of time in video calls and i want to see if i can figure out a way using the tools of p5.js ml5.js teachable machine and open broadcast studio and zoom as the video conference software of choice not sponsor you could use anyone that you want but i'm going to attempt to use zoom and see if i can create my own overlays that are controlled with my own gestures that's what's going to happen today i have not attempted this at any point in the past present or future so here we go so to be honest there's not going to be a tremendous amount of coding in this particular video there will be however a lot of like piecing together a lot of different parts of tools and software and things like that and i'm doing the thing where i'm allowing myself to to do stuff again which i shouldn't do because probably my recorded disc is failing and this is just to just be a thing that i'm making and there's not really going to be any editing i should put a timer on and give myself a certain amount of time i should just go for it to be honest there's probably not going to be a ton of coding in this although i will be writing code and mostly i'm going to be like plugging in this piece of software to this piece of software and this piece of software lots of connectors and tubes and cables and things but all um happening on the computer because i'm much too afraid to use that stuff in real physical life okay so let me talk through what the components are so what i'm going to have ultimately is a video feed where for example when i raise my hand and apparently i can't draw that's me raising my hand i might have a popup that says you know question a big popup so that the other people in the room can see that i'm raising my hand and i have a question so this is what i want so how am i going to get there so to do this i'm going to use a p5.js to connect to my camera and show my camera feed then i'm going to use a teachable machine to train a machine learning model to recognize my particular gestures so just as point out if you're you should be able to do this yourself at the end of this video and you won't even have to write any of your own code you could reuse my code but almost certainly well definitely you will need to train your own model so i'll talk about how to do that which you don't need to do any coding for machine learning model so once i have that and then i'm going to talk to the teachable machine model with ml5.js so all of these components will be running in a web browser this is all inside the web browser then i'm going to use a piece of software called obs or open broadcast studio it is the software i'm using right now to live stream to record to disk it is software that i use for making youtube videos but what i can do with obs one of the things i can do is i can capture everything that's in the browser so the browser is going to be sent into obs and then this picture blues diagram is terrible you will see in obs then from obs i'm going to start something called a virtual camera so i'm going to trick the computer into thinking that the open broadcast studio software is my webcam so when i log into a zoom meeting and there is a grid of people and this is me here i will select the obs virtual cam as my video input so instead of picking the default you know if i'm on a mac it's going to say like facetime camera i'm going to switch to obs virtual camera this is not the only way to do this as you can see uh in the project i reference where i got this idea from it's using something like snap lens studio something i'm sure there are countless other ways you could approach this but i never really thought this diagram was going to be helpful hopefully it's at least it's helping me sort of think through this um i i'm hoping this is going to work again i haven't tried this yet so remains to be seen all right let's do the first part train the model so i'm going to go to the teachable machine website now i could really if i wanted to just talk for the next like hour about what teachable machine is uh fortunately i'm not gonna do that and if you want to learn more about teachable machine i have three videos that i've already made about how to train a model and use it with p5 and you can do stuff with audio there's lots of stuff there google has a lot of resources it's a it's made by folks at the google creative lab um i'll include a lot of references in the video subscription of course to teachable machine i'm just going to click on to get started i want to do an image project because i want to train a model from my on me and i'm going to first create the first i'm just going to do i'm going to do like back i'm going to do background i'm going to call background being like me not doing anything just me just kind of sitting in the meeting like this trying to make eye contact with people over a computer through a web have you ever tried it doesn't work how do you make the eye contact where do i look i got to just look at myself which is weird but it's like that's what my eye is drawn to is that like that for you or is it just me am i weird i think i'm weird it's definitely weird and then the next uh category will be question so i want to click webcam and um you can see i've already installed by the way virt obs virtual camera on this computer so you can see this is like it's already available but that's not what i want right now i want the facetime camera and i just want to like record myself here what do i do in a meeting no i don't don't make any gestures okay so that's probably good enough and then i want to do the question um the question now will i what hand do i raise i have a question it's confusing because i want to i need to use my mouse i guess i'm going to be lefthanded for asking my questions i'm going to try to get about the same amount of samples like 238 okay and i'm going to train this model i get to take a little break here remember the don't switch tabs song i don't i don't know in my ukulele but i had it don't switch the tabs don't switch the tabs oh it trained okay so let's see if it's working background question background question so this is perfect so now i have a model trained it's very important i mean even though i talk about all this in the teachable machine videos and i'm trying not to do this now it's important for me to emphasize this is not doing any kind of gesture recognition this is pure image classification so it's not going to work if i gave this model to you and you're wearing a different shirt you have different hair you're not wearing glasses your background is different um so this is the kind of thing that every person would have to customize which i think is nice because you can make up your own gestures and different things and everybody moves in different ways and does different types of things gotta move on that's the song that's stuck in my head today uh all right so now export model and certainly i could download the model all this could be done locally without anything being anywhere in the cloud all of those images were not sent anywhere into the cloud you can with teachable machines save them the google drive but i do want to upload the model it's just going to make it very convenient for me to work with so i'm going to upload the model now i have the url right here which i'm going to click copy then i'm going to go over to the ml5 code example so let's call this zoom zoom annotations i don't know if that makes sense let's get rid of this just want to simplify this example it actually has some extra stuff in it that i don't need and let's run it so this is the example that comes with ml5 and it's just actually it's a pretrained model that is showing that has two categories daytime or night time so it's hard to make a model that people can universally test and use but this is one and now so now in theory if i were to go and paste the url remember where did i get that from right from here this shareable link of the model by the way you could go there right now and try it i don't know if anybody can manage to like get it into the chat who's watching right now i'm going to paste it in here my font is very small i've pasted it in and i'm going to run the example again what oh there's a mistake here ah okay so this this will hopefully be fixed by the time you watch this video i actually updated the examples it needs to also have uh added the to the end of the url i need to add plus model.json that's what ml5 is looking for that particular json file that holds the information about the model background question background question all right let's get at least a quick popup of a question mark to appear when i say i have a question i have an insane amount of all right okay um before i do that let me make a couple quick changes i want to just um make this a little bit bigger uh and then i want the uh i'm always going to have the video size match um the canvas size and then i actually don't want to draw the text label that's not something i'm doing um so let me just make sure this works still and we see it a little bit bigger so i should be able to say now if label equals question draw something else and i happen to have a thank you to jason heglund who is the coding trained illustrator makes all the characters um i think i have one of these that i can use let's try using this one so i should be able to upload a file and drag it here it's kind of like a weird name let me just rename this i'm just going to call it uh question.png and then in the sketch i want to say question and i'll preload that image question preload a question.png then let us try to say image question zero zero so i'm not really being thoughtful about this let's just see if it appears whoops what happened what preload no the function name is load image this is me trying to do stuff way too quickly making weird mistakes also my computer feels like it's dying here save i think this page froze ah let's try this again let's see if i can at least get something to appear okay come on people debugging time oh guess what folks i named my labels with a capital q capital first letter okay and by the way i really should uh check and see like what is the resolution of this image it is that's a little bit unnecessary for me right now let's fix that um let's just put this on the desktop we'll call this uh question dot png i want it to be like the character sitting on the bottom so let me adjust the size to 480 better then i'll reupload it better okay here we go again so one thing i really want to do which i feel like is important here is to kind of debounce this a little bit so i feel like if it's going to appear i don't want it to uh disappear immediately like i don't want it to flicker so i'm just going to always have it fade out so let me just i think i can use i mean i should make like an object there's all sorts of ways i could engineer this in a really thoughtful way but i am going to just do a i'm going to make a variable called fade out and set it equal to 255 and then whenever i detect a particular label i'll say fade out equals 255 and then and let me put this i'm just bear with me i'm gonna have to think about how to do this with multiple things but let me just get this to work right now fade out minus equals five let's make minus equal to ten um if fade out is less than zero i'll say fade out is greater than zero image question so and actually fade out should be zero so you know what this is this is why i need to like wrap these two things together into like an object or something but let's just have question fade be at zero and what i'm really doing is i'm setting question fade to 255 whenever i get that label and then i'm always fading it out and i'm only drawing it if i have a value greater than zero and just for efficiency's sake i'll also just fade it out when it's greater than zero so this should now um it should always it shouldn't like flicker like uh i didn't oh i i have to sorry i that's actually like just leaving it there it's actually going to fade it so i was going to say tint question fade which i i realized it actually is i debounced it just by not even having it fade but oh hello that tint applies to everything whoa that was weird i don't know why it is uh that's the way the image fades maybe somebody can can investigate that is that like a bug in p5 or is that actually how it's supposed to work do i need to do like oh maybe i need to do this so i'm definitely fading oh i'm just fading the brightness there we go that's what i was looking to do so that's i was i want the brightness to always be at 255 but i want to fade the alpha okay so now let's see if we can get this into a zoom meeting now obviously of course we could spend hours making like little animations and training different gestures and after i get it all working i want to spend a little time making a version of this with with some animations and different things but i just want to see if i can at least get this into a zoom meeting so the first thing i need to do is open up open broadcast studio so this is the website for obs studio it's open source it's free there are some like other companies who have made their own versions of obs that are maybe paid and different things but this is the one that i use i just use the free open source open broadcaster studio i guess it's broadcaster software who knows oh it's open broadcaster software studio i guess that is the correct way to say it um and um so i already have that on my computer i'm going to open it up when you open it up it should look blank just like this it's an empty window and i have been actually hoping to make some obs tutorials and i've just never gotten around to it so this that's not what this is going to be i'm just going to quickly show you a few steps to get this working but at some point i will maybe also create some tutorials for it all right so i have a scene that's what's down here i can make multiple scenes but i just want to use the default scene now i need a source so normally what i might do and just is i might say something like video capture device but i'm going to i'm thinking about this um ultimately what i probably want to do and i'll see if i can get this working later is select a video capture device i'm going to call this a webcam and i'm going to pick my webcam and have that be the sort of main element of the scene and then the other stuff would be an overlay over it which i think i have an idea of how to do but right now i'm just going to try to get the raw browser window into into this so it won't be pixel perfect in terms of resolution and everything but it'll be a start so let me i'm gonna i'm gonna take that out and delete it and i'm going to say is it window capture display capture i think it's window capture and i want to capture a p5 web editor and i think the best way for me to do this is to go to share and take the let's take the present mode and open a new window paste it in there i can even make it a little bigger just by zooming in let's make sure this is working oh did i not hit save shoot let me hit save and go back to this window and actually i just want to like do this because let's see if it's working great okay so now uh in obs i want to take chrome how come i don't see it here shouldn't i see one that says chrome like i don't want this oh there it is i don't know why i didn't see it before i want to take the one that says google chrome webcam image classification so i want to take that then i'm going to say ok then i'm going to use the option key to like just crop around the part that i want again this is silly there are some better ways that i could do this probably but i'm just going to crop around the part that i want and then i will stretch it out and it's the wrong aspect ratio so maybe i'll just like no how do i do this i'll just crop out some of the bottom i don't know let's just leave it like this we're going to work on the layout later and now i've got it in obs and whenever i raise my hand it's happening you can see the frame rate is really low i'm going to work on a way to fix this yeah um i'm going to see if that works i just didn't want to try that first there's some good suggestions in the chat about capturing the browser directly in obs but let's just leave this now the next thing that i want to do is start the obs virtual camera so that is an option i have right here under tools start virtual camera that is an option i have over here under tools i'm saying this again actually that's an option i have over here under tools start virtual camera the re that does not come by default with obs studio hopefully this is the one that i'm using but um so on the obs project forum there's a post called obs virtual camera 2.0.5 and this is what you can follow these instructions to install the virtual camera and i believe oh it definitely supports mac because i have it for mac is it a different one for mac let's just see yeah so um this one is actually the one for whoops this one is actually the one for windows so if you're on windows you can just run this particular installer that you can download from github let's see if we can find the mac one oh yeah and um and for mac there's this particular obs virtual cam that you can just download and run the installer right here and i'll include links to both of these for mac and windows in the video's description and somebody in the chat telling me there's a way to use v4l to sync on linux so i'll try to include some information for that as well so i'm going to do oh i already so i've started the virtual camera and now i need to go into a zoom meeting so time out for a second i'm going to use uh a link that i know that opens a test meeting it might be that this is exposed to those of you watching in which case uh i would ask you not to join the meeting or at least i'll try to like but if you do you're not you're not helping anybody you're just making this experience it's worse for me and everybody else so hopefully that won't happen um okay so i'm going to go um because i have a zoom account through nyu i'm going to nyu.zoom dot us slash test and this should open up a test meeting let's go into the meeting and i'm going to say join without video just for the moment yeah yeah yeah i think you're working okay so normally if i start my video um this is just me in the zoom meeting uh with this uh the video that's the webcam and now i should be able to go over here and change to obs virtual camera i forgot that i opened it up here and there we go here we go i'm in the zoom meeting hi everybody oh oh this is such a great discussion glass thingy me oh it's reversed oh you know what it is i think zoom is just showing it reversed for me right is um let's go into video settings oh because i've already flipped it oh yeah so when does anybody know this mirror my video oh touch up my appearance i definitely want to do that um does this mirror my video only mirror it for you to see yourself mirrored or does it actually mirror it for other people i don't know i don't know if anybody knows so because it's flipped because zoom is trying to make it a nice experience for me i'm going to uncheck this mirror my video and i've already mirrored it in my own software and now i have a question um all right um so i want to think about ways to improve this which i have some ideas about i'm told the pink noise is back it's so minor though no big deal all right um let's close out of the meeting let's close this page let's disable this in obs yeah um all right the first thing i want to do is i want to try and see what happens so i've got lots of stuff open by the way so let's turn this off um this is stopped okay first things first let's see what happens the first thing i want to try is let's see how the builtin browser to obs works i am going to do um a browser source i'm going to paste in the link to my p5 sketch i kind of have a feeling i'm going to there's going to be a problem here and i have a way around it i'm going to hit ok i've added a browser source i want this particular url oh i put that in the title for it i don't know that i care about this css but i'll leave it with let's leave it at 800 by 600 right now and let's say okay now the reason why i think it's not working is it doesn't have permission to open the camera the builtin browser to obs probably doesn't have permission so i have a way around this i anticipated this issue let's download the code put it on the desktop call it zoom let's open up terminal let's run a web server so i think oh even for localhost i thought the browser doesn't ask permission for a localhost so this is working i thought now i could put maybe if i say localhost it won't no it still asks permission um let's see if this works this is unfortunate we'll have to sneeze uh local host control audio no use custom frame right now so anything i can do here does anyone know whether obs has like a console or anything i can do enable media stream you need to run obs with a flag to automatically give permission that's very interesting how would i possibly do that obs executable dash dash enable me okay all right so i'm making this unfortunately additionally complicated but let's quit obs go to uh terminal oh whoops let's actually keep this running so where do i want to go go to applications and then oh maybe it's hold on yeah obs app this is what i would do on a mac oh i mean you oh i'm in okay right that runs it but can i put those arguments here or do i can i do this no that was weird or do is it in the contents like the actual oh no no i want the folder i think i can do like show package contents contents it must be this right this must be the executable contents mac os whoa oh what oh okay let's try this enable media stream um remote debugging port equals nine two two two to get debugging in a browser okay let's try this no reads input from note field arcs args dash dash arcs this is not what i expected to be doing i think i can do this there we go so now a browser a localhost oh whoops local host local host ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding the only unfortunate thing is it went and got my obs virtual camera not the actual facetime camera but that worked so how do i tell it now i have to write something in the code to select the right camera or i have to change the default camera of the obs browser oh this is so sad oh that's such a pain i have another idea for how to do this that i think will probably be just fine but i would prefer to really get this working working um how do i change so let's do p5.js enumerate cameras i've seen this select cameras um so console log devices object object object virtual camera facetime camera okay so uh this should work hey all right okay so let me take this and hold on i have this open already so now i'm going to set the default camera i'm going to work from localhost i think from now on and i want to set the default camera so where do i let's just paste this all in and see what i need setup i need to do enumerate devices in setup then i need the got devices function i don't really think that i necessarily need this array but i'll just keep it so let's put that here just so i can find it and then i want to set devices 1 and create capture with the video so then i should be able to i should be able to change this to video equals create capture set the size hide it and do all this stuff here once i've selected the correct camera oh i'm i'm really off the rails now with this very simple example that i made um okay how we doing here i think i'm in pretty good shape this needs to go this needs to go let's take a look at localhost okay that's working here now we should be able to actually actually just be able to refresh this i think will this refresh it no um do i really have to like remove it add the browser again oh wait it's not there still i thought it would be underexisting come on did i not say did i oh i didn't restart the server yeah i did is it caching it oh wait no there's no server running that was weird let's try this i mean i can also just go back to the browser now oh this is crazy what i'm doing why am i taking all this time to do this hold on let's just be really sure about this by uh also making a different port let me use whoops is it like this okay i'm running it on a different port just to be a hundred percent sure let me make sure this works here oh weird i actually didn't test this code it's doing something weird now what did i do wrong i think i i must not have saved it okay video create capture with height size oh i have this too sorry this has to go so uh we've got an error where oh because i gotta wait until flipped video is actually available i think by the way i i'm missing an important setting here i don't realize i didn't have that set here okay there we go okay now localhost 8081 is working now i should be able to go back to obs this probably isn't going to be any faster frame rate rise i just want to i i because there's something i can do here which is really awesome just give me a second i'm getting there localhost and put this in there hit ok there we go wow i think the builtin obs browser is like really bad this is worse because i forgot that this whole sketch is operating with like webgl i mentioned there's no like webgl opengl context uh the best thing for me to do would actually be use like uh websockets or something and run a server but i have this idea went nowhere so this will get edited out all right and if if this gets edited into the coding challenge i'll i'll explain so um in case i this all by recorded this is actually called it 25 minutes ago so it's chris manning sorry about that um i'm going to act as if my recorded disc is working and we're actually going to edit this into something so i just tried to see if i could get this to perform better by running opening an actual browser source within open broadcast studio itself and i had to jump through some hoops to like enable the video capture and all this stuff but it's actually much much worse and i believe this is because teachable machine runs in the opengl com with the opengl context using web i believe this is because i believe this is because a teachable machine runs using the webgl context to do the to run the machine learning model and that probably is not something that performs well in open broadcast studio but it is i say i have a better idea better than all of my ideas here it comes okay i'm thinking about this i mean what i really want to do is run i'm going to do it the way i'm just going to do it the simplest way i can think of it okay this is what i'm going to do i'm going to make a uh what's 16 by 9 like 1280 by 720. i'm going to make a 1280 by 720 canvas i'm going to make the video as small as possible so let's see even if i do it like 160 by 120 and i'm going to hide it i'm not going to hide it i want to see that video separately and then i don't want to draw the video instead i just want to see the image pop up so let's see if this works so i've got my video at the bottom right and i'm able to get the question mark to pop up great so now i'm going to go to the present view again my i moved the camera around which i think is causing a bit of a problem i'm going to have to retrain the model which i'll do let me go back to here this is working pretty well and i want to change the background to a pure green actually i could just make a trans no i'm going to do a pure green and you'll see why in a second so stop did i not hit save now this should run much faster because i am passing a very small video to the machine learning model i don't need a high resolution video to do the classification and i'm also not drawing it so it's much less work for me not to actually draw the video just draw this because now what i can do in open broadcast studio which i can open again and let me delete these other elements i can actually just add my camera source directly so i want to add the facetime camera i'm going to add it here i'm going to stretch it out to take up the full and you can see the frame rate is very fluid here then i'm going to add as another scene a window capture and i'm going to get the browser i don't know why i'm always making a new one but that's fine and i want to get i want to grab this which is here hit ok i'm going to stretch this out but i'm going to crop it around the canvas i'm going to fill the window basically with it then i'm going to add a filter in obs i'm going to go to filters i'm going to add an effect filter i'm going to go to chroma key and i want to chroma key the green out so i'm going to say the default's going to work really well i have a perfect chroma key because i drew the green itself and now there we go and i have no frame rate issues pops right up now i want to um i guess now i need to go to zoom that's right now i need to go to my zoom meeting oh it's time for my zoo meeting i'm so excited it's time to be on zoom for the 15th hour of the day let's go to how do i get there without like messing this up i'll make a new window and i'm going to go to a test meeting join obs i need to make sure i am running my virtual camera i going to join my test meeting um join without video yeah yeah yeah i hear the ringtone yeah i'm sure it's all working um now i'm in the meeting and turn on my video um i want to mirror it oh there we go hold on let's just let's go to video settings um mirror my video hello friends welcome to class today on zoom if you have a question please raise your hand all right uh this works i'm so glad this actually works quite well i wonder if there's a better way that i can visually by the way am i missing the oh i can enable hardware acceleration for the browser in obs so that is a thing i could have done but i still like this solution better this feels more flexible i think all right let's i have a half an hour let me make a model with more gestures and also um let me think about if there's a way that i could have other people join the meeting without it being a problem i just feel like it would look more effective if it was like a grid of things but whatever okay um i mean this wasn't my idea but it sort of feels like hey google you made this teachable machine thing you have a product called google meet hit me up let's make this for google meet right you could have this built in you could have even a button that's just like train your gestures in google meet customize your icons and then it just works free advice i guess um okay and by the way this is not specific to zoom i've now created a camera feed on my computer that just does this just to emphasize this even more if i go to like quicktime and i was like oh let me make a new movie recording i could select my obs virtual camera and now i'm in quicktime it shows up as well so the virtual camera is just now a camera that can be sent into anything let's have some more fun with this let's go back to here um what do i got we could do yes and no should we add those it's going to be um let me close this why is this not showing up i mean i could just start over i probably should start over because i've been moving the camera around um yeah by the way there's no reason why i couldn't just do this now also with my live stream so that when i make certain gestures certain things pop up or if i say certain words certain things pop up side project saturday let's let's get that working thumbs up is yes okay but why i'm just going to retrain a new model totally because i don't know why this like is not showing up is the zoom meeting causing a problem i don't have a lot of time here people i was going to do a tutorial on object detection ml5 um all right let's restart the browser uh yeah leave site i wonder if like quicktime or let's quit obs i think like the my camera got stuck with something there we go let me just make sure i'm in the right camera okay okay so background is just me someone remind me not to move my laptop around it's just going to be like this with some oh boy the way i put my whoops oh this is going to take too long to delete just start over uh okay this is just me let's do a question let's do a yes i don't know if we're going to be able to get the difference between thumbs up and thumbs down with this kind of let's do a no and then hold on there is a way i can tell it to record with a timer where i don't need to be holding down the button yeah so i can do this hold to record off delay two seconds duration uh six seconds okay this is what i meant this is what i should have been doing all along i don't know i don't know i don't know i don't know um so hold on what do i got here uh i'm going to use lowercase and i'll have to fix it in the code question yes no confused and then let's do something funny uh funny um okay and then i want to do one more which is love let's now try training the model right so chris is suggesting to use posenet and i was thinking about that as well oppose net is a machine learning model that detects key points and it would work really well for a lot of it possibly could even work just with like hand gestures you're not getting a lot of nuance like it would definitely not be able to tell thumbs up or thumbs down um let's see how this works so this is just me did i move my laptop around i hope i didn't uh question okay uh yes no uh confused funny and love oh it works so well yes okay export model um upload my model then uh now i just need this url i need to go to my code so i think this is let me just i should leave this open just in case but let's just make sure this works this is the page for the model background question yes no confused and loved all right all right 20 minutes people i can do this uh now i got to go to the code zoom annotations um let's put in the new model url um let's go and this is now should be lowercase and let's run this see if it's still working with the new model yep new model works okay now i just need to do yes no all right let's do so i'm going to do i this definitely needs the i will refactor this later song but i just got to do this uh let's go to my gesture stickers uh oh i should do one where there's nobody there and that would be the i'll be right back uh sign but you know you get the idea uh yes um so let's make this um what i guess i made them 480. i was wanting to sort of sit on the bottom i just realized but that's fine uh adjust size uh let's make the height 720 pixels okay that's for yes it's fine i've downloaded these it's fine uh no height is 720 pixels uh no so let's change this to a no let's change this to yes let us upload these go to the sketch yes equals let's we'll do two more of these again all this could depend on the array and objects and labels mapped to the object with the knows its fade value but quickly folks let's just make this work and i challenge you i would love for you to help refactor this code when i release it and we're going to just do it in a very silly way else if label equals yes yes fade equals 255. i like sometimes it's very meditative to just copy the same code over and over again this is not a sustainable solution if i wanted to have you know 100 different possible labels well which technically is possible and then and we can actually have multiple ones up here on top of each other and if yes fade yes fade yes yes fade and then we're gonna do no no fade no fade uh no and we're gonna run this just see how it's working awesome now let's get really fancy let's do our love so i'm going to try using an animation now um that's a good one uh but i was thinking of using oh there's that there's so many good ones uh sleeping i have all these animations this is yeah there we go okay this is the one i want to use so let's do uh and and what is its size it's very high uh well we're just gonna it's going to be what it's going to be let's call this one love.mp4 i hope this works file upload oops upload i mean i really should make this a gif would be easier but i think this should work as an mp4 and let's hit stop i need to do the laughing one so now um what is what am i doing what am i doing love love fade is zero the difference is love equals create i think create video uh love dot mp4 then i want to say love dot hide and love dot loop so it just always should be looping i ideally i would want it to start when i make the gesture but i'm not going to worry about that right now so then else if label equals love love fade is 255 and then the same exact thing i just am drawing a video if love fade is greater than zero love fade fade love and let me just make sure it's the right and let's sort of see what happens here it's like so little awesome all right one more let's just i want to do another animation but um i think just in the interest of time you can see how you can do an animation i'm going to do let's go to these let's do for laughing let's go to my this dot character let's just try this and now i want to upload this and a sketch let's go back to the code and uh else if label equals what was it laugh i don't even remember laugh fade equals 255. one more of these this is really painful the way i'm doing this left fade is greater than zero tint by the laugh aid the laugh fate fade goes down and the image is the laugh so i just need variables for that one laugh and did i call it laugh funny i called it funny so only if the label is funny and i had a mistake there anyway okay let's take a look at this i have a question yes no whoops but i love you okay i think that should be bigger and in the center also uh so let's just quickly ah know what i do i can't get my code back there it is um and how do i make it bigger let's just make it oh it's a square so let's just make it 720 by 720. um and then uh because i've done something awful um let's just say image mode corner for everything else except for this one there's nothing after it okay that should work i feel confident let's hit stop let's do share let's go to present let's go here we've got it open and now i can go back to open broadcast studio i think i moved my laptop come on little heart i love you where are you i love you what happened to the love i i want to make i want to make the love animation appear did something go wrong fail to load the resource oh element play oh so the video won't play because i haven't interacted on the page okay i have a this is super annoying um i am going to fix that by saying this um ah i oh i got it i got it i mean this is quite a hack but i'm just gonna force myself to press the mouse to play that video because then i'm interacting with it okay there we go there we go okay now back to obs what's going on here why is my camera so like weird resolution wise now hold on okay so these are working color is all weird but let me add my camera again video capture device why does this disappear i'm doing it again and again okay uh i could debounce this a little bit better okay use your official uh use your official coding train gifts yeah okay um now it is time to go to my zoom meeting oh it is just time for my zoom meeting would it be great if i had an actual zoom meeting to go to and i could log in right now and unsuspectedly the people joining would see this i'm going to use this later today when i have some meetings so i'm going to go to a meeting now me join my meeting oh i didn't start the yes yes okay so one thing i forgot is i've got to go to up to here tools start virtual camera i need to make sure the browser is actually open to this page now i can go to my meeting i can start my camera i can check like i'm on the virtual camera now here we are hello everybody welcome to today's lesson i have a question i really can't smile right smile that comes up serious question oh it's reversed again when did that happen so confusing oh i can flip it in ob i'm so confused about the flipping let's unflip it i guess i have a question yes but i love you let me do what i meant to do this whole time by the way and i'm going to do this now is i'm going to start recording so this is going to be a separate video feed that if we ever actually do edit this together i could create like put it into a zoom meeting um so now let's go back to zoom and hold on we'll make this i want to make this look well if i minimize that that's a problem will it still work if i minimize it probably not right yeah no that's fine uh it's got to be open somewhere but i could probably drag it off the screen there we go okay so now open up the chat okay i'm trying to make this look like a real meeting which is really ridiculous all right everybody welcome to today's zoom meeting apparently my model if i ever put my mouth thinks i'm laughing and i have a question for you everyone watching no i don't have i have a question yes uh question oh the meeting was ended all right you get the idea let's try that one more time that's where you can by the way see the meeting id and the password to try to join see it is there just to finish this off what happens if i leave all right so this is my demonstration of annotating your zoom video based on uh image classification using teachable machine i did this coding challenge i got a lot of work to do on training my model and debouncing the various popups but we can see that i can one ask a question i can say yes i can say no i can say i love love you yes i love you we all love each other and then i can laugh all right so i could add more things like say goodbye or if i leave i could put something else up there's all sorts of possibilities um i i hope that you can follow this i hope that you can really be more thoughtful about the design and animation and to be honest like there is nothing you couldn't possibly put um you don't have to just layer over your video you could play something else or do a full screen gif there's so many possibilities and all you need to do if you want to use this exact example is just go to this particular url but before you do that actually sorry before you do that you if you if you want to use this exact example all you need to go all you need to do is open the url to this particular p5 sketch you do need to train your own model your model should have exactly the same labels everything that i've done here but you should train it with your own images test it to make sure it works then copy paste your model url into this line of code at the top um and then once you do that once you hit run you should see and you've got then run and click the mouse you should see your video down here and your gesture should be able to control these popups now what i would encourage you to do is come up with your own labels and gestures and maybe use objects like what happens when you show it a train whistle or some other object think about what you're actually showing your own images or their animations or you know are can you play pom over yourself like while you're in a zoo meeting uh could you scroll text by you text to speech i would also encourage you to think about accessibility are there ways that you could send audio to zoom um in the sense that instead like when you're laughing it would play a laughing sound effect or when you have a question it would say question or or play a ding um so that for especially for people who might not be able to see the zoom meeting could they experience this result with uh um with audio so if you make anything like that um you know please share with me write a blog post a medium post create a github read me page um because this uh um and and make a web page for it and share it um based on the instructions that you'll find um in this video's description that show you how to add it as a community contribution to the web page for this coding challenge i hope you enjoyed it um i there's probably a million other ways you could do this better than what i did i hope this inspired you thank you i i have to thank um cameron hunter um thank you especially to cameron hunter who where i got this idea from it's not an original idea of mine i just had a lot of fun trying to make this um one thing you'll notice also in his particular example is a lot of the annotations do follow him so yeah you can see how the haha is like moving around and that's something you could also do by adding pose net to this and keeping track of where your nose there's so many things you can do i have to stop talking i have to say goodbye i hope you enjoyed
