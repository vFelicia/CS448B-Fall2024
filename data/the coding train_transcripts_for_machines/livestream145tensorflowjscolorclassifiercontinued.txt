oh here what a failure what a failure I know you hear me now I know I know I know I know you know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know i know we can i have we start this over again i'm waiting till the chat catches up to realize that my audio has come back on i always i haven't done this in such a long time i've become slightly more professional in my live streaming but yeah I went to go ah oh now I hear myself even coming out of here this computer I went to I went to go use the facilities which is something I'd like to do right before I start live streaming and when I do that even though I'm not we're streaming I'm actually not even recording so I'm gonna hit start recording or recording to disk I I like to just mute my microphone just in case you know anything happened by accident you know I don't want to confess to some crime in the bathroom by accident so and then I came back and I started and I forgot to turn the microphone back on anyway I was saying go Mexico scoop please give me score updates go Mexico sorry Sweden sorry sweden i love you' Sweden but go Mexico for what I understand if Mexico wins today Mexico would be the first World Cup team ever to win three games the first three games in a row I don't know if that's somebody out of fact check me on that but I think might be correct yes hey Zeus in the chat says Mexico is playing I can't watch both please go and watch Mexico this first of all this will be not nearly as interesting or exciting and also this you could watch later and you can watch the Mexico game later but that's you're gonna already know what's gonna happen and you know I can tell you what's gonna happen here I'm gonna try to code some stuff I'm gonna make lots of mistakes I'm gonna get stuck a lot I'm gonna waste a lot of time and eventually maybe at some point there will be a small useful nugget of educational material that comes out that's what's gonna happen okay anyway what was I saying good morning it is me the coding train person Schiffman thing human being and I have one job today my one job today is to complete the color classifier example with tensorflow Jas so the two things I would like from the chat i am i Yura I'm going to answer your question in a second the two things I would like from the chat well are one score updates so spoiler alert I want score updates the BIC okay Pat the chat so if you're watching this and you don't want to be spoiled I don't know too bad I guess if this if slack comes back online somebody let me know because I can then look at the slack channel for the for the slack chat and actually since I don't have I'm gonna so I'm gonna be looking more at the YouTube chat than I typically do okay so I have to get myself organized and figure out where I last left off so let me open up terminal also I want to say thank you to the YouTube family and Learning Team I was able to attend something called YouTube EDU Khan last week so that's a move to a new apartment and so out of sorts I live in a sea of drowning in boxes going away on vacation this tomorrow two weeks all right so Wow oh no no no no no no no Sweden scored are you now I can't tell if the chat is trolling me I need somebody reliable nothing you're not reliable the dark hound who gave me the score of why look so unfortunately this is the the World Cup is on a lot this is the let me talk about schedule this is the only time I have right now to do a live stream this week and I have some bad news I suppose if you enjoy watching these live streams there won't be another one until the week of July 15th I'm gonna be away for two weeks the good news it's true okay that's too bad the good news is for though which isn't really good news for you presumably as a live stream viewer but for the non live stream viewers out there I have a backlog of about 8 edited video tutorials that have not been published to the channel and I'm gonna make a couple more today mostly there's the first seven parts of this color classifier thing if you can believe that the first that's right seven parts and then that one edited challenge of doing a subscriber visualization so those will come out be published as public edited videos once every few days while I'm away and I should also let you know that most likely even when one comes out and is public you can look in the description if there's a link that says next video you can go to the next video you might see that it's unlisted but I don't know if this is good practice but this is my the way that I approach if I have a series of like a 10 part series instead of just putting them all 10 live online at once I space them out every few days but I leave the other ones there unlisted so the viewer who really wants to keep watch all of them at once could do that ok oh Germany scored I'm not paying attention to that game I guess that's good though Chico Germany whose German I didn't know he's playing for Mexico I don't know like a huge Mexico football fan all right Oh Italy scored all right I really also I would like to do something with major I'm a little bit of a baseball nerd we'd like to do something with machine learning and Major League Baseball data something that I'm thinking about if people have ideas or suggestions there is a entire example created by the tension flow Jas team that classifies pitches into ball strikes you know curveballs sliders no no no no not ball strikes that classifies what was I saying classifies pitches into fastball curveball slider etc based on the pitch data all right wow we are really got it we've got a good World Cup discussion I love the international quality of this audience I love that there's a great World Cup discussion going on the chat is a wonderful break from the usual its programming language or which IDE is better than the other so if it's one thing that the World Cup has done it's made us forget about all of our quirky preferences for coding editors and the like sorry C are brown can't get behind that Red Sox thing but look congratulations to you on all the recent success interesting tidbit I did go to college with Theo Epstein I didn't really know him though I did not get a haircut as Shubra is mentioning in the chat but I did I could I meant to get a haircut but I did just use my home grooming device to trim this beard which had gotten out of control so no wilderness Dan today okay so I need to figure out where I am and I'm gonna go to the desktop what am I in p5 tensorflow probably and I was so one thing I really messed up I think is so something I could use help with is it's gonna not be easy for you to help with it because I haven't published the videos yet but I was trying to keep the code that is at the end of each video separate and I erased one set of codes I need to recreate that which I will do myself but if someone wants to volunteer to do that it's the one I think where I was visualizing the grid of the colors he'd have to go back to the live stream at this point okay so I'm gonna create color classifier I'm gonna run a server I'm gonna open up the browser and open up the console and go to color classifier there we go this is where I left left off then I need to open up I'm gonna use the atom text editor happy birthday um I can't by the way people often ask for like shout out or you look at this or way it's impossible I think for me to catch every message and but you know hey happy birthday I care about your birthday hold on let's get this going here I don't want this YouTube this thing I do want to open up on the desktop oh oh computers are such a silly thing so let's close this and let's go to color classifier that's where I want to be and Here I am and let's go here let's make this a little bit bigger and I think I am I am ready to go so it's 1115 a.m. my goal today is to finish this example I really want this example to be finished I think this example is interesting enough or has enough to it that I can both publish the kind of fixed version that is the code that I'll leave with at the end of this tutorial as part of the coding train com website and then I'll also make a separate github repository with this color classifier that people can submit pull requests to like just improve the design and interface and that sort of thing I do have an issue where I don't have a good system for maintaining the various github projects that are associated with the coding train and so a lot of this stuff really looks like lingers and languages and so I am really thinking about that and how to mean how I can like manage the community better and so hopefully things will improve all right we need to find a tissue to blow my nose oh and I need to deal with this other camera so if you if you remember I did something really silly and ridiculous on the previous livestream where I didn't want to erase all of this over here I just turned the camera so that I could write some notes about a different project here so let me erase this this is nothing to do with the color classifier I'm just realizing now that I don't even need this so me not erasing it was kind of pointless but I want to turn the camera back uhoh loose HDMI cable sorry about that okay no green all the way to like they're up loose HDMI cable so this should be good does this seem like focus and you're seeing what you're seeing Oh actually I don't usually have it turned all the way that way because that little smiley face that I drew was my like testing okay there we go so I think this seems good and this is where I last left off I know you can't read this tf1 hot thing there all right so that's good we come back over here and let me open up the tensorflow api reference we're definitely gonna need that a little bit okay my eyesight is more supports I bigger computer screen alright so now I am here and so I actually one thing that I have to talk about which I will get to is I I'm actually going to use validation data and not testing data as this tutorial here's some here's some news actually I took about two or three hours last night kind of building out the example I'll just show it to you right now so as just to prepare for today because as you know I typically don't prepare but I felt like this was I needed to sort of see how this was gonna work so if I go to a shipment github dot you color classifier I think this is it so this here is actually whoops this here is running a version of what I want to build today so behind the scenes its training the model with the training data and you and I'm and this is the number of epochs for now I'm gonna say epoch a lot pronounced epoch look YouTube thank you YouTube epic okay okay what about the British pronunciation is a difference epic British pronunciation epic how to pronounce well let's look at oxford dictionaries I guess you could say it either way don't die okay and yes I could watch Peppa Pig live right now all right oh I logged in to because I was watching the World Cup Mexico game I've logged into my daughter's the account that I have set up with YouTube red for my daughter to watch videos and we can see what she likes to watch here okay let's move away from that epic epoch I want to say Epoque all right second one is the only correct one I so agree me I am soo me as well as the only way to say maths is matched alright so this is what I'm going to look at this so I've trained it with the data and we should see now reddish yellowish greenish bluish stick it with bluish purplish purplishpinkish ish purplish so this does this will work and I've gone now for nine a pox I feel confident now it's if the key is saying it with confidence all right does anyone remember where last left up like what was the last thing that I did oh no Sweden scored again how much time is left oh I'm bad luck for sweet and I have to stop livestreaming I mean bad luck for Mexico come on Mexico I mean Mexico's gonna I think Mexico will advance anyway is that correct better be nice for them to win all right let me see hold on for a second I'm going to go somewhere that I don't want to show by accident so here we are for a second I'm going to I just want to login to my YouTube dashboard to find a particular video and I have to log in now as myself switch account another coding train and I'm gonna go to my creator studio creator studio videos color classifier part seven seven is the last one so this is an edited version of part seven that has not come out yet but I can watch it because it is private and I'm going to do that right now Oh should I put on the hoodie so that the matches continuity I know you can't hear the audio okay so let me see where what happens at the end do you want to hear this audio wait wait don't leave just wait don't leave just yet I do want to think about memory management and I'm maybe I'm going to think about memory management later but and the X's and Y's I'm gonna want to use in the next video but I probably should after I make the one last little tidbit here and then I'll move on in the next video I'm gonna start creating the architecture of the neural network model itself and oh I'm gonna introduce some new concepts soft backs and crossentropy oh no I have to talk about softmax and crossentropy okay all right that's fine that's fine okay good thing I watch that alright alright I'm ready ready everybody ready Freddy Roby we think of maybe I need to get into the mood a little bit oh I'm to the wrong string like I actually have left this ukulele here and I haven't been here for a while so I haven't had a chance to play I need to get a second one so I can have one here one at home so I can actually practice and learn some new songs all right here we go stretch my stretch I'm gonna get up and stretch stretch your hamstring muscles okay there we go let's cycle those cameras yes Warner says stick decoding it totally totally okay hello I am back I have returned to finally build the architecture to take this training data these RGB values that are matched with these one hot encoded labels if you don't know what I'm talking about you should probably go back and watch the first seven parts of this series but I'm now going to create the neural network architecture to train a model with this data and I'm going to use continue to use tensorflow j s in particular the layers API to do this so let's review over here a bit let's review over here a bit where I am alright so we've talked about all these things you know it's really funny I just want to erase I want to erase all that I can't like I can't I can't I apologize here sorry everybody go go watch the go go route for Mexico for a little bit this is just it doesn't help me to have this here it's like two out of my head and so I need to erase all of it what oh how ridiculous mi then I so desperately jumping through various hoops to not erase this it's like I needed it and now that I'm here yes you haven't switched to watching the World Cup once again you were watching a livestream of a person quietly are not so quietly erasing I really need a cloth so I don't kill the earth by the way we have a little family World Cup pool going and the person in the family who happens to be leading with the best picks is my sixyearold far and away running off with watch this one of those glass boards that I could put right here drawn this before it started but don't worry I'm gonna get the coating is it noon already if it's noon time to be a knight I couldn't my watch my watch battery died and my Fitbit why and I didn't know packing and moving a hip behind the charger don't get your sips of tea or coffee or do some more stretching I'm almost ready I think I should probably just start over all right oh you weren't even watch I didn't even have the camera on sorry everybody are you ready oh it's only 1130 okay whoo Oh slack is still down is that correct all right Oh No Sweden scored again I mean I love Sweden and everything but got to go all right hello I have returned once again to make a color classifier machine learning well by my first intro is much better okay alright hold on I think my belt isn't tight enough my pants feel like they're falling down okay now everything's gonna be right my brain is gonna work correctly hello I am back in this video I am finally going to start to build the neural network architecture to make this color classifier I am going to take this data over here which is a long array of many many RGB values normalized to arrange there to one which matches with all of these one hot encoded labels and if you don't know what I'm talking about then you might want to go back and watch the first seven yes that's right seven parts of this tutorial series that's getting very very long but this I think is I'm really getting to the good stuff I don't know maybe it was good stuff before maybe this is bad stuff I don't really know but this I'm really excited I'm excited because now what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna use tension flow yes but I'm going to create the neural network architecture so let's just remind ourselves what we have we have a data set most of the first seven videos of the series was all just about collecting and cleaning that data set and that data set is many many RGB values I think I have like five thousand which is actually is kind of very very small for a data set but it's fine for this particular demonstration I have five thousand RGB values each one is labeled with something like blueish or reddish or purplish these were crowdsourced but those got converted to one hot encoded vectors meaning if there are nine if there are nine labels well let's see then I have a vector that looks like this one two three four five six seven times ten nice night and maybe this one refers to purplish if this particular element of this array of numbers has a 1 in it it is that that and that one is for a particular label this one sort of label okay so that's what I have so what I I know that I need to have some kind of neural network and the inputs has have a shape of 3 there are 3 inputs are G B the outputs have a shape of 9 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 this is the output layer this has a shape of 9 inputs of a shape of three outputs have a shape of nine because the goal of this is by what once this whole thing is trained and finished if I send in some RGB values what I'm gonna get is a bunch of numbers all between 0 & 1 and I'm gonna find the one that's the highest and and those numbers are gonna be the probability of this particular data point being a particular label and I'm gonna find the one that's highest in front of sign at that label who classification we're doing classification so now what goes in between all this now this is a big question and many different scenarios might call for multiple layers different kinds of layers there's something called a convolutional layer which I'll get to but I'm gonna do something really simple I'm gonna have a basic dense layer which is kind of the standard building block of neural network systems and I'm gonna give it some number of nodes so for the sake of our even right now let's pretend that I just gave it 4 nodes and a dense layer this output is also going to be a dense layer dense layer means fully connected meaning that every input is connected to every node and then every node in the hidden layer this dense layer is connected to every output now I'm going to let your imagination draw the rest of all these connections but so this is what I want to architect so let's now go on detectives now I'm going to do this using tensorflow digest and the layers API if you don't know about the layers API you're going to watch my three or four part series about the layers API tutorial but I'm bookin I sort of talk you through it while we're doing it here so you don't necessarily have to watch that okay so if I come back again this is what I built so far I have all of the training data and tensors and you can see the shape of it I have 5643 RGB values and 5643 labels nine with nine possibilities okay so the first thing that I want to do is and I'm gonna do some goofy stuff with some global variables that I might not know that you know just to make my life kind of easier I'm going to create a variable called model and my model which I'm going to create in setup at the end after I've prepared all the data I'm going to say model equals t f dot sequential TF dot sequential so that now that's that's me creating a sequential neural network model it's sequential because it's a feedforward the layers go in this order so now what I need to do is create some layers so the first thing I want to do is make the hidden let's make the output layer now let's make this we should do it in order we have to do it in order and to make the hidden layer hidden equals TF layers dense and then I put some configuration stuff so I make a layer by calling TF dot layers and then I specify the kind of layer this is gonna be a dense layer and then I can pass an object in as an argument and that's where I can configure things like input I don't remember any of this let's go look it up so let's go to the documentation let's go to TF TF layers and let's go to dense where do we see that hold on time out for a second let me look at my cheat sheet which I didn't want to do but I'm going to totally do TF layers dense I got that right so where did I miss it oh it's right there under basic sorry I'm looking around for it and it's right there in front of my face under basic so I'm gonna make a TF layers of dents I'm gonna click on that and now I'm gonna see these are all of the things that I can pass into the configuration so I need to specify the number of units the number of units is like the number of nodes and I made up four right here maybe let's try sixteen maybe we want to have some more than four whatever we can make up anything we want so I'm going to now say units sixteen one thing that I know I need there's an activation function again I can't cover everything in this video I have an other videos where I've talked about what an activation function is and how it works but the idea is the activation function is the function that takes all the sum of all of the things passing through the network being multiplied by the weights and kind of squashes them into some range and so there probably is a really useful interesting discussion about we could have about what would be the best activation function to use right here right now maybe later he'll try some different ones but just for simplicity I'm gonna use I'm gonna make a bad decision and just use sigmoid this sort of like historically original activation function of neural networks I'm gonna use the activation function sigmoid let's see what else do I want input dimensions so this is something that I definitely need to do here because remember this this this these inputs this is not actually a layer this is a two layer network it looks like there's three but I'm just drawing it with three things and the inputs being but that's not a layer but I do need to specify that three things are coming in so I need to come here and say the input dimensions input dimensions is three because I have an RGB value this should do me just fine for right now so then I want to also create the output layer output TF that's gonna be dense that's going to have nine units because they're nine labels again that's completely arbitrary that's just how I happen to prepare my dataset now I don't need the input dimensions because the input dimensions can be inferred by the previous one the input dimensions to the output or the number of units of the hidden so I don't need that but I do need to specify an activation function and guess what I am going to use a different activation function softmax so I'm just gonna type that in right now I will come back and explain what softmax is in a separate video which i think will be the next video of this series just gonna push this a little bit further now I'm gonna say model dot add the hidden and then model dot add the output so this is now me this is now the code for exactly what I diagrammed right here three inputs into a hidden layer with some number of units with some activation function into an output layer with some number of units and an activation function timeout for a second I just want to see do I want to do the optimizer yes I think that I do okay okay okay oh yes so we have now built the model here's the thing the next thing that I need to do and I'm gonna do this in the next video what I need to do is create an optimizer so let's just put this in comments create an optimizer and I need an optimization function which typically in the past I've used mean squared error but I'm gonna use something called categorical cross true I don't know why it sounds really scary but it's not and I can't its I also can't spell it so I'm gonna create the optimizer and then I'm going to compile the model and then I'm going to train the model these are the next step so they need to do this is the architecture for the model people telling me I have an error oh yeah I have something extra extra comma here but so this one do the next video and so what I need to do in the next video this is like just a few lines of code but I need to I mean I could just add them but I would like to try to understand a bit more about what why am i have softmax here instead of sigmoid or new or any of the other activation functions and why I might choose categorical crossentropy instead of mean squared error which is if you have happened to watch my ex or tensorflow TAS coding challenge or some of my other layers tutorials I always just use mean squared error so that's what's coming the next video I'm going to create the optimizer I'm gonna compile the model and I'm going to talk about softmax and categorical cross entropy oh wait wait wait wait let's actually run with this and see if there's a syntax errors no okay and if I just say if I if I look in the console here at model we can see there it is this is the object and it's got all this stuff in it alright see you in the next video okay now is the moment where people can ask some questions or offer some comments before I move on to the next so I I so I need to open up a Wikipedia page for softmax and then why did why does everybody make everything look so insanely insane and then categorical crossentropy one thing I want to know is what's the difference between categorical crossentropy and because I think in if I go to loss functions here but it's actually not here so this is I don't know if this is a bit of a point of confusion for me there's the loss function here is written as softmax crossentropy but I know for a fact because I was building this example last night I'm looking at the chat so hard to follow the chat without the /o Caddick so here's something I would love so this is what I'm building I have it in here already right so this is what I did I use categorical cross entropy because this I have found in this is what I found that examples of tension flow jas however as the loss function and then but however if I go here and look at the API Docs it says softmax cross entropy are those the same thing no metrics oh it's a mint interesting it's here under metrics I'm looking at the chat I guess I'm gonna just kind of gloss over this right now and this should be a lowercase e by the way I mean I'll leave that there since all right oh I I also messed up which is that the optimizer I totally I totally misspoke at the end of the last video oh yeah okay thank you about for the the battery the battery notes I only have one plug today so let me plug this in the first thing I totally messed up the optimization function is stochastic gradient descent or adaptive something the loss function the loss function is mean squared error or in this case I'm going to use categorical cross entropy instead okay so that I messed up okay all right so I got to just move on I guess cycle the camera the chat has more entropy than the program itself all right I am going to move on and let's look at why is the word entropy use that's what I would like to understand it's between two probability distributions P and Q over the same underlying set of events measures the average number of bits needed to identify an event drawn from the set coding scheme so basically let me see if I get this right before I put it in the tutorial where did I put my marker where's that marker here it is so this this output layer ultimately with softmax gives us a probability distribution and we could absolutely look at the correct distribution wipe the thing that we're training against the calculating an error is this right the one hot encoded vector so we could use mean squared error it would give us a loss but crossentropy is a formula for looking at the difference between this output vector and this vector if we're considering these probabilities because it looks it does use a different formula to compute the loss but the error between two probability distributions it's optimized for that and in particular but not and and it's linked to using cross entropy with soft max because soft max is an activation function that generates a probability distribution from any just vector of numbers that seemed about right without going into the actual maths the formulas for these two things although I I might describe the formula for a soft Mac so I think that's worth doing because it's much simpler than it looks like on Wikipedia but does that seem like a fairly accurate explanation before I get into the next video Oh Korea scored that's exciting I'm gonna have to wait a minute for people to catch up to me I'm gonna look at the formula here so uh so it's just the sum of probability P Times log of probability Q that's pretty simple actually H of P is the entropy of P the cross entropy for distributions P and Q is this and for discrete P and Q that's what we have here it means this okay I'm not gonna get into the mass of cross entropy the slack still that's not everyone just talking about Mac versus Windows so I'm just gonna quit slack because it's causing my computer to freeze up here how am i doing timewise it's only noon okay I think we're pretty good that's a nice definition of entropy like you know lack of order or predictability all right I I'm not seeing anyone complaining about my explanation like no there's like a completely separate discussion going on in the chat that has nothing to do with what I'm talking about so I'm just gonna assume that I'm gonna move forward Oh how much time is left in the Mexica game okay thanks Dan I'll take that as a yes all right Oh Korea's beating Germany and realize Korea and Germany were playing entropy is a mathematical way to determine how think Thank You Jo two micron who writes entropy is a mathematical way to determine how chaotic something is in this case it's a way to measure how two different how different two tensors are to one another that is a great way of explaining it so let me let me say that again in my own words so in other words entropy as a measurement of how chaotic something is so cross entropy is basically looking at this probability distribution that the neural network generated and the sort of known correct one and what's the sort of chaos that exists in between coats what's the cross entropy the error between those two probability distributions how if we are using them as problems we're generating an outcome like how chaotic is that outcome going to be well with the 100 vector it won't be chaotic at all it will always be just the one thing because it's a hundred percent this label but with this what's the cross entropy there I think that's a good way of describing it all right let's move on all right okay I can't look at the chat now okay okay I'm back hi I'm back to create an optimizer and a loss function and compile my model for this color class fired another thing at the end of the previous video I was talking about oh I want to use I gonna use the thing called softmax and I want to create an optimizer I want to use mean squared I will use categorical cross entropy instead of mean squared error boy did I really kind of box that the optimization function I want to use this is something I'm choosing from for example what I'm going to use is stochastic gradient descent this is the optimization function that whole let me let me start this over I need to get my head straight here okay all right here we go I'm actually going to I think while I'm recording I don't really need this laptop even open because I have to there's no slack channel and I have the YouTube chat over here although actually I just realized it could be useful because I do have my premade code which I rarely do in advance circuit I do have that over here so I think that would be useful to have available to me okay alright I'm back in part 471 of building a color classifier now what am I gonna do here in the previous video I created the architecture of my model a hidden layer and output layer a sixtieth 10 ths sequential model to dense layers activation functions units etc now at the end of the last video said only the next thing I need to do is define an optimization function and then compile the model well I really botched that is what there's three things I need to do optimization function loss function and compile the model and so I kind of conflated optimization and loss I'm optimizing against the loss but the optimizer that I want to make is I can use Const I guess here I get a very inconsistent about winning using converses let maybe I'll go back and clean up that code at some point I'm gonna say I can get it from TF train stochastic gradient descent and I can create a learning rate which I'm going to say is like 0.2 so this so one thing to do is create an optimization function right there are different options and we can try other options stochastic gradient descent is the one that I basically used in almost all of my examples and covered in detailed in my how to build a neural network from scratch series and the idea of created descent is walking along trying to go down the graph of the loss function to minimize that loss so what is the loss function that I want well if I'm just say model compile I believe this is a whoops this is a function that I'm going to write with a configuration option and one of the things when I compile the model I need to specify up to optimizer optimizer ena this is very awkward that I just called this up here but that's fine and then the other thing I just specify is a loss function mean squared error so this is typically what I have done in previous examples if you look at my X or coding challenge but this is now going to change and the reason is because I am using an activation function called softmax so let's talk about what softmax is softmax question mark okay so remember the output that we want from the neural network is a probability distribution right what's an example of what an output might look like it might look like this there's nine values 0.1 0.1 0.2 0 zero zero zero point seven zero zero right ohho my math is off zero point six right these all add up to a hundred percent this is the idea we're what this is saying is this particular RGB color has a 60% chance of being you know bluish if that's the particularly ball that matches with zero one two three four five index number six a 10% chance of being reddish a 10% chance of being purplish and a 2% chance of being greenish this is what we want now the training data is encoded like this and maybe we can actually look at it right next to it maybe this is what the training data looks like zero zero one zero zero zero zero zero zero a one hot encoded vector because actually the correct label for that color is greenish so I need a loss function sorry let's good cat across entropy and soft backs are linked together they're used together so that's why I just can't remember which one I'm explaining but I need a loss function to give me the error between this probability distribution and this probability distribution but I need my neural network to generate a probability distribution in the first place activation function as you might recall is something that squashes any number into some range it's one way of thinking about it the sigmoid function if we were to graph that sigmoid function it looks like a boy can never do this something like this oh boy that's a terrible graph of it you look it up on Wikipedia something more like this right and this the top is one the bottom zero so any number given to sigmoid results in a number between zero and one softmax is an activation function that not only squashes the values that are coming in to these outputs between zero and one but guarantees that they all add up to one now you might say to yourself that's easy that's very easy to do we do this all the time with normalizing data I could just find I could just take all of the outputs add them all up and then divide each one by the sum of the total right because let's say somewhere I have these numbers two two one five right I can add all these up and they're going to add up well look at that they added up to ten let me divide by ten I have 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.5 so this we could do this sort of like divided by the sum as our activation function in but that's but but this is not going to give us an AK an accurate probability distribution that we want for this scenario and softmax is another way of doing the same thing with more that that sort of expands the difference this one makes this one much more likely expands the difference between these different values so the way that softmax works is we actually do the following you know that I gotta find it Eraser know that natural number e for natural log to point seven something I think well what if I said and took E squared e squared e to the 1 power e to the 5th power what if I took all of these what if I took all of these and then added them all up and made that I'll call that the e sum and then just took each one of these values and divided by E song that is softmax in a nutshell you'd only think I'm gonna do I'm gonna have a like a tan tangent video that you can go and watch now where I'm actually gonna write the code for the softmax function we'll explain it better only it's worth doing that in this video but I'm gonna I'm going to do that in a separate video so look for that in the delete it look for a link to that in this video's description just to like just to be sure that I'm right about this we can now go here and this makes it look like oh my god this is like the craziest scariest thing in the world but you could see it right here the softmax function for a vector of values z means take every value e to that z index J power divided by the sum of all of those values and so that and you can see here the probability theory the output of the softmax function can be used to represent a categorical distribution a probably miss tribution over k different possible outcomes time out for a second so what i want to do is you know i'm going to do that in a different video okay yeah okay okay okay alright so again in a separate video I'm gonna write the code for softmax and actually it's right there intensive load is also as functions for doing it and I'm gonna compare what those outcomes look like versus just summing and dividing but I'm gonna move on and say so if I've established that softmax is what I'm using as the activation function for the last layer the output layer the question then becomes what loss function should I use how do I calculate the error between the node the target outputs with the training data and what the what the model generated during the training process so again mean squared error would work here but I am gonna change that to categorical crossentropy why am i using that so first of all what is entropy entropy is a term that refers to like the chaos associated with the system so you can think of a probability distribution is like being very chaotic or more or less chaotic so what the cross entropy function is a loss function designed to compare to probability distributions and look at how much chaos there is in between that the cross entropy between them and the math of it is you know mean squared errors like subtract take this one this one and then do like the square root square it then do the square root or make it don't do the square root then add them all together me and squared error I've talked about that you can look it up it's a pretty simple mathematical function cross entropy if we look at it we get we could build that I could build this in a separate video which might be worth doing as well is really just the if if I have two probability distributions P and Q I'm looking at the mine the sum of one probability distribution times the log of the other probability distribution so again you can research what cross entropy how the math behind it works more in more detail and maybe I'll do a video about that for those who are interested but at the moment the important thing to do where am i over here thing to realize is that softmax is an activation function for generating a probability distribution and crossentropy is a loss function that works well for comparing to probability distributions so for a classification problem those are the two things we want to use pause wait if it's a binary classifier it's better if Dan use binary crossentropy yeah yeah yeah that's a good point okay um in the chat someone just mentioned that you know if it was a binary classifier there's only two possible outcomes hot dog or not hot dog I think is the classic example now then I would use binary crossentropy so again there is no be all end all for the loss function you choose I'm just showing you one scenario with the idea of and locking your mind to think about well let me research all these other loss functions and why would he use one with its the other and what's available as part of that I get for free as part of tensorflow digest okay so we've done that oh I think I'm done with this video let me just uh let me just kind of like run this code oh wait we got it unknown loss ah okay I think this is lowercase e okay there we go so so now we're done what is the next step what am I gonna do in the next video it is now time for me to call model dot fit model dot fit is actually the function I will call with the X's and the Y's that I've prepared in a previous video to train the model right I really only got two steps left and I'm sure there's gonna be lots other stuff that are forgetting about right now I want to train the model then I want to use the model to give me a label for a new color that the user is going to specify okay so in the next video I'm going to actually add model dot fit see you then oh please talk about the difference between stochastic gradient descent and gradient descent that's a good question I should talk about that somewhere maybe cannot I think I need to do like little aside videos let me see if I can answer this down so we can tell me if I'm correct stochastic rate I always forget which ones which but stochastic gradient descent is the one where you run you some a whole bunch of like loss function values and then compute the gradients as opposed to computing the gradients for each data point one at a time it has to do with went to you when do you tune the mod when do you tune the weights like here's a data point what's the error here's a data point what's the error here's a data point what's there do I do that a hundred times then tune some weights or do I some weights in between each data point I can never finish doing a bit stochastic means doing it in batches okay there we go all right how am I on time twelve ten that's pretty good I kind of want to be done by one if I can so we're gonna do model dot fit in the next video all right all right whoa binary crossentropy is for multilabel classification x' whereas categorical crossentropy is for multiclass classification where each example begun belongs to a single class oh I messed up so I totally miss explain that match I wonder if you can cut out the thing where I mentioned binary crossentropy no people are asking I guess about my this is a google Summer of Code tshirt yes so I do I've for the lot I think since 2011 I missed one year I have done I'm the organ the org administrator and sometimes a mentor for the processing foundation google Summer of Code shoot so Matthew let's figure out what to do about that binary crossentropy thing I guess it's not the worst thing that I mentioned in there but I got it slightly wrong by the way this is something that came up in that YouTube conference that I went to like there's no way to correct a video there used to be those annotations and you could add there's no way to correct a video without once it's been published without like just removing it and uploading a whole new video binary crossentropy look at this anyway I'm not gonna worry about it too much okay so let me get to let me uh cycle the cameras okay slack come back I'm out of water I may need to go get some water all right okay good the chat all right it's time it's time to fit our model here we go so so far you know hopefully you've watched all the previous parts of this series if you haven't that's fine too but what what I have so far is I prepared my data set loaded it from a JSON file I've turned everything into tensors and then I created a Model T F using touchflo data has a TF sequential model which is designed to receive RGB inputs and output a probability distribution for color labels and you know again this is somewhat of a trivial scenario but I'm classifying data simple data with just three values all between zero one and nine possible categories or labels okay so that's what I've done so far so now that I have this this is actually like it's always the feeders gonna be over in like two seconds not really all I need to do is call model dot fit so modeled outfit now what do I need to pass to model dot fit well the idea of model dot fit is that I'm saying hey here's the training data here are all the inputs and their associated target outputs which I have called X's and Y's now I think I'm gonna get an error right now let me just actually run this and I'm going to up so let me run this and see if I get the error that I'm expecting yeah so look at this Oh okay so a couple things welcome to your life doing machine learning shaped mismatching I didn't even expect this error so I have to think about this one error when checking input expected dense input to have shake three but got array with shape 5643 three so I guess right I'm sending in not just three inputs the shape of my inputs is many so I think if I just do let me look at what an example that I made previously that's weird I didn't have this issue what I'm thinking about this where is this error coming from we'll know to think about this for a second huh I know that this batching thing is always an issue I thought I took care of that I'm just looking at the code I wrote yesterday but that's so weird the code that I wrote yesterday did is there something I did to it X's colors yeah Oh input shape got it that's what I that's the difference between the code that I wrote yesterday all right aha so I made a mistake and I used input dimensions where what I really meant was input shape let's see if we can actually look in the documentation here input dim with it for the dense layer what's the difference Oh input shape isn't actually listed here ah if specified defines input shape as is has input dimensions inside of brackets so actually I think this would probably fix it let's try this right really what I want is this like I'm going to have an array of batches of data each one with three values in it so I think no but probably what I would need to do is say five because I know I have this much data maybe I need to do this this is actually not the way I want to do it let's try this No so weird I know what I want is in I know what's going to work is this okay let me let me go let me go redo that explanation I have to think about this more later I went down a little bit of a rabbit hole though that's unnecessary all right let's go look at the documentation and see what it says there and I actually I've got it pulled up already okay so you can see what I specified was input dimensions if specified defines input shape as bracket input dimensions oh so actually I don't even need those that those array brackets there and that should fix it there we go but if I wanted to use those array brackets because I'm sending in many data points I could actually just specify the input shape directly and this would then have the array brackets around it so it's a subtle distinction I think because only input dimensions is documented let's use that one and let's put a 3 here okay so no peeps we've got that I wonder why that didn't know because I didn't call fit before okay so now I'm fitting the model I don't see an error I expected an error let's so what happens when I fit the model well it returns a promise model dot fit returns a promise if you don't know what a promise is guess what I have a whole set of videos about what a promises and I'm also going to be using eventually a weight and a sync which I also have videos about but right now I can just write the dot then the prompt fit returns a promise which I can then call a function called then to where the results will be passed in and I'm just gonna say and I'm gonna use this arrow syntax this es6 arrow syntax console dot log results and eventually I might want to do more with this so I'm actually gonna make it a full function so this is what I'm saying is once you fit the model then log the results let's see what happens waitingwaiting ah ok great look at this history loss and there's my loss so it fit that model it did one epoch and gave me a loss great so done train the model here's the thing I want what I want to do ultimately so this is actually way done what I want to do is first of all I want to train the model for more than just one epoch so one thing that I need to do here is pass in some options so I'm gonna create a variable called options and one thing I can specify is like epochs I'm gonna say do it for 10 and then I'm gonna say and let's actually let's just say 2 right now because it's gonna take a while so the third argument to model dot fit is options and if I go into tension flow yes and I look for a model dot fit oops I was right there already we can see now these are the various options and I'm gonna be using a bunch of these but epochs is one of them the number of times to iterate over the training data so let's rub this down and you don't have to do I'm gonna I don't think we need all of this printing stuff so I'm gonna get rid of some of the earlier printing things because I don't need to look at all of that so much so let's run this whoops options is not defined I spelled that wrong I guess I still have 44 and 45 console logging stuff which I don't need I didn't get an error that I expected yet which is kind of interesting and oh you know why one thing that I want to do is I want to update you know at the time of this recording I think the most recent version of tension flow chess is zero point eleven point seven well and I when I was previously recording I was using 0.4 and I think some things have changed so it was alright so let's let this run it's it's running for to epochs right now it's finished and I can look at the history and I can see both lost so we can see the loss went down for the second époque that's great now let's run this over ten a pox and let's run this and let's just console log results dot lost by the way or what was it is it results dot history dot loss might be that now let's look at what it is a history history dot loss okay so let's do this whoops I don't need that let's go back here hit refresh and waiting I'm gonna edit out this waiting part or speed up we're doing for ten a pox I'm have a lot I gotta fix I can fix this here while I'm here this is awful cloaking device oh it's back okay great so look at this over ten a pox the loss is going down this is good this is what we want to see now here's the thing what's it using to calculate that law huh oh there's so much to discuss I gotta get myself organized my thoughts here I want to here's I think maybe maybe I've done this video I'm really really drugged breaking this into lots of small parts and really what I've done now is call model dot fit with one single option the two things I need to do that are next one is I need to figure out what's getting that law like what data is it using to calculate that loss is it the training data didn't I talk about testing data and validation data should I be thinking about that it's a point so I've got to deal with that number two is I would like to I the point of this is I'm in a p5 sketch and I could say function draw background zero and I can run this but look at this it just is loading up there all the while while it's training I'm locked I don't have any ability to run an animation I want once it finishes I see the canvas I want the canvas to animate while it's training and I want to see the loss over time I want to have that reported back to me so those are the two things that I need to do I think I can tackle the training the testing and validation data thing right now because let's do that in this video and I'm going to add the animation stuff in the next video so first of all okay so I have my data set my data set has I think it was five thousand six hundred and forty three elements data points in it I said at the very beginning of this series runs preparing the data set that a typical thing to do is divide the data and again this is really small for proper machine learning model robust I probably want to have a much larger data set but this will actually kind of work just fine as we'll see I want to use probably the 80/20 rule saying that 80% is actually the training data so I want to just only use why does it it's because the keyboard is next to this it's going sound I want to I want these X's and Y's to only actually be 80% of that original data so I'm not doing that I'll maybe I'll add that in another point that can be an exercise for you of the view for you as the viewer to take out 20% or maybe because my data centers are small just take out 10% of the data so that's what would be used to test the model after I finish training it but while I'm training it while I'm actually training it figuring out well how many input notes do I want what learning rate do I want what are these sort of taper parameters what are the parameters of this system that I want to try different things how many pucks do I want to train the model for what batch size do I want to use all these things are known as hyper parameters the parameters of the during the training process if I want to be playing around with those I need a separate data set to compute a loss that's not part of the training data but also is not part of my testing data that if you use when I'm completely done training that's what the validation data is the validation data is basically a test dataset but it's not your test data set when you're done and you're ready to publish your model it's your test dates that while you're doing all the training intensive like that jazz has a configuration option for model dot fit that just says hey use this much as the validation data so let's go back over here let's go back to the documentation and we can see here now I could specify the validation data or I could just specify validation split which is a float between 0 & 1 it's the fraction of the training data to be used as the validation data so if I come back here and I just add an option validation data and I say 0.1 I want to use 10% of my training data as the validation data that's what's going to be used to calculate the loss but it's not part of the Train down now there might be an issue I also want to make sure I have shuffle on shuffle is a parameter that shuffles the training data at each epoch because you don't always want to train with the data in the same order as you're tweaking all the weights and stuff as it's doing its training if it's in a different order it's gonna help it out but the validation data I think I looked at this before is before selected before shuffling so it's selected from the last sample so I might have a slight issue or if for some reason the order my data is in there's something weird about the end of it is all one label or something I probably won't like shuffle it myself manually but let's not worry about that right now but that's something definitely to be cautious of well this is so much to think about all right now so now that we've added shuffle and we've added 10% as validation data let me now run this again it's danced around oh it's finished already ten tiny boxes not very long so here we go and we can see this is good we still have a loss that's going down over ten a box maybe we can get this lost even less maybe one train for more epochs maybe we want a different learning rate we need to tweak all that stuff but I want to be least see it and see an animation going while I'm doing that so that's what I'm going to look at in the next video I'm gonna look at how to do an animation by also adding callbacks to these options here okay so ello and async you know I need to make this happen in an async function that's actually I think that it really helped me out okay I'll come back to that in next video thanks for watching so far so we train the model I'll be back soon oh shoot shoot I wrote the wrong thing hold on not you let's go back to where this finished we just run this again unnecessarily oh shoot and I'll fix that okay so I'm gonna do redo the end of this trip okay uh so we finished it trained now with the validation splits and OH breaking news breaking news getting information from the chat that I wrote validation data here interesting give me an error so if I wanted to give it specific validation data that's what I would use but I want to use validation split thank you for to the chat for correcting me there let's try running this again let's give it just more epochs a little bit more time to wait let's give it 50 all right all right so this is gonna be the sped up portion where I could play the ukulele but nobody will hear the ukulele in the edited version of this video why isn't still printing out this one tensor actually where is that there must be a labels tensor dot print alright alright so it's back let's take a look it's ok it's back let's take a look at our loss function over 50 epochs and we can see it's going way down to 0.75 you can see it's kind of stopped actually we kind of accidentally might have you could see how it kind of goes up now we can see like it's not able to get any better so we might not even need 50 epochs but we might want to tune various parameters to see but I'm not going to worry about all that right now the point is I have now trained the model using model dot fit shuffling the data with a certain validation saving 10% for validation I'm not doing proper testing data yet that would come later and 50 ybox okay so in the next video what I want to do is make it so that I can run an animation I can graph the loss function over time all that sort of stuff and not have it kind of like blocking right the way it's doing right now the animation thread and then of course I also need to allow the user to specify a color and get a label for that so those are the next two steps I need to do see you in those videos okay sorry I'm my nose is running and my tissue box is empty I'm out of water I might need a little break let me see if I can find oh I have oh you know what look at me here prepared prepared with the Kleenex uh alright okay how are we doing everything everybody wait wait crazy teenager rights lol I was watching roblox and this on my recommended so did you are you were you watching just like some gaming and this was like arbitrary recommended to you and you just pops here welcome now if you don't know about coding what I'm doing here is probably like the most advanced stuff that I do on my channel and you might want to go back and watch a lot of the beginner tutorials if you're interested certainly don't have to slack is back okay let me see if I can get the slack channel going so for those of you might be wondering the slack channel is for sponsors of the of the YouTube channel or patreon patrons we have patreon it's the same thing there should be a sponsor button you can see I mean nobody eats the sponsor only if you feel so inclined you'll be able to watch all the content but I use that to have a smaller community people asking questions and discussing the stuff I'm trying to connect right now okay looks like it's coming back to me what time is it 1230 I'm okay on time it's gonna be way worse Josh in the chat asked do tutorials on slack BOTS no I would love to though okay okay let me close this thread okay I am now got the slack channel in welcome new sponsor exmiss drink X so I don't know if my kids are at home they don't of school today pay for a babysitter so I could be here to do this live stream by the way so but I set it up my Phillips hue lights at home they blink some sponsors the channel I can't do that here because I'm in a lockdown in the NYU WiFi I new sponsor Kyle right because I should mention the whole sponsorship if you're there thank you thank you to those very kind of you to sponsor it does really help me allocate time to doing these videos and algas thank you for thanking people and I really one thing I really need to do I need to do some maintenance in terms of like getting all the emojis stuff set up on the channel okay you have World Cup winner with prediction with tens of Lodi Jess ok alright I got to move on let's cycle these cameras cuz I got to get out of here I'm leaving for as I mentioned I'm leaving for a trip tomorrow for two weeks do my kids know how to code so my kids are 6 and 9 so I would say my younger daughter I talk and I show her things sometimes but she's really too young to do text based coding certainly and my son who actually is not 9 he just turned 10 was his birthday over the weekend he has done he's taking scratch classes and he's attended actually some p5.js workshops that I taught for fourth and fifth graders so he doesn't know how to do it unfortunately he fortnight is a thing it's very distracting anyway so let me having to get our gaming channel set up all right sorry ok ok all right let's move on now to the next video ok all right okay this is really let me see if I can do some where is it it's over here that it's like if I fold it I think that's better now the Kubo robot that sounds interesting okay okay I don't know about this fortnight thing I don't know if I should be allowing it okay all right all right videos seven thousand two hundred and sixty three of my making your own color classifier with previous video previously on making your own color classifier intense photo yes I worked in the model dot fit function so I'm fitting the model according to my training data with these options now what I want to do is I want to be able to basically see an animation graphing the loss function while it's doing the training so right now I just get a report when it's done so there's a few steps that I want to take to do this the first step that I want to do is I actually want to move this into a separate function so I'm gonna just write a function I'm gonna just make it a global function called train nice train and I'm gonna put model dot fit there then I'm gonna call train here so that's after one and let's let's uh oh and I'm gonna put the options here in this function and I'm gonna just go back to to a pox and I'm gonna run this Oh X is not defined oh boy I did all sorts of goofy stuff here so let's let's make these global variables X's and Y's I'm gonna need to do again just could use some refactoring but now it's training and to epochs done well you can see the loss functions great but still I don't have an animation so what I want to do is I want this to be an asynchronous function I want this function to be an asynchronous function to happen and let things keep going and guess what I have a video series about I do that with the keyword async and then if I say viii if I make a function async I can use the keyword await meaning this function will wait for model that fit to finish before it's done in turns a promise by the way so I can actually take this now I could say return a weight and then I can put my then up here right because it's gonna return that same promise but it will happen asynchronously meaning it will the code up here will be allowed to move on while this is happening in the background in theory but I've got to do more here it's the same behavior hmm so why is it the same behavior well I've set myself up for success but I don't have success yet and the reason why is that tensorflow das is using something called WebGL to do all of the calculations and it's taking over basically your animation or drawing capabilities while you're fitting the model however tensorflow J s comes with a function called next frame which returns a promise that resolves when a request animation frame has been completed it's simply a sugar method so that users can do the following a weight TF next frame so what I can actually do is kind of trigger the animation letting drew the draw loop go the p5.js draw loop is just using requestanimationframe itself by adding a weight TF next frame somehow in this async function so where do I add it so I have an idea I'm going to add something to this called callbacks so and I got a spell callbacks correctly for this to work so let's go back to look at model dot fit model dot fit and we can see that oh look at this this is like a list I was looking in the wrong place but last night when I was looking this up it wasn't actually here these are optional callbacks that can be called during training for example on train begin on train end EPOC begin on epoch and on back begin on batch end so let's just let's add on train begin on train end just for real quick so I'm gonna say I'm gonna have a callback on train begin and this needs to be a function it's gonna my life's gonna be easier if I just use this yes a six arrow notation and then I'm gonna have another callback called on train end and I'm gonna say training complete so I'm gonna just add these two callbacks so these are functions that are going to be executed during the training process let's see if I did that right training start and try to complete and I see the results wonderful so what if I in train begin just make it a slightly longer function which also has a weight TF next frame in it what happens if I await the next frame in it no oh huh do I have to say a sink here wait where do I put that all right that's not what I wanted to do let me go back we're gonna look at the chat while I'm taking a little okay alright alright nobody's discussing anything about like does anybody actually watch the stream or you just come to talk about like different programming languages and why why why why this is making me crazy okay all right training start training complete okay now let's try a different callback let's try on epoch end and on epoch and well it takes two arguments I'm looking over here on this computer because I I have some notes there which I don't typically do but it's the documentation here doesn't actually if we look here it's not telling you what the arguments are for these callback functions but I looked them up and so the arguments are the number of epochs so I can say num and then a log which is like a report so I'm gonna say num and logs and then what I can do so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do console I'm gonna write a function here with multiple lines of code I'm gonna say console.log epoch num and then I'm gonna say console log loss a logs dot loss loss so there's a property of loss that's in that logs object so these are the arguments do every time it finishes an epoch so I'm gonna now give it 10 epochs let's see what happens if I add that call back alright epoch zero epoch one epoch to epoch three epoch four look at that so I am now getting I'm getting a call back for every one of those individual epochs and we can see the loss going down and then of course we see all of the lost values when we're done but now if I want to let it draw something I believe I can say oh wait TF dot next frame hold on timeout did I talk about what I'm so lost in to what I'm so lost like did I explain what TF not next frame is already cuz I went back and forth and I like went down a route and then I didn't want to I think I did explain it shoot I'm confused I'm just gonna have to do my best Matthew I'm sorry hopefully this will come together I might end up explaining the same thing twice okay if I want to draw something at the end of each epoch I want to allow the animation to proceed I can go and use that function TF next frame its whoops TF next frame which allows me to which allows me to sort of unlock the drawing thread and and let draw update itself so I'm gonna go and I'm gonna say a wait TF next frame right here at the end of each epoch and then this is also an async function so this now has to be an async function as well is that gonna allow me to do that I think so yes okay let's try this oh yeah look it's drawing now let's actually add an animation so let's do something like stroke 255 stroke wait for line a frame count modulus with zero frame count modulus with height so I just want to draw a line that is that is moving across so for example if I don't bother calling this train function all we can see here I have an animation that's running okay so now let's call the train function and see if that animation runs waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting let's get to epoch zero I'll look at it so the animation is going but it's only able to draw once at the end of each epoch so while it's training if I want to let it unlock that drawing more often maybe a different callback would work better and in fact one something that tension photo jess is doing behind the scenes and model dot fit sorry is in the callbacks right it's actually batching the data so I have five thousand six hundred data points it's actually running the gradient descent algorithm in batches that's what stochastic gradient descent means and there are also on batch begin on batch ends and I could sort of specify the batch size I'm letting it use a default so what I actually think that I want to use it's gonna be able to it does a batch pretty quickly a full epoch takes quite a bit of time so I can actually do on batch end what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna add one more callback on batch end and I'm gonna make this the async one so it also has a batch num number and a number of logs so it's the like epoch end but I'm gonna put the await next frame in there this one no long as it needs to be an async function so this should unlock the animation much more quickly because it lets it draw every at the end of every batch so let's go to this now and we should see yeah look at this so the animation is running just fine and we should see now it got a little glitch there when I got to the end of epoch 0 let's see if it does that again no I don't know what so the first epoch they must have had to do some copying onto the GPU I'm not sure why but you can see the animation is no longer study stuttering from epoch to epoch okay so now we have a trading the model with an animation going let's at least so what I really should do is graph the loss function and by the way I can look at the loss function at the end of each batch so I can get a much more quickly updated loss function so I'm gonna leave that as an exercise to the viewer but I'm gonna just what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let loss P and I'm gonna create a paragraph element again I'm not really being thoughtful about design and interface here loss so what I'm going to do here is it's just going to have a paragraph element that says loss in it and what I'm going to do is instead of logging the loss to the console I'm gonna say loss P dot HTML and this is using the p5.js Dom library I give use native JavaScript or jQuery I'm going to put this loss information into that paragraph element so now I have an animation going and then as soon as I get to the end of the first epoch I have to talk for a bit here I see the loss function so now I'm training and getting a report of the loss function so for you I'm in the next video what I'm gonna add is inference or prediction I'm gonna allow the user with sliders to specify a color and have the label returned to me and what I would say to you as an exercise is see what happens if you can query the loss function with the batches and graph it over time and so you see that would be an exercise to you as the viewer and I'm gonna publish a github repo with this finished project so you can look for the code this is very confusing but you can look for the code it'll be linked in the description in two different places there'll be the code that matches exactly this video and then there will be the code that's in a separate github repo that and someone in the future people will be contributing to that will have maybe the graph and other kind of designing things that people have from the community have added okay great so one more video to go I think and and then some other ancillary ones that I forgotten about but one more core video to this tutorial series which is adding the and I will see you if you're really gonna watch all of these I will see you in the next video you can check the video's description for the next video link okay okay so that's interesting I should have been looking at the chat maybe I'll cover this in the next video let me try some things so you're saying if I just say return TF next frame I don't need the await an async thing I like this better and then in fact I can just say TF next frame that's the callback I want to happen oh that's way nicer so I'm gonna explain this at the beginning of the next video yeah all right great Oh Dave into the chat let's see where can I find the code to the 500k subscribers map Doozers I'm Way behind I haven't published it yet I you know once the video gets publishes or like a coding challenge then I publish the code if you hit me up on Twitter at Schiffman I can probably it'll be a reminder to me and then I'll reply to you there and upload that code okay okay you want validation loss not training loss donut aren't I getting oh are the do the logs have different loss I thought the logs got lost is the validation lost let me look at this oh that's the validation loss is different I didn't realize that okay great did I say video subscription I meant to say description did I say subscription shoot brain is melting I need water today wouldn't mind if I go get some water I gotta stay hydrated on the coding train as you know welcome new sponsor Thank You FD God my lights are blinking at home if I could be home right now I would see the blinking lights probably off all right okay so thank you so the things I need to cover at the next video are the validation loss versus the loss thank you for that and interestingly enough I think there is a problem with my validation data I really should I need you need to shuffle it and I just have very little data so that's not great and I need to talk about this simplification here of TF next frame okay yeah okay all right everyone I'm back start over all right oh this is getting tiring but I am back and I have yet another in this building your own custom color classifier with 1000 GS series now the thing that I want to add to this video and by the way this line moving across is pointless I just have it there so that I could see that the draw loop is animating that I haven't blocked it there's two things that I missed that are kind of important from the previous video um one is this is actually not the validation data loss I didn't realize this but I'm going to I'm gonna change this here I'm gonna I'm gonna console.log the full logs object so right what I'm putting on to the screen is logs dot loss let me come to the console log what's there so again we have to wait a minute for the first epoch to finish apologies for that okay there are actually two lost values there's the loss function can be computed against the training data and there's the loss function computed against the validation data now to do this properly I really should be using the validation loss because that data that hasn't been done with the training that's that's that's that's protect against overfitting having my model work really well with the training data only the thing is I have a very small data set 5,000 data points I'm just using 10% as the validation data and the weight to the footage s works it also takes that 10% from the end and I didn't wasn't careful about shuffling the data around so this is something that I should come back to I don't know maybe this series will go on to infinity but if I were doing this properly I would actually want to show the validation loss here like this log stop validation loss maybe I want to show both and maybe I want to be more thoughtful about shuffling the data first in advance but I that's not what I said I was going to do in the next video so I'm again leaving that ten rarely as an exercise to the viewer or I'll come back and do it in a future video I don't know yet that's item number one item number two thank you to me I am so me and others in the coding train sponsor patron group I made this way more complicated than it needs by trying to make this an async function in here actually this does not need to be an async function if I just return TF dot next frame so if I just return TF next frame it's actually returning the promise and unlocking the draw loop so that makes it simpler actually I couldn't make this so simpler what am I doing here at the end of every batch I want TF next frame to be executed and so I actually don't need to write a wrapper function to execute see if that next frame what I could just do is set that as the callback the callback again if I wanted to do more with on batch and look at the loss and the logs but really what I want is at the end of every batch to draw a new frame of animation I can just put TF knocks next frame as the function which is the callback there okay so let's this is still working that simplifies the code makes it a little nicer to look at I don't even really need this on on begin and on end but I'll leave those in there just so you see them okay so now I'm ready for what is the purpose of this video the purpose of this video is while I'm training the model I couldn't wait till I finish training the model but I've actually it allowed this to happen while I'm training the model I want to be able to specify a color and see what the neural network thinks that color is so very quickly to do this what I'm going to do is I'm going to create our slider G slider B slider I'm gonna make three sliders again this could use a lot of improvements and I'm gonna use the p5 Dom library create slider function so the slider is a range between 0 and 255 and let's start with like what's this red and green make yellow let's start with a yellow and so the G's the B slider should be on 0 and I want the background color too and I don't know what that's doing there I don't need this line anymore it's distracting I want to say our slider well let's actually let's so I want to say let our equal our slider value so I want to get the values from the sliders I want G and I won't be eventually I'm gonna send these as inputs into the neural network but right now I just want to be able to see that color our G B okay so here we go so now we should see there are three sliders and as I adjust these sliders I can change the color and so what I want whoops what I want is to be able to and I see though what I want is now to see the neural networks prediction down here so how do I do that okay time to use tensorflow touch yes again whoo so I need to make some input data so the input X's are tensor T F dot tensor 2d and an array with RGB in it now in theory I could be running prediction with multiple RG B's right but I'm not so I need an array of arrays in here so this is my input data then what I want to do I want to say model dot predict with those X's feel like you know what I need to normalize those right because the it expects to have normalized values between 0 & 1 so I need to divide each of those by 255 then I need to call model dot predict and then look at the results and that hat oh you know what this doesn't actually happen asynchronously it's the because the data is still on the GPU this is a confusing thing I have to pull I'm gonna use that date I have to pull it out but let's just look at the results of pure results so I should then be able to say results dot print okay so I think this is knee just creating the inputs getting the prediction and then I should be able to see that in the console syntax error who I have an extra extra curly bracket alright okay so we can see this and this is exactly what I should be getting right it is a probability distribution over nine labels now whether it's giving me correct ones who knows but look at that so now how do I get the label out of there well remember that what I'm looking for is I'm looking for which probability is at them at the highest level is it a ninety percent chance of it being yellowish and point zero one point zero two point zero three you know 1% 2% 3% of being the other ones and there actually is a function intention flow Jas that will pull out the index of the highest probability value that's called Arg max right I could write a little for loop or or some kind of function to do that but if I look for Arg max TF dot Arg max returns the indices of the maximum values along an axis so this is can be quite more complex because I could have multidimensional data but I actually get to do this in a really simple way I just want to say let index equal results dot r DX oh and if there's an access of AK c access of one the first there's a onedimensional here so now let me say index dot print and so let me run this and we can see it's just giving me whom is that right is that a coincidence so I should get some different values yes okay so it's actually changing so that that's giving me that maximum index so as I change so so this is my label here's the thing though that's my label but I need to convert that to one of these so 0 means reddish one means greenish two beads bluish 3 means orangish so have this label list already I should be able to just say let label equal label list index the only thing is I can't do that because this is a tensor that's a tensor and what I want I need to pull that the tensor is the numbers the data that lives on the GPU the WebGL fancy thing that TouchWiz has implemented I need to pull that off and normally I would pull that off with an asynchronous function shoot normally normally I would pull that off with an asynchronous function but the thing is here it's such a little tiny bit of data I think I can pull it off synchronously and not slow down my program from running so actually what I want to say here is Data Sync and then which is a dot data would pull it off asynchronously so let's look at and let's let's say I'm a console dot log index and let me get rid of my other console logs that I don't really want to look at right now so okay so I got an array with the number in it I pulled it off and so then I just want to say index 0 so I only need that first value index 0 and so there we go that's the label number I now have the label number and so now I can say this and I can say and let's put it out on a paragraph element so let's say let label P let's have that B first and so now I want to say label P equals creepy and then I should say all the way back down here label P dot HTML label ok ready for this here we go I've started my training oh wait why this is so silly but I want the labels of it I really should not be changing this right now so let me just put it here okay so here we go it thinks that's greenish right well it hasn't gotten very far with the training I would imagine that once we train further and the law starts going down it's going to recognize that as yellowish so here I'm gonna just wait a little bit and I'll be back in a minute let it rain there's some a pox and I'll look at the chat has Schiffman open the slack yet no no I still have open yes I do have a slack open I'm gonna let this run for a little bit I kind of wanted this to appear as yellowish okay I only do 10 epochs I don't know I should be console longing the epoch there we go look look look look look it's learning all right back so he trained over ten a box and you can see now it's saying this is yellowish let me tune this down that's greenish turn this up that's bluish we've still got blueish can we get some purple purplish can we get some pink oh it didn't get pink maybe if I add a little more brightness how it thinks that's pink so I have now trained the neural network to recognize and let's see if it can get red reddish so we could see I could play with this all day long this is now going to classify the color based on that particular model so in a way I'm done I probably want to train it for more epochs what are some things that I want to do so one is I would want to be more thoughtful get more data I would want to be more thoughtful about the validation data and then other thing I would want to start doing is thinking about well does it actually work better what are the hyper parameters that I can play with for example the hidden layer I put sixteen units in it well or what happens if I use a different activation function for the lare what happens I use more nodes or less nodes what if I change the learning rate what if I change the optimization function if I use like the atom optimization function so these are things that all these things are things that I could play with and research and think about an experiment with to try to tune the model really well then at some point I also would want to save that model right save it to a JSON file so the trained model somehow so that I could load it back in without having to run through the training process again maybe I'd even want a larger dataset I don't to train it over a long time me but I want to port this code to node so I could let it trainlike serverside without having to train in the client there's so many possibilities but I have now built a machine learning model with tensor photo how many videos this took that trains a model based on crowdsource color data and if you want if you just a humor me for a second if you remember if I go here this is the system right this system was used to allow people from the internet to click on and say that's like pinkish that's greenish that's blueish tag a whole bunch of colors save all that data in a firebase database retrieve all that data clean that data put it into JSON file load that JSON file here into this sketch build a model train the model with that data and then pulls a new color from a slider oh and I forgotten something memory management oh I knew there was a step that I'm missing estimating what category out of the fixed set of labels this that color is but I did forget something really quite important which is memory management let's look at this num memory of TF memory dot num tensors so again when I create tensors that are allocated to memory on the GPU to store numbers those don't get cleaned up automatically there's no garbage collector like in kind of regular JavaScript programming so 15,000 for 85 tensors now one thing and there's still even more and more and more it's growing this is a memory leak so one place where I didn't clean up any of the tensors is right here and there's a easy way I can clean this up by adding in the TF tidy function so what TF tidy does is it says just put all of this code that's inside of this function passed into TF tidy clean up any tensors that are made there so this will clean up everything for me so now let's run this again and we're gonna take a look at the tensors there's thirty one seventy three it's kind of leaking right well let's let it get all the way through ten EPOC s I'll be back in a minute when that finishes okay it's taking I should add that I should have something that's reporting the epochs oh it finished okay okay so the training is complete and we can see now ah there we go I am no longer leaking tensors now the thing is do I really did I really need 1628 tensors I don't think that I did I think there is also there is also a leak going on inside of this train function and I think there's an issue with this and so I'm gonna I might have to do a followup video about this because at the moment if I go to github.com TF oh oh hold on let's go from here too I should have had this prepared where do I go github and issues and I'm gonna look for fit memory leak this one so I believe there is at present a memory leak in model dot fit with callbacks and you can see that's exactly what I'm doing right where model dot fits with callbacks so I'm gonna not worry about that particular memory leak right now I'm gonna wait for us to see if that gets corrected by the time you're watching this that might already be corrected and this code might have no more memory leaks in it just by updating the version of tensorflow Tijs or I might still be missing something in here to do a memory leak so you know if you don't want any spoilers and/or the following videos the fallout videos have not been published yet you could kind of kind of like sort that out yourself but I will come back at some point and talk about that okay so thank you for watching I wish you many purplish and pinkish and bluish and greenish days all the colors of the rainbow may they fill your days with joy may you make your own classifier with your own data please share with me I don't know it has this helped the world this tutorial series I've missed so much about data and data collection and machine learning and bottles and algorithms but hopefully I've got done something this is not the end it's only the beginning well I'll see you soon in future tutorial videos that up because this playlist probably has about 300 ok good bye alright everybody ok it is 115 I have done what I set out to do today which is finish this example I am now going to I'm gonna leave within 15 minutes at 130 because I because I because I need to do that I'm gonna check some messages here because I have all these texts mission to make sure yeah but 1140 somebody spoke so that my kids are at home with a babysitter they hadn't left the house yet at 1140 the lights blinking so they must have left because I'd get a so that did get a text message saying that the lights blinked at home who was that who sponsored that was awesome ok so that was all right great ok so I'm going on vacation tomorrow for two weeks and so I will be online here and there I let's see there are currently 7 videos edited versions of the color classifier series that have yet to be published I could use help keeping the code getting the code that goes with those videos online if anyone is like coding along or I have all the stuff it Google Drive and wants to help with that you know open an issue on coda train calm no no github slash Cody train slash website could you just help with that but I will hopefully keep up with that matsya who also who is does the editing will be uploading and editing and these videos will get released so the channel won't appear dead but there won't be any live streams until the week of July 15th I have something that I'm really trying to figure out how to do and so I'm looking this can be discussed in the slack Channel I really really really want to get the updated version of this book out I have a new chapter I want to write about neuro evolution I want to fix all the mistakes update all the code and get a p5.js version of this book out this summer is the time for me to do it now when I get back in July I've two or three weeks of being in New York City before I'm out of town again and I was planning to do to live streams per week to keep up with the YouTube channel but I might need to take a more of a break from that so I can focus on the writing of this so I guess I'm curious to hear from people you know the you know in terms of like keeping a youtube channel going you should never what what everyone says is don't stop making content but that's not realistic people have to go on vacation they have to take breaks so I don't believe in that you know the views go down subscribers go down such is life but I do know that there are people who are funding the work that I'm doing through patreon and the YouTube sponsorships so what I want to do is take the temperature how people feel about kind of that funding essentially going towards the time of working on this book taking away some of the time of doing live streaming so we can discuss that in the slack channel I'll be curious for people's thoughts but so I don't know to what my my goal is always for live streams per month that's what I'm kind of committed to and I've actually done five or six the last few months and so July if I did to the weeks that I'm back if I did two per week I'd get to four and August I could get to four but I'm thinking of actually doing fewer and and focusing on the book so I'll be curious for your thoughts about it and me I am so me says that I should work on it livestream working on it pardon there is a way that I could possibly do that I'm gonna have to that's an interesting idea okay so any questions anyone wants to ask I'm very I also really want to get stuff in the shape for the channel but can you have guests fill in I so that's a great suggestion and I do want to have more guests than I've had guests it's it's the same or it's a different kind of work to have the guests it's not the same amount it's not the same work but having guests is would not open up more time to work on the writing of the book it would be a good thing for the channel and for the world I would hope having more guests I would like to do that and I definitely planning to do that but I don't that doesn't solve the problem of allocating more time to work on the book okay any questions from anyone BRIC the world asks what programming languages do you know I would say the one the language that I probably know the best even though I don't know any of them that well is Java with I don't know dare I say second is now JavaScript I mean I only started programming JavaScript like two year three years ago probably longer at this point I'm sort of forgetting how much time has passed I to program in C and C++ I used to I mean like 15 years ago so I guess I know those languages and I've hacked around PHP and Python and Perl as well next time use atom with helu it's very fast let's try that really quickly so I should do a fall and want someone help me keep track of followup videos so let me just try that real quick if I put atom here and then put this here know how do is it just lowercase oh look at that hold on a sec it's I don't know that it's necessarily happening faster but looks like that loss went down quite a bit and it got too yellowish very quickly you know interesting so it's interesting again to try these different architectures I'm gonna put it back because when I published this code alright this is the stream over yes it is over any classifier ideas that we can practice huh interesting question well the next thing that I was planning to do I based on how long this took I'm not so sure about any more of us to do image classification and use convolutional layer so that's something you could sort of try amazingly everything this here is the same just the data the input data is twodimensional and you'd want to add a convolutional layer but to hit two two hidden layers one being a convolutional layer the learning rate should be around 0.0001 probably yeah I you could train it to use the yeah what is your so show hum is asking where's the slack workspace the slack right now is open only to patrons or sponsors of the channel and you will get an invitation if you're a YouTube spot I'm using both systems right now I should probably just pick one at some point but if you're a YouTube sponsor I don't get your email to send you an invite automatically so look through that look at the community tab there's a post there that you'll be able to see where you can find out how to submit your email okay are we going to train or get the Train miles from Python I actually do have a plan to train to do a video about training and LS TM model with Python and then have that train model coming to JavaScript I'm actually there's a great post about how to do this by paper space well let's see if I can find this paper space LS TM Khris Khris no so we could find this paper space LS TN blog yep here it is so this is a post just recently came out by Cristobal who is one of the main maintainer x' and contributors to the ml5 library which and so this tutorial goes through how to work with paper space and train the model with your own data and then run the model in using ml 5 j s which is a higherlevel library on top of tensor photo jazz so that's the other thing that's just too much to do because my other priority is to make a lot of video tutorials with ml 5 but I'll just you know um go as I go and you can see it running here this is so you can see it's doing it's predicting doing predictive text based on the train model okay well I forgot to change atom I thought I didn't didn't I do that right here people are telling me I forgot to change atom but I thought I did and I also being told me I should have a much lower learning rate for Adam oh yeah Riaan for me I would love to do all the things reinforcement learning is actually something that I am most interested in more so in a way than this sort of classification stuff which is I'm also interested in but I haven't had the time to dig into it yet i've been doing neuro evolution and that i have a whole set about that which is kind of reinforcement learning style thing oh is it possible to code the approximation from tau Oh June 28th I don't have a child a challenge oh I mean it should be SGD oh it should be SGD with oh boy the point is you to let everybody else play with this stuff yes I did end the video with SGD oh I see it's fine now okay I don't know what I got it I got it I got it all right because today is coming up I mean this is just though me this is kind of like where is my there it is if I had an idea for a really short coding challenge with Tao I could do I would but let's at least look at the approximating PI code what was it 90 something I don't think we're gonna get a towel day challenge this summer so what do I change here this is the one that's approximating pi so if I wanted this to approximate tau I'm doing the circle probability over the total x for don't I just double it I'm brain is tired oh no I don't I don't although I have to answer this for myself right now so area of the circle is PI R squared that's our in the area of the square is 2 2 times R squared which is 4 R squared so so so this prop this ratio which is R no no sorry this ratio check on probability a pi equals 4 times that probability so if I wanted to do it with tau what is the area of a circle with tau PI tau divided by 2r squared right so wouldn't that be eight we're gonna just be eight looks well the camera went off oh you can't see me sorry everybody sorry everybody this is what I was drawing I was working out the approximation plan I can't do the towel thing now your record PI things and means doubling oh the learning rate has changed oh my god I think I had a point I'm not I don't remember what's in this code x times x plus y times y that's the distance well that's the is less than the radius squares in the circle oh the record PI no oh I'm printing record PI I see oh right of course that's not something available there's no math doubt towel I have to do that oh shoot there we go there we go all right I don't think this is worth me doing as a video coding challenge just to update this one for Talde I guess I could the difference yeah you know you're behind I correct that in the future me I am so me all right so I could I don't think this is worth making into a video but just for fun cuz I'm here and I'm leaving and why not oh here you can't see me let's let me erase all this okay okay here we go everybody maybe I can figure out a way to make this totally ridiculous and it'll be worse it'll be worth having done this close this oh but of course by heart has a Tao song Tao I'll to here I just want to find the digits what do you think accurate happy holiday everybody take point two point eight no there's no point there six point two eight three one eight five three oh seven one seven nine five okay welcome to a special just me wasting time on the internet but you know it's worth noting the day we I noted Pi Day and I made a coding challenge which was an approximating PI by using a kind of dart throwing technique let me close all this stuff up we can run the example right here the idea is I'm throwing darts into my processing canvas and the ratio of the number of darts that land outside of the circle versus inside the circle give me the value of pi now one of the comments I got so much on this video was but you're using PI to calculate pi well no I'm not and I want to be clear about this I'm going to comment out all of these lines of code right here and I'm gonna say print line pi so there we go we can see my approximation of pi right here now I am sort of using PI in the sense that probably the value of pi is used where is their lips function somewhere in here no wait I thought maybe I use the ellipse function oh I do uh in where this ellipse function is drama let me comment this out so now I am not using the ellipse function which probably behind the scenes is using pi and I am I am only you the reason why I'm seeing a circle is because I am calculating the distance of each point to the center and checking if it's below a certain amount and if it's below a certain amount it means it's inside a circle but let's just look here the only place where I might be calling math pie is now commented out I was just using that to compare okay so we can see here that this is in fact not using pi but giving me this amount now why does this work now I already covered this in the previous video so you totally could just go away and do something else right now but if you don't want to go watch the previous video the reason why this works just to talk about it again is if this is a square and this is a circle right the area and this is a value called R the value of the sorry the area of the square is each side of this square is to R so the area of that square is 2 R squared R squared or 4 R the area of the circle as we know maybe from some math class is PI R squared so here I am using the idea of pi but only only because I know that that's the definition of the area of a circle now what if I were to just throw darts at the wall and I would count how many darts landed in the circle versus how many darts landed overall that would be the same so the total darts divided by the circle only should be equal to well this before our squared for R squared divided by PI R squared so now what I want to do is solve for pi ok well first of all the R squared can be is gone so then I could say 4 times total divided by circle total equals 1 divided by PI okay I just flipped those right so pi equals the circle total divided by four times the total total that seems kind of right maybe I got that wrong did I get that wrong because four times circle divided by total well yeah why is the four on the bottom why is the four on the top okay so now if I reverse these I could say pi divided by four equals the circle this should say Circle T like the circle total divided by the total now I can just multiply each side by four and I could say four times circle T divided by total equals PI or PI equals this and we go back to my code we have four times the total number that landed in the circle x divided by the total overall so that's there so now what if I want to approximate oh well what is tau tau by the way is okay so what's the circumference of this circle meaning what's the length of the arc all the way around to PI R well that seems like an awkward way of writing it why do I have to have this to here what if I just had a Val you that instead of being PI was twice the value of pi then I could say the circumference is just that value times R and that's what tau is uh something it's another Greek letter that I've totally botched let me go look up how to draw that better so here's the Greek letter write uppercase to lowercase towel so I can go back and son so I didn't do the worst job here I guess it yeah that kind of that'll be so I could say it's a tau R and guess what if R is one the circumference of the unit circle is tau the circumference of the unit circle is tau naught to PI I don't know people now enjoy the comment section of this video everybody so here's the thing what if I want to approximate tau okay oh boy oh boy okay well the area of this circle is still 4r squared and the area of the I'm sorry area of the square is still 4r squared but the area of the circle pi no no no PI divided cow what is it with town tau tau divided by 2 tau divided by 2 R squared ok so yeah I love this is super nice I gotta say it's tau divided by 2 5 2 where do I want the well welcome to here but do I want the 2 there but let's say I do this then the total weight for R squared or tau divided by 2 R squared so the R's get cancelled out that this becomes an 8 and so now the value of tau guess what you just double it it's just double it's just double pi pi is just 1/2 towel whatever you want just live your life tau and I just ate and then this is tau so we now can go and revise my coding job that's really your so watching this video apparently I'm gonna stop this and we're going to we're gonna make one of these for all of you tau lovers out there this one goes out to all you towel out there from me to you we're gonna change this to record towel we're gonna draw that we don't need to draw that this is unnecessary code just save this before I forget this approximating towel and obviously put this on the desktop of my computer this is processing its java processing org everybody always asks then i'm gonna come down here i don't need to do so many each frame my formula here is now 8 tau is 8 and I can now what I want to do is I need to check the record tau if I get one closest because redo the record and then now and this is now tau and then ah this is just math tau and math dot tau all right oh and this is record tau ok we're good I did it I redid my coding talk what what Java dot math hmm where are the constants where are the constants hold on math dot PI Java hmm yep pi oh there we go here are the constants e we get e we get PI I don't see tau I don't see tell this video is over forget it all right fine I'll devote to it anyway anyway but this is so sad this is what I have to do look away everybody look away don't look don't look and now we are now approximating tau happy towel Day everybody Oh see ya okay there we go that's an extra bonus for all of you people out there on the internet watching this now I really got to go almost two o'clock so again I'm gonna be out of town for I'm gonna be out of town for did I miss something hope not I'm gonna be out of town for a couple of weeks as I mentioned all these edited versions of these videos will all become live well YouTube has this new feature like this new premiere thing so I kind of want to I don't know if that's unlocked for me yet I don't know if you've heard about this but I'm definitely an experiment with that and I will see you all in the future okay I'm gonna I'm gonna end this I'm gonna play you out with my ridiculous thing that I always do goodbye yes so Muhammad is asking you didn't use PI but used the formula for the circles area but that's okay because I mean I have to use that but if I were just using it with dart throwing I wouldn't have to I just have the circle draw and I would see which ones are in and out of the circle right visually okay goodbye everybody Oh dev new sponsor thank you so much all right here goes something we wanted to make some crazy idea to make you you
