okay another matrix math video I I need I mean there's lots more of matrix there's lots more to matrix math and again let me encourage you I will link to in this video's description to check out three blue one brown's youtube channel which is a whole series about linear algebra i'm just kind of implementing the minimum that I need for this neural network example that I want to build in JavaScript so the missing piece and I just talked about at the end of the last video is to transpose a matrix transposing a matrix means take all the rows and make them columns so ABC this row becomes the first column ABC this row becomes the first column yeah now this is yet another function which requires me twitch which requires me to make a new matrix so I'm not actually taking the matrix it's I mean it could take the matrix that redo it but I think what I'm gonna do is make let's just write this function transpose and the first thing I need to do is make a new matrix which I will call result again equals a new matrix and it has the number of rows that it used to have columns and has the number of columns that it used to have rows and I should be able to just say now it should be as easy as it should be as easy as if I was like ever going through the entire matrix and I should be just saying that the results matrix I J equals the and actually I should say the results matrix J I equals the the this matrix I J we see this now it's possible I got this backwards but it should be if I'm writing over all the rows and columns every row column position should become the column row position so I should be able to just say J index I equals the of the new matrix is this matrix I come i J that should work so and then I need to say return again return results okay so let's test this out could I really have done this this quickly very unlikely oh why am I saying plus equals should not be plus equals it should just literally be equal and if I go into the sketch that I had and all I need is a so I'm gonna have this random one and then I'm going to say let B equal a dot transpose and then I'm going to say console dot table a and console table B all right let's take a look I'm not accounting for the number of rows and columns differences I think that I am hold on let's take a look probably get this wrong whoops and of course I need to consult the actual matrix object to see it try this again six seven four one zero nine six one seven zero four nine six seven four six seven four one zero nine one zero nine all right I think we got transpose correct so that's great so we did this we're done we're done with the matrix math videos and it's the next one that will the next thing I need to do is actually start thinking about how does this feedforward algorithm work if I were to write a feedforward function and I were to give it some input by word you feed some input how do I ultimately return some guests so this is where lots of matrix math needs to happen so again if you're interested I'm also going to link to three blue one Brown's video what is a neural network it's an excellent animated explanation of a lot of the things that I covered in the earlier videos in this playlist but what I'm going to do is try to write the code for the neural network right here once we have that done I think I'm going to just try doing a couple tests like I'm going to solve a problem called XOR which is a really simple problem and I'm also going to look at the EM NIST data set which is kind of like the hello world of machine learning with this neural network and then oh then with the idea of just seeing if it works so that I can then once I know that it works I can do some more creative stuff with it okay so thanks everybody and see you in the next video
