we started ok let me just see my recording this hello everyone I'm livestreaming apparently from the interactive media arts program and ITP at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts so my name is dan you're watching the coding train which is this YouTube channel I feel very awkward embarrassing right now I want to just get a couple of logistic things out of the way this microphone is not actually doing anything it is recording audio as like backup audio but there is a new mic attached to the phone that we're livestreaming and so hopefully you can hear me people can hear me yeah ok great so just hopefully let us know in the chat how the audio is oh look at the camera oh I'm looking at the mic yes lettuce thank you let us know in the chat if how the audio is doing hopefully it's going to be better this year than any other year before so this is what you're tuning into there are two programs here there's an undergraduate program called ima interactive media arts there's a graduate program called ITP interactive telecommunications program is a twoyear master's program both of these programs are at Tisch School of the Arts which is this building 721 Broadway in Manhattan in New York City and then a part of New York University so this is the end of semester show of all the students work there probably over a hundred projects I don't know how many we'll get to we've gotten to like 30plus projects before go for an hour or two or two we all into the steam I'm dead Adie who's behind the camera and be true here is helping monitor and so I'm just gonna wander around and show you projects what else do I want to say anything important I think that's good and then at some point I'll also probably try to make an edited compilation video of just the highlight some of the projects alright so let's move hey Kenny how's it going over there you want to be our first project okay so we're gonna come on over here so um tell us your game and a few seconds about your project then we'll get some kind of you know that you can play in the browser like several ways dad was pretty vicious no uses facial recognition too and then the other way of putting it is here the touchscreen I'm familiar with the bumpier maybe tell us a little about the origins mister the thumb piano I just been I'm interested in the thumb piano as the shapes are like meeting the calabash which is round because this is like a modern version you know which is like a square glass you know with a resonator in the middle I made it actually for people with finger muscles or like an adaptive twin browser we're not having to worry about the notes you know with p5 for now there's no requirement to use b5 Jesse relieving to use p5 to do it because you know it gives you all the tools instant like it's an ml 5 pho this okay we try this project here can you tell us about it tell us their names created okay so that's the next person won't necessarily get that compliment look at a random one but that one is just I love the idea of just like a database yeah okay yeah we'll just tell people to talk louder so that doesn't surprise me they we we have we've never had like a great audio at least I'm capturing this audio and we'll be able to put stuff together afterwards but thank you so for the first time ever perhaps oh I remember something I want to talk about the first time ever but it's been a little while but now this year at the ITV show there is a performance room and this is actually the performance schedule so at 426 p.m. Matt Ross will be performing pillow talk oh there's an introduction before that Emma will be producing complication of the computer mouse at 454 p.m. can you tell us what that's enough yes sure a lecture based on about six months of research on the computer house as an object also talking about how gender is an active through the materiality of yeah don't worry about speaking up into business it's this mic that's actually picking you up cool great well we're gonna try to sneak in to catch some the performances that would be great we're gonna be right on time okay okay great all right all right you do you want to tell us quickly about your projects I just tell us your name and if you worry about what we're seeing here my name is Michael bloom my name is Michael Blum and this is a platform to help educate users about some of the recent advances in natural language generating technology which are are basically you can consider algorithms that are capable of generating text similar to what you or I would would write and I think it's important to sort of learn more about them and know more about them because not only would be better able to sort of harness these technologies were creative ends but also just be more conscious of some of the sort of notsogreat things about them I mean there's a lot of issues surrounding bias and misuse so those are some things that I'd like to sort of shine some light on maybe we'll find this online if they're looking for it it is not currently I'm playing okay great well we're gonna include links in the video's description to all the different projects so hopefully if this goes online people will find it through there great kid awesome okay let's come check this out yeah so you can Jeana and this is p5.js shaders I worked on with my partner Lisa LSL and it's essentially a collection of examples of shaders in p5 that are basically and a guide to basically show people what they can do with Jada's and p5 why they want to use stairs and p5 versus your load pixel function webcam and haven't been running in my browser it's not slowing down they're very perform it just might let me a since I want to use them here's the documentation case go through the why the what the how and like this is just like some kittens with using load pixels to increase the brightness depending on distance mounted using shaders and weight faster you just switched from low pixel shader by clicking that button yeah oh wow so what would you say if people are they maybe they know a little p5 they know a little but have never done any change before the idea of shaders completely dude yeah well how where would you suggest that they get started is this a place where they could get started with yeah you can definitely get started here we go through what shaders on how to get them set up and peopIe and even I like some explanation about what's actually going on in the background yeah it's if you want to and even how to use this resource with other resources like book of shaders right and this is the URL up there yeah also bitly /p fighters okay so that's a bit ly /p v shaders cool maybe I get that requested a lot yeah pearls are shaders and I have never done that so this will be helpful great thank you great ok coming this way hey you want to join us in a little while in a little while yeah we're gonna maybe take a little break from me and have a Spanish language version of the live stream okay let's come let's stop here talk about the feedback mer no you tell us your name and a little bit about your processing it's using using the letter AI to visualize the camera image but it's also measuring the overall image to create some sort of feedback ice adjustable so when you started now I can understand what's going on much more now so this is very clear to me I see the onetoone relationship between pixel um kind of angle of this line when you started that had this almost like swirling fluid like quality to it what what's that a factor they stock so that's off right now because it depends on the value you call in set up so even if you change it afterwards it just stays that way so these are exact same two things but this one is and it is 3d effects outside so under strong language it's a very unique you know seen lots of variations of this kind of idea but this idea of having this extra feedback angle it's very unique and creates beautiful effects okay this is the crater creator super fun game pick up Billy's bread you tell us your name and a little bit about your project sure my name's Billy Bennett and I have a c5 sketch with some particles which he may recognize in the nature of code see yeah I I rigged up this musical wand to play music as you swing it across in a way that surprised you or they weren't expecting um all right you'll see a lot of waiting around it's mostly a lot of waving around and confusion they're like what do I do but once they kind of get to the left and right motion yeah I really love the way instigating these moments of the ball popping up it's very like really cool thanks okay I know this might be hard to explain in this context well let's give it a try sure so will you tell us your name and a little bit about your project sure my name is Dan ovett and this is my thesis that I can either selfdriving in it it's about what does the future feel like when our device sir making decisions for us some that are very uncomfortable so yeah don't worry about this microphone okay so making when a future where the devices are making decisions for us that might make you know make us uncomfortable so I made a artificial intelligent device that makes me do what's very uncomfortable which is talking to strangers and the way it works is it when it identifies people it I don't you can see here at the camera so there's like it's identifying people using a quarrel which is a machine learning piece of hardware it gives me an instruction and then I basically went around parks in New York and Subway's talking to strangers and here's documentation video and yeah it's it's a better experience with sound off but you can check out my website and see like the nice documentation video but yeah it was a great project I spoke to a lot of people and then found bent boundaries I never thought would have existed yeah and can you talk about so for someone who might be familiar with a little bit with machine learning yet maybe has done some stuff like on just either javascript in the browser or using tentacle on Python what's what do they need to know or figure out to get it to run on a Raspberry Pi like you've done here sure so this this Raspberry Pi is using what's called a coral edge GPU accelerator which can do machine learning locally without you know sending indicative internet and basically the API is super simple you just send this thing an image and then it'll give you back detection boxes boxes where it estimates a person is or a chair or a cup and you actually don't need to really know that much about machine learning to use this because it's a few key lines of Python code where all that stuff is extracted away and it's using a preach what's called a pre Turing machine learning model which has been trained to recognize about 70 objects whether Yolo models mobile not mobile net okay it's mobile yeah but at some research that's something I didn't get to finish for this would be was being able to trade custom models to recognize specific objects but I want to work on that on the summer so that people could basically create any kind of detection model and then upload it to the gross they can create a machine on your device that's best for that's what's best for them custom personalized myself yeah great job yeah I just have you changed your behavior now when you're not using this yeah I mean I start start asking liquor he says today go and get like really nice responses that I would've never I mean I don't really to be honest like it's just made me understand new things about people yeah and I don't really use it that much anymore but it's just to change my perception and yeah yeah just a more more aware people on the street yeah so tell us a little bit about what you made and I worked on a project where I looked for people in the Library of Congress who are featured in The New York Times is overlooked obituary feature so I put together a day to say the 16 people who are about half the people who have been recently given obituaries only for the first time so some people you might be surprised and they didn't receive it on time to die so I decided to ask like in another institution have they been overlooked it there as well so I asked some questions put together some data by like searching the online collections of the Library of Congress and use that to kind of power the interaction here so the questions down here correspond to the buttons that you can press to find out like are they in the library promise at all do they have a name authority file do they have a subject heading and you can see that you like to start to fade away kind of representing how they might define what it's like today and then I started become extensions which is on my laptop over there playful an exhibit of someone and then I'm interested in like collaborating and like working on the dataset with others I know can you tell us a little bit about the class because this class was a collaboration with the Library of Congress and did you get what feedback did you get from them and what was it how did that process work yeah so some of us I think you were in a class taught by Jared or old artists in the archives and he was an innovator in residence at the Library of Congress for the last year so through Jer like this group of students got to build projects on top of the collections like the help and feedback I got was really great so like through that class I got to talk with bank Metcalfe who is a recommending officer at the library for like gender and sexuality so it was great to get her take on like how our items in the library like decoded with data and how are they find a bowl from her perspective and me even got to go on a field trip to the library which was super fun so we got to see a lot of things in the Library of Congress is an amazing place you can visit you should visit anybody can just go in there you get a library card you can check out stuff nobody's there anymore compared to used to be that researchers would have to make their Bogalusa Library of Congress find information to their research but now there's so much beauty and wonder there now it's really cool and you can still go down to the floor and see the card catalyst it still experience what it would be like to find things awesome great job okay okay oh we've got VR projects you can't really test VR project but you could give us the ones version of what is Island and it is actually based on my the memory the travel memory helped my grandma so basically in their VR sees the user will be welcoming a wood house you will be creating by my grandma and then she asks you do you want her grab her for me have you say yes and then you will have to finish two tasks so this is kind of be a game as well the first status you would feed the chicken so the chicken is aware you feed the chickens you become into edit this is your first tag and the second tax will be you help my grandma to pick up the badges in order to have the breakfast so this will be a very interactive VR games not just sitting there you have to like you know okay so tell us your name and a little bit your project is a lot of stuff to look at here so maybe we can just have you explain it for a little bit and then we can kind of have the camera walk around and speak loud into that microphone so my name is Yao and this is my business project for life in a nutshell there is two parts the first part is a series of sculptures they have 13 from birds with that as and the second part is an interactive installation people can interact with it and they need to make a post exactly like what the sculpture shows and then they will become part of the character to experience different stages of life did you throughout the process of making this was there because you were there new discoveries that you found about how the history of these characters and what they mean and how they out and you have a juicer sense of them as you use them in daily life by doing this project I was also very inspired by this project I made so they are actually deriving from the ancient Chinese character called Oracle bone script the Oracle bone script were considered as the first fully functional and mature Chinese written language so from a lot of the discoveries and findings from scholars we found that since they were pictogram and based on the findings also my design I put human character in each of this Chinese written character some of them has one human being but most some of them have two human being so as you can see here so for example this character this means first it means that the first sprout freaked out from the ground and that means first and for the other character like home it means that two people they hug each other's under under this small roof and then it means home and for example sky you can see that from Asian peoples I actually sky is very small sky just a little difficult little squares so that's all our imagination about the world about sky and also the cards and happiness happiness is so simple it's just like playing and dancing to music like an instrument things happiness and here is love it means two people holding hands with each other and love forms and here our hometown hometown nice to people having meal with each other and they will chat and they will change and then share their memories about their hometown their native place and here are that that is like one people one people gone one who is God and the other people who still alive and those people who still alive groups for the people who already gone so it means that in Chinese characters documentation footage of your installation it's really remarkable effect of characters and the particles going back forth between the human form in the character form easily all right we're gonna try to interact with this project click on the backpack like a very rare sight at iGPS a Windows computer never see that here how many stages where they're all together and if people want to see I don't want to see all the different stages you have this the video documentation online somewhere you tell us where it is people get fired yeah beautiful work it's it's really magical to have it simply recognize your phone and for the how you easy to break backpack pretended I got that affect on computer I can walk I can also now wave and I'm pleased that can I work it's kind of hard to show anyo this would be our brother okay so yeah give us your tell us your name in a short explanation of your thank you for visiting the Museum of Technology history today we have a really exciting exhibit it's a rare artifact in the early 21st century as you all know Automation what a lot of people started through the underground weeding experiences starting to be created and people made these virtual waiting speakeasies so in this the yards of it even you start in our virtual museum and then you can go down a hallway into one of these historic waiting awesome cool and as anybody's we actually this may surprise you or yeah it's really really it's been a good Congress it's been great big job all right countries countries now let's sit here it looks cool okay let's all right thank you guys you guys are together you polish your games you have to keep up so did this microphone to speak up and touch your native village my name is Tony Capraro I'm Adrian Batista TV one and we still have two other group research which is Karen do and it's yeah are you ready to start yes yeah sure no process here we like that you can tell that's accepted well what you're gonna be doing to be joining the CRISPR detective unit today your goal is to find members of the metastasis mafia these are the genes that cause cancer cells to metastasize and spread throughout the body so obviously we want to be able to identify those and we'll give you just a couple seconds to review the evidence board to get an overview about DNA and genes a little refresher but I guess well people online somehow participate in the chat can like solve the mystery whoa what we're gonna need to play a game so we need two players is there anybody who could play it with like Dan with you like Veronica would you like to be welcome to your first mission this is the prechristian era where genetic research was a little bit cumbersome not always accurate now it's the most efficient so to illustrate that point you're gonna be doing here is using your sense of touch gonna be trying to find the bad kid the ones that cause metastasis they have an etching okay so the genetic civilians the ones that no effect on metastasis are gonna be smooth so put your hand in the jar when you find metastases mafia gene member will pull it out and you'll go back in for more and get 30 seconds right it's my left hand sure we're good disadvantage or both are you ready okay ready as you can see it's a little cumbersome it's a little frustrating and editing day was like the little scrap give you see does that what you can do now is enter the modern era where people like you identify and then a DNA sequence is faster and cheaper than ever before Christopher makes it possible to eat a thousand genes at once and evaluations it becomes an experience of members of the metastasis amount Chris Berg has opened up over to new research opportunities for scientists in genetics detectives can help save our genetic Police Department's a lot of time we're still searching for members on metastasis mafia many as you can detective each fingerprint to me tape with Christopher and the machine but if one oh and so okay and what if I find one what do I do it you put it okay if you get goal was to try to simplify how crisper what use use now and how to technology was before to make the user feel like frustratedly was like really slow and we did money if I faster and it's like more like what's what's the best anyone's done with maximum I wanted to make it we started with just one we realize what's going to frustrated yeah but still you so like today we see yeah now it wasn't to make it slow and really frustrating great job yes really amazing full fully fleshedout project of installation thank you okay can you tell us about your project this is my forget I call it no your English conversation because I'm so tired about people taking photos in your dreams and extension sometimes they really don't care about our work itself the only one is a post on Instagram so I mean very Instagram goal and when you're trying to take a photo of it is soft so maybe you can try it feature do you want to come use your phone and pretend you're taking a picture join a club use your phone and pretend you're taking a particular give me a second and what are you what technology using the detective Bowman I used something called open holes if the library can see now you may have the scarlet antibodies right so it's actually not looking for the I know in fact it would do the same thing with me just doing this we are taking photos the kind of gesture are very similar so that's why I'm a little with have a scholarship dimension and this project of pull out shown you on TV those three creatures are from Chinese mythical stories of the have special policy to like to the great music or listen everything happen in the world so actually it's a it's kind of like performance but 12 right now is a exhibition that I will bring step by step so back to this interface all those interface our web page so everyone who has internet access to those two page this is like playing page and this one is it's a submission page that the audience can participate as damage new way for maybe and well automatically show here be real time and it's done random and this this is the controller of the of the program the audience Ament and we also fought em alone when they combine they become a sound thank you so much thank you okay let's keep moving this way about your spaceship so I'm eating it right so tell us a little about your budget hi I'm James this is 100 days of spaceships before it was all for a class called 100 days of making the class 100 days of making which was about iterating on a theme so for a hundred days each day you have to make something new and part of the class is about trying to break free from the chains of perfectionism it doesn't matter if it's good or not you just have to post it and another part of the class was posting it publicly so this was all on Instagram and each of these posters represents two days of spaceship making the first day was modeling a spaceship and in the second was animating the spaceship and this is basically the results this is all 100 no this is all 100 well 50 but because they're animated and modeled he so I also wrote a little description for each ship and that's what's that's what's logged here with all those printouts and then on this side is the final animations finish as well as the process did you use the same tool for every single one right I did work with something that I wanted to do is learn this tool it's called blender I use the open source 3d modeling software called blender I wanted to get to know it a little bit better so I use that for all hundred days great job thank you thanks for stopping by the wall to come in you tell us your name and about your project yes so my name is Johnny and this is a project for a team of three Helen and Jenna and they're also in this project and we're making a music box for our children specifically age from 4 to 6 and we just want to deliver a very playful experience to encourage them to be more interested with music making and also maybe become DJ or composer when they're young so we're just wanting to actually inspired by traditional music box and then if you'll turn it faster allied watching truster and the future a slow you wanna switch places and also there's a the card is some occasion for different instrument by inserting we're just hiking the stops making and then this is the key or turning it off so face turn off ownership yeah yes that actually one of them so simple and elegant and just the interaction is so satisfying remember turning that it's a really great job what when how many of these could you possibly like imagine baking so radically it can be like a lot but right now we're using stretches right so right now there's only three combinations and we have to make it on symmetrical because children especially like though they don't have an order so we're just making it more like stable for having like two different so I got symmetrical connection but ideally we want to make more options and even more children maybe one day they can just cry there on the card and then just awesome great job thank you so much hey didn't you tell us your name and a little bit about your project you have to speak up probably a little bit yeah go meow trade and it's a lab that is turning the movement of the algae under a microscope into the movement of the white here it's a webcam based microscope and by attorney different ways sometimes they're smaller in nature see that the light actually I wish it could be put into maybe bathroom or someplace that so that we can have a really wide feeling about life great job sorry we can't do the VR projects of it can you tell us your name about this project my name is Koopa and my project is called cat it is my experiment on generate film completely using AI and this is like the very very first step of doing that so what you're seeing now is my first experiment on using neural network to combine human portraits with different things that are ubiquitous in our lives so what you see at the top is include human Porter mixed with cats bitmoji donut power all that ripped jeans and the video is showing how we could do animations for atom human tortured mixtures by manipulating the laitanan factor in neural network so you're say we're seeing a rendered version of it or if it's running in real time and how long did it like what's the amount of time for frame it's 30 frames 30 frames per second and it is because my laptop's not powerful enough so that's like prerender than generated oh no I just meant like how long does it take you to record oh it's like did you have to run it for days just an hour I think it's about the two hours yeah some very cute and also incredibly creepy castle yeah some people would say it's like putting icing yeah to us yeah great job thank you okay you need a peek behind the scenes money there's no way for you to avoid being on the camera now okay all right tell us your name and a little about your hi I'm Brent I made an AI mirror that uses face recognition to only work as a mirror for me which is very vain in retrospect I'm not sure how well it will show up on camera but like you can try looking in there and it's best in simple alright yeah see it just kind of glitches out when you're in there and I go up to it and stand very still yeah we'll turn back into a beer there we go alright let's come and check out these plants and then after decide it's not a place anybody wants to be alright tell us your names and about your project well why don't you stand next to this pleasure principle and it aligns the bodies in builtin reward system with creativity and essentially it loves the amount of time you use this drawing app which we've made a vibe to charge this pleasure device as I will call it for future use and right now we were featuring it in live mode so it will actually react when we draw oh my gosh I'm bout it righthanded drawing I'm a lefty and it was made for quantified humanists with Joey was an amazing oh cool it's a behavioral intervention uhhuh do you create an internalized incentive towards creativity what's the camera for anyway they can I think art is Terry for Humanity and I think as much as as much as pleasure is I mean we wouldn't be here without it you know so good job thank you you can tell us about your project I'll stand in front of it sound that so yeah this is just a largescale interactive interface that suppose reacts to touch and there's light animations and different sounds depending on what mode it's in so it's a MIDI piano and one mode right now it's in like a other note solenoid mode but yeah just you know get people to come up and play around awesome very colorful and delightful I didn't turn bright red all right let's we're gonna moving along all right we're like we've we've hit like quite a bit of this show how you do how's your shoulder how's everything going to err glance which okay so this is Alex right so your name for okay I'm Tampa and if you take city and this is a project like water this is simply chop down and make a song it's a feather in the half on the butt yeah you can keep shooting that but the surface like this is like that like an acrylic sheet and then we pen in it with like water resistant spray so that's mind Waters has been helping like that and how do you do this sensing that's the camera right so this is what we're going to talk about a lot which is that you can create a computer vision project where you can control the environment you have an incredibly high contrasting thick space you can do so much with yeah this is like the perfect here for that but it's a testament to that so beauty of this project could it never occurred to me to even look and it's just so first peter is random like that Connor say it's not bill it's just being so reading back to see the top water and those apps in meadow there are actually trying to send both water and water it never goes off yet sometimes yeah that's a beautiful job thank you project later okay let's tell us about your project hell surname in America project date except for the customer from Japan and my TV first year and I my daughter actually made his life we get made together I like the way you put the lights under it gives it a very blowing like politics and people how do you have kids at the show come and play with it I wish we had the baby playing with your pocket right now about what to me and I created a project called ENIAC girls program and pretend so what it is is a speculative playset for girls to get them interested in programming but the place that also references the history of inequality surrounding women in computing so here it is the motions of being a programmer and the first so you can move around like you can turn knobs and like rearrange connections just like the ENIAC girls of the 1940s in yesterday there was a person here who just was like it seems to me like they were here for 45 minutes oh look there's a giant dinosaur why don't you tell us your I'm sorry am i interrupting here never know gets that's my head interrupting it felt so first thing machine and then introduce your dinosaur Maya through it d Dino Dino Dino Dino Dino for the states we partnered with dr. Michael Graham he know who's a geologist and also a researcher at NYU and he specifically studies mass extinctions so we made an AR app we're going Friday to become a geologist by standing the rock layers for evidence of the station and more information about her sister enviable so the way it works is this is usually and if you find an object you can scan it in an AR component will appear so this one's one of our favorites if we call him ancestors true because he is the ancestor of all placental mammals so we really wanted to kind of emphasize this idea of fieldwork and there's so many sense of discovery that you have as a scientist you can actually read a little bit more about it our our ideal setting is definitely like a museum or something so if someone wanted to read a little bit more they could you can exit out back into this search mode and then look for other things summer animations which are like these are like fungal spores a little bit more and then we have some static components so like for example our favorite dinosaur yeah that's mass extinction not everything on the wall will trigger an AR component because science is hard and you have to search for the answers to your question what was the collaboration process like with the scientists who work with and have you gotten any feedback or as the scientists coming to see it here at the show it was really cool we just got to sort of talk to him about his work he was definitely like handson enough to give us all the information but also it's just like I give you sort of ownership over what you'd like to do like how you want to communicate it so it's a really fun way of using AR the scale of what you have built is it really makes it work I've been because he imagine if you didn't have this tall size thing you could really imagine building this out even with a larger scale in his hands years Wow tell us about your project my project is a sound exploration in they are so my idea was to see what happens if I said sound sources and sound source elements in the space and we can move around without out that kind of meant about the beautiful aspect understand that's basically waiting maybe maybe you can move around the tip to Dublin I'm proposin writer yeah superfun the process music is really nice it's very soothing and soothing and lovely to listen to thank you so much Sonic Youth's instrument a set of instruments I made for a final performance as it for this class down in space using 17 speakers okay we've been going for about an hour I could do it let's go talk to Ty about his back working the weather though okay so my name is it I need and this is my thesis project that's me the story basically it is storytelling application for parents and kids let's see how it works telling the Machine what kind of story you want today then lion and a man channel travelin company the forest and there's the lion what happened next Daniel I have to say something the man has a lion if you would like something to eat see story bird you said they're going to become the bird become a sandwich yeah and how does it arrive at the end what happened to be introduced in the end yeah based on the labels benefit their morale India they want to find out more dot XYZ thank you Jessie can we check out your project yeah sure could you just tell us her name a little bit on your project yeah my name is Jessie Simpson I moved a catchable MIDI controller that uses fiberoptic cables to patch between light sources and light sensors for triggering MIDI values and MIDI notes and my computer software so unfortunately we're hooked up with headphones right now so you can't hear it but this is essentially how it works where we have a step sequencer down here on the bottom and as these different placements cross over these buttons that are activated they send pulses of light through these cables and then activate different sensor this sensor grid here what here why don't we give audio little break okay and you could say hello the IQ show happy videos I'm working a TB y vamos a ver la projector could be an end i worked and emerson aki gala une metabolic o gente Chile Matabele comentary Colombia a Gila present and Superman hello first moment we do when our Joe saw a Brahma war so he technical mental age among educational technologies but realm is necessarily about web I'm a web developer pride to be and it's a great place to be maybe sooner also become a student so deprecated somebody though which prices have you seen already so basically to see if they are perfect in terms of being equal having like equal resolve between the six numbers so basically you're trying to prove that the each number will have will come at six of the time as you wrote to be surprised about how the dye each dye is the different from another which ways make a portrait of the knife and reveal its native tangled right security so it's a now you get to so the dice is also dancing the music suffice I surveyed my humans but it's very close to suit this has been running for I guess we each numbered like three thousand times maybe a Latin America nice nose do you wanna suspended venison imagine automatic okay hey Sam thought I get on come on yourself a little down haladki see I'm gonna power Depot when I check out all right okay yeah so hi my name is jeff fretts and this is my project is project it I think and my thesis project is write a statement which I practiced a million times is my thesis is about applying a style transfer to to 360 imagery so a style transfer is a computational technique where you can reimagine to photograph in the style of a painting and I using images from Google Streetview I'm able to create art that forms a connection that inspires the viewer to connect with the actual locations yeah we can do that over here so we are Penn tech so we're using web PR we've got good look at this it's immersive she can look around everything looks the style is applied even look is this prebusiness preprocess yes prerendered so it takes about five minutes for each one this particular each of these images have about two and a half K resolution and I need to use more GPUs no harder gunfire so I'll do that after the semester is over but the neat thing about this is the stylism is even in continuous and there are no seats which is different yeah yeah exactly learn more about how you did that there will be yeah I'm ready to reach this paper explaining how it works but the data structure is called a tensor shear which is a spherical data structure that supports indexing using spherical coordinates which is like latitude last year and because of that I was able do this so yes when people Street here nice yeah so using their API I was able to collect some pictures that I do that into my algorithm this figure one looking at here is there a watercolor painting that I made as part of my thesis research everyone's in here so what happens Mitch Pacwa system and how these ladies networks and then also the repercussions of it like how you can be tracked what these are and basically just being more aware about your privacy okay Japan and how to kind of be more secure internet advertisers parking it's very hard to explain topics like this we give this in like 40 pages yeah you can also find us online yeah privacy you can print your own and I just follow that it off and you have your team now you going letting you out of you a little bit yeah if you guys want okay with it is this fun okay here we are with guest host planet hi how are you your project yeah my name is Sean first year student here at ITP my project is called the choice and it is basically a scenario based fictional narrative that walks the player or the reader through different scenarios of the main characters saying where he has to make choices in the world or the age of surveillance and so my message through this project is there's no right or wrong choice but there are well informed choices when it comes to surveillance and data collection so let's educate ourselves thank you so is this online can somebody play this yeah also ruse is Kirikou to play the game Gary looking will you tell us your name and about this project yes my name is su Kenya this is the collaboration with Nick who's run away right now it's a project prevalence it's essentially a router and the router leaks liquid as data is leaking through our bodies as you browse the internet so I can we go to BuzzFeed for example so these are the sort of domains it's hitting which are not force field these are third parties and as you can see there's like this liquid that starts running but it's basically just to shed light on the fact that there's this whole industry going around on surveillance for profit and sort of tracking up a neighbor online and creating these profiles of you we have a new guest host now and whoever holds the microphone has to get to can you introduce yourself and say who you are people might recognize from previous ideas I'm not evil in see a no current Ana okay I'm good I'm good right now I'm enjoying this job you want to tell sir I took a bus to our project coffee and hiked working together so the concept is like insect social media that will but when you buy some product you feel like you've got a product when you buy sneakers you got a box right but Facebook users download it from the App Store it seems like so easy but our concept is this when service is free you know the customer you are the poorest nation yeah so we make the concept of a box this is the face pop that be boring so we imagine that Facebook happy Diwali product and the dstring but actually it's not because yeah this is the product and to raise awareness of that we use Facebook and read the instruction to create an account with your personal info it's a user treatment provide activities data to us as much as you could to make sure that you will get a personalized advertisement that can return and help us by sharing feet fake news and political messages that influence your online friends during elections okay I said listener when you open the box it will like secretly like capture yes by face detection and upload you to web server so if the web server is running I think it should be here yeah yeah so now you become a part of the product so according to a research that last year Facebook make $24 per user and tono gonna be like 55 billion dollars so actually we keep the tamil print we see but you know print a receipt yeah for you guys but so you can take a photos or like yeah enjoy with this furniture in class this is all so I combined me and my partner Mike we work on this we combine too fast like villains about social security web server so we combined security and video together and if economies and project it's called I can't breathe it's a homage peace to Eric Garner's last words and then the documentation of how who died it's a data visualization face of black deaths at the hands of police brutality so essentially what happens is the street goes through the days of on a date where there were no deaths of and on a day where life to the hand of an officer the calendar pauses the lungs completely deflate and shrivel and crunch week before the calendar the next day come to work everyday which is now moving backwards to January 23rd which is a cumulative of 80% of which have had no judicial investigation and 73% which were unarmed so my next iteration hopefully will account for like an entire dataset but it takes two hours just to witness January 2018 alone so that's what I have today and use this programmable error which is a circuit board that was invented by a second year and ITV named on the table and so it's a it's a Arduino compatible instead of like like pumps and motors that allow you to like code just like you would an LED or any other kind of electronic device when you want to push air into a locationtracking slash surveillance project goal is to identify devices and see where so what we're doing is we're basically scanning the nbody web and looking at different passes wires and seeing who's connected to which I explained it and if we know who's connected which at this point we kind of know in that radius the floor map and the different access points located and we start visualizing the MAC address of the devices we see right now we see 60 90 people on the floor and it keeps changing over time with huge antennas visualised I'm using up to five just interested in learning more about like surveillance technology and privacy underdog so my name is Stefan Stefan step back that's like anyway so what you're looking at is a USB device that is connected that reactor through your browser used if your internet so if you visit a bandwidth heavy web site it will switch from what it's in now it's cooling mode which is actually pulling the inside to heating and and when you what's in here is actually a iceberg st. Ice Cube and so when you switch to heating mode like dramatically increases the speed at which the iceberg melts and and once enough of it has melted it will actually trigger a simulated shortcircuit which leads to all the monitor setting off and prevent you from using the device any further so the ideas that it's called representative of the way in which bandwidth heavy web browsing is destructive but also based on the structure in the sense that in this case it means you can use your computer anymore and obviously in the larger scale there's a pretty severe consequence of climate change so the idea so I can even show you how it works essentially right now if I were to visit say Netflix this is my example that I've been showing a lot and do something like show you planet Earth you can actually see that it's switched to heating mode now so it's actually both the color but also the temperature isn't so it's now actually heating up inside there obviously there is a certain electron like trick amount of energy electricity it suits us to run your devices but ultimately the large majority of the vibrates applause for this sort of activity especially streaming is that there are these massive server farms and a lot of with a lot of which are running on nonrenewable energy so it's like it's you know the electricity to run the computer that's the electricity to to keep the whole spaces pool to function optimally and Netflix is one of these you know all all the all the major tech companies are helpers and athletes is particularly bad when it comes to making use of renewable energy in that server maintenance so it sort of yeah exactly so it's sort of like the goal really is to just bring attention to this environmental cost that is generally invisible to consumers because there's no it's not usually thank you thank you thank you for being the the host Thanks my name's Lauren rays I'm a designer and I participatory design with low vision of blind designers and makers to convert all the material that's used to teach physical computing and itv2 tactile so these are the original symbols from the P comp site I printed them out and I random let's call this wellformed machine which reacts to carbon and black ink what they did to puff up and then this is the 11th iteration of each symbol using the door design so a lot of the elements are hollow with the solid symbols are less discernible we have brown is changed significantly because shapes are more eternal so just getting them to be a quick read and then after I took all these learnings I applied them to all 50 of the Wisconsin attics so we have 50 of the schematics used to teach this company tactile and what happened after that was it became like a funnel so if somebody needed a schematic that was tactile they've come to me and I realized I was the only one making them so what I did was I created a style guide with templates so teachers and students some slides this time the Braille these are how to handle leader lines and labels so just some examples of what you get when you check out there's also a birch movement of the worktop of the next phase of this research as I wanted I want to find out if I can use these to actually hook up the circuits themselves and then I want to start materials for this benefit okay this is super fun the budget white flag my name is Cameron Party I'm a first year and I made a game called colour crazy we said explain the game so I made a aqua to reality mobile application and the goal of this is just to make something fun I'm an aqua to the reality and also to trick your mind because you're tapping on the color not the word of like different colors around here okay to tap on all the blues and it's the dark blue and feel free to walk around what's your why do you think 46 19 or something our application well Marilyn later on a friend to share their secrets and the Morris the cat is our daughter her name is bird and when you feel very lonely you can share your secrets and Morris like the international students started alone you tell us about the physiology behind asleep introduced Cody and this animation just to use that obviously thoughts and explore with the PMD sequence by with the collie yeah hi hello my name is Jason Jung this is my thesis project it's called the conjunctiva and it's not like a light it's a medium for creating volumetric light sculptures yeah and basically it's it's using movement of separate motors and the light of LEDs and the darkness Troughton produced by like a projected shadow on like object attached to the stepper motor to create like a lot of different volumes of like different volumetric pattern so I can play with different colors essentially like I really like abstract painting and I kind of want to put it like into like a 3dimensional object using light that wasn't the whole concept you know there's no interactivity in that sense right now it's mostly I just established some kind of the mechanism to create this box but I will add like stuff like react to the sound okay hello hi okay my boyfriend's watching right now hi Vince okay so basically what this is is as you may or may not know world Pride it is happening to June and it is for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots basically that was like a huge it was a little bar fight or a very famous um thing that happened that basically launched the the gay civil rights LGBT civil rights movement in New York so now you may or may not know this but the arch in Washington so on the half centennial anniversary of the LGBT civil rights star what better way than to commemorate the founding mothers and fathers so this is my project basically what I'm trying to do is tell the story of what's happened in 50 years in New York you know between you know the early pride marches to the AIDS epidemic into the 90s the rise of folk culture Paris burning kinds of things and and just really time to thought so do you imagine during projection met and yes you know if any and and whiting administrators are hearing me I'm trying really hard York City what pride to do this on the actual arch and yeah and this is something that I would really love to do that's my project thank you I'm hoping so because there's so many people from all over the world that are coming to celebrate and I want them to see those impactful people like Hector extravaganza Sylvia Rivera Marshall ki Johnson people that really made pride what it is so ok that's what I got thank you so much breathing meditation experiences could you introduce yourself oh I'm sorry I'm Ella nice to meet you guys so I'm graduating this year and this is my thesis project which is called brass wheelie and breathing meditation for one to two percent never is dark and immersive the studio so the purpose of this is to allow people to practice if they're a breathing meditation and how this breathing as a primary notice thing to nature in the environment that we always notice that our breathing is part of the nature but we don't see it right away so I want to use breathing and some hard way to Arabic words understand the breathing meditation activity and also under them has to understand that the small changes of breathing's affecting the environment very very more impactful way Network result all the sensors so right now let's assume in a weird answer is checking their birth name and when you move in a very nice to do that thank you thank you so much everybody talking about how much energy we're heading to the Under this is exciting actually no idea with thank you I have it go this is Miami over here and then dissing so we can try to catch up these projects so should I clock look here yeah hi my name is Rui and this is our project first virtual reality I'm working with my partner Roger Xu who has already flying to China so this one is called claw machine so like in a game mark I don't call machine where people Khoisan I call grab the toys so like in this game is an interactive animation so like instead of being a human player that is outside the car machine you did some become like a toy inside the car machine and you have like different toys around to you can talk to you like they each have like a different opinion that like whether or not the cause I like going to the outside war is good or bad so like you are the park I'm glad you're feeling boy among all the other toys that can like move your hands and we have like a bunch of weapon bosses front of you that you can throw to them and so to save your friends but like you only have limited boss so you can't you need to choose like whether or not to save the boss to save yourself right to say isn't it we're like kids my name is Rosie I'm actually presenting two projects so the first one that I'm presenting is for class I took this semester called 100 days of making in which you take an idea and work on it 400 days straight so I took a concept that I came up with about a year ago called broken fluidity with that concept I take cylinders and I create abstractions objects characters words you name it I'm in the second project that I'm presenting is a VR sculpture garden of the digital pieces that I made over the hundred days just got a message by the way that's bad okay this might just suddenly come on okay okay okay okay we're gonna keep it we can't we can't look at the VRS gasps show us their yeah okay and always a reconnection yeah the digital deuces Oh interesting okay so the priority I would have to I have an adapter they do have long it does both well it's uh let's see if we could get you to explain explain your project this is a simulator that teaches you how to be a successful artist and mr. grammage and it is very simply pressure wave inspired it's an abstract representation of how I feel about being a young creative in this era and you get to sign a consent gives us all your your rights your physical presence your mental presence we copy it we use it after you die thank you you have to do action this is my project a school party simulator for homeschool boys it's a simulator for going to school then we're never able to go twice party it's like a comedy leash the pr2 watch it at home it ends with a magical moment I'm good we can't really we can't really show the VR project so we're unfortunately but you can give us an explanation of it please right it's a kind of construct e360 we are film I made two cinema story in each of them into version I use the face to see camera for shooting whole small video and for each version I want on I shoot the video close to them guys in the same perspective and one time close to the woman's perspective and the user will have to appreciate you to use to bother to switch between the perspective and think about the details that make them different from each other so they will just put on the headset and see the video and can switch between them whenever they want to compare and see more body details and we talked about 10011 you know what talking but so many details because they have different feelings for each other and it makes me whole experience different and I try to make another kind of situation it is impossible in the real life considering so many other perspective to and try to just take more about this challenge relationship that's always how can there may be problems yeah I hope that kept out people just better think about it thank you thank you oh yeah yeah and I'm a secondyear students and graduating and this might be a project let's call the magical pencil the editor is whatever you draw in this game because the field so you don't need to find an item we don't need it whenever you need something just choice you're gonna use it with no puzzles on the journey I'd say that that mainly you better create a car or something I know that in the work the koolaid something you tried it appears in the game yeah yeah actually the blue is their buddy you're on the negative rate come on Ames everyone they're gonna check out this performance should we try we're gonna attempt to plug in it let's not talk too long alright the battery is running low so we're gonna attempt something the audio is definitely gonna cut out for a minute so the way that this would work I'm live on the internet right now yes so let's see so this this comes out the audio is now here sorry so the question is is this the microphone that's on that would be the question did we do we still have this microphone anyone in the chat could let us know by tap this microphone does that register or we're fine anyway okay let's go see if we can catch it okay great so I'm so sure native talk about what Antonio I'm a firstyear 90 feet and this is a haptic watch so it has a 3d printed case with Velcro around out over it is a lid it's also 3d printed there's a button up atop and it tells time by way of vibrations when I press it and you're touching it you feel different vibrations say it's five o'clock five something now it's almost 530 so it'll vibrate like five really short like that and then for ten zero most almost like a heartbeat and the one vibrations are like a little longer like that so if there's another person that can touch it but I'll touch it and now press it and it'll go five funny 30 so it's 530 now can I try feeling it sure here you go five down on dirty yeah well and then here is a haptic motor with the gemma board and a battery and some circuitry have you have you spent time wearing and wearing this and some last night the battery power is not that great it just has a 100 milliamp hour battery in it that it has to be you know this has to be taken apart unplug and recharged there's another one that's charging back here here charging the battery that's the battery right there the tiny things about it it's really it's like it's really very distinct like it's certainly even you're not being experienced with a lot of haptic devices I can really feel those pulses yeah I try to design it to have figure out a way to add them up so that it doesn't take too long ready to tell the time great job ready to work here hello would you like to tell us your name I would love to knock and this is untouched and it's an experiment and giving garments like worse so it was made in the where of intro to wearables and or should I touch it but maybe you should touch it right so if we touch it a little bit it responds a little bit right so a little bit of attention is not used everybody likes a little bit of attention but did you hang in there and use yeah so yeah it was we were experimenting kind of technologies wearable technologies and my thing was how to make fashion you like fashion and like too much technology actually has a lot and have you tried wearing it's fresh out of the oven but but we are very interested to see how the wear would feel with the eight vibrating motors on the studio that could be a inside/outside kind of experience yeah good job yeah thank you you can come check out these project my name is Anna first years and then my cruiser is April video controller because when I'm cooking a music watching a YouTube video but I don't want to pause my iPad in my grizzy so if I'm wearing this apron I don't know if I can control video with this right now have you tried this and actually cooked was wearing these yet yeah what did you make the design astray because I couldn't even really notice at first kind of the simulator is a fling button the pause button is very abstract so it's falling to it okay we tell us your name and about your project I guess what comes Stan usually give me in front of you application and the address here is displayed on this loom what is what what because all right let's come back this way say your names and then tell us about your project open yet and this is our project this would be so comfy to wear it's like a physical therapy and in the back like a mental therapy it's just this show others like a woman's statement like a free every release and like to be practice it's like a breezy like calm down read them they just assured that America is and the in the middle part is rabbit straight is dressing from the bottom to the top issues that my love energy through the current I would love to I feel like it would be good for like wrap up I know you you have to go yes so we're going to go there's a few more projects downstairs in the lobby that I'm going to take us to go see well I recall last time we did this the WiFi cut out while we're in the stairwell so the stream might go down for a minute hopefully we get downstairs it'll check itself back up so rest assured we're coming back I will say good bye when it's time to say goodbye all right so let's head down the stairs there any stairwell very exciting no not for flights by the way the new IT teams will be in downtown Brooklyn will also be on the fourth floor we'll come back but this is gets a little more relaxed down here and we can kind of take a place to sort of finish up back all right I think we're back we reconnected we're in the lobby of the Tisch School of the Arts and we're gonna look at a few more projects for a little bit longer and then I will say goodbye but this full livestream will be left archived online so you'll be able to watch it later if you the futures market we do some time every day Toronto well you look so official look like microphones that camera can we do some shopping here yes you want to tell us your name and about the market sure my name is my name is Alton Jones and futures market is a store that I made to solve a variety of different speculative products and services oh you take that moment I do take okay I'm gonna buy something okay great I don't know what's about good personality and the chat can weigh in here I'm a very frugal person just be aware although I kind of want to buy the information straight let's see so there's the personality reassignment personality scrambler biomedics crying yeah so I can I gotta use reading and ethic juice job yeah I could explain these a little bit so for the personality reassignment I would generate a new personality for you it's very simple and I was gonna get a little scroll like this with your new information on it I'm actually not selling the personality of scrambler today I usually someone a USB Drive it's just a software that I wrote that you can find with the panics prodding I would use my sprite over here to reveal all the pics about for my refuge reader if you have anything you're planning on throwing away I could use my trash analyzer over here to analyze that objects and then basically what results is an analysis you would tell us deeper insights about you you might not have realized in the phonetic juice jar I could take care of my things and literally bottle them up for later use you would come in a little bottle like this and the way you would apply the emotion leader is just to open the bottle and dispensing it upon your head and today with any effort juice jar that I'm selling I'm also throwing in a free by the next time oh wow cuz I was gonna say I was I was kind of interested in both the personality reassignment and the effect juice job alright I was gonna get both of them and then I would get the by Nick Kurt's trying yeah I would say also anybody watching this should feel free to venmo and buy something for me but I'm gonna purchase this myself all right we're just gonna open up the venmo app here this is very exciting I've never bought anything at the ITV show before I don't know why this feels like so much fun like yesterday about $80 yeah let's fire no no this is this is now documented oh yeah hired they're big fans of the coding tree yeah I'm going for six at Miami on Ben mo yeah you can buy don't know if you can like tweet you could order for like a later delivery I'm not sure yeah we could well be to work something out yeah I know I know how to find it great so which one which one would you like first what why don't you the personality is coming with a new personality the opportunity to choose the new name for it so what would you like that new names if you can you can keep your old name and people still think a lot of pressure how about choo choo like ch ch ch ch ch great and what kind of job would you like to have in the future musical theater director musical theater director okay wonderful Saracens like 30 seconds of dinner no it's fine this is like a grid we're two and a half hours all right okay I paid all right these are you capture at 600 on a scale of one to ten with one being the lowest and ten being the highest so for teamwork you have 8.4 I think that'll do very well as a musical musical theater yeah musical theater director sounds excellent for that future vision the only 3.0 you're more range in terms of the past so you are close to the future analytics 9.1 so you're excellent and analytics you're very good analytical tasks which I don't know how much of that you'll you'll end up end up doing yeah we'll see tinkering 5.4 so you're pretty good at tinkering it's not your strongest suit but they're good at working with mechanical objects collection 3.9 so you tend to prefer to throw things away rather than hold on to them and project management 4.7 not a great project manager you know worst ambition that was just 3.4 it's about not very ambitious your legs are considering only the evidence that supports conclusions you've already drawn feeling to think things through and becoming caught up and unhealthy codependency your dislikes are doing research thinking over your plans before putting them into action and longing for someone or something so it's a new personality I'll wrap it up for you and then you can keep it you can keep it close in case you're better okay forget who you are you'll have this to refer soon after the creep there you go and then all right and then for the for the ethnic juiciness crying we can have look into my Scryer I don't need every time they put my eye all the way up onto all right so looks like you are surprised okay so let's get you a charm could you focus this might be a little bit difficult but hold this zoom into the jar and then depress the button I can look I can also could switch the knife again it's really just back up audience okay and then press the button until the stars wonderful way is just label it so there's your surprise you can have this for later hopefully it comes in handy and then I'll have the results of the yes my back pocket what do you think the chicks are I'm gonna sit on it explode okay up in my friend pot maybe you can pick it up later I really would like to keep from the results of your strike it seems like 96.7 eight percent of your atoms come from the solar system it's very it's very normal for it to be that nice don't worry one point three eight percent come from a blue snowball nebula which is very exciting but very far away and 1.4 percent comes from other that doesn't necessarily mean that they're not from the other two categories it just means we couldn't figure out what it looks like your interests are social media market diners camping hunting and dance so if you're not aware of any of those interests sometimes with my and then I ask for your future don't relax yet there's more to come and but don't be surprised by a personal attack and it's time to do back on that I'm not the best resolved unfortunately so here I'll wrap this up for you all right thank you very much this is a very satisfying retail experience rating qui baby we'll check out a couple more projects okay hi my name is Chang Chau Chau and the project is my PC project taught one new time it is about personal time and harness affected by geography it was inspired by me where time is now absolute and more active power so I was trying to visualize our change based on our committee so I can assure you got it sure so this is the winding key and the combined debt cap your wine it and it's gonna so there is the video the video is our past 1000 troops and it's playing backwards and so that's why people are working backwards in this video and the camera to capture and there are three three of us in from the camera so it's generating and this one is not that sketchy but his two are chachi and this employer judging so it is kind of demonstrate how our moving speaking to a back it's a really nice way to tie in the slitscan style effect yeah the concept of time ago today yeah thank you okay okay let's see I think maybe we can pull we'll say goodbye over at the front this your project can you introduce yourselves and tell us about yeah so this is sanad this is a 1bit adder circuit where the inputs are two different solar panels what we think is competition when we think is information we found some definitions information is just like relative differences and we found that like oh right that's really similar to like constant voltage and the concept of light there's a constant amount of energy in the universe and when we think of a power plant that's really just a relative density of energy in one place at a point in time with a potential in the future to return to that's erupting without the water with which classes energy and it's just like when there's excess when times are good when kinds of sun shining are good it'll charge a battery because it can get in this stain where there's not enough light to generate enough current to turn on the LED but there's enough to just have the voltage height enough to be like it is on so it's just like a little backup battery that is dead well it's a nice merging and sort of like feature oh yeah I've been we've been saying this we've been saying our part it's a it's a the basics of the personal computer or the target user is Assad yeah and we're waiting for some we're trying to attack some VC funding right now yeah check out from the planet I mean I was gonna make some superman breakfast forgot my brain is melted never I think we're now at like we're almost at two and a half hours all right great job what's the planet in Superman zoran or something no by the chat definitely gonna no not be very embarrassing just to school the arts photography installation okay let's go over to the front I think we're we've done all we can we've experienced the show that is the IPTV yeah we wanted to say thank you're live on the Internet Parsons yeah awesome and are you are you continuing the thank you well we're just wrapping up here this has been almost three hours now I don't know we i we did to hit a lot of project always that just like an enormous guilt that I look for the next few days of projects that I've missed yeah okay so what should you stand together sorry tell us your names and tell us about this project well credit captures I'm Donna hi nice to meet you I'm indeed yes yeah this is a project that we found at two flat portables we created it in a critical object class and okay so I would say art installation that me and animate as a statement about flagpole protocols and black both protocols basically say when a flagpole when you're allowed to breathe the flag to full staff or lowered to halfstaff me and Donna feel that those protocols don't necessarily represent always the maybe causes that people would want to lower the flag to halfmast or halfstaff and that the people that look at the flags to get a sense of community or mourning as a community don't necessarily get to decide those decisions and so we made this dance digital dance between two flat poles trying to make a statement about how sometimes when one is that the other country's flag necessarily actual and what does that mean and sometimes when we leave in the same country and the flag staff has is pooled which you don't necessarily necessarily identify would that cause is there some universality to this concept of I mean all countries have flags sort of like a convention and they all have protocols but this those you know most cultures I guess have this and this is what we were going with these two very clear statement zero and one yes perhaps that boost up commemoration or victory or civics that's very serious yes oh that's crazy here we are the thing here okay okay well I have to don't like figure this out okay okay yeah so we just wanted to see if we can neutralize that situation and maybe without sides we could be on the same side and it seems to be a very just in tensional choice that the flags are just clear plastic is looking you thought about it right yeah definitely I think that me and Donna coming from the same country when we see our national flag we automatically have an emotion towards that flag and I think they didn't want to make a statement about a certain place or a certain fact but we wanted to neutralize that my so every person looking at the object decide what they feel or what flag they see or don't see in this work we also created this line trying to identify would one side it was just like an experiment because we've got this tree right so that design is that I'm work I think experiences would view this from here but really the ideas for to be outside and then there's contextual information in terms of that is very powerful actually that's just automate anything up and down yeah I've never really thought about the code is also kind of a test if there's one way to go like every function is like half staff whose path it was nice to write it yeah yeah yeah technology wise it's stepper motors we learned a lot about step reporters and area calibrated by twelve sensors thank you for being this is a bit I think an appropriate project for the last project it's very dramatic it's right here in the lobby all right so I think we can wrap this up I'm tempted to go outside to wrap things up but I have a bad feeling that the WiFi will go down so I stand in front of which is a nice symbol so thank you for tuning into this move people thank you for tuning in to this live stream of the ITP Spring Show 2019 also with ima interactive media arts the undergrad program if you want to find out more about these programs you could go to ITP NYU vtu as well as ITP dot NYU vu / ima this is a kind of momentous occasion in the sense that the whole program is moving to a new NYU building in downtown Berkeley next year so this is presumably the last ITP show on the fourth floor ITP is also having its 40th anniversary if you can believe that this fall I don't know what what anniversary show this is the shows weren't around for the first however many years so I don't know I feel a little bit of a moment here but and so what we're just going to do the same old awkward thing where at some point we're gonna have to like all move around and try to find the right button to press so let me thank both body and me true so much thank you guys for help like with the camera and doing some guest hosting thank you Lennon who gave his little spanishlanguage hosting there and all the other people who work at ITP and make this stuff go through if you're wondering what's happening Cody train wise in terms of tutorials this is a very light month so I don't think there will be another livestream actually until June I'll be at the IO Festival in Minneapolis if you're there please say hi but there will be a lot of new videos coming out because I've been recording a whole set of tutorial series about node and data and api's and save them to a database and all that stuff so that'll all be coming out there's almost 20 new videos actually coming out in the next couple weeks so stay tuned for that it's 6 p.m. go and do whatever it is you need to do for the rest of the day or evening if you're staying up too late go to sleep thank you so much again and I'll see you on a future okay think it's as easy as 2 X X X there it is
