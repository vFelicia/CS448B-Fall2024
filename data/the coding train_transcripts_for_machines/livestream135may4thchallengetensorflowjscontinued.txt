okay I'm here I'm just checking I have a new system I press a button over here to start streaming rather than press a button over there and apparently I think it worked because I'm here with you live on the coding train hello I think he's a little quietly it's finals week here at NYU I think maybe they'll get out of class a little bit or I might just sort of forget about it start to ramp up the energy volume but hello in fact I'm just going to get started with the fact that it is May 4th and I'm just gonna I'm looking around good morning and let's begin with a coding challenge Oh first hello to the computer science class at a why Jackson SS in Ottawa Ontario hello maybe you're actually watching this I hear you're having a computer science class and maybe you'll do this coding challenge with me so I'm gonna open up processing how's this we're just getting started right here could it be the coffee I was I was trying to get started at 1030 this morning but I had a visitor and it was lovely to have a visitor and I got a common conversation I was talking I was talking I was like I would spend 25 to go upstairs so I didn't even get a chance to eat my melon so I'm really gonna oneup gibreel this here gibreel is if you're watching this is for you you know both people say they don't like melon it's not anybody's favorite fruit and I'll admit when I get a fruit salad really you know I'm like picking around to go for the blueberries or the mango I have to say a really good honeydew melon throat low pH which is good for me I've got acid related anxiety has lost a piece of fruit the heck okay the sound is low oh whoa wait a second oh my goodness just like look just so you guys all know that I'm not completely insane this is this a piece of honeydew melon on a fork this is a new mystery cloaking device melon that's totally as well mmhmm so today's a return return of the tenminute coding challenge can I I really shouldn't do this every once in a while people are like how come you never use the timer anymore oh no I don't want to full screen ah I just want a little okay I want to be able to pop this out no it's fine it's fine there's a way I used to do the 10 minute timer with OB yet with a wire cast I could do this here's where I things are gonna go wrong today on the coding train I was like I'm gonna start immediately with coding talent I thought let me try to put a 10minute time and then 45 minutes later I'm trying to debug the timer you could turn up the overall volume level a little bit let's see if I can manage that oh it's quite low actually on the microphone there we go how's that I just turned up my volume a little bit so hopefully that's better for everybody now there's a browser source in OBS there's also a plugin for timers all right I'm giving myself ten minutes to try to make a ten minute timer this is like okay ready so this now we're gonna have the timer if only I knew how to program my own timer oh okay this timer now represents by ten minutes to get an open broadcast studio timer going okay so if I go here and let me open we try just using a different browser than the other browser I've opened just ten minute timer and then if I do this and then if I add a source display source image source scene video capture color source browser source create a new browser source ooh oh look at this oh and then I put the oh look at this I'm gonna I put the URL for this this is crazy how do I get the URL for this leave Paige oh my goodness oh my goodness oh my goodness here we go I better get myself 15 minutes for this coding challenge like 10 minute timer I really oh here we go copy now if I put this here paste okay okay whoa oh can I not feel can I interact with it I can't interact with it this is kind of wacky this is so weak I like a crop it what I can't interact can i refresh it I can't interact with it interact mode for others an interact mode I want the interact mode okay hold on properties local file shutdown refresh cache reload this page yeah okay but how do i how do I interact I don't see it interact will preview lock preview preview scaling full screen copy filters interact whoo look at that oh and I have now I can interact with it this is great I love learning open broadcast studio live well live streaming hello good morning maybe we'll get the tensor fluff chance today it's quite possible okay so now what I want to do is I want to know know I want to crop it how do i crop in I forgot how I crop in OBS this is changing the size I've done this before or but what if I just do this with interact whoa how do I crop holding alt oh my goodness okay you guys don't realize this is like a game of Twister so the computer for open broadcast studios monitor over here the mouse is right here and the keyboard is over here so what's the equivalent of alt on a Mac ctrl option there we go twister here there we go all right we're back and how do I I can't start it now okay hold on I have to unfold screen it I have to I have to refresh it refresh cache of current page okay we've got to start over here this is gonna be fine now though because stop oh I know I have to do option again option no option option option reset ten minutes can i key I'm out who cares that's fine okay did it everybody we did it and I still have I still have five minutes ago at this time okay oh yeah now let's make it 15 minutes let's make it a 15minute timer is when was there ever a coding challenge completed oh the keyboard doesn't work in interacting with it oh my goodness are you serious this is crazy keyboard doesn't mean to work with interacting oh boy oh boy okay hold on hold on we can make this 15 minutes add it at interact no no no no not interact okay interact browser source where do I change the URL properties tenminute just changes to 15 refresh cache of current page and no how about refresh the whole page there we go alright oh and interact alright now we're talking now we're talking just use the OBS timer plugin oh that would but I wanted to learn about how to have a browser thing in open broadcast studio so that's I'm glad that I learned that now alright so okay I can't see the I can't see the YouTube chat too easily I don't have any like good space sound effects I meant to get some space sound effects we won't have that for today next time Oh in fact I even have this great Darth Vader mask that like changes your voice and the Darth Vader but if I make it cousin the whole coding challenge wearing that which I'm sure would have been very entertaining for everybody another time one of these days I'm gonna have a lot more time to buy costumes and do more stuff whew it's getting warm in here let's get started hello wait okay I'm recording hello happy May 4th I'm gonna do Cody challenge for May 4th on the coding spaceship miss Cody challenge I'm going to make some scrolling text that looks as if it is scrolling off into the distance and it is the return of the 15minute timer with yeah when has that ever gone wrong I mean it's always been so great to have the time for nothing if it goes wrong with the timer so um why am i doing this challenge today it's I don't know it's the 4th of May and I thought it might be appropriate and maybe someday I'll get a sponsorship and then I'll be able to you know have all these logos and music happening at the same time ok here we go let's start the timer and let's begin all right so I'm gonna do this in processing processing is a Java based programming environment if you were anybody else or if you were born after 1990 you would probably do some kind of like CSS transforms and have some crazy cool 3d text scrolling thing in the browser I'm old and I like to draw my pixels one at a time so here we go let's make a window that is let's just start with like 800 by 600 and let's let's it just admit the fact that we're going to be doing this in 3d and I'm going to add the p 3d renderer then in draw I'm gonna say background zero oh and I need some text hmm so let's make a text file but first let me save this and I'm gonna call this I'm gonna just say this is the desktop under May 4th challenge and I'm just checking the chat because I'm gonna need help definitely gonna help them at 14 minutes okay and don't get distracted don't get distracted okay text edit on the e key still doesn't work on this computer so many things going wrong format plain text so let's get some text I am using in this coding challenge processing org and so I don't know this looks like some good text oh yeah this is great let's look at this let's use this okay so I'm gonna save this as I'm gonna go to the desktop and I'm gonna go to May 4th challenge and I'm going to go to space dot txt you know II on fingers okay there we go so now in back in my sketch here I want to access that text so I'm going to create actually I'm gonna create a variable I'm gonna call it a txt I don't want to call it text because there's a function called texted processing and just so I don't confuse myself and once I'm going to use the load strings function and I'm gonna load what could I call that file space space dot txt but the thing is you might be wondering here I really don't have time to explain I'm going to anyway why do I have this array of strings called lines well it so happens that the load strings function loads a text file and takes every line from that text file it makes it a separate element in an array and this is actually very convenient in most cases but not so much right now so I am then going to instead say actually this might actually be really useful because I might I might want to make use of that array but right now I'm just gonna say T XT equals join lines lines join and then I will join them with the line break character and join good I'm going to join them with the line breaker lines not join hmm maybe I need to give it double quotes because it's not a character it's a string no oh let's check our errors cannot invoke join string on the type of string array oh oh right let's do this this is a processing function that exists called lines that's called join that's written into processing there's no join function for an array in Java I guess and the join function is part of the processing API where I can take an array and join them with a line break okay now we are going to say a fill 255 because I want my text to be white on a black background then I'm going to say text txt and I'm gonna say I'm gonna give it a bounding box of the full window and let's just run this and see what we got okay there we go there's our text it is in this window there it is alright let's do some stuff I really should think about the font oh I didn't even think about this do I have time to go look for the appropriate font for this particular simulation that I then I'm attempting to code without buzz marketing for free a particular commercial product oh it's a single anyway text font Oh text size let's just try text size sixtyfour okay I also want to use it that's pretty good I also want to use text align and I want to full justify that's not gonna work let's try Center just out of curiosity what does that do uh it centers it okay centers it within that box well let's reuse that for right now okay we're doing well look at this I got ten minutes I have time to eat some melon there's gonna be really weird I I'm so confident about this code challenge this piece of melon which you're wondering what is the deal with this piece of melon it's purple it's blue this is the magical space melon that they eat on the planet ma Phooey that's the only planet I know I have delicious very good very low pH soothing of the throat okay sponsored by alien melon okay now what I want to do is I need a variable I'm gonna say I was about to say let but I'm in processing I need to specify the type float y equals zero lets you let's set the text at zero comma Y and let's say Y so Y is just going to change by one every frame and now we have scrolling text where'd it go oh look at this I gave it a bounding box which was the high OH this was gonna be a no edit this is gonna be a no edit coding challenge can't edit that out the camera went off it's fine it fixed it so I need to can I possibly make this bounding box without I mean I could just do this and here's the thing I want it to start right I want it to Y to start at height okay I'm getting some so now here we go processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code okay this is great we're wasting time here all right I'm told there is a specific color that I'm supposed to use so let's change that r75 2 1 3 2 3 8 all right across the thing is a flexible software sketchbook I there must be a specific font it also needs to be full justified I'm gonna see if I can manage that but here's the thing it's so this is just scrolling up but I I have made this do not forget AP 3d sketch we means what I can do right now is I want to rotate the scene this way now if this is if this train whistle is representing my axis of rotation this is the z axis that would be something spinning around so if I were to just say for example whoops let me zoom back out here and say something like oh let me rotate by you know 45 degrees which is radians of 45 or I'm gonna say PI pi divided by 8 no pi divided by 2 is 90 so pi divided by 4 is 45 degrees we should see the text it's completely gone why I need to look I need to rotate around the center I need to rotate around the center of this oh look at that there it goes here comes it's kind of like this that should be the sound effect that goes along with this all right so I what I want to do is rotate by X but let's I think actually what's going to make more sense is for the world of this universe that I'm building to be have its origin point in the center so really what I want is for I'm going to take out the rotate really what I want is to transport or agender oh so now I want that origin point to be in the middle and you're going to see it now why am I not seeing anything I will eventually it's very slow the scrolling text highwage too overconfident about this but so now what I want is for the text actually to not be at 0 comma Y but to be at negative width divided by 2 so offset it and then Y can start at height divided by 2 and now we should see back to what I had before and now hopefully I can now rotate right this was this will now rotate my text along the z axis so it's doing that but what I really want to do is I want to rotate it along the x axis I wanted to like sort of fold down so I want to say rotate X and processing is a flexible software is it too slow or is that actually the appropriate speed I also can't see it at all so let's make it much wider Oh wrong color I'm told 238 to 1375 I did it backwards ok processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts I don't know that's going kind of slow let's uh let's have this go a little bit faster what else does this need this is done done four minutes ago yeah there we go what else should I do that is approximately the right speed yeah so the one thing is I pretty sure that if I were being true to this particular design it really should be full justified I'm trying to think of how to do that make it like 80% of the width yeah so I guess what I should do also the bounding box I guess I can adjust the bounding box ya know but that's not doing me any good because why doesn't that Oh No okay so negative width so hold on so I need to let me just make this so this should be negative W device so I want the bounding box and the text to be centered based on the bounding box so I've got a and I want that bounding box don't have to be the full width so I'm shrinking it by like eighty percent and I probably should have the font the text size be related to the width as well so it was like 1200 divided by 64 mph it was 60 point that would be a hundred two hundred so I could say width divided by 200 right oh no I meant to say not 220 so let's do this and so that's right I guess the size is too big actually so let's make the text size width divided with times 0.15 and now whoa I meant oh one five know what I'm doing anymore don't just make up numbers so no point force can be really thick oh five 5% oh yeah 5% I prefer good let's make it a little smaller let's make it like 3% this is really the way this is the way to program just try different numbers oh the width is still too wide ah this is the problem I liked my size I wanted to enter there we go thank you that only took me so I have a minute 42 seconds left processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts okay what else do I need to do in my minute and a half that I have left text mode is model or shape yeah yes so there is a textbook do the full justified no I have a challenge to you try to oh and I did the reason why I was doing this is because I wanted to demonstrate Processing's wonderful fullscreen function and whoa that's weird why did that happen when I went full screen huh do I just need to rotate much more what what did I do to deserve this that's so weird what if I do this how am i doing on time yeah that's so weird why would I went full scope from p.3d thank you I feel under I'm a so of course size is where you specify the width and height manually and a particular renderer if I say full screen I still need to specify the renderer so it was working but it just defaulted to a 2d renderer and rotate X didn't work Oh time run off I finished here we go we're done oh I can't do the gibreel slag I can't talk while I'm eating how does he do it somebody's gotta tell me we don't know what I'm talking about check out de brillz YouTube channel I have now made a sideways scrolling yellow text thing with no theme music or branding whatsoever with some processing text in the amount of time that I was given it really should have it really should be full justified I will leave that to you I hope you make a version of this please make some but that timer do you hear the timer or you just hear it cuz I really want to hit okay okay make your own version of this add stuff to it to make it more fun or different or with your own style I'll try to make a JavaScript version of this with p5 and the WebGL renderer p5 we could make a 3 J s1 and then of course all of you who know more than I do prop many of you could probably make a CSS one with transforms and all that fancy new stuff I know Sarah Dresner who is like my CSS probably knows a way to do this ok put a starfilled behind it yes you can do that goodbye I'm gonna finish this I'm just like I'm just gonna be done with this cozy down goodbye ok there that was the coding challenge for this morning start tensorflow okay yeah yeah all right people want me to start tensorflow okay it's very warm in here I should probably tweet that I'm going to start the tensor flow stuff now so let me close this out come up and save this oh wait I have to do something I have to remember I have to stop I just have to do a little housekeeping here to upload this because I I'm gonna release that today as a standalone coding challenge so I need to upload this to Google Drive Oh No so I've been using this old Google Drive software on this computer and every time I come up here it tells me this software you using we're not gonna we're not supporting it anymore you should really like update to blah blah blah new Google Drive thing I just never bothered to do it it looks like it actually finally but it's no problem because what I'm going to do is I'm just going to you're just gonna have to bear with me here I'm gonna do this manually I have to log in through the browser at account oh no no I'm actually logged in right I want to be in oh no I want to go to this one so sorry I need to upload the video file for that it'll just take me a second and I have to oh my god I have to put in my net ID and then I have to oh wrong password seriously and then I need to send myself a push for twofactor authentication this is really good and I'm gonna say approve yep okay now I'm in Google Drive I'm gonna go to the coding rainbow folder that's what it's called did that that's right I said it I'm gonna make a new folder I'm gonna call may 4 and I'm gonna create that folder I know you can't see what I'm doing someday I will share my open broadcast studio machine screen then I need to go to the browser I need to go to the desktop I need to grab this file which is 1.25 gigabytes and upload it and it is uploading less than a minute left hopefully this isn't messing with the streaming and then I'm going to come back here and hit start recording again then we can get rid of the I can close this browser source thing unless I need a timer again and I can close this and I can come back to the chat and there we are okay so I don't know so it's 1115 I have about two hours which is pretty good actually I am going to try to recall does it bother you if I have this up higher it's just that you could see the keyboard of the other solo for some reason maybe what I usually do actually is laptop unhook no green screen unhook move this down a little bit so I'm a little bit lower but now I can move this up a little bit yeah that's better okay and then lock all right sorry for all this configuring stuff no audio no the audio must be working you line up the timer with the end and the rest just plays I don't know what's taught but what you got I don't know what everybody's talking about in the chat okay so I now I'm going to open up terminal I'm gonna go to the desktop and I'm gonna go to p5 tensorflow and I'm going to open up atom text editor so I've got this is where I last left off and I'm going to run a server I am going to type in my password then I'm going to open up the browser localhost it and hit refresh this is where I last left off like this little wider oh I have plenty more room here I'll move this over okay and then we need to get to the API reference and okay so here let me make a list of the things that I want to talk about reshape where are the oh is it in here TF tensor flatten a scalar as 1d as 3d as 40 as tight buffer data disposed to end perma shape reshape expand squeezed clone where are the math operations for tensors can categorise model with layers so I'm just looking here Oh operations this is what it's down here okay so what I need to let me make a list here this camera is off I think that I don't need any of this anymore so I need to get myself organized where do I have some paper towels here to erase this whiteboard Oh might have a slight problem I'm missing a key supply where would it have gone I wouldn't have used it all up somebody we have another mystery I would play the serial podcast theme music again but the copyright violation for that last time it's like can't do that again uhhuh well I have this remnant of a paper towel maybe I'll use that how far will this get me pretty far so I want to make a list of the other tensorflow J s kind of just general topics that I want to discuss for example I want to talk about memory management I want to talk about if we need a bigger paper towel then this piece these are some tissues oh there they are they're the paper towels found them okay not very much this paper towel roll save the earth everybody I probably should get a reusable I mean I try to use the eraser whenever I can but when I'm this is tends to work better just a little water and a paper towel but at least I'm being only using one little tiny slice here so I want to make a list and I don't think that I'm going to make a completely comprehensive set of tutorials of every single piece of what's inside tensorflow das but the things the things that I've done so far if I make this list let me do it over here so so far what have I done so far I did kind of like an intro check I also made a video where I talked about tensors check so the other things that I need to do are I think this could be in one variables and memory management then I want to talk about operations and then I want to look at so if we look at the operations in the API like what might be a small list down here like add subtract multiply square difference math so I don't know I I don't think I'm gonna I don't think I need to go over all of these oh but matrix multiplication definitely then there's some of these convolutions so I you know there's a lot of stuff here so I'm gonna go over the basics to lay a foundation and as I go and make other examples we might return to some of these but so I do I want to talk about operations and then I want to talk about the layers API and then I want to do X or color predictor and a doodle classifier this is my and then after that I'm going to move on to ml five so this is kind of I mean in theory I had hoped to get all the way through X or today I don't know if that's particularly realistic but this is what I'm going this is my plan for I'm going to cover you know between now and the beginning of June I would say I think I can get through all of this between now the beginning of June and then in June I'm gonna focus on this new machine learning library that's built on top of all this stuff called ml five so that's my plan let me just take a moment to look at the chat the Select channel for patrons and see if there's any questions or comments or anything that I'm kind of missing that's key here of course you know I can't win I come back and look at the chat know what's being discussed is whether I should use Visual Studio code or Adam haven't you all learned anything the code editor is not the point it's theme ideas the way of being together as human beings in the world yes I mean you might like Visual Studio code yes I might like Adam yes I probably would like Visual Studio code more if I just used it you know I could I could put some firmware on this camera so it would stop shutting every time minutes why let's just enjoy ourselves all right I'm gonna check the chat again so I got some thumbs up from Caitlin thank you very much I mean okay um yeah butBut vim I know a good point you would think me being you know kind of of a earlier generation of programmer that I might be using something like vim the problem is I didn't actually start learning to program until I was 20 this is not entirely true because I always have to qualify this but I I like to say that it didn't start programming till I was 28 which is true because I never did it other than like a little thing and basic on an Apple 2 plus when I was in like maybe fourth grade I think I took one class in middle school where we actually did some assembly language and I took one course about programming and C++ as like an evening course after a question from college but none of those really ever took with me so so I didn't actually grow up with vim for example all right why don't you use NPM server that's also a very good question there's no reason there's absolutely no reason because my fingers remember how to type Python em and I I think actually with the kinds of tools that I use using like a live reload Sewer server so many things could make more sense all right okay so let's let me look at variables for a second actually know this I made this list and it's like I don't really know any of this I'm trying to learn it as I make these videos which I should probably say when I start the next one variable so variable oh you can make a variable out of a tensor oh so that you can like train it I see so the thing is this is not I'm gonna go and use the layers API so I'm less likely to end up being but I think it's good too Inchon this stuff so ot have zeros I like that I'm getting notifications on my yes tidy yes yes yes yes tidy dispose these are good points thank you Eric people are guessing that I'm 50 usually people guess them let's not talk about my age it's not the point of this these videos alright so let us begin I think I'm going to turn the notifications off on my wash but it doesn't it doesn't actually help okay all right oh this needs a little work better better okay No hold on I need a little more tape here bear with me I fix the problem I think I did okay great all right this is my third tensorflow chance video and I actually just a moment ago I made this list so what have I done so far I have made an introduction to where tensorflow J is sort of fits into the kinds of stuff that I'm working on and thinking about I made an intro video to the idea of what a tensor is and how to make a tensor a variable that stores a tensor in your JavaScript code and now you really what I want to do is I want to get down to my goal is to get to the point where I'm remaking earlier machine learning coding challenges I did but instead but using tensor flow j s as the basis for them the foundation for them so the things that I think that I need to mention and talked about before I get to that is I need to talk about variables and memory management there's something difference between a variable and a tensor there's they're kind of a similar thing but it has to do with memory management I would talk about operations so mathematical operations that you can do on these tensors the layers API that's a really that's like the topic I'm the most excited about on this list and so once I can do three more a little quick general tensor flow dot J's videos which are by no means comprehensive as to everything that's in tensor flow that is to much larger API than what I'm going to cover and also I don't actually know any of this stuff I'm just kind of figuring it out as I go so I'm trying to talk you through me learning it so just in case you're thinking you're watching a video by an expert and then and then I'm gonna get to these coding challenges and then I've teased this before but there's a new library called ml five which is built on top of tensor flow Jas which I'm going to eventually do a lot of tutorials and videos and hopefully bring some guests in also to do stuff with ml 5 ok so back to the computer you could like edit this and I could just reappear over there no point in doing this all right so I'm back so the where I left this off I think if we look at this code that I had is I created a tensor I use tensor 3d because I knew the shape was going to be of rank 3 having three dimensions yes and this is the shape I'm putting integers in it I'm console logging it and in and we can see the results here now incidentally I think I should also note that if I actually want to look at the data not just seeing it the string of it like printed out there then what I want to use is actually the data function oh wow I probably shouldn't have called mine data so let's call it a tensor price shouldn't call it that either let's call it tense a very tense tense data now this is gonna be a problem I think let's see what happens here and this is this is gonna relate I don't get to the point here you'll see you'll see look at this a promise oh that's so nice of tensorflow not gesture promise me something what are you promising so here's the thing there's something weird going on here and this is actually really the topic of this with variables and memory management in that there something is happening here something is happening right here these values are stored in a plain old array that's in the computer's memory and when we make this tensor out of them that data gets copied onto the computers graphics processing unit the GPU that takes some time and we want to minimize the amount of times we have to copy memory back and forth so this is the thing we have to think about as we build more examples in code and in fact this this here is doing this asynchronous this this here is doing this a secretly now I wonder if I could give it a call back I'm just gonna experiment here I think they're only using this thing called promises which I made a video tutorial about this yeah there really need to so what happens if I give it a call back to see like oh can I can I give it a call back there oh wait so let's let's do this and see like oh let's give it a call back and then see if we can look at the stuff that comes out of the call back let's see what happens there no because I have too many parentheses yes too many parentheses no nothing happens there so it's not using and and I'll cos told me I could use a wait but I owe this there's so much es6 and beyond JavaScript going on here so actually what I want to do is if I say tense dot data I can save then and then is this special function that's part of a promise where it's saying like once the promise has been resolved you've made a promise to me you're going to keep that promise and when that promise comes to roost cockadoodledoo then I can can I just write code in there no I have to make a function I can say console dot log stuff so how it works yeah look at that so there we go we can see this is one way but I actually don't want to deal with any of this so because I want to just so this is something that's going to come up let's try to avoid this and there's also a keyword called await that I could potentially use but luckily there is also a function called data sync so if I use the function data sync you can see this here what this will do is actually give me all the data back but without without the butbutbutbut block but wait wait for it to be done so now we should be able to say boy really very tense so you see here it is and then here's I notice it all came back as a onedimensional array hmm so oh yeah I have I have used timeout for a second think about this I should probably go back I'm trying to think I waded into this territory of promises that I didn't mean to almost want to like start this over because I do need to come so like like I do need to it is gonna be something there's no way around it this is why ml5 exists because what I've been working on this stuff for ml5 have been kind of like hiding all of the await async stuff and just using callbacks but promises are the way of the world aren't they I'm in a couple years am I just gonna all these if I've still using callbacks in the olderstyle am I just going to be I don't know I don't know the answers to these questions but what's interesting here is all the data comes back in a onedimensional array which I guess is kind of normal because I'm asking for it as just the raw data again there's also the get function right just curious about this like if I say get does that works I think that's how I can get one yeah so night that gives me 94 can I do something like this 46 uh yeah but wait oh no was it just giving me whoops undefined so shouldn't I be able to get if it's three dimensions I don't know but I can do this get 28 and that should be 10 because this is 29 and this is 10 so there's also get and get happy I guess cuz get you're only looking at one at a time that doesn't need a callback or promise call blacks are dead long live promise got it got it dude trills okay it would never be 2d or 3d its doors they have things that's right it's always the 2d the shape is really a concept for us ultimately the data is just a list of numbers okay so okay back to recap this is what the tensor is and this is this is the way that we're thinking about the tensor and how the data is stored and the print function allows us to see that they're easily in the console if I want access to the data the data sync function will just give me all of that stuff ultimately just as a list of numbers because this idea of the different the shapes and the dimensions is really for you know us as human beings to think about it and store it but ultimately it's just a bunch of numbers so I should also mention that in addition to data sync there is also a get function so if I were to say tense dot get and I were to say zero we would see I've got the number 80 which is right there and if I were to say one I've got the number forty one and if I were to say you know a twenty nine which would be the last one I've got the number fortyseven so get is another way I can start to pull that stuff out data sync data and I need to come back and I probably should add something about like what we need to support some of this stuff that I haven't really talked about is a video on promises promises and also one on a weight and async and promises are oh I went to I went to high again I let's don't worry everybody we're just Matt to to the rescue I really should add an addendum here which is that in order to support this material that I'm covering at some point I need to come back and make a video on promises and how the arrow syntax is often typically used with promises and this then function so these are something I need to come back and do some additional content on as well as a weight and a sink because if you want to work with this particular library how these new ways of handling synchronous and asynchronous things in JavaScript are kind of key foundational elements I've got to come back and talk about this I would suspect that funfun function has some nice videos on these topics but I don't know so maybe I'll link to those in this video's description ok but the point of what I was saying is what if what I wanted to do right now is I wanted to change some of the numbers for example I wanted to do the equivalent of saying something like 10 set 0 to 10 in other words I'm sure this doesn't exist but what if what I wanted to do is say like oh whatever number is in the first spot in the tensor I want to change it to something else well I actually can't do that these tensors once you've created them are immutable and that means the values can never ever be changed this is different than this like Const declaration which just means you can't like reassign a variable name but you can might be able to like change the internal data of an object that's different these tensors absolutely cannot be changed so if you need to change the values and you might in a kind of learning system you're building right what if you're storing all the weights of a matrix in a tensor and you want to adjust those weights rather than copying into new tensor to new tensor this is where the concept of a TF dot variable comes in so I can say Const bar oh I shouldn't Const V tense oh boy this is getting really weird TF variable tense I can take a tensor and make it into a variable by passing it through TF dot variable so let's just look at this and sort of see what's there and we whoops us we don't want this set thing and you can see now this looks very similar it has a shape it has a data type but it's now stored differently this is because tensorflow has a kind of lowlevel library managing web the data using the graphics card intensively really needs to do different things it has to manage the memory differently if the stuff is never going to change versus if it's going to change and so if I go now to tension flow Jas and I look here at TF variable we can see this is now something that has a new parameter called trainable so in fact you can add this thing called an optimizer to it and adjust it so that's an important thing I wanted to mention and I'm just going to leave it at that for right now if I need to use a TF variable later we'll come back and look at when when I might want to use a TF variable versus just a TF tensor okay so I'm just taking a pause here for another little and I feel like I could do as many positive edits as I want now because I did that coding challenge in 15 minutes hmm I also I need to have one more piece of melon don't worry this is the last piece of melon memory management okay all right let's talk about the next piece of this which is memory management so let's say I'm going to now all of a sudden take I'm going to get rid of this variable thing and I'm gonna take all of this code and I'm gonna put it in draw what does that mean this means I am making a new tensor 30 or 60 frames per second this could have 30 pictures I can every time through draw so let's let's go and do that ooh oh and I don't where's the veto I don't need this in fact I can get rid of all this stuff right now so again this this code isn't doing anything but it's gonna I'm gonna make new tensors every time through draw so here it it's chugging along so how do i somebody somebody must know there's probably a way right can I go to like for memory a heap snapshot sure take snap take snapshot yeah all right somebody else somebody help me out here kites I use the task manager whoops task manager I want to see the fact that I have like a memory leak here just gonna show it yeah so let's make this more extreme so this code is running running running and what I want to do is check how much memory it's using now there is this there are different like memory and performance evaluation tools so they can use in the developer console I'm gonna do something a little simpler right now I'm just going to go here to the task manager in Chrome and in task manager I'm going to is I'm gonna wait them it's gonna take a minute to wake up here but what we can see is the memory footprint so the browser as a whole I have a tense I have the tension flow Jeff's website and then this is the tab for my code and also there's like a GPU process running so what I want to do is look at this seventy five point eight point nine seventy six point three point four so this is actually just going up kind of slowly but it's going up it's never going back down if you are writing software where the usage of memory just keeps increasing over time and never stops this is what can be known as a memory leak I have to pause for a second I don't know if Nikhil I don't think the keel is watching today I forgot to tweet that I started this Nikhil is one of the creators of tensorflow digest is this memory actually the right thing to look at because what I want to show is how the like would that actually show up here if it's using like the GPU memory like this which is different like is it actually this that I should be looking at GPU process that's going well let's see what I'm going to do is let's change this to B so this is 2 by 5 by 3 so it's 15 by 2 if we do it 15 by like by a hundred let's just do a lot more and let's let's be really extreme about it got to come back and do this I suspect I mean certainly going up a lot faster so maybe it is the GPU process is staying stable and this is going like way up way faster right I would have thought it would be on listed under the GPU process yeah but look at that but you can show GPU member by rightclicking on the header of the chrome task manager and choosing GPU memory I'm trying to right click on the header of the task manager I'm not seeing how to do that whoops oh and the keel is in the chat no that's a different Nikhil that's a different Nikhil well hello Nikhil Siviglia different Nikhil then Nikhil Thor at unless Nichole Paredes in the chat table header row oh there we go memory footprint GPU memory it's interesting because the memory leak is clearly here looked all over couldn't fine right that's clearly the memory leak but the GPU memory is tiny and this is stable I mean let's hold on let's I mean let's be a bit more thoughtful here let me do this because it's just not garbage collecting whoops sorry that I have to take this break here like does this stay stable now I'm not making anything yeah so this is a bit of a mystery to me why the memory leak would show up here under memory footprint is it possible that I don't have GPU enabled how would I test that override software overrides the building software and enables jeep an unsupported that's enabled I think I have GPU enabled Oh GPU only gets involved once you train you can't fill up the CPU memory either it's just a gate you won't see the GPU process the other GPU is enabled I think that K we c'mon right I think the GPU only gets involved once you train the tensors are only moved to GPU memory when you start doing calculations why else would it be moved to GPU memory it does make sense that is a very very good point got it got it the GPU is just for computing okay so like if I were to do something like yeah but this still is a memory leak like watch now so maybe I don't need to get into like right now I fixed the memory leak with by calling dispose this is what I wanted to demonstrate so I think I'm actually demonstrating this quite well which there was a key command to get the this is the one that should be going up before it was like crazily going up and now it's not anymore interesting okay I keep this there we go there we go okay alright alright come back that's you I'm gonna be this is gonna rewind all the way back okay so there are a lot of tools here in the in the chrome developer tools where I can evaluate performance and memory in a very detailed way what I'm actually just going to do is go to this task manager and what you'll see here with the tax task manager is it's shoving me I have the developer tools open I have tensorflow J the the page the webpage retention flow digest and I have my my sketch open in this particular tab here so what I want to do here let me just save this code and I move this over here and hit refresh so we can look and we can see like okay well what is the memory footprint this is the memory footprint right now of that with my sketch how much memory it's using now there's a question of is the memory CPU GPU and that's an interesting piece of complexity and it just sort of went down the truth of the matter is I'm like not doing very much let me go back and change this to like this was to 5 by 3 matrices so what if I made 10,000 of them and so that would be 15 10,000 times 15 numbers that I need and let's go back and let me move this over here and hit refresh and now if I take a look at the tab it's you can see it's starting to go up hold on why why is this misbehaving with me and not demonstrating what I wanted it to demonstrate I have to kill the task manager and reopen it I'm gonna try this again shift escape so weird sometimes it memory leaks them sometimes it doesn't well there we go oh there we go it just took a little while okay I'm gonna refresh this page I'm gonna pull up the task manager shift escape does not work for me I thought it might and let's take a look at the memory footprint for the p5 tensorflow sketch I'm running and let's see what happens to it not much give it a minute give it a minute it's definitely doing a lot of work it'll take a while where it triggers the jazz garbage collector until it can't anymore yeah yeah maybe this was a sort of pointless demonstration yeah there we go it kicks in now does it kick in if I don't yeah so maybe did it run out of memory somewhere else and then started to fill up somewhere else wow that's crazy so I wonder let me try doing an operation so what if I create I'm gonna have to what if I create two tensors two tensors and then let's look at let's do the matrix multiplication so I'm coming out of the tutorial you know we're in this is this must be element wise yeah this element wise a dot multiply B so let's just try that so let me call these a and B a equals a dot multiply B so let's take a look at this well it's actually just just curious here all right it's doing something it's doing that like if I do an operation maybe I needed to talk about operations before I talked about memory management there we go look at this there we go that's so I think whoever was explaining in the chat that it doesn't actually start to use the GPUs memory unless it you're doing an operation was right and now if I change these to yeah there we go this is the demonstration that I'm looking for by the way I meet someone named I meet in the chat asked how come you don't practice this stuff beforehand I you know it actually so I have different ways of doing things but for many of my videos and tutorials I the practice was really like teaching a course about it for years and years and years and this is not something I've taught before so I'm actually just figuring it out unfortunately as I go here but yes I could see why that might make sense you might prefer to just come back and watch the edited videos which a lot of this debugging gets taken out ok so now I'm rethinking this whole thing where maybe what I wanted to do was talk about operations first so I could leave my weird so when this gets published I could leave the amount of time I spent I could actually just we could just cut all of that I could just cut all of that and I could do I could start with looking at operations what makes the most sense I'm looking for your feedback here so I could just cut all of that that was an interesting exploration I'm just gonna move on video 3 is gonna be operations boy I hear the fan going nuts on this so let me just say no loop here real quick so that's option 1 what time is it this is new already oh crap option number 2 is leave all of my talking about variables and this kind of weirdness and then cut right to me saying actually I'm gonna talk about operations before memory management switch those talk about operations and then I mean I could do all these in one video to be honest now that I'm thinking about it variables operations and maths where I'm going to do so I'm going to make this all because I'm not really doing a comprehensive a tutorial here I'm just going to talk about in one video variables operations and memory management and I'm just gonna talk about operations first that's what I'm gonna do I think that makes sense okay yeah I'm gonna talk about TF tidy in I was going to choke dispose first and then all right got it so me I am so me is right this makes a lot of sense whoops I'm in the wrong camera that the library keeps references to every tensor so that they can't be garbage collected right so the tensors can't be garbage collected because what if you want them to copy them onto the GPU but they don't actually go onto the GPU until until you do until you actually do an operation okay okay Lappe 2 3 4 says should there be a video on matrix maths I already made all those videos so this is really picking up on that so ok so Matthew if you're watching I don't know if this is gonna work and I can always just come back and do all this over again which I'm happy to the way that I'm gonna have this work right now is everything up until basically I came over here and did this can stay in the video and then we're gonna cut to me saying I'm gonna change how I'm teaching this and then I'm going to go straight to operations so in the code I need to back myself all the way back out to where I had variable and how the stuffin set up yeah okay okay Simon rights make through video three just variables and video for operation I could make video three just variables but wasn't that just like four minutes I guess people are happy to watch a fourminute video but I sort of feel like for me my the way that I'm kind of doing things the videos need to be like 15 to 20 minutes that's kind of like the chunk maybe that was like 20 minutes I don't know what I'm talking about oh I was feeling so confident well who knows I'm just doing my best okay where's the eraser hi so I'm back actually with a weird edit point because I just went down a rabbit hole of trying to figure something out about memory management and I discovered that actually the memory management stuff makes a lot more sense to talk about after I've already looked at operations so let's actually I'm gonna switch this order here and right now in this video that you are watching I'm gonna talk about operations next and then maybe I'll move maybe I'll take a break and move on to memory management in the next video something like that okay so let me come back and talk about operations so what do I need when I'm saying operations not the kind of operation like I had here on my elbow recently not that recently a year ago so now it's too late I already alright so let's talk about operations okay what do I mean by operations so if I come back to whoops if I come back to the tension flow digest webpage there's actually a part of the sidebar here part of the API which is all about operations and when I to get my bad phrase that's what I mean mathematical operations that I want to perform on the tensor itself what if I want to double every number in the tensor or I want to take two tensors and element wise multiply every number by every other number what if I want to do matrix multiplication between those two tensors now this would probably merit a whole video series about linear algebra and matrix math luckily or unluckily for you I made a whole series about that already so you could pause here and go and watch that I would also refer you to the three blue one brown video series on linear algebra which is excellent so rather than get into the weeds of all of the mathematical pieces themselves I just want to kind of like look at a few and see how you would use these okay so let's for example say I want to use TF add so if I click on that I can see uh add two tensors elementwise a plus B what does elementwise mean well what that means just to sort of recap is if I have two matrices a b c d and i have another one e f g h and i want to add them together and i want to see the results elementwise means a plus e b plus F right I just take them ones that are in the same spot and add them together so we could create we could do that right now in our code and I could say I'm gonna call this tensor a and I'm gonna this is a little bit silly but I'm just gonna make a second one that's with the same numbers in it obviously I'm more likely would have two tensors with two different values and then what I want to do is say TF wait how do I let me look at this Oh a add B sorry so what I want to do is I'm going to say Const C equals a add B which by the way would be exactly the same as saying B add a in this case with other operations the order of the matrix the matrix the tensor so I shouldn't say matrice matrix matrices so that really could play a role so if I say a dot B and I were to say a print B print C print and I come back here and go and hit refresh we're going to see you know here's a here's B they're the same and then every number is doubled basically because I took a plus B so really obvious I should make two different random sets of numbers but this is this is how an operation works and depending on what you're doing you need different mathematical operations let's see if there's any other ones we want to look at maximum minimum modulus per what would be a good one to look at squared difference is a good one do I wanna know the basic math stuff I'm not gonna look at right now I think I should look at matrix multiplication probably our transpose reduction minimum of so much stuff here okay I'm not gonna go through all this let's look at all right so as you can see there are a lot of things we could subtract multiply divide there's maximum minimum modulus power squared difference all need to be interesting to pursue and I might come back and do more videos about particular mathematical op operations but really I think just showing you ad hopefully now you could kind of look at the documentation and see what each one does I think it's worth at least doing there's a lots of other math functionality but I think it's worth looking at matrix multiplication TF NAT mall because this is a really key concept in building a neural network how to do this weighted sum of all of the inputs and all of the weights passed through you really need matrix multiplication if you go back and watch my other videos so let's look at this one so here we can see a dot mat mole so really it's just another function but we're gonna run this an interesting thing here what if I were to try and I don't need to print I'm not gonna bother printing a and B let's just try this right now so I'm going to write this would work a dot multiply and ul B because that's doing element wise a time you know in this case a times B times FC times G let's go back and I'm gonna hit refresh oh it worked so I guess the way okay of course it works I forgot I was doing L then what of course of course it worked I'm doing element wise multiplication I'm trying to demonstrate here that if I actually want to do matrix multiplication which is a totally different thing mat mole is that what was called now there we go oh I love this is like my favorite error this is very simple these are like kinds of areas are gonna run to all the time themselves before era matmo inputs must be ranked 2 got ranks 3 and 3 the reason why this is is when you do sorry I'm seeing a super chat thank you to Daniel hello to Brazil this is gonna make a editing point for I also I also wanted to oh you can get the amount of tensors in memory by saying TF dot memory ah Thank You me that's gonna be really useful me I am to me thank you matrix multiplication hold on I the columns and rows that the number of columns and the first one equals the number of rows in the second one yeah when you do matrix multiplication the number of columns in the first matrix a has to match the number of rows in the second one and by the way you can't even have like a this is fully you can't have a rank three you get your majors month so this by the way this whole thing is flawed because this was only gonna work so let's if I have a rank two mate tensor or basically a matrix a two dimensional array so now let's get a different error message now error in math so first of all matrix multiplication is only for matrices in two dimensions tensors in two dimensions and then the error here is the inner shapes three and five of the tensors with shapes five three and five three are in transpose so what's this error message about to do matrix multiplication the number of columns in the first one must match the number of rows in the second Matrix in here this would work this would actually work because these are two by two and so the columns here matches the matches the rows here and again if you go back to my video on matrix multiplication you'll see why in more detail about this so but just to follow up here what I must do now in order to do Mitra's multiplication as I probably would have shape for a I could transpose one of them but let's do this first so I'm gonna do shape a and then I'm gonna do shape B this is a good time to cover transpose and shape B and now this should give me something there we go there's my new matrix and out of matrix multiplication if I am doing excuse me a five by three multiplied with the three by five I end up getting a five by five matrix which is correct now another way I could have done this by the way is if I used the same shape for both of them if I backed in here I should be able let's do this okay I should be able to say B now let's just see what happens if I say B transpose no so here's the thing remember these things are immutable so even transposing it I probably have to say consul's be transposed and then I can do a dot mat mall BB and there we go so what does transpose do with the matrix transpose if I have a two by three matrix we'll take that matrix and transpose the numbers into a three by two matrix so again why do I I'm not doing anything of any value or meaning here if you go back you could probably go back as an exercise if you want an exercise right now go to my toy neural network look at nnj s go through all of the matrix maths that in that and see if you can rewrite that with the tensor flow the TF operations I don't know why you'd want to do that but if you want to just do everything you could possibly do in this world that's something you could try and maybe I'll try to publish something which is like an answer key to that I don't know you could ask me in the comments or somebody could make one I could post it alright so I think this is about where I want to stop right now again this is not meant to be comprehensive I just want to talk through what are the pieces here we know that there are tensors tensors are n dimensional groups of numbers with we can also those are immutable they can never change if we need them to change we could use this thing called a variable maybe we need to see an actual scenario where we need that variable hopefully that'll come up in one of my videos in the future but you could try it yourself and then we can also perform operations we can perform operations like take these tensors that take this tensor and add this one or double this or find the maximum number and this one and there's plenty plenty more matrix multiplication so I encourage you to explore all of those and maybe I'll come back and go through some of them as we need them but I just want to give you an overview of what's there in the tensor flow jsapi itself so in the next video I'm gonna talk about something very important because I have not been paying attention at all to how whenever I create a tensor I'm using memory in of the computer and sometimes I'm using maybe I'm using memory that's all you know in the RAM sometimes using the GPU memory what's going on with all that so I want to in the next video specifically talk about memory management and how to make sure if I'm making all these tensors and doing all these operations how I how to make sure I avoid having a memory leak okay I'll see you in that video ok so ok so I think where are we now 1220 I'm about an hour ok so I think that you know that wasn't my best finest work but I think we're good I'm gonna keep it and I can always come back so I have to reconsider whether I want to kind of read do a discussion of variables and operations but I think something can be pieced together from that Matt Matt you can do some magical work so now I'm going to start with memory manager all right it's time oh boy it's time you know hold on I think I hear tissue I just had a little pizza snot gurgle up there here's one yes hold on I'll be right back I should meet my microphone apologies for the noise okay I'm back I just saw a question in the live chat that's going on right now saying what's the memory leak guess what you're gonna find out what a memory leak is in this video in particular how to manage memory if you using tensorflow no chance now here's the thing I live in a world where I generally program either in processing which is built on top of Java or I program in Java and be fought with the p5 library in the language JavaScript and I don't have to worry about memory management I mean often do but most of the time I don't there's something my friend my friend Liv lives in the computer their name is garbage collector and the garbage collector just kind of is always there checking to see if I'm using any of my variables anymore and if I'm not collects that memory and reallocates it for somebody else a memory leak is something in your program which continues to allocate memory over and over again and yet where you don't need to you'll need to remember that stuff and so you're filling up the computer's memory and it's just to infinity and eventually the memory will be full and your program will crash your computer will crash I mean maybe it's not a leak technically if you keep if you need to save all that stuff but most the time like if you're creating a variable that's just keeping track of the computers like a score in a game and your reallocating new memory for that score over and over and over again and you don't need the old score you should deallocate that memory and if you're programming in like a lowlevel language like C or C++ you sometimes have to manage this memory yourself higherlevel languages that are more apps that have a layer of abstraction the browser is there to protect us I think as a java virtual machine they have a garbage collector that handles some of this memory mandrin tests are dope flow duchesses in this sort of funny inbetween place and we're programming in JavaScript but tensorflow digest is doing some highly manual management of the memory of your GPU to do all this fast math operation so we have to make sure we carefully think about how our allocating memory and explicitly deallocate memory so that's what I want to look at so let's take a look we're gonna this is gonna be exciting we're gonna make a memory leak happen and then we're gonna fix it yay all right so what so this is the car that I had before let's actually keep this this is kind of interesting but what I'm gonna do instead is I'm gonna take all of this code and I'm going to put it in draw what's draw you might ask Oh again there's no reason for me there's no particular reason why I need to be using p5 the p5 library with tension Fletch s right now but one of the things that p5 library has it has this animation loop if you write the function draw it's going to execute that function 30 times per second 60 frames per second depending on the situation so I just want to hit save and now I'm just gonna hit refresh so in theory this is chugging along right now so the question is how do I look at how much I mean there's I don't see anything like I could like maybe what I want to do is do like console dot log hello just to make sure it's like running and we could see the hairs I'm seeing hello over and over again over here over and over again in the console so it looks like if the programs are running fine it's running fast no problem let's look and see what memory it's actually using so there's a lot of tools up here whoops no here that I don't really know how to use for evaluating the performance of your webpage in the developer tools I'm gonna go and you up here under window and go to task manager one of the nice things about tattle oh my goodness we definitely have a memory leak okay I think and I think I filled it up I think probably the GP so the memory footprint so let me scroll this over here so we can see these are the various things that browser is this is the browser as a whole so this is the regular computer's memory the tensorflow documentation tab is using 94 megabytes FIFA but the GPU which is just filled its way up to 2 gigabytes really fast let's try let's try setting the frame rate 2 to 1 and refresh the page and let me go back to the task manager and maybe now we can see Wow it's already at two gigabytes am I gonna go down this rabbit hole again let's so let's just be clear about stuff let me comment all of this out let me comment out all of the tensorflow Jas stuff and let me hit refresh again let me go back to the task manager I think I might have to click the task manager might not refresh its values ah you know what if I don't reopen the No Wow why do I have to look let me hold on just bear with me for a second let me quit Chrome it's crazy how I want to use the TF memory thing but I wanted to just look at it in I wanted to look at it in here we go okay so something was going on with the browser probably I had filled up the memory somewhere else so I just actually quit Chrome and restarted it so now you can see the GPU is using thirty two point eight megabytes of memory which isn't that much and maybe over time it's gonna like to go up because I make it oh oh actually no it's not because I also in testing things I commented out sorry I comments without all the tensor stuff so let me put the tensor stuff back in right and now let's take a look at the GPU memory so I'm gonna close the task manager I'm gonna hit refresh now I'm gonna go to the task manager again and I'm gonna look here that's it I'm gonna look here at this number so we can see I'm using some memory maybe it's gonna go up maybe not but the thing is I've got very I'm using like a very small amount of numbers so really what tensorflow digest is designed to work with the reason one is to work with large amounts of numbers so let me go back to my code and let me just say what if instead of having 15 numbers I'm gonna have 15,000 which would be 500 by 300 so I'm gonna have a 5 to 500 by 300 matrices transpose one of them and do matrix multiplication so let's do that let me now let me hit refresh one weird it's very hard to demonstrate whoops oh not 50 150 thousand 15 that whoops oh that should actually be a hundred fifty thousand let's do that one hundred fifty thousand that's what I meant let me hit refresh let me go back to the task manager and now let's look at that memory it's going up little by little it's going up now let's say I was trying to do that 30 frames per second let's get rid of this frame rate 1 hit save close the task manager the task manager I feel like needs to be and I'm gonna go back and open up the task manager my last time demonstrating this and now I really want to see this memory leak I want to see this number go up 63 66 68 so you can see the memory is leaking right I don't need just keep storing all the to keep track of all these tensors that I've been making every time through draw and maybe there might be some kind of oops I want to sort by memory man whoops where where am I here GPU yeah so you can see this number it's going up and up and up so and actually wasting a lot of memory regular memory also ooh oh boy up and up when up we go ah sorry watch it maybe edit out like the last 5 10 seconds of what I've been saying don't have to just slide to the left of the page so it sticks out and click back and forth to give it focus okay yeah probably need to restart chrome yeah so I'm gonna just do like an edit point and like I'm gonna let this go real high but you can kind of go back as much as you can to like get rid of all my awkwardness and now I think we're in good shape okay so I let this run for a little bit we could really see the memory leak is happening you know this is only gonna go up it's never gonna go down so one of the things now there's i I'm using the task manager the truth of the matter is and I'm just gonna I'm gonna type in here no loop just to shut this off for a second the truth of the matter is tensorflow digest provides us with a mechanism to check this as well so I can also say TF dot memory let's actually go to the API API reference memory TF memory and I can look at the number of bytes allocated the number of tensors this tight kind of thing so let's actually look at let's let's look at number of tensors so I can say I think TF memory dot num tensors I can do what's maybe it's just is it a function or is it a property let's try this console.log this oh let me get rid of the hello so you can see here these are all the tensors being stored and they're going up and up and up the good news is there is a way to get rid of tensors that you don't need anymore and I'm gonna write that down there are two functions you want to know about for memory management one is called dispose and there might be more and I just written off the edge we try that again there are two functions okay probably there might be more than this but there's two functions that I want to talk about as they relate to memory management there is the function called dispose and there's the function called tidy and there they do the same thing they clean up memory that's not used but they do it in a different way so let's look at how that works so coming back over here if I go into my code and I say like these are all my tensors a B a B and C I'm gonna call this B underscore T because that's actually like sometimes I feel like a naming convention like transposed to B this is my own naming convention and I'm gonna say a dot dispose B dot dispose C dot dispose and B underscore t dot dispose so this is me manually despo after you know this is like do something meaningful here like I want to do something meaningful with these tensors and then I'm done with them I want to dispose them so now let's run this again I'm gonna hit refresh and look zero zero zero zero the Argo tensor stored in memory and in fact if I go to the task manager we should see load up please that the GPU process is not growing it's at 229 megabytes and it's not getting any higher there is no longer a memory leak we have correct fixed the memory leak the thing is so that's good that's step one we we've talked about dispose the thing is you might be writing a program using tension flow to ask more you're just making tensors like crazy you're just tense or happy and so really having to manually keep track of everything and call dispose on everything can become rather unwieldy and that's where TF tidy comes in so TF tidy is a function that you don't call on a particular tensor but it allows you to wrap a bunch of code in that will get cleaned up when it ends what I mean by that is I can say TF tidy my stuff and then I can write a function called my stuff where I do all of this so what this is doing is saying execute this function my stuff but make sure you tidy it up after you're done so let me run this and see what happens and you can see I still have zeros and just to be sure that this function is running let's put hello inside that function look and now we could see that function is running here's the thing you're not gonna see anywhere in any tension flow digest examples it written this way so you noticed yeah I'm just going to do a couple quick steps here I wrote a named function and past it into TF tidy I could more likely you're gonna see an anonymous function that doesn't have a name passed into TF tidy like this and even more likely than that you're going to see that arrow syntax so I encourage you to check my video on arrow syntax but this is what you're typically gonna see this is ah inside of the draw loop every time I want to do some stuff some meaningful stuff with my tensors but whatever I do I want that to be cleaned up and I don't think it will clean up variables I don't know if somebody in fact check me on this but I think the variable is something that gets held in memory does TF tidy clean I don't know why I bothered to say that so maybe cut that part out alright let's test this one last time we've got TF tidy and hit refresh and once again zero tensors let's put one constant test equals TF oh no whoa look at this this should be tensors to D by the way I'm surprised it didn't pick up it didn't give me an error there oh I think that's the same error that I filed a bug report at and that's been fixed maybe I maybe I'm not using the most recent version of tensorflow jjs is there a point xi no but when there is one that will be fixed its ignore me so now I'm going to go in here and I'm gonna say TF tensor to D values shape and I'm gonna run this oops to lowercase D and now we can see ah I'm creating all these tensors I have a memory leak these are getting cleaned up but I could you know manually dispose of this one I everything's been cleaned up or last piece this one could go inside of Tidy and then there we go alright and by the way I'm the chat is reminding me that there is a function called TF keep so I probably if inside of TF tidy I could use TF keep if I have all this stuff happening but I want to make sure to keep this one so this could get very complex very fast and I'm really trying to just give you a cursory overview here and hopefully as I start to build some examples where I'm trying to do stuff with tensor flow digest it'll make a bit more sense as we're using this stuff in the world okay thanks for watching see you in a what's next on my list oh the layers API alright so I'm gonna talk about the layers API next okay all right what time is it 1230 600 I'm definitely not getting to X fourth this morning if I could come back last but the Citiz less we're gonna didn't come back small chance I could come do a little more this afternoon so laters API that's a big topic I almost would rather just do like I wonder I wonder if I should come back to that another day think I'm gonna come back to that another day because that's a big topic and that's really paired with the X or things 1236 I'm looking at the chat hello Hong Kong so what's gonna be what about what have I done let's come back over here and check so I did this now we talked about variables we talked about operations we talked about memory management ok the layers API so much to discuss I guess I could do a video about the layers API I just do I feel tired the other thing I could do is I could go do that water ripple coding challenge let's put it to let's I'm gonna do let's put it to a straw poll or I could go now it should increase my chances of coming back this afternoon I might feel a little bit more refreshed but let's see here I want to get some water anyway so look layers API this is not the boat which layers API water ripples coding challenge so just to be clear the layers API means just like another one of videos in this similar style where I'm like this is the layers API this what the things are named this is what they do here's a quick little like try something out but not really using it like I will eventually use it doing any of these particular examples like X or color predictor or doodle classifier and the water ripples coding challenge is the water ripples coding challenge is trying to follow this old article from days of yore to make a little like water ripples simulation know if you can see this but I don't you can't really see this very well but so that's those are your choices so I will give this a little bit of time and moving its I want to get some water so I'm gonna be back in I'm going to oh well I'm not gonna take 15 minutes to get water forget it you don't need a timer oh well I could also just put it here I'm gonna be back I'm gonna try to get some water I don't think I have a cup up here so this microphone is about to get muted while I go get some water and I'll be back in about five minutes and I'll do just one more thing this morning I mean the music goes on for four minutes hope I'll be back before the music shuts off you know what must have happened what must have happened is when I went so far away lost the connection so I don't know what that would have been but it was definitely muted the whole time so it must have like lost the can I went pretty far away went like all around the opposite side of the building and it's connected wirelessly so huh okay look I found though paper towels so sorry if there was like a horrible sound thing that happened there I guess I should know that now shouldn't it should know that by now all right let's take a look water ripple coating showers hey only 67 people voted all right this is probably a terrible idea for a variety of reasons but we're gonna attempt this water ripples coding challenge so next time I do this I should software muna in Wirecast and OBS like this wait yeah you did I'm not you did i'm not muted okay all right they're also gonna just been no so I'm definitely gonna need me the whiteboard for this but I want to keep my list Oh finally can I take a minute I would like to take a minute of your time to just mention one of my favorite youtubers simone geertz i don't know if i'm pronouncing her name correctly let's find her channel Simone it makes the lots of I don't like to swear on my channel Alec at all she has a lot of subscribers she makes the most amazing robots she's awesome check out her channel subscribe to it go back watch all of her videos if you haven't seen it I wanted to just plug her patreon for a minute she recently published a video about a brain tumor that she has and she has amazing which is no surprise really a completely amazing attitude about it and sense of humor in what is obviously an incredibly serious and difficult thing to go through I you know watch her video if you want to hear the medical explanation about it I'm not qualified to speak for her or speak about it but I do want to mention that I did support I did subscribe to her patreon it in or that she had one or it just occurred to me and I know that you know she's gonna be on high you know I was on hiatus for a couple months when I broke my elbow but really having surgery on my elbow to fix some pones is nothing compared to what she's going through with the so I would encourage you if you can to subscribe to her patreon I mean I have one too but I think that if if you can have a lot of supporters through her patreon that'll hopefully help her get through this amount of time or I imagine she can't make videos for her channel and if anybody else is a youtuber who has them or anybody else in the world has some ideas of ways of supporting Simone I know she has large larger following than I do certainly and so there's a lot of people supporting her already I'm sure but if there's as any ideas or things we can do to support her I think that would be a nice thing to do okay now I am ready for this coding challenge so this I go this is so let me I'm gonna do this in processing I'm going to call this water ripples why am i why in a million years am i starting this right now I have no idea but I am hello and welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make a 2d water simulation now you might be asking how are you going to do so so this is actually I wrote this code not I didn't invent this algorithm but I wrote this code it's got to be at least 10 years ago this is one of the first things this essay on how to create this algorithm for creating 2d water ripples has been on the internet for a really long time in fact it's not on the internet anymore this was the URL and this URL hugo dot elias it doesn't go anywhere but thankfully the Internet Archive and I don't know who this person is who wrote this essay thank you hello if you're out there let's get in touch write in the comments but this is a really fun algorithm and it works it's very if you if you're looking for some background for it you want to know a little bit about how pixels work twodimensional arrays may be cellular automata this idea of a grid of cells with States I've had a bunch of videos that I made related to how this algorithm works that I will link to in this video's description excuse me but what I'm going to attempt to do in this video is just read this web page and write the code that falls along exactly what doing and see if we can get the result that is on that it's described here to create 2d water ripples so let's just get started I'm apologize for having to have to read this out loud okay bahbahbah narrative narrative narrative narrative so firstly you'll need two arrays of words well integers okay so let's do that so let me go open up processing processing I always feel I have to say this is a programming environment built on top of Java more information at processing org download this if you want to follow along and I will create a JavaScript version of this that runs in the browser as well when I polish the code all right so let's set void setup void draw these are the sort of basic functions to control the flow of the program in processing and I'm going to say I'm going to make two 2dimensional I'm just gonna say like 100 by 100 just arbitrarily right now let's actually do a 200 by 200 and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say water one water 2 because I don't know what those are could be useful yet look at this and like I'm gonna say size 200 200 okay so I have a window that is 200 by 200 pixels and I have this these two missionaries and I bet you couldn't write like a super fast crazy version of this with shaders or something so maybe you're watching this you're gonna want to do that later but let's try to do this basically just follow along okay back to here that's right these arrays will hold the state of the water one hold the current state the other holds the state from the previous frame so let's actually call this current and previous oh why can't those have the same number of letters in them no preview play view so this is gonna be current and play view whatever now that bothers me more previous okay it's important you have to erase this you need to know how the water has changed since the last frame buffer too but for one buffer I could call them buffer one buffer anyway data from the previous frame blah damping some integer between 0 & 1 so we need some sum so we need to have a damping let's try 0.9 so the beginning loop what I need to do well first I need to I I need to fill those arrays with some values strengthen matters I think they're going to get filled by default with with zeros and I also want to I think I want to keep track of the columns and rows in a variable oh that didn't work the way I wanted it to I lost my ability to type oh that's right all right there we go for every knot so let's this is begin loop so this is the it boy this background is making hard for you to see the algorithm but for every non edge element so let's do that for every non edge element what does that mean for int X x equals 1 let's actually use I and J I equals 1 I is less than columns minus 1 I plus plus that is a way of looping through every non edge element and I'm gonna do the same thing with j j is less than rows minus 1 and a j plus plus alright and now what do I do let's just copy paste this and say all right so what this really means here is this is saying current the current X Y which is really current I J is equal to the sum I mean you can see these are a bunch of neighbors X minus 1 X plus 1 y plus 1 Y minus 1 what this is really doing if I come over here to the whiteboard you'll have to excuse this I'm doing some tutorials about tensorflow yes I didn't want to race that so that's still here in this coding challenge basically if this is my current IJ I want the new value that goes in this IJ to be a function of its value as well as its neighbors to the right to the top to the left and the bottom so that's what's happening here so I'm gonna go and I'm going to say equals previous X minus 1 y plus previous oh and it's not X I'm using I and J which now I regret making that decision oh this is a good timer going up hold on sorry everybody that was a timer for when I had to go get the drink I got that hold on I don't like to interact alright that timer wasn't there visible was it okay okay Matt gene you can edit a little bit of this out if you can all right i J it's all plus right now let me go back here wait these are being or these being multiplied by each other this is weird where are the pluses I sort of assumed this was all being added together right it doesn't actually say let me see does it describe this yeah I'm pretty sure this is addition well let's try it it would make sense to add everything together so I minus 1 J boy I plus 1 J then plus I J minus 1 plus I J plus 1 rule come on indent this the way that I like plus and then so that this whole thing divided by 2 minus previous I J so I think I got that right so basically and let's actually let's just do this so this should be all of it I mean I don't love the way this is Auto formatted but we'll live with it I can actually put this on the next line might make me happier so this is all of these added together previous I minus I minus 1 I plus 1 J minus 1 J plus 1 all added together divided by 2 minus what the current value is so this is kind of like an image processing algorithm you're saying like add up all the things around me and then subtract my value ok now display buffer 2 and swap the buffers wow this is really coding jobs gonna be over soon so what do I what's one way I could display it hmm well let's first set a background and then while I'm doing this I could say load pixels and I could say update pixels right because what I could do is I could use the value of current IJ to be the pixel color yes so I'm gonna say pixels so let me first get an index value index equals I plus J times columns this is an algorithm that I've talked about many many times this has to be inside of the loop this particularly my talked about many times and what this algorithm is doing is it saying like the pixels are actually stored in a one dimensional array but I'm looping through this twodimensional array so find the right location in the one dimensional array and then give me a color equal to the current I J value ok and update pixels so let's just run this and see if anything happens it's all black that's good because it's all zeros right what if I were to just initialize let me just go through I didn't actually do the swapping part but just just for the sake of argument let me go through and actually write something to initialize that whole array two dimensional array and just say current I equals 100 previous let's just bij J equals this is a little bit silly what I'm doing but I just want to see that this is working run this again we should see a gray value whoops run this again right we see a gray vow if I do 255 for both of those I'm gonna see white okay so it actually is rendering what's in there and then I forgot something really important which is written in the algorithm swap the buffers because what is now current should be previous for the next frame and then we have a new current which would then become previous for the next frame and so there's a nice swapping algorithm that I can use to do that I can create a two dimension of referenced called I'm gonna call temporary which should equal current then I'm gonna say previous equals oh no no I miss 8 which equals actually yeah previous 10 so I missed a previous is now the current right the current is now previous and then I can just reuse that other the previous one for current instead of making it new twodimensional array this is a swapping algorithm I have to store a reference to previous because I'm gonna overwrite what previous is pointing to but then I'm gonna set current equal that so this should now still work but I'm not gonna see anything so now hopefully we're gonna see something now here's the thing I kind of I kind of want these to be floats I don't know why they're integers sort of feel like they should be floats so I'm gonna do all this like math to them and so this should also be a float and now what if what I'm going to do is I'm going to whenever I click the mouse so let's just see if this works to be lets say previous previous like 100 100 equals 255 and um let's see if this is gonna do what I think it's gonna do I'm just thinking thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking like a crazy person while I'm livestreaming does this make sense what I'm doing of whatever let's just run it yeah there we go ooh something happened it's like spread it spread out from the center there mmm what did I get wrong that was interesting both times look at this algorithm Oh if did I forgot about the dampening I forgot about the dampening very important there so where do I do that so now I also need to say current I J I need to dampen it equals current IJ times damping I call it damping or dampening I guess I should call it dampening right dampening hmmm this didn't work the way I'd hoped so let's see here let's look at this this all of this all of this divided by two is this multiply is this these should be multiplied together what's the chance these should be multiplied but also it does say there it should be integers so I don't mean but what numbers should I be putting in these oh wait yeah this is adding okay let me look at this yeah whoops but oh the camera went off thank you this deal is little debugging sessions gonna have to get edited eret line 37 right so is my swapping wrong swapping should be right the swapping should be fine breathe I think the swampthing is okay but what I'm interested in here is this the same thing destination oh that's interesting oh but that's the same it shouldn't matter more damping or hey hold on let's try throw it let me try let me be 0.9 just isn't enough let me try 0.5 whoops no I don't think the dampening is happening all right I guess it is weird some weird stuff is going on here it does should these be normalized values between zero and one and maybe I should just be like scaling up by 255 that's where the same thing what's the difference they're right mmm it's current not previous yeah but why would that make a difference wouldn't that not make a difference whoaohohoh it does make a difference it definitely makes a difference why does that make a difference yeah that's no dampening yeah it's very different but how could my brain is not cool that's not clicking into my brain right now it's very different because so I start with all these previous values and then the current value is equal to oh because it's been swapped of course it's different because it's been swapped okay so let me because it's different data right thank you it's been cuz of the swap we didn't we didn't start from a blank thing okay yeah I didn't notice that here thank you okay whoops so I didn't actually I wasn't being very careful here this I should actually be taking whoops sorry hold on there's uh I'm back that was edited out like a me just like spinning my head around for a while there because I really was not being very careful it this is says buffer 2 here this says buffer 1 here and in my code I have previous I'm adding up all the previous dividing that by 2 and then subtracting out previous but that's not what I want right because we have current and we have previous and so it's different data so I'm taking the neighbors from previous and then subtracting out what's current so let me fix that let me fix that change that here the dampening is there I added that in while I was debugging maybe you've just saw me do that I'm not sure and now aha there we go that looked like a water ripple alright let's let's be a little bit more explicit of all let's um let's just make the dampening zero like really high I'm just curious yeah you can see that ripple kind of going out whoa and bouncing around the edges cool I'm gonna leave it at 0.9 now this is really what I want to do let me make this like 600 by 400 let me add mousepressed and by the way the let me put let me I'm gonna take the columns should equal the width I'm gonna put all this the rows should equal the height and I want to initialize I got to do this all after I set the size and now these I can set the the two arrays oh so I want to do all that and setup so that whenever I change the size of the window to the number of columns rows and the kind the two dimensional arrays all change so let's run this and see just see whoops what happened to my oh I commented it out that out so now what I want to do is when I click the mouse I want to find the right spot in the array and I want to say index equals Mouse X plus Mouse Y times rose and me clicking the mouse is like dropping a pebble into the water and so I can say I think I should I put it in previous I don't know it doesn't might not matter previous index oh no no no I forgot these are two dimensional arrays already so I can actually just say previous mouse X now it's y equals 255 so as I click and I'm just curious I think it'll actually work the same way if I put current yeah so let's let's use current kind of makes a little more sense to me let's D let's increase the dampening a bit I mean there's actually decreasing it so the ripples go out a little further I want to see them interact with each other that's pretty cool and so there we go water ripples in processing pixelbased water ripples and now would be so what Oh ooh what am I even doing what am I even doing Mouse dragged there we go how lovely look at this wonderful water ripples all rippling around good so yeah I think now I've made something that you the viewer could do much more with for example what if you thought about color what if you actually started with an image and then you made the sort of pixels of the image the initial values ah and you could like ripple over those oh I still want to do that I'm not gonna do that I'm gonna let you do that make something with this now this is eventually gonna get really slow and it's probably gonna be really slow into more the big larger the higher the resolution I make and if I'm gonna try to make a JavaScript version of it it's probably going to be really slow due to how slow pixel operations are in html5 canvas but I don't think about all this stuff I just want you to be aware of that I'm sure that some of you will write in the comments and have some clever ideas how to make this into like a shader or something that's optimize but I'm happy where this is this is twodimensional water ripples thanks to the Hugo Elias page from many years ago about how to do this algorithm in two dimensions okay thanks for watching goodbye alright line 37 is still wrong or is that just from before no I think I did not get her what's wrong with this bring director lingo back have the canvas adjust color with a rainbow effect yeah so many things alright it's 115 I'm gonna go I think I did a lot of stuff today I feel pleased yeah this would be a good for me to actually learn about shaders and come back to that I'm just looking here looking through my emails to there's anything really important there's more comments on my tensorflow example I'm whoops not here sorry a tensorflow where let me go to Schiffman repositories yeah here's I'm looking for tensor flow jet so this by the way is where I am creating some of these examples that I hope to make and kind of build from scratch in a video tutorial and I wrote some questions about this and I can XOR one and I think that and Nikhil Thor out is one of the creators attention flow digest responded here so so I'm gonna read this very carefully after I go off and I'm glad this is here because you know so when I this is going to be helpful information for when I come back and actually get to these parts here alright so thanks for tuning in today I can take a few minutes to answer some questions anybody in the chat have any questions you want to ask I'm looking at the patron chat I'm looking at the YouTube chat right now David Smith says there's a fantastic WebGL version of this in 3d with shader shaders made by Evan made by Evan WebGL water whoa that's cool that's better than mine how would webcam video input training neural network to play the chrome dinosaur game I would love to do that can you play chess I'm not very good I mean I know how to play chess I can play chess I'm also very good at losing a chess it's divided by two minus current I know I fixed that though that was the problem oh I think people are what I think people are like in the chat like thirty minutes or 45 minutes behind Oh pick up the ball how do I pick up the ball interactions press the spacebar drag the background drawing the water press drag the sphere to move it around wow wow this is crazy this is more than I could ever do all right how is AI useful for a startup well I think the first thing anyone should do when they're considering using an AI algorithm is ask themselves if they should be doing what they're doing and if what they're doing is kind of helping the world in some way so that's what I would say so I don't know that AI is useful for a startup I should still you should still do an introduction to firebase I have done an introduction to firebase alright so I think I'm gonna go let me play my goodbye song thanks everybody for tuning in now here's the Pearson I got good news bad news it's mostly just bad news I will not be livestreaming next week however oh yeah I don't know what do people think hold on what should I call that coding challenge my name a the fourth coding challenge star shy use the word the War of the Stars coding challenge so I think probably just may the fourth coding challenge is good I know that like may may the fourth be a part of your soul is a copyrighted phrase so I TV thesis week as next week may 8th to 11th I will be watching all of these thesis presentations there are many of them these will all be livestreamed so instead of watching me next week you should tune in to the live stream not on the coding train you have to go to this webpage ITP that NYU dot edu slash show slash thesis 2018 mark your calendars if possible I'm gonna try to be in the slack for those of you who are patrons and are in the slack Channel we can have a little like chat going in the live channel for these lot this live stream I mean I'd like to give my full attention to the students so I don't want to be just there in the audience like typing on my laptop but to the extent that we can have a discussion about them and answer to talk about them and answer questions during the live stream I'm available for that and yeah so that's what's coming next so that's next week so I won't have my regular coding trained live stream also if you are in the New York City area you should come to ITP Tuesday May 15th Wednesday May 16th I am tentatively planning to do my coding train livestream from the show Wednesday May 16th probably around 200 or 300 p.m. so usually like to do that before the official the show I think this year I'm gonna ask somebody to like hold the camera for me I would try I like
