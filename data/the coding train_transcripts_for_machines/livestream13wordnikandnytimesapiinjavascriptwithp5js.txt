I'm here in New York City at uh nyu's Tish School of the Arts ITP um and I've been making a whole bunch of video lessons about working with data and apis and Json files that's a loud noise outside like to have the window open for some air but I think I have to close it um so uh in today's session I'm going to spend about an hour or a little over an hour and I want to look at two particular apis the wordnik API which is one of my personal favorite apis because I like words and word Nick um as well as the New York Times API which is kind of a rich data set and I I don't mean to suggest in this session that okay these are apis to use for they are apis to use for a projects but I'm I'm looking at them in the context of they're good case studies of what apis look like and how you figure out how to use them and how you write some code to get access to them so I'm doing this as a live stream there's a chat running uh where you can ask questions um but I'm going to at certain points during the live stream I'm going to like hit a record button which will record like a 10minute section as like a kind of Standalone video Lesson that'll upload uh later to YouTube um as as its own thing so uh the first thing I like to do is uh just check to make sure you can see me not that you need to see me but you can see uh and actually um you know one thing I'll pull up here is if I just open up the uh P5 editor here this is a JavaScript uh editor oh I don't know what's going on now um I'm to make sure this uh font size works for you that you can see the font here you can can hear the sound looks okay and then if I come over here uh over to this whiteboard and draw a nice smiley face and say hello is this clear can you read this text can you see it so I'm going to use the Whiteboard I'm going to use the computer I'm going to use my own face and arms and hands my voice to talk to you uh about this sort of stuff and um uh and get started in a minute so I'm going to check the chat uh some people are there um saying hi so I haven't heard that everything looks okay and that you can hear me but I can I can actually see in the um in my sort of preview screen that the the text and everything looks fairly legible so let me know if something's not okay so um uh let me uh kind of now this is the part of the live stream where I get organized for what I'm going to do so rather than prepare in advance I sort of prepare during the stream and then hit the record button for the the actual lessons that'll get uploaded later and you can give me feedback back or talk to me as things are going uh so what I want to look at is just my list of things so uh if you haven't watched any of these videos before you haven't been with me on one of these live streams I've actually now made eight I think I have a little over 200 videos but I've made eight in this particular series about data so started with just what is data in general what are some different formats of data looked at this format called Json and how you could load Json from a local file how you could load Json from a URL and what it means to to sign up for an API and get data from an API so kind of assuming all of those videos and that the the API that I used as example is open weather map so I think what I'm going to and then I looked at a few different scenarios like how to get data from the API just when the program runs once how to get it when like the user performs in action and how to get data continuously uh while querying the API over and over again while the program is running so now that's all the stuff I did before and now today right here in this moment in time uh um I'm going to just let's look at some other apis and see kind of what happen so I think I'll start with word Nick um and so what I'm going to do in this first video is um so first let me get set up here let me get the uh um you know what I should do by the way let's do this together there's a new version of the P5 editor uh if I go to pjs. org uh there's also this lovely uh project but uh which is a CL oration between processing p5js uh the artist Leah and the um design firm so so limited where you can order some clothes as an aside um so what I going to do is I'm want to download the new editor right now which is uh version 0.5.3 um just has some bug fixes and things in it uh so I want to make sure I have that to work with for the examples that I'm going to make so I'm downloading that uh I'm going to go find it in my downloads this is like an I must have done this yesterday but I didn't actually install it and I'm extracting it this is this is like riveting like narrating using a computer and then I'm clicking on the file dragging it to the desktop and it's asking me if I want to replace it and I do replace it okay okay so now I have the new editor and I'm going to open that up oops I have the old editor open so I'm going to close that did that actually work we'll find out ah I think that didn't work because of my incompetence of having the editor open while I was trying to to install it so let me do that again copy this over replace now that should have worked move this up here launch it yeah I want to open it okay so uh and I'm going to close I'm going to make a new uh I'm going be in the editor and I'm going to make a new project and I'm going to close this one okay great so this will be our empty Standalone project where I will start to write code to use the word Nick API I also want to go to Chrome to get set up here and I will Google wordnik so first actually I think what I might do uh to talk about wordnik is first just look at the website itself and see how it has information about uh given words uh and then what I will do after that is go to the uh word Nick API which I could probably just get to from here um uh and under docs is where I want to go and then I'll start looking at how to sort of read documentation for an API and how you figure out how to use it and I think what I need to do is make the browser a little bit smaller and a little off to the right so that I don't stand in front of the important information too much blah blah blah blah blah blah blah okay anybody there yes you can see and hear the screen I've got a few people watching live which is always nice and I think I'm ready to start talking about the uh wck API you guys with me here okay um so I'm going to uh just go over I'm going to cycle the cameras which is a thing that I need to do cuz they I have this thing where they like turn off every so often I'm realizing one thing I think the scenario that I'm going to use for the wordnik API has to do with querying wordnik for related words words that are synonyms or antonyms and there's this concept of a hyperm and hyponym which is like uh a way of thinking of hierarchy I'm saying this in advance cuz I think I might have to talk about this in the video and this always gets me so a hyperm is essentially a word that uh is a represents the category of other words so primate being the hyper nimm for chimpanzee and chimpanzee being the hyponym for primate Furniture being the hyperm for chair does it sound right let me know in the chat think synonyms and antonyms I got similar words opposite words lots of other ways that words have relationships okay I think I I think I got that uh so I won't screw that up too much in the video checking the chat I see some names that I recognized from ITP back in the day nice to see you guys here Anthony uh and I'm going to minimize this where I look at my face and here we go so this is first video what I'm going to do is look this is probably going to be about 10 to 20 minutes um I'm going to look at the word Nick API and I'm going to look at what it is how you query it and how you might uh uh uh make a little I'm the example I'm going to make is I'm going to make a little sketch that has a word that you click on and when you click on that word it replaces it with a similar word it's gonna be awesome okay here we go just check the chat one more time make sure no one's yelling at me like you can't hear or see me uh okay here we go in three two I need like a person to stand there on the other side and go in three two and by the way I'm going to say this and then I'm going to start and then I'm going to like screw it up and start over again so I'm I'm getting a little anxious I feel like I have to go pee but I'm just going to I'm just going to start anyway okay in three 2 one hello welcome in this video I want to look at an API called the wordnik API which is an API that allows you to get lots of information about words in the English language so on the one hand this might be relevant to you in that you're interested in the word Nick API on on the other hand you just might be interested in how do you work with apis how do you work with data so I'm really looking at this as a case study of one particular API and I'll do a few more videos after this with other apis like the New York Times API and maybe some API that involves images okay so how where do we get started here so I'm using the p5js uh JavaScript library I'm using the p5js editor which you can get at pjs. org and uh let's get started so first of all what is this word Nick thing so let me go to my friend I like I don't my friends are things on the computer apparently uh the browser uh and look at the wordnik website so here I am just at word nick.com and I could type in a word like rainbow and uh I could see here that word Nick is giving me lots of information about this word it's giving me definitions it's giving me examples uh I can see here emology where does the word come from related words synonyms equivalents hyponyms so these there's lots of information lots of data associated with a particular word so word Nick is a vast dictionary and resource for gathering information about words and I I don't pretend to be an expert in it at all um I'm I'm I'm not an expert in anything actually but I'm looking at it from the lens of I'm a person who is talking about JavaScript code and data and apis this seems interesting to me let's try to make something with it so now this is just the wordnik website there's all this data there so you have to ask the question how do you get access to that data well the lovely thing here is that wordnik happens to say to you oh look you we have this data we want you to have it and there is is this thing called an API application programming interface a way for wordnik Server the programs that run in its server to send your program data through Json through the through this format known as Json and if you're if you don't know about how all that stuff works you can go back the beginning of this video series which kind of gives you an introduction to that sort of data format how this stuff works but I'm going to click over here and I'm just at developer. neck.com now and uh if I if I if I went to that you'll see there's a lot of information and things that you can look at but what I'm looking for is this I'm looking for this thing that says docs so how easy it is to use an API is only as good as the documentation and examples are and I think word Nick is a nice example of an API that has good documentation and so I'm going to walk you through how you can for you know I'm I'm I'm rambling way too much but I I am making a point in a way by rambling which is that a lot of the work involved with working with data and apis doesn't even have anything to do with writing code it has to do with reading the documentation playing around with the website clicking on things and figuring out how it works so that you know by the time you get to writing code you know exactly what to put in your code and that's the stage that I'm at right now so uh let me click I don't know where to look uh let me click on docs and here we are and you can see you know this this might be unfamiliar to you like what's going on here but you can see hm so I've looked at this before so I'm trying to like get I'm like doing like a a a method acting thing where I'm trying to pretend I've never looked at this before but I'm seeing here okay there's a bunch of options here to click on and this is quite common with apis in that there's sort of commands that you can execute with an API like maybe you want to ask for information about one particular word or maybe you want to get a list of words back or you want to ask for information about a group of words so these what what's what what's being shown here are the different API commands that you can kind of start with and I know for a fact that in the scenario that I'm imagining in my head I want to get information about a particular word so I'm going to click on this and it's going to show me aha so if you if you um in the pre in one of my earlier videos where I looked at open weather map it the whole thing was figuring out how to put together this API query out of a bunch of pieces so what the documentation is showing you right here is what are those pieces and in fact you can see like H if I want to get the definitions of a word there's like this part of the path then there's that part of the path and what's this thing here in between curly brackets oh that's the thing that I set myself so if I want to get the definitions of the word Apple I need this part of the path and this part of the path and I want to put Apple in there if I want rainbow I want rainbow in there if I want porcupine I want porcupine in there just some words I'm thinking of in my head so uh for this particular example what I want to do is look for related words so words that are synonyms words that are antonyms you know similar words opposite words those are the things that kind of might be intuitive to you but there's lots of other ways that words are Rel related to each other something's called a hyperm like Furniture is a hyperm for chair it's like a broad category uh and there are hyponyms which are the things in that category so they can have these hierar relationships of hierarchy so there's a lot more to this and somebody with more knowledge about it come and join me someday and talk about that but I don't even need to know be an expert on that I can click on this related words and start to see ah okay now here's this is something that makes me personally super happy and it should make you happy too if you want to work for an API work for work with an API um which is that this is a tool so I in order to figure out how to use the API this is now an interface where I can start to do things like okay let me put the word rainbow in here use canonical that must mean something important we could kind of read about that in the documentation later but false default that's fine relationship type oh I could pick a relationship type or I could just leave that blank limit per relationship type that must be how many things I get back so you can see I'm sort of configuring the API call that I'm going to make and then look at this button this is the greatest button I've ever seen and I've seen a lot of buttons and I'm sure I'll see a greater one later today but right now it feels like such a wonderful button because it says try it out so all I need to do is click on this and you can see first of all look what I've got I've got the full path to the API query so this is that API query that I spent all this time figuring out with open weather map the tools of the wordnik website are helping me make that query already so I can just literally copy paste this into my code and then it's also showing me what the response is so you can see ah look at this uh equivalent a seow oh a rainbow is equivalent to a seow I don't know what a seow is I guess it's a bow Over the Sea and you can see the hyper nms right Arc is like a broader category for a rainbow bow is a broader category what kinds of bows are there all my whole life I only ever thought there were rainbows now I know there are sea bows and other kinds of bows I mean there's the bows you wear in your head okay cross reference spous rainbow style ciny Bowl what anyway this is like fun I mean to me this is just fun like I'm I'm getting some moments of surprise here getting some data you might have a real reason why you're doing this but the next thing I want to do just to like really be sure that this is working the way I want is I can take this full URL and I'm going to just copy it again into my web browser just into the address bar and hit enter and you can see look at this this is indeed the data that's coming back so I've done I've now done essentially all the work that I need to do before I start writing code I found the API I looked around the website I enjoyed it I found that it has documentation and an API tool to help me like configure a query I did that it made the it made the uh add URL address for me and I put that into the browser and I see that I'm getting data so once I've gotten through those steps my next step is to start writing some code so really I need to use the low Json function to get this data and then I need to practice all the things that I've looked at in previous videos which is uh how do I get this is an object and then there's an array called words oh the for whole thing is an is an array so how do we dig into the data and and I'm going to get to that so let's um let's get started so um okay so one thing that I want to uh make a point of here is that once again we have this idea I'm going to just I feel like I have to use the whiteboard in the video which is sort of silly I don't really have to use the Whiteboard but again I need to do this thing where I think about this API call in pieces so I might have the path to the API I might have my API key as a particular variable and then I'm going to create that API call as like the API plus the API key and then something that goes here in the middle this is the word that I want to search for like rainbow or something like that so this is one of the things that I'm going to have to figure out is now that I have that really long URL you know that's you you can see it up at the top there how do I break it into pieces to make the query and the code so okay so let me come back over here and let's start uh writing some code uh first I'm just going to grab this URL and I'm going to go back to P5 and I'm G to say VAR URL equals and it's this long thing now one thing you'll notice by the way is there's an API key in there already like whose API key is that now um what wordnik actually I don't know that this is true but what I'm speculating is that wordnik when you're using their uh tool just generates a temporary API key that you can use to try out the API so hopefully this will work in my code for a little bit if not I have my API key saved in a file but again to do this yourself you're going to have to sign up for an account developer account with wordnik and get your own API key or like analyze this video and use mine which is fine with me my API key your API key that's how I feel about my API Keys okay um so couple things I want to do is I want to First realize that like okay I need this is the thing rainbow right there that's the thing that I need to put into the query myself so I'm going to put a a a end quote here and I'm going to then I'm going to make another variable that stores rainbow and then I'm going to make another variable that says uh URL 2 so I'm going to just divide it into two parts so this is one way of doing it right that big URL has the beginning and the end and the one thing in the middle that I need to change so I think this is kind of uh a way of doing it okay so uh next uh what I am going to do is I'm going to create I'm going to I'm going to have a a link on the page uh which will be like a button uh and I'll put the word rainbow in it uh sorry I lost my train of thought for a second I like went into some sort of Trans State forgot that I was making a video let me come back look what what am I doing here so first of all actually let me just check to make sure this works so I just want to add load Json URL one plus the word plus URL 2 uh to and then I need a call back where that data will come in so then I'm going to add that call back and the the call back the variable the argument that's part of that function that's what gets filled with the data and I'm going to say print line data just to see that this works so whoops and I better save this as something uh word Nick so let me run this and see if it works and you can see ah good something is happening there I got some data back so first of all we can be happy we know that this idea works now what I want to do is what I want to do is put something on the screen that when I click on it it makes that API call so I'm going to make a uh I'm just going to call it like a link and uh in I'm going to say link equals create a with that word in it so and it's going to link to nothing so okay so I I'm kind of jumping around here but in the P5 uh library in the Dom Library there's a function called create a which makes an anchor link you might say ahref equals google.com and then Google here I'm doing I want the word rainbow to link but to nothing I'm just putting the pound sign in there because it doesn't actually link to another URL I'm going to handle the click on it so if I look at this now if I run this sketch you can see here there it is Rainbow up at the top and I probably should add no canvas because there's like an invisible canvas there that's making the spacing weird and I can run this again you can see there it is up at the corner so I don't have any like clever styling going on here but there it is up at the corner so now what do I want to do I want to make it so when I click that link I'm going to make write a function called add word word ask word Nick then in that function ask word Nick I'm going to make that call to load Json right so here we've got a I can type I can type so here we go right what do I have now I have this web page that has a single link on it when I click on that link this ask wordnik function will be triggered that ask wordnik function will make an API query to wordnik and the data will come back so the question is what do I do when the data comes back back so first of all let's just see that this is even working so I'm going to run this again what I want to see right now what what happens when the data comes back I just should see something in the console down here so I click on Rainbow and I see something in the console down here perfect now what I want to do is look into that data and pull out a related word to the word rainbow so let's go back to here where I had that data open now what is this what is this oh my God I don't know this is an array you can see that square bracket bracket at the top means that it's an array what is each element of the array it's a kind of relationship so each element is a kind of each element AR is like equivalency hyper Nim maybe cross reference you can see and then what's in each element of the array a uh a property called Words which has another array which are actual the actual words that are related so for example if I wanted to get to this particular word c B I would say data Index zword index0 right data is the whole thing index zero is this first object wordss is that property index zero is that sibo let's try that so I'm going to go back to my code and I'm going to say print line data index zword index zero I think that's what I said right let's just look at that I'm going to run it and I click on Rainbow boom ah and look at that the most beautiful two words in the English language to me right now this is working CBO so what could I do with that well if I have access to this link why not just um change the content of it so I'm going to say link. HTML oops this is the wrong place I don't need this draw function I'm not using it link. HTML is is that data so there we go and now when I save this and run it again let's zoom in here I'm going to click on Rainbow and I'm going to see sibo so I queried the the word Nick API and I got back a related word what happens when I click on sibo H nothing I'm still getting sibo so what I want to do is now when I query again I want to get a related word to sibo so I'm kind of playing a game at telephone with the word Nick API 15 minutes into this video if you're 15 minutes into this video and still watching you know #o uh okay uh uh that's I don't know I don't know if this is really working my whole hashtag thing I feel like I'll such I like doofus um uh okay so uh H so what do I need to do this is always querying oh my finger disappeared this is always querying the variable word the variable word is always the word rainbow what I want that word to be is now sibo so what I really need to do is update the variable to be that word and then uh I'm going to uh add put the update the variable to be that word and then update the content so now the next time it asks wck it's going to pass in sibo so that feels like a very word strange word to say so I'm going to click here I get sibo and click there I get rainbow I click here I get CBO oh rainbow SEO rainbow so there's a flaw in what I'm doing right the the flaw in what I'm doing is I'm only ever getting exactly the first similar the first related word of the first related category so what what could be a better solution here think about that think about this why don't I pick a random category and a random word from that category so you know something you might do right now is pause the video stop and like try to implement that yourself I would wait for you but that doesn't make any sense so I'm going to go on and do this right now and that's going to sort of wrap up this video but this could be something that you could stop and try to implement on on your own but you can see that there's two numbers in here I'm getting the zero element of the data array and the zero element of the words array so what if I want to get a random element of the data array and a random element of the words array well I just need to use the P5 random function I could use the native JavaScript math. random but I'm using the P5 Library which has its own random function so I could say you know I could say uh index and maybe I'll call it index one equals random number uh between zero and data. length right data. length is uh is a data is that first array so I want a random number in that array but remember random gives me a floating point a decimal number so I need to use the floor function to chop off that decimal I don't want to be mean to the decimal to remove it nicely kindly put it to the side and I'll talk to it later decimal friend of mine um so then uh I'm going to now once I have that what do I need but a random word from whatever I picked so now data index one. length I uhw do length right I this is now right I picked a random index into the data array so I need to look at that array that that element in the data array and get a random index of the words array from that particular element and I'm going to call that index two so I'm going to say data index one words index 2 two I did this kind of quickly but hopefully this works and now I run this again and I've got rainbow arc flash bash bashed clashed clashes dashes Dash foil frustrate nugatory SL okay I don't know where this is going I want to stop now I'm worried I'm G get like a word that's very embarrassing for me to say like pumpkin that's not that's not embarrassing but I I don't know I couldn't I don't want to say the embarrassing word because then I'd be Em I'm easily very very easily embarrassed I'm already so embarrassed right now so I think this wraps up this video I mean there's so much more to word Nick I really only showed you just this one aspect of it of using this particular API call which remember is uh related words word. Json related words but you know I might encourage you if you watch this video and want to do something yourself go back to that API tool come back here I'm going to click back in the browser look at all these different possibilities I could get example sentences definitions top example um word Nick has this huge Corpus of lots of source texts and you can actually get word counts per year I think of frequency so you might look at something like how often is a word generally used in the English language over time so there's so much possibilities there I don't know you probably have better ideas write in the comments this is like the longest video I've ever made uh 20 minutes um and I thank you if you actually uh are still here watching and I'm in the next video I think I'm going to look at the New York Times API which is yet another API I wish you could just I wish I could stop and hear a question from you if there is actually a live stream going on and maybe there will be a question but I'm going to instead just hit uh uh and record goodbye and until the next time okay um hello is anybody still walking uh okay uh walking watching my brain is like not working today oh I lost the chat show chat uh oh I'm in the wrong place live dashboard oops oops I don't want to hear uh 10 people watching okay hi everybody were did you watch that that make any sense uh oh and I clicked on the wrong thing I'm doing all sorts of like lunatic stuff um uh I'm in the wrong place okay um sorry I said um and like I I was like I was just like using all my energy to like keep it together for that particular like video that I recorded which was 20 minutes and I kind of like lost it for a minute there but I'm back and uh I need to get like take a little moment to get situated I'm going to open the window because it's is very hot in here now and get some air uh and um I think what I'm going to do is look at the New York Times API in the next video although I'm open to other suggestions but I feel like that's sort of like a commonly used one um so let me figure out um I'm over here now erasing the Whiteboard uh if you have any questions or comments or something wasn't clear or or if like there was a problem in that video in that section um let me know um and I think what I'll do I'm trying to think of what's a good I mean the easiest thing probably the thing that makes most sense for me is to use the article search API um where I can just pass it a word and get articles back from a given time period that contain that word and I could display the headlines and maybe the snippet like a paragraph from it but if you have better suggestions of what might be a good demonstration I'm open to that I'm coming back over here um let me get situated here and New York Times uh apepi you're going to need a short break for a second I should get some I just just think I need I didn't bring a glass of water in here uh so I might take a break for a second I'll leave you guys to stare at this I can I'll leave you something fun on the I I don't know what that would be p5js website uh okay article search API I think I'll probably I think this is probably the thing that makes the most sense to start with the article search API um uh and uh oh Anthony asks word Nick visuals um certainly you could do a lot with uh visuals with wordnik I don't I don't believe the word Nick API provides you any particular like obvious data but you could you know for example with the related words you could build a kind of like networked diagram where you're seeing the relationship between the words instead of just one at a time that would be an interesting thing to try one thing wordnik does have is sound files uh with word pronunciation so that's kind of an interesting thing you could kind of build a weird little almost like speech to text thing where you just like keep quering the API and getting a sound for every word and play it back that's not speech to text that's Text to Speech but that's something that you could try uh okay so um I'm going to uh I'm going to um TW minute break so if if you're watching this um if you're watching this in like a recorded you can just fast forward ahead two minutes if you're on the live stream uh just hold on I'm gonna I'm going to mute this microphone mute this microphone e e e I think you can hear me now right yes okay good I never went to mime school and I always wanted to go to mime school that's probably a weird thing to say that you want to go to mime school but I think it might actually be true in my case the Jac laok School of mime I think it's in Paris anybody know that place maybe I can do that as like a summer vacation and then these videos would be even more ridiculously weird um okay I can erase this wish it weren't so hot in here um and uh I'm going to come back over here and uh I'm back uh so there's eight of you online at the moment which is nice okay so I think I'm going to get ready to start what is this over here oh this is like a piece of tape there's like something on in the Stream that right here what is that that's weird oh it's this ah this on the table is actually visible anyway sorry no one needs to be watching this part uh okay so now I'm going to look at the New York Times API and I'm going to do article search and uh so let me open up P5 and um I'm going to save this one and I'm going to do save as and I'm going to say New York Times uh I would like to publish these code examples somewhere I've been having people volunteer to like remake them actually contribute the GitHub repositor because they're kind of doing it anyway with the video so if you if you're doing that uh send me a note somewhere where in the note space of the internet um okay so I think now I'm going to get rid of all this get rid of all this I guess I'm getting rid of all this uh and uh leaving that there and we're ready to look at the New York Times API okay and if I just go to developer. New York times.com I'm on here okay here we go any um make a yes I could possibly do one of these entire and the cameras are shutting off which is good that that happened do an entire video just only with mine I don't think that would be that helpful although it would certainly entertain and amuse me personally uh okay oops I left this one is off sorry about to get started here uh I'm drink this water that I got it is 123 p.m. I have until 2 p.m. so we'll see it might just do one more video okay any last messages in the chat uh and now I'm going to get started and do this New York Times one okay I'm G to minimize that uh I can see the sound is still working uh and here we go oh the window's open I should close the window probably for sound uh I can survive the heat for a little bit uh okay boy here we go it'll be much better in the winter when it's I can get like the really cold temperature coming in in between hello in this video I'm going to look at how to use the New York Times API with your I'm like Ed car JavaScript salesperson to Dan today but anyway scratch that I'm I'm really I'm not trying to sell you anything I'm just here I don't I'm here and I'm making a video hopefully this is helpful to you I want to look at the New York Times API so how do you query the New York Times API how do you get get get data from it and how to use that in a JavaScript sketch Tada okay so this is the New York Times API I got to just start this one and over I'm sure people will be amused someday that like but let me just start over I don't need the used car salesperson thing at the beginning of this video okay here we go hello uh in this video I'm going to look at the New York Times API which is an API that you can query to get information about articles in the New York Times shocking leag quite a surprise yeah so uh again uh I'm not suggesting that this is the be all end all of apis to use but this is a nice case study of finding an API that's out there how do you navigate its documentation how do you figure out how to form an API query and get get that data look at that data and make something happen on the screen in a web page using JavaScript HTML CSS and this thing over here above my head I need a hat I just would rather have that as a hat um called p5js okay so the first thing once again as in the previous video where I looked at word neck the first thing is I can spend a lot of time without even writing any code or looking at any code because the first thing I need to do is just figure out like huh there's an API like so um one thing you'll see I'm already here but I'm at developer. New York times.com so once again you're at the mercy of the API how good is the documentation are there examples is there an online tool that helps you navigate the API and again this is a case where there is a good one and you know you know this is that question like you went to the New York Times website you found all this data you want to use it is there an easy path to that or do you have to take some sort of like side road and in this particular video I'm showing you the easy path and in another video we'll look at some side roads to how you might scrape or Harse data that isn't presented in a sort of API Json friendly format okay so all that aside here I am welcome get started this is nice friendly language it makes me happy that somebody's welcoming me to the page and I could get started so the first thing you're going to need to do by the way um if you're doing this on your own is request an API key so again you've got to sign up for an account get an API key I don't believe actually I don't know that have no idea what I'm talking about all of a sudden which is most of the time but uh I I I don't know whether there's any threshold of quering this API where you suddenly have to pay for its use but certainly what I'm going to show you today getting a little bit of data here and there is something you can do for free this is a great thing this is something that if you see is good news for you you're looking for an API tool meaning you can figure out how the API Works through an interface in the browser we solve the same exact thing with word neck um so I could you know click around and look at various things available apis but I'm going to go here directly to that API tool and here you can see ah API console actually you know before I go that let me click to available apis so you can see here there's a lot of apis there's you know event listings and Geographic data most popular API movie reviews there's lots of different sort of sub apis different paths within the larger API I think I'm going to stick with for Simplicity just this article search API so interestingly amaz this is a kind of nice data source because it actually goes back to 1851 so I can query the New York Times to ask for tic I can search I can say give me all the articles that have the word rainbow in them or the word that you know sibo there's there such thing as a sibo as I learned in a previous video or you know porcupine whatever pick your word of choice you can find out find the Articles um so I'm going to start with that one and I could click on it and it's actually here's some documentation of how it all works but once again I I'm going to prefer to go back and go to this API tool and here I am article search API so I could try one of the other on but I'm going to stick with this one I don't know this toggle all endpoints that seems like a weird thing what's an endpoint but I think endpoint is like you know the I don't even know what that means the weird language of these apis but endpoint is like the point of end of like the API where you're asking the thing toggle all M that didn't make any sense uh all right okay I know because I toggled them all there's only one end point search so that's probably the um uh uh uh yeah toggle La methods uh okay I'm I've lost here oh boy uh somebody edit this part out where I'm I'm sweating here I'm very uncomfortably so the point is this is what I'm looking for I want to uh I want to get this interface where I can start to figure out how do I form that API call and here we can see here that these are I G to stop this take a break uh I'm going to come back I'm going I don't usually like to do this by pausing for a second and opening the window let's get some um which is that uh I think what I'm going to do is just start over from the part where I went to that page because um and I'm going to see if uh anybody's saying anything in the chat they're not I'm gonna just splice these two together because the beginning of that was fine um and I will start over again actually let me look at this look at this for a second just to try it out and then I'll go back to the video because so if I go to the um if I go to the uh back to to this here and I click on search and then I scroll down let me give myself a little more space here uh I can see these are some things like I want to look for um you know rainbow and the filtered query begin date end date I'm going to skip all that sorting I'm going to skip all that so there then I'm going to hit try it and I'm going to get this and uh it says overrate so I can't use that I can't use the sample key which that was good to find out so I need to go get my API key uh which is in here uh o I thought I had a oh I have a sample key in my text F boy it's good thing I stopped that video so I need to get my New York Times API key I swear I had an API key somewhere uh okay sorry everybody um now in this uh particular video you're going to get to watch me sign up for an API key no no no no no apis uh request an API key log in what's the chance that I'm going to remember my login any anybody want to place bets on this no could not find a combination so I think I better uh sign up no oh I could log in with Google am I logged in here with Google uh allow yep that'll work continue give me my API key that sounded very rude please could I have my API key uh refresh aren't I logged in now come on there we go name of your application I can change it later YouTube video demo my website is shiftman Donnet the internet is where I heard about this API article search I think that's all I'm going to use so I'm going to say I agree register application I probably should include this in the video but uh now I have my API key uh which I will copy paste you know I'm going to leave this open uh because I'll show it that's good and then now if I go back to here and I put this in here and I say try it that worked and I got all this data okay excellent oh I could use images interestingly enough like there might be images associated with some of these articles which would be interesting no I'm going to do that in a separate video anybody's still watching or here in the live stream but I'm ready to I could actually and I can't decide if I should start the whole New York Times video over I guess I'll leave what I had up until the point where I started going to the API console and I'll splice that together anybody have any feedback no it's eight of you here it says to me that there eight people here hello to you eight people uh and there we go so I'm going to back up now go here uh and um I'm at here and then I also I can close this and close this and I have this registration successful and oops and I click search great okay great what is this methods that's oh that's just opening end points if okay fine okay you guys with me um let me keep going with this particular video and um I'm going to close the window and I'm going to start again from the point where I was at this page just check the chat nobody it's very disconcerting to me when nobody says anything in the chat the number of people watching keeps going down share with your friends let's get some more people involved here I'd love to see a couple more people here live uh okay here we go hi moment of technical difficulty but I'm back and I am on the API console so the first thing that I'm going to do here is look at how the API console Works to figure out what the query is I want to make to the New York Times so I'm in the article search API but of course I could change to a different one and what I want to do is click here this is the one uh what's known as endp point being the point of end of the API where I'm going to get something but really I think it's endpoint is referring to search and or maybe that's the method it doesn't really matter this terminology the point is I want to search the API and this is the path for doing that so I can click here and I can see now again I have an interface and yes I want the format to come back as Json that's going to work well for me and then Q is the search query term so what am I what art what's the query term that I'm looking for articles that contain that particular word so I don't know I really should think of something different but I'll just keep using Rainbow by the way no never mind uh and then there's other things I could filter the search oh there's a begin date and an end date so I could restrict to only getting articles from like 1957 with the word rainbow in it I could sort what I get back by a different order so all that stuff is interesting but it's also all optional right now I'm going to leave it out so I'm going to you I encourage you to look through this try it on your own add different parameters to the ABI search but the point is I want to hit this now once again uh the most beautiful button in the internet is the try it button cuz that's going to let me just try the API without having to write the code to see how it works now one thing here you can see the New York Times will often give you some results with a key known as sample key I've overused the sample key so I tried this a minute ago and it's going to like tell me no sorry you've overused the sample key but I have registered and logged in for my own API key so I'm not going to include this process in the video if you have trouble ask a question in the comments maybe I can help you but once you've made an account logged in in you will get your own key and I'm going to take that key and I'm going to go back here and I'm going to paste it in here and then I'm going to hit try it and once again we can see this is this is exactly what I want I now the API tool formed the API query for me and also you can scroll down you can see it's showing me the data but this is a bit awkward to look at it here so what's a little bit easier for me to do is grab this URL once again open up a new tab in the browser paste it into the browser and now I can start to look at the data as it looks in in in the browser itself so I can start now now here's so first of all it might look like this to you right you might get this result I have a particular browser extension which formats Json for me nicely I demonstrated in an earlier video I think if you just Google Chrome extension Json formatter you'll find one so um but even so this is a good example of now a lot of apis will give you back a ton of data so really there's some detective work involved here in figuring out how to find the data so let's uh let's say what we want to do is show on screen the headlines for all of the articles that contain the word rainbow and maybe even a short snippet paragraph from those particular articles so let's think about how we might do this first of all one thing I often like to do is start like minimizing these you can see that really the API is just giving me back a an object with a response property a status property and a copyright property which is important to note that you're getting some copyrighted material here um so I can unpack this response property there's a meta property and a docs property meta probably has some information about the API query how many calls I have left that sort of thing docs which has 10 items I know this in advance that's giving me 10 articles so most apis won't give you back all like 10,000 articles all at once they're going to give you 10 at a time and there's a way of paging through them but that's a bit beyond the scope of this particular video but what I want to do is here look at docs and docs is an array so you can see this these These are each element of the array so each one of these elements of the array is one particular article so in this particular article now I need to zoom back out here and look okay I don't multimedia headline there we go keywords there's so much information publication date by line you can see some things are right there like snippet lead paragraph abstract I'm kind of interested in the headline which is now in another object so I can unpack that and see main kicker print headline so we can see you know you I could spend all day here like looking into the the API but I can kind of Imagine now what I want if I want the headline is response. docs index you know zero for the first one. headline. main so I like weirdly feel like I have that memorized now probably because I've used the New York Times API a bunch of times but this is the kind of thing you're going to be needing to take notes practice going to make a mistake try it again um this is the kind of thing you're going to want to do on your own but now we are ready to go back and start to write code we've we've looked at the API website we've looked at the documentation we've used the tool and we've got a working path um to to getting data and so now I'm going to go back to P5 and I'm going to say just in the beginning load Json and I want to the the API URL I'll have that as a variable and a call back called got data so I'm going to make a variable which is the URL and I'm going to paste this URL right in here now for expediency here I'm not going to go through the steps of breaking that URL into Parts I've done that several times in several other videos now and in fact I would say probably the exercise for you at the end of this video is to have the user input the search word and then get particular articles back with that search word right now I'm just going to get rainbow articles but the first thing I want to do the first what I need to do right now is write this got data call back and remember the got data call back needs an argument that's where the data from the API will fill that variable with the data and I can just look at it to make sure it's working in the console I'm not really going to look at in the console but I want to just hope that I see something there and you can see there is something there so hopefully we can we can feel pretty confident that what's there is exactly the same as here so now let's think about this again uh response. docs index zero. headline do main let's let's let's let's work with that uh data. response. docs index z. headline. main did I do I did I dare possibly get that right let's try it again let's run it looks like I got that right let's look at the second article see what the headline is I'm changing that number zero Hollywood dreams that makes sense that you might have a rainbow in your Hollywood dreams my Hollywood dreams are consist of YouTube videos about data and apis which is sort of a strange Hollywood dream some might say something to I don't know where I'm going with this I'll stop now um uh where are we oh I've only been doing this oh no no I forgot I have two sections here anyway I'm back okay so blah blah blah um what do I want to do with this what I want to make something appear in the browser now there's a lot of interesting applications here and maybe I'll get to some ideas for you at towards the end of this video but right now let's at least make it Loop through and show me every headline and perhaps also a snippet so let's go back to this you can see snippet is actually just response.doc index z. snippet snippet being like a short paragraph or a snippet from the article to give us some more information so one thing that uh you'll that is one thing that happens here is that I have an array data. response.doc and you know what I think can be useful this is a useful technique if I just make up a variable called articles and say articles is data. response. Doc like I'm going to need in every time I try to look for data I'm going to need to say data. response. docs blah blah blah data. response. docs da da da remix this has kind of like a rhythmic quality to it data. response. docs da da da but I'm going to need to do that over and over again so it's it's kind of useful if I just store that in a variable called articles because now I can say things like what I want to do is have a for loop I goes from zero to articles. length you know i++ and I could say something like uh whoops let me leave that down here for reference right I don't need to say data. response.doc headline main I just need to say articles headline main well art what I need to say is I'll say create P articles index i. headline. main so this should now Loop through every single object in that array that docs array each one having a headline object and each headline having a main being the main headline so if I run this now you're going to see here we go I've got Rainbow International painbow charms painbow what's a painbow that sounds terrible no no no no pain bows rainbows um uh East Village Birdman abandoning his nest of CDs anyway some interesting articles about rainbows um so and but maybe what I want to do actually is say create element I'm going to make an H1 element for every headline and then I'm going to just quickly I'm kind of like trying to wrap this up here I'm going to make a paragraph element for every snippet which would be articles indexi do snippet so again there's a lot of data there articles index i. headline. main articles index i. snippet make an H1 make a paragraph and now when I look at this we can see I've now got sort of like you know my own version in the New York Times right here of a bunch of Articles and little Snippets and uh I could change you know right now if I wanted to change what it's searching for I've got to go into my code into this URL you know I could change it to porcupine and I could run it again and you can see I've got now some prickly and name but refined on the table I've got some articles about uh porcupines so here's what I would say to you first of all just showing you kind of the beginnings of what you could do here so one thing that I think would be a good exercise is to make this work but not have to go type into the code to change the word add a text input field add a button when the user enters something in that text input field and clicks the button you get the articles with that search term another thing you might think about doing is can you add query string arguments right the only query argument I have right now is Q equals porcupine but if you go back to the tool there was a begin and an end in terms of dates so could I get all the Articles from a particular year could I even have that year be selected by the user that's something you might try another thing you might look into and I might need to add some link or something in this is that the New York times will give you the frequency that a word appeared in the New York Times for a given year so you can look at interesting trends like when did the word computer start getting used often In Articles or this is a very totally trit example but you can think of something like how many times the word War used versus the word piece so anyway you'll be more thoughtful or creative about what kinds of comparisons might you be interested in doing but that's something in this article search API you can also get is something about word frequency so there's a lot of possibilities of things you might explore if you stuff share them with me I would love to hear about it um and I hope that this was useful to you in how you might use the New York Times API this is me signing off WF mxy YouTube ITP Hot Lights room weird place over a window and computer and okay goodbye I'll talk to you I don't have a hashtag for you # uncomfortable person Dan okay goodbye oh wait this mouse fell asleep Sleeping Mouse again okay and I'm going to stop this video okay so th if you're still here on the live stream only four of you left uh you're that's that's nice of you four of you to still be here with me I did a video about wordnik I'm going to open the window uh I did a video about the New York Times um trying to think if I have stamina and energy to kind of get one more Topic in here today let me look at um my list of videos so now I'm on to where I was I so I have about five more that I was going to make on this topic so one that I was going to do was use an image uh an image API I have an example for Instagram I feel like Instagram always pulls up embarrassing photos flicker might be a good one to use Google image search um can I do this in 15 minutes well you know I got to figure this out at some point so maybe what I'll do I have a working version of the Google image search API it's just sort of so hard to get that one set up API getting the API key is kind of a big hassle and in that sense it might be worth me doing a video on it to to look at how that works giy people are going for giy you know what let's do it let's look at the gy I've never looked at the giy API let's look at it so I'm going to see um I'm going to just kind of this will just be sort of embedded here in this video uh I don't know H why don't I just hit record and see what happens I can always throw this file away hi hi I'm going to try to make a video now that uses the giy API with zero preparation I've never Googled or looked at I don't even know if I've ever looked at the giy website this is probably going to go down in flames but I'm going to give it a try anyway we going to see in 15 minutes can I make a working code example where I query the gify API and get some gifts on the screen and you guys can while I'm screwing stuff up can argue over whether whether I should say GIF or GIF somebody tell me I have no idea so let me look for gify uh giy is a website that if I go to their search for gifts I'll search for my name which is like the most vain thing you can do of course there's no gifts with shiftman in them rainbow there we go rainbow is good I've got some nice rainbow gifts here I like this one this is a nice one you can see nice rainbow gifts so there must be an API here let me look for a gify API ah look at that I've got a GitHub link that's that's good news I've also got here a URL api. gy.com let's start with that you URL uh okay so often a question that comes up when using an API is do you do you need to sign up do you need a key I have no idea this is like this is exciting somehow this is like I don't know I feel whatever okay uh get started giy search giy trending giy roulette all oh these are other apps that people have made let's go to get started oh okay I'm on the uh ah give access and API Keys public Beta key so the giy a API is open to the public a single public beta key to let anyone try it out all right that sounds good to me so I'm going to use the public API in this demonstration obviously if you're going to do something more involved you'll want to get a I'm standing in front of the text you're going to want to get a production API key but I don't think I'd even get one so okay so I want to use that I'm going to go down overview the giy API um provides the following and I'm standing in front of the text again this is terrible let me I can't let me move this over and let me make this a little bigger the giy API provides the following Json endpoints so I can ask for a random one looks like a trending one I can get stickers by ID one gift by ID and right so this is good so I'm just figuring out these are the kinds of things that the API can give me I think search is probably a good place for us to start a random would also be a great place for us to start but I'm again like I I mentioned very easily embarrassed I'm worried about getting an embarrassing gift but you know I should I should not be wor I should just live in the moment that where we are okay um so let's see if I can find uh this is so this is okay so let's start piecing this together a little bit so I'm going to open up actually just like text edit actually know I'll go I'll go to P5 and I'm going to make a new project I'm going to close this New York Times one I'm going to hit save I'm going to call this gify API and uh I'm going to just give myself some space at the top in comments where I can start pasting stuff in there that I might need for working with the API so what I definitely need is this this is the URL to the API uh I'm also going to need this public key let's save that there now search all giy gifs for a word or phrase punctuation we stripped or ignored use a plus or URL and code for phrases oh yeah Ryan goling gifts that's that's going to be good that was weird that I I feel like that was weird that I made a weird dance and talked about Ryan Gosling I I really should edit that out but it's too late apparently that just was like I was overcome by the name Ryan Gosling maybe we'll get some good eating isn't there like an eating cereal meme with my anyway so this is good this is probably all I need uh because it's like giving me look at this it's giving me all this wonderful information this is the path so I need that I'm going to put that in here and then these are some of the things I need like search CU so every every this is this is in case you've come here from some strange place in the internet all of those all of these uh all of this list here are parameters parameters are name value pairs that get strung together like uh Q equals Ryan Gosling and then uh limit is like how many results do I get the maximum is 100 well if I'm getting gifts about Ryan Gosling oh my God the limit is is the sky is the limit right do you think I could say limit equals sky and I would disgu okay so I'm back and so anyway there's more stuff there but I don't really need all that stuff all I need is to realize that I'm going to say things like Q equals and I'll just I'll go back to Rainbow I don't think I can I don't think I can handle Ryan Gosling uh it's it's too much too much ran it's too much for me I just I can't handle it I'll be overwhelmed I'll be overcome uh um I'm really lost it here uh okay uh oq equals funny cat that would be a good one anyway and you can see API key so this is really all I need I'm done we're we're good so um so let's let's put these in some variables this is going to be great HTTP okay VAR API equals a string with the path right I'll call this end point I don't even know if that's the right terminology but this is the thing that I know need to go after the API and honestly that's silly that I'm making this into two different variables I guess I'll just put this one up here right because I'm just using the search so I need to make this a little bit bigger so now I have a URL which is the URL to that API I have a uh API key which is oh camera come back to me camera um I have a key which is this and I'm going to put that over here now I forget what did it need it needs it needs to look like this and Ampersand API uncore key equals so in my code I'm actually going to say and no I say ersan API unor key equals and then I'm going to uh have a query B and Q equals rainbow and by the way this right here a query a query a set of a query string always begins with the question mark so it's API key equals something and Q equals something and limit equals something but all of that begins with a question mark so this would be the full API and I've kind of broken my own cardinal rule here where I started writing code before I even checked to see if I was getting results in the browser so let's go back and let's kind of let's go back to the browser here and I need all three of these pieces I need I need this piece um let me open a new tab that piece followed by this piece followed by this piece and I'm going to hit enter oh awesome so now it looks like I got some data and I got a URL a bit.ly URL an embed URL Source the thing that I'm looking for is the actual like gif file this is like an mp4 webp URL this one I think will do like if I this I think this is like the link that I want like I want to get something that I can display quickly in the browser I'm sure I could make any of this stuff work I could embed the like giy embed or I could get the original source as an mp4 file but what I want is something that's like pointing to an actual gift file if I copy that address and paste it up here in the browser we can see that oh yes that I'm getting oh this is wow I never expected to get such a wonderful rainbow gift VI URL uh okay you I suddenly so overcome that I lost the ability to speak okay so um all right so this is good this is good so now I got to go back I got to go back and I've got to say uh create no canvas I'm I'm like I feel like I'm in a hurry all of a sudden I got to uh I want to make that URL which is API plus API key plus query and ultimately again I don't want rainbow to be hardcoded into my code I want to get that from the user input but I might you know did that in a couple different previous videos you can almost think of that as an exercise for yourself but now I'm going to say load Json URL got data so again the low Json function is a p5js function where I give a URL from an API that's going to give me back Json I have a call back got data so if I write that got data function uh and I give it an argument I've said this in like all the videos I've made today that data variable gets filled with the data from the API and I just want to see first again does this even work I'll add a print line in there and I'm going to run and I can see look okay so data came in there that's a good sign so now I've got to figure out again this is that thing this is hard I've got to figure out uh I've got to unpack this Json so first one thing I can notice is that data this is going to be awkward because I'm going to have this moment where I'm saying data. data because the first key the first property of this object that came back from gify is data so then what is data it's an array and each element of the array I'm guessing I'm assuming is one particular GIF with lots of information about that uh and what I want is index zero images do original. URL I guess I could get like different sizes and stuff but let's go with uh data index z. images. original. URL I think was that right I I can't I'm like having trouble getting all the way to the right here yep that's right uh I think that's right okay so let's give that a try did I did that make sense so I want to say data. data index z. images. original. URL could that possibly be right let's go back and look at that again data dot data uh do images. original. URL I usually I have like a whiteboard really handy which I have one over there okay I think this is right let's just run it and have some Faith look at that that looks like a URL that makes sense if I click it I see it oh good oh good now we're talking so guess what guess what P5 has for you oh this camera's off one of the functions in the P5 Dom library is a function called create IMG now there's a lot of different ways of working with images in the browser they you can load them from a file you can draw them in a canvas you can mess with their pixels what this particular function does is it makes an HTML element that looks like this right now there's lots of different attributes and ways that you can configure and style this particular element but if you give it an argument that's what becomes the source the source of that particular image tag so what I want to do is take the path to my giy thing and then create an element that will appear on the screen so in on the web page so all I should what I should be able to do is just say create IMG set of print line with this particular URL and I I I kind of want to put just like um I'm going to just call this gify just so it doesn't say like data. dat I think that's confusing to look at so got data fil the data with giy the the lighting in here changed um and now let's run this and see what happens look and there I have my rainbow now here's the thing gify it gave me more than just one image right so this is this is pretty exciting what I can do is now say for VAR I equals z i is less than what's the array here gy. index zero gy. dat. length I ++ and I can say index I now so I'm going to make an image element for every single image that I've gotten from giy and we can see look at this I've got this page or all there all of my this is like the this is this is quite uh quite theough this is a good one there we go that that that is I'm just going to like never make a video again because I this is like the perfect thing to ever have in one of my videos um so anyway you can see boy this is fun there's lots of things you could probably play with so what do you do with this I don't know maybe you get take user input maybe you you arrange them in a different way I don't know maybe it just makes you happy to like look at gifts I guess it's making me happy I you know we really should do the Ryan Gosling thing I think before this video ends so but you know that would be the um I don't even know how to spell Ryan Gosling uh let's see if that's right um so you can see here we go Ryan Gosling there you are uh and so you this is the thing like I'm changing the word what could you do with this make something interesting this play around with this um send me an email or a tweet or write in the comments I would love to know uh what you do with this example uh hopefully this helped you with yet another kind of API you could use now here's the thing I there was a we got to have a chat you and me because I've been doing a lot of these videos about working with apis and I kind of you know one thing I haven't really showed you is what if you need to make like a whole lot of API calls all at once there's some issues that could come up you know you've got like you're creating a lot of callbacks all at once how do you know which callbacks goes with which API call you might be generating a lot of Dom elements all once it could lock up your browser so I do need you there some there's some pitfalls here and I think I need to make a video soon that just sort of covers those scenarios and there's this thing called a JavaScript closure what do you think the chances are there are giffies associated with the word closure this is this is like high risk here uh I don't know what this this is this is not this is not working for me but anyway um so I was hoping I would get something interesting to look at cut that out but so I I want to make a video that sort of covers this topic and maybe we'll look at it even in the context of U giy which is seemed to be a nice API to use okay so this was a totally offthe cuff uh thing that I did hopefully it worked and you got something out of it and I've now made three videos today it's 2 o'clock which is the time that I said I was going to end but I'm in the recording bar never mind you don't care about the time uh shiffman Ry Gosling hash rainbow heart thing I don't know that's too long you you you figure out what that is um I wake up Mouse goodbye and I'll see you soon all right so thank you live stream all uh ah yeah word Nick related words defeating the giy idea is such a great idea I wish I had um thought of that and said that in the video but I didn't um so hope you enjoyed this particular uh live stream today I can stick around for like 2 or three minutes 5 minutes if any I'm not going to start on any new projects but if anybody has any questions um let me know and um I'll be glad to uh listen uh developer over rate error yeah so uh uh I know somebody posted getting a developer over rate error within New York Times if you're by accident using the sample key sometimes it won't allow you to do that or even if your own key if you've queried too many times It'll like shut you off a lot of want you to query like only so often or only so many times okay I think this hour and 16 minutes is up I have uh had enough you probably had enough and uh thanks for the kind feedback Lionel R uh and um I'm I'm gonna so the next time I'm going to do this probably will be next Thursday sometimes I try to sneak in an extra live stream like on a Tuesday or Wednesday morning um but i' been trying to do this weekly on Thursdays and my plan is this spring I have an extra big hole in my schedule February March and April where I'm I'm hoping to dedicate myself to kind of building this out as a more involved Endeavor what that means I have no idea but doing this more in a structured scheduled and planned way you have any ideas let me know I'm also looking for a space in New York City where I can kind of set up a recording studio I've got this uh spot here at NYU but I'm kind of looking for a more independent space that I might use if you have any ideas let me know uh and I'm going to hit stop on the stream and talk to you guys soon
