some crazy idea I did it again they did it again again hello I failed you know the thing is my new system here which hopefully is going to be better with less crashing still is subject to human error and I to play that ridiculous trailer thing I have to mute my microphone or else I will be talking over it and then I forgot to unmute my microphone because with OBS the microphone settings are not on a per scene basis they're kind of global anyway that's not it week hello it is me Dan Schiffman and the coding trade to welcome you on a Friday what I was saying is that I'm pleased if it's the afternoon here in New York City it's a slightly earlier time than usual I know that there are viewers all around the world who have been watching the middle of the night are way past their bedtime some of your younger viewers in Europe you know I'm talking about Simon and we're saying way past their bedtime so I'm glad that it's a more reasonable hour today ah wait wait wait you could hear me though right oh oh oh people are saying no live stream for me I'm looking at the chat which I really should do because got to know I ain't going to work so I can't watch no live stream meaning I can't watch it not that it's not working okay I am getting warmed up so welcome this is the Kotick train my name is Dan I come here every Friday to do some coding stuff something like that I also embarrass myself and make lots of mistakes and I generally don't know what I'm talking about as evidenced by the video on Const that I released this week and made last week which I kind of got a lot of stuff wrong so you should read the comment thread hopefully you guys can upload the like clarifications in that comment thread I pinned one to the top and I'm thinking maybe I should rerecord it the main thing that I got wrong in the I need a sound I need like my something better but like my Corrections Department sound clip which is that I talked a bit about how Const as an yes as a as a tool for memory management or efficiency because the computer or the interpreter or the browser whatever it is knows that you're never going to reassign the value so it can like be more efficient about the memory and that's not really true at all maybe there is like some slight benefits but really the reason is just for maintainability and for the human being to kind of protect oneself from not making future errors don't go off my chat yeah I'm curious about the sink I do have the delay on to keep the audio in sync all right so that was my main Corrections Department about my constant vigil I'd be curious tweet at me at Shipman if you think I should redo it or kind of like yeah it's fine you kind of got it wrong but it's in the comments and you're not going to destroy the world with misinformation but it is true that I I you know there was a time I feel like when I first started making these videos that I had researched and thought about and read about and taught for like a whole bunch of years I'm like grounding in some sort of knowledge and then was rehearsed and prepared and then more recently I'm just like the good friend make some videos on Friday es6 constant probably means this so but thank you to the community for very nicely offering me some corrections okay what I want to do today is a bit tight it is a 5 of 1 p.m. here Eastern Daylight Time I have a meeting to be at 3 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time so whatever happens around 245 two hours from now I'll be wrapping things up I want to talk about the community projects and show things that people have made and today's topic is es6 classes so a couple words about that first of all for those of you who are like where are your machine learning videos I have a bad habit the more people ask me about something I kind of getting this like procrastination like mental block thing like with Chrome extensions I think we're learning is fully following in there I will get to it if you really want to yell at me and make me feel guilty about it you should join the patreon group patreon.com slash coding train and contribute and join the slack channel and then that's where you can really help me and I'll feel they'd probably end up in a little sooner but right now I am focused on work making tutorials for beginners we're just starting to learn to code we in a Java Script and perhaps p5.js and so today's topic well today's topic is classes objectoriented programming for the total beginner so let me look for something here I'm gonna have to ridiculously go to my channel and quickly scroll past that video I'm gonna go here to up the camera went off what are the numbers anybody know the numbers from lost I feel like I need to punch those in before I press this button well I have a new camera thank you to some other folks here who are doing some tutorials at NYU in this room there's a camera right up here I could probably show it to you and I could go look at it like this I'll do that in a little bit somebody remind me but I want to continue my train of thought here so this oh don't watch this ad look at these oh how do I get there I want the playlist and what the playlist what ah there we go this playlist which is the playlist intended for beginners ah a couple things I need to mention so this is where if you had never programmed before and want to get started you can get started right here with introduction to p5.js and I did make these a couple years ago so some of the stuff is a little out of date but mostly still relevant this one point to video was me trying to put a bandaid on the fact that the desktop p5 editor that I used in this it throughout the videos it's not really available anymore so using brackets was just one possibility but there is a problem which is that and let me just mention this which is that which is that the download the p5 just download changed so the folder structure that I used in the video changed and so if you look at this link however you can get the same folder structure that I used in the video let's see if anybody said that that worked for them Thanks and without a notice this it works there's a syntax highlighting my brother's okay I'll come back to this later okay so now let me go back here where are we function basics okay that's gonna be fine function parameters and arguments that's gonna be fine functions and return that's gonna be fine functions inside of objects oh all of this I don't like any of this oh then the constructor function oh oh oh multiple J's files okay ah this will do clicking out got to redo all this up got to redo all this huh oh my goodness because I now I'm the person you couldn't do I know if you heard that I could hear it who uses es6 classes a different way of programming objectoriented programming in JavaScript that is newer and I like it better frankly I like it better so so I need to redo all these videos so oh boy I didn't realize how many I had to redo well but at the very least I'm going to pick up I think from here so I'm gonna start a new six point series which will be about objects not to replace all this stuff I don't know what this is gonna be hard so that's what my main plan for today is so I'll come back to that so I'm looking at the chat I'm seeing all sorts of messages that are confusing me I will not read them then okay now I want to talk about some of these community projects github can you guys by the way here the like party chatter things going on the hallway about people talking coding train github.com slash coding train so this is the github repository organization thing for the coding train I know I already have a 6.0 all those videos are gonna go away I'm gonna read number in it's fine it's fine I'm gonna figure it out so there's a bunch of things here so first of all I have been totally amazed by by people's 10 print things so first of all I did bring the 10 print book with me let me be perfectly clear a lot of people are saying thanks to Dan's inspiration thanks to the inspiration the coding train video I made this 10 print thing here thank these people who make wrote this book and inspired me I love this book it's like a wonderful history of creative computing especially if you were you know not born during some of the years that are talked about in this book you'll find a lot of this fascinating and it's a wonderful historical and cultural perspective so I want to plug this book and say thank you to all the authors of 10 print 10 print org and then if you're looking for what people have made with the 10 print challenge one place you can just go is twitter.com slash hashtag probably slash ten print is that how the URL is formed and you can just see so many wonderful kind of beautiful versions and variations off ten print so one thing that I was really thrilled about that I think I would like to do more of in the future and look at this this is wonderful Paul 0x1 see use the school lesson to try 10 print on paper using some kind of like ancient machine what is that it's a class I Oh a cos I Oh oh my goodness you know I used to have a Casio watch I wish I still have one of those cos I own watches ain't no way to announce it so figuring out how to program random numbers into that and then drawing on that look at this ha in this area 22 by 22 there's two to 484 options well that's a big of possible 10 print this is blowing my mind right here this is awesome wonderful work so I really been thrilled to see the diverse the diversity of ideas and people who have created things with 10 prints so one thing that I discovered that's so successful about this is it's actually that my video was like eight or nine minutes long or ten minutes or twelve minutes is very short and the amount of code in it was basically nothing it's like twelve lines so I think I would like to do more of this in the future coding challenges that I make that are incredibly simple I demonstrate a simple geometric idea and then see the explosion of ideas that come out of that yes it is a scientific accion t seek cal calculators calculate or that sounds like something really interesting okay so I wanted to mention that I will also show you so it's great to see all these on Twitter with the hashtag we should have a hashtag for like the coding challenges whoo right I'm with it I know about hashtags I snap chat not really okay I'm very embarrassing but oh my goodness look at this so many changes recently so first of all thank you to me I am so me they have been helping me wonderfully with keeping these that github repositories maintain and pull requests that I've just fallen totally behind on so I'm gonna go to rainbow code another place you can submit if I go under coding challenges all the way down to the most recent one coding challenge 7610 print you should also feel free to and we can see we just have a bunch here compared to what's on Twitter is nothing this is nothing compared to what's on Twitter so it's nice that the Twitter thing is great and especially if you're sharing something with me if you can make a little animated gif for an image and that's really wonderful and helpful for me to be able to see it and share it with other people but let's click on let's just let's go nuts and click on all of these real quick so how do I do that open in a new tab automatically option click nope command click so let's look at this here is a wonderful by Virgin by Joseph couch our I don't know if that's pronounced correctly I love this with its scrolling that's really cool I wonder if you could make a terrain like a 3d terrain out of this almost like an overhead view that's really nice wow this is awesome oh oh this is that oh no it's doing it oh I just pressed any keys and it goes through it Wow look at that emulator of the Commodore 64 right here in the browser that is totally awesome thank you to marriage in from the Netherlands one of my favorite desserts is awful that I press that correctly anybody likes stroopwafel we're very into it here okay now let me see here the horror this is something so it's great for you to share with me the coat it's much nicer if you can try to host it online or put a little video documentation or something windy ten print Wow windy hey windy but this looks much more windy look at this a blog post with documentation and reference boy do I love this so this is one thing that I highly encourage anybody who's embarking on a journey of learning to code is don't just make the thing document your process tell people how you made it share that process it's not just for the good of the world it's good for you too to have that to refer back to if you're you know if you're applying for a job and you can show the way that you think and how you build things that's going to be a good thing so I really encourage you guys to do documentation totally not how you pronounce it okay fine I'm gonna really have somebody will help me okay Justin look at this I love this oh and this is using by the way glitch taught me which is a wonderful new code editor development environment that all runs in the browser made by fog Creek I would love to do more with glitch on this podcast because that's all I do a little bit body cast this is not a bad guest I would be terrible at a podcast because I actually and not I don't make sense with the words things I just like compensate by waving my arms around a lot which was kind of you know a little touchandgo there for a little while with this elbow problem okay that's wonderful oh I love this kind of looking like twigs wonderful worship version Matic ooh and now we're that's great so thank you everybody alright two more community things I got to get to the tutorial stuff we're at 105 I'm moving quickly today is the International Coffee Day I think I used to not drink coffee I was about 20 years I didn't drink coffee and then like a few years ago this was another one ten print oh and here did I look at this one already I did not oh look at this with sliders oh I love that so I could kind of change the parameters of it color size love what it's doing maybe line thickness this is really cool wonderful so I love all these and pressing a key restarts it okay wonderful so now what are the other community projects I want to talk about number one is I am amazed so I was a little worried like oh I love this historical work absolutely it's a historical but this work from the 90s by John Maeda I never know if I'm pronouncing his name correctly to be honest with you uh and which is actually in looks like it's in San Francisco MoMA and but this post from Golan Levin's course at Carnegie Mellon University is really the only visual documentation that exists that I know of of the twelve o'clock project and I did a clock coding challenge and said hey why don't we try to remake these in p5 Jeff and me I am so me set up a wonderful like mechanism for contributing and this is amazing I'm going to show this to you right now I'm gonna go to coding train I'm gonna go to community not twelve o'clock and I'm gonna click on this link here and look at this oh no no we still got one so first of all we need to look at these and sort of check for accuracy although I'm this is Wow how did this one get done is this done with like this I'm wondering is this done with p5.js or 3j s or is it actually not a 3d render but just this like illusion amazing but look clock twelve was still not implemented so all of you watching if you want to contribute first of all you can always help this is not meant to be one person per clock this is meant to be a community collaboration so maybe you notice something that's can be improved or that doesn't match visually the originals but this is kind of incredible to me and I I just want to thank this generous and creative and talented community I really should just at this point I'm not I I guess I just exist to hopefully give you guys some interesting ideas because you're all much better at this than I am at least in certain terms of being creative and visual design and so this is really wonderful so I think if I click on one of these or they've been just highlighting them we can so we'll think about this website I need to think about a way of Hyder Ali Punjabi and the chat is saying I made nine and ten thank you so much that nine and ten is 12 11 10 these are 90 dead if I got that right so I'm gonna share this with John mighta probably within the next week since it's almost complete so please get your contributions in and I need to think of a way to thank people and you know obviously github has a history so we can see everybody's contributed simply by going here under under commits and I can look and I can see the history of what people have done and that's one way of thanking people I can also go to here I think just under contributions and we can see all of these github users who have contributed but I would like to think of something beyond this that I can thank in terms of credits in that sort of thing all right I'm looking at the chat everything seems good what more community projects so you may know there is something happening called processing Community Day it is the first time you know of course lots of people who do stuff with creative coding and code and all get together in all sorts of forms and formally classes conferences on the subway and restaurants all sorts of things but this is the first official processing foundation organized sponsored event it's happening on October 21st at the MIT Media Lab you can still get a ticket to come to the event I'm supposedly doing a live coding train I don't know what that's gonna be I'm hoping they tell me they being me I told myself cuz I guess I'm helping organize it but that Mateo Choi is really a spearheading this and he is wonderful the founder of the school for poetic computation SFP cio and i'm hoping you wait 20 minutes but so i'm gonna do this live coding train and so the idea for that right now is where do i go here here i guess i'm gonna go to github.com coding train is to make a cloud maker like Algar algorithmic generate generative cloud design and so I'll guess I'll make my own but before the processing day I'm asking people to contribute their own cloud design and I'm actually going to use these cloud designs to be printed on nametag people at the event so if you want to contribute sure just be you can create whatever you want to this because I'd love to see all sorts of creative videos for clouds but to print it on the nametag it's gonna have to be like a thin black outline and then the names will be nicely handwritten in alright so we click here and we can see I think every time I click I just get a new random cloud and I can actually pick some and it has a who created it here and so like let's look cartoon cloud we can see and thank you to Austin coding train patron who to me I am so me created this site and Austin did some UI design and visual design for it cumulus that's pretty cool Thank You Luke and cloud from Kazakhstan that's really nice thank you to Ilyas so I encourage you all the way up until around the probably like the first of October which is coming up soon what's today's date oh my watch I think a battery oh no came back alive oh that's soon so like for the next week another week to take cloud submissions so thank you everybody alright now pause for a second here and see did I miss anything any questions about these community projects processing day before I get started with es6 classes Tonka's did I miss something did you submit something it's very hot you try following a lot of YouTube chat and livestreaming and this lack Simon is pointing out that I'm 22 minutes in which is pretty good if I actually start doing some tutorial encoding so actually I should get myself organized while I'm singing if they're questions one thing that's always helpful for me those of you who are in the slack group who are patrons patreon.com slash coding train if if you notice a comment in the YouTube chat that's something that I should address or share or it's like a correction that's useful if you can copy paste it in with the person's name because it's easier for me to follow that and Austin is saying I made it so you can change the background color on the community clouds now too wonderful oh just a video suggestion challenge okay uh and Ilyas is saying my cloud is randomly generated every time and yes that Wow look at that that so that that's really what also what I'm looking for in a way is like you're cloudy it's an idea for a design of a cloud but it comes out differently so it's procedural design or conditional design its design and formed by an algorithm that varies there's a set of rules that define what it means to be a cloud but it varies okay so hello blowed again and I'm cutest thing I forgot neural networks you did not forget trust me nobody is letting me forget yeah I did forget Chrome extensions though that was gonna happen today alright so if anybody wants to help said we sound effects make sound effects music I could play without getting copyright notices please please I am available to improve okay so let's look here if you can bear with me for a second I'm gonna look at the so what did I do in this video yeah yeah okay no no don't watch the ad I know you probably can't hear this can you okay all right I'm thinking here okay so what I where I left off is this idea of like a bubble okay function so this is Oh Opie beginnings so I need this code maybe okay okay ooh I could get three months of YouTube read for free should I do that okay yeah actually should do that because then when I play stuff the ads won't play yeah okay hold on maybe I won't sign up for that right now I don't sign up for that right now during the live stream okay okay so I think I have a sense of what I need to do all right so what's the chance that there's some code on this computer already called Opie beginnings there it is how lucky for me okay now and that is in other documents p5 just videos Opie beginnings so let me grab that let me put that on the desktop in a folder called Opie and actually what I want to do here is and when we close this oh I'm Austin who I'm mentioning over and over again now has turned me on to something called I turn which I haven't had a chance to look at yet but I'm going to try using maybe a different terminal application and do a little tutorial about it this computer went off okay so now I need to go to desktop and I want to generate a project called op1 and now I'm going to open up Adam and I can I'm going to run a server so I'm getting set up here this is what I'm supposed to pay my waiting music and I'm gonna get this what all right this is already like the changed version that's funny this is what's funny is what I have here is the code from the end of that video so it kind of but I think I know basically I don't like this way of doing it at all and I'm gonna bear with me here for a second everybody don't go full screen it would work much better if this bubble would move a little bit more oh did you guys want me to do some coding and stuff okay sorry I got confused I thought that somebody wanted to watch with me and my desire to be an avantgarde performance artist okay the only chatter not happy all right um okay so one of the things that you if you haven't watched this of these videos before that I do is this is a live stream and then portion of the live stream get edited in tutorial videos that make it into various playlists um there will be a slight delay on the edited videos this week due to some scheduling stuff so one thing I'm definitely gonna try to make sure I do is have a good match it helps me to is amazing and helping me do this make sure that I have like links to the time codes of the actual tutorial portions and I'm going to try if I can to not do the thing that I stop and start all the time to make it a little bit more watchable but not that I'm really interested in making this watchable oh if my timing is so off okay okay I think I hurt myself I think I might have pulled a muscle in my neck okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is make a quick video that's going to go in between it's going to go I lost the YouTube playlist but it's gonna go in between the last functions video and the first objects video and maybe someday this video will be deleted but it will I'm just like tell people that I'm these are hey let me just do it hello this is not actually a tutorial video you could just skip to the next one if you want the actual tutorial content but if you happen to be watching this as a playlist because you're learning to program in JavaScript with p5 just for the first time I just want to give you a little warning all the videos you've been watching before this video were made as of right this moment a couple years ago I now am going to I am now programming in JavaScript with a slightly different style it's a more modern style start of es6 what's es6 you could go watch a different video where i talk about that then I'll link to this video description but where I use something called classes to make objects so the videos that are coming next the older ones are deprecated they'll be off in some other playlist somewhere that you could go and find but the videos that are coming next I like I do now just like with more grey hair I have a scar on my elbow that I didn't have before and but I but those videos will not assume any prior knowledge they will assume that you are arriving here just at the moment where you are about you just learned about the basics of functions and you're about to learn objectoriented programming so if that is what you would like to do please stay with me and just watches this video transitions to the next one probably with an ad on it sorry about that sorry okay see you in the next video maybe all right I need to flash the firm don't replace and just make a new playlist yeah Simon you're right that is a good point there's no I'm no they're not gonna replace I just have to I think I would I want those four people if their first finding the videos to find these but definitely I'm not gonna delete anything and I'll have all older version of the playlist as well so anyway Matthew and I will figure out an appropriate way to do that and of course I'm happy to have suggestions oh I forgot this was behind me the whole time oh and I forgot to mention that I was gonna do another editor uh okay hold on maybe I maybe this could be spliced in also I should mention that yeah maybe could just place this in the middle somewhere Matthew okay also I should mention that in the these videos I'm using a slightly different editor at this point I'm kind of hoping that maybe you already have an editor maybe I had a different tutorial that showed you an editor to use so you could you could this is the Adam editor you can use it but I'm gonna focus on the code in these videos and not the editor but just if you're wondering why it changed that's why I'm using something different these videos alright yes I Greg says I suspect the dancing is only for the gifts that is correct it is my it's all missions in life ultimately oh yeah we're gonna make this happen I need to do my first tutorial but this is gonna be worth it hold on just give me a second here you can still hear me I think right oh it's gonna be off them create new overhead I really shouldn't be doing this I hope you can actually hear me it's going to be this first one and it's going to be 1080i five nine ninety four then I'm gonna hit okay and then I have to somehow find the button to press up here oh did it come on no it didn't work all right I'll look for that let's try to just for goofiness turn on this over camera oh okay edit the bit about the editor good point good point I think by the way is at 150 no it's 120 okay here we go so I have to figure out how to get started here all right so I have to really remember that I'm making a video for people who have just were in there like 5th week maybe of taking a course about programming and they are they've never done out of Georgia program before and they have just learned about what functions are okay okay here we go water it is always important on the coding train to stay hydrated because as you know coding train is brought to you by water it's liquid and you can drink it okay oh one thing I need to make sure I have is a marker and that's a hey what happened to my shortcut keys for the whiteboard and stuff there we go let's just see oh whoa whoa I'm very big weird what's going on here we may need to zoom out a little bit maybe that's better actually maybe this is actually better is this better maybe you can actually see that better maybe I'll leave it I gotta go check and see if the focus is fine it looks good okay I'm gonna leave it all right oh I knew that was gonna happen so that's why I was waiting for the camera to go up and now I can start do you like afraid to do this tutorial and so that's why but I just have to I have to get over my fear okay oh and why this is my computer now that I look at the slack chat keeps going to sleep one of these was a good marker yeah I don't think it was this one who knows I think it was this one hello this is a very exciting moment for me I don't know if this is an exciting moment for you this is the video where I am going to talk about objectoriented programming in JavaScript using something called classes for the very first time ever in any of my videos so this video is part of a playlist and if you're watching that playlist what you just learned about is functions and you might have done something where you first use functions to reorganize your code and you said okay I have some code which draws a circle and I have some code which moves the circle so I'm changing some XY variables and draw drawing ellipse at some X Y variables and then I put those into these own functions call them display call them move and I could call them and draw so I've organized my code and I even have this thing I kind of have this thing called an object it's a JavaScript literal object meaning I'd saying I literally want an object with an x and a y so I can see those up there and so the thing is I got distracted first I get the thing is this isn't really this was a nice way to learn about how to declare and define your own functions and there are reasons why you might want to do that you're gonna see those in many future videos just sort of standalone functions that exist unto themselves and in fact there is a style of programming called functional programming which JavaScript is wellsuited for because functions are kind of like the core building block of JavaScript but I am do take a different direction here because in particular if what I want to do is program graphics simulations animations things moving around the screen one way to do that is to think about this circle moving around as an object now I'm already thinking about it as an object it's a bubble it's got an X and a Y it has data but I want to think about it as having functionality it can move it can be displayed I want to I want to say things like in addition bubble dot move bubble dot display this is ultimately how I want to write my code and I'm kind of wondering why I display there is being syntax highlighted I think it's probably like a key word or something in JavaScript somewhere else I'm going to just change that to show what I want to do is I want to write code where I cry where I create these objects and I issue commands on them and the reason why I want to do that is because well ultimately ultimately I'd changed the code and I won't run again this is not going well I said I would restart recording so I can't you're just gonna have to keep watching this what I want to do is change at least just give me a second here to like this will be one small little edit point what I want to do if I could think about this thing moving around on the screen as an object then I can maybe make a second bubble and a third bubble so I have to think conceptually about what I'm doing so I think what's gonna be helpful actually is if I come over here hello to you too and talk about this with the whiteboard so the one of them there's a couple of different principles I talked about with functions that there's some principles behind why you might use functions you can make your code modular or you can make your code reusable this is also true of objectoriented programming but one of the first key principles of objectoriented programming is this idea of encapsulation I want to encapsulate everything that it is to be a certain thing inside of an object what does it mean to be a bubble what is there what do bubbles have what properties do they have what things do they do throughout their life I want to encapsulate all of that into something and the idea of using something called a class in JavaScript we can think of a class another way to think of it is the word template I think is appropriate or the word blueprint is also appropriate the class which is a new block of code that I'm going to ask you to write if you choose to follow this these tutorials is this idea of encapsulating that goes in between the open curly braket and the closed burg curly bracket is everything that it means to be a bubble what does it mean we're gonna find out what does it mean to be a bubble all that will go in there so that in my main program which has set up and draw I don't have to write the code for the bubble I could just do things to create bubbles I could say things like bubble equals new and I think I'm gonna go off the whiteboard here something to write this down here new bubble so there's a new keyword which ironically as is new new is a key word that means to create an object we're gonna see what that actually really refers to in a second and then as my animation continues throughout the draw loop I can see say things like bubble dot float dark pop or dot move or whatever whatever commands these are functions that are somehow part of the object objects the idea of encapsulation is to encapsulate the idea of data and functionality into an object so for example I had this weird little JavaScript literal object this is an object that has data in it it has an x value and a Y value and actually I mean if I really wanted to I could do this this is something you'll see I probably shouldn't show this to you I'm not I don't really do this that often but it's totally reasonable I can only put a function in there for that way you know this is this is the thing welcome to your life there are 15 different ways to do everything in JavaScript and also this video will be out of date by the time you watch it because there'll be a different way that people are doing now but I'm just trying to keep with the times and I think classes are a nice way they're a way that I am now choosing to create objects in JavaScript so let me come back over here a class is the idea of the template this is the template you can think of this I think this is a bit of a this is not my invention here but one way of thinking about this is the class is the cookie cutter the object itself this is the object also often referred to as an instance this is the thing itself this is the template this describes there is no bubble here this just describes what does it mean to be a bubble this is the actual bubble I make a new bubble based on what it means to be a bubble am i saying the same thing over and over again I am but I'm hoping this helps make this make sense to you so object instances instance object template cookie cutter is like the thing you use to make the actual cookies so this is the cookie and this is the cookie cutter so now that that hopefully makes some sense to you the next point of discussion is what goes inside the class how do we write the class I'm gonna pause for a second oh and let's see so I'm not used to I wrote encapsulation up here that you can't see you just zoom out a tiny bit don't change the which is the focus which is the zoom oops okay let me just zoom out a tiny bit so that way at least oh I didn't rise so much of this you couldn't see so what I'm gonna do here is if bat to for any reason you want to like fade in like when I was writing so people can actually see then fade back to where you can't see we could try to do that people are probably so you guys have been telling me all the time you've been yelling at the screen I think it's gonna be fine right oh wait okay so how bad was that hold on like was that terrible is this workable do I need to redo this I don't think I need to redo this all really bad Oh pretty bad what was so bad retake time not so bad bad enough well I don't understand was it because wasn't it just this stuff that's cut off and can't I like I could superimpose that in postproduction oh it's out of focus it was all right so much for my whole like this this live stream is gonna stand alone people gonna better watch this without mill on it like just by looking at the time codes it's good to be fine yeah okay you could not see the top things like class so I can fix that everybody's giving their own opinion I'm gonna okay I think that much yeah Matt is a genius and he's going to come up with some way of when we make it I make an edited version of this tutorial of when I wrote something that you couldn't see of like just like putting it on tops okay all right alright ok we're on camera oh no ok I'm gonna keep going so so now I even forgot what I was thinking about there's a big glare on the board yeah I know that's not something I can do too much about oh you can't see which is which light is the glare coming from yeah it's this one all right they're not fixed the glare all right okay continue thank you for pointing that out that helps a little bit and I'm still viewable here okay all right I don't think that met you is unfortunately able to watch at this time so I don't think that he's here but I will I'm gonna keep going and if I have to all redo that first part okay or even just like parts of it alright so let me think I guess that's I don't know how help if anybody has to guess how long was that about because what I want to do I think let me see what are those videos what were the videos I made before before I did oh my goodness I just put functions inside of it so I just need to do this myself okay I did this in like a crazy weird way all right okay all right yeah so actually this is really important and I'm gonna do this now so I don't have this problem again I'm gonna get a little tape or actually I'm not gonna use the tape I will just use a blue marker a pink marker that I have here oops and this is about the top this is about the right I mean I don't usually come over here this is here and then the bottom is about like here so you probably can't see any of those marks I guess you can kind of see this mark make that a little bit higher and oh you can see this mark over here so let me do it about here you can still see that but whatever it's fine okay okay all right okay so first let me just apologize I had a little technical glitch where I drew stuff out of your viewpoint in the previous video I'm hoping that by the time you're watching this I figured out some nice magic to make it make sense or redid this video and you're not even watching this because I don't have to say this but we'll see but I'm gonna go on and what I want to do in this video is now talk about we really need to like hopefully that the first video helped you understand the concept behind objectoriented programming in a very simple and basic way and now what I need to do is look at the actual syntax how do I write the class how do I make object instances and how do I use them so let's let me I guess I should be over here so what is the syntax of writing the actual class what is the syntax of making actual object instances okay where should we start so I keep saying that now I keep saying what I said before there was this new keyword called do and what new does is it creates an object instance it says hey make a new instance of an object that's defined inside of a class called bubble so I know I want to make a bubble which is something I made up this is a madeup game for a class but what could what actually happens do when I call a function when I say something like you know draw a robot I look for a function called draw robot that draws the robot this new keyword actually says execute a function but it's a special kind of function it's a function to create an object or actually maybe let me use a different word construct it's a function to construct an object and so the first thing that I need to write and I need to write this if you might work without it but I really need to write this in every class that I make is constructor so I actually declare a function called constructor it is written just like I don't have to say function by definition it is a function so it's just like any old function definition it's a function definition inside the class and in here this is kind of like the objects set up so we think of set up a draw in our code like a p5 set up is where I initialize everything draws where I animate stuff and loop over and over again the clad the constructor is like the object setup so I'm defining again what does it mean to be a bubble now I'm getting more specific what does it mean to be the first moments when the bubble is formed that first baby bubble it comes out of the bubble making machine and what is what happens so in this case I'm just gonna say x equals 100 y equals 100 so this isn't correct yet so don't yell at me if you know about how this works I need to add something to this but this is the idea I want to declare remember objects are a collection of data and functionality so this is where I say this is all the data that has to do with this particular bubble this particular bubble has an x and a y now here's the thing and nowhere in here did I declare var X or let X debate which video to JavaScript by the way as two different ways of declaring variables and I'm kind of using let now but I probably use the bar to previous video I hate that this is happening but it's happening but I didn't actually declare the variable so and what's weird here is that I don't actually declare it in the way that I previously had so something that happens here when I say new bubble is there's a new object instance and I need to like actually say this is a variable that I want to attach this is a variable that is a property of that object and so the way that I do this and this absolutely this I'm awkwardly saying this because the thing that I put right here is actually this this dot X this dot Y this is a keyword in JavaScript that can mean a lot of different things and over time in future videos I will use it for a variety of different purposes but for right now the this keyword is a reference to the current object instance it doesn't exist right this is a template so it's like in theory if I would ever use this template to make an actual instance of a bubble that instance that's being made I'll just call this out here the instance that's being mean has a variable name called bubble I declared it let bubble I mean I said let bubble any might have said bar but I'm saying that now let bubble bubble is a new bubble that's the object instance that's the real object instance this is the theoretical object instance and then when I say new bubble this code actually happens that actual bubble is created this and bubble point to the same thing but the nice thing is I can use this template for any object I create because this is a generic term to refer to whatever it is I have to do making at the moment so that's the idea so let's go let's start writing this code and just let's put this in this this this dot this dot you know I'm talking about right this is good if this dot is the bane of your existence now welcome to your life okay so I'm going to get rid of this I just have this idea right of a bubble and I'm gonna change it to say let and I'm gonna say bubble equals new bubble we're gonna comment out everything in draw because I don't have anything yet I don't even wanna I'm gonna comment all this out because anybody use it later but the idea now is that I want to write the class now where I define the class could kind of be anywhere and I might show you a way of organizing stuff in two different files at some point but I'm gonna write class bubble open curly bracket close curly bracket now I'm gonna create that constructor like this I'm gonna say this dot x equals you know 5 100 200 this dot y equals 150 and I'm just going to say print line X double dot X double dot Y and it's not println anymore in p5 it's just print which is the same as console not log but that's a bit of an aside so now I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna see look at that 200 comma 1 200 150 and actually one thing I can do just to kind of I can actually in this interactive console that I'm using in Chrome I can actually just type bubble and look and see look now I have an object it's a like bubble and has two properties X&Y so that's what we've done we have made a constructor in the bubble object we can create new object instances and there they are the timeout or end a video I'm not sure so hold on hopefully I'm doing okay here all right uh I'm in the wrong frame okay I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking I think you know I'm kind of enjoying these as short videos so I think I'm gonna like the next video we'll just be adding the funk that's this video is just about the constructor and then the next video or I should probably keep going so tricky to like figure out where video should stop and start I guess then there's certainly the next step is to write the functions inside of the class and right so hovering the chat is making a really good point why would you write prop the constructor like this to hardcode the values of x and y and to be honest most cases you wouldn't and this is something that I'm going to have to get to do I have time I still have an hour today so I think I could get you the part where I'm gonna add constructor arguments I think this can be in one video I think this can be in one video I'm gonna sew this all this talking I'm doing right now is an editing point and I'm gonna have to come to the next point which is adding the functionality yeah austin's make a good good point aren't constructor variables typically prefaced with an underscore it's not necessarily that's a popular convention yeah there are conventions of like making certain instance variables public versus private and underscore I'm really this is really uh you know my my point of view and teaching this stuff is to not that's an important point and I it's a perfectly valid an interesting discussion for us to have but I want these videos to be for you know potentially even like the eighth or ninth grader who is learning to program in JavaScript first time and just wants to make some stuff and I think that level of detail is unnecessary at this point though interesting and yes setters and getters and extends I will get to all of that not in these intro videos this is really just about the principles of object origin and the basics okay here we go are these live streets basically never for the people that are watching them correct I used to not do them as live streams I would just make all the videos and release them for some reason people seem to enjoy not necessarily the if you you can just do this stuff out and just come back for the edited videos this is this is my process it is my process it involves oh there's nothing there I was gonna involve this will does all right all right so I don't know it's so the next step now is we can't actually do anything the goal here is I want to write nice elegant easy to read code where I say things like now I want this bubble to move now I want this bubble to show and ultimately I'm going to do things like let bubble 1 let bubble 2 and again I know some of you might have just watched the previous video where I used a bar some day I'm saying this it won't matter and the aliens will have figured it out too like dub over my voice in a way that makes all this make sense but for now I've got music music Matt so I ultimately I want to be able to make multiple objects we're going to look at this thing called an array in future videos but we haven't gotten all the way through right well the only thing I've put inside of this class is the constructor and I've I've initialized and I've did I've set I've I've I've defined attached I specified the data for this particular bubble what it is to be a bubble as to have an X into y so now what I need to do is add the functionality if I know I want to say at some point bubble dot move what I want to say here is move so this is how I declare a function of piece of functionality inside the bubble class this is what it means for a bubble to move notice I don't have to say function here so classes the functions that are part of the bubble template I do not do are by definition functions I don't have to say functions and then what do I want for the bubble to move I want to change its exit its Y so can I just say x equals x plus something to change its X no say it with me this dot this dot this dot it's so hard to remember but inside of the template inside of the class I'm referring to the variables the data that's part of a bubble object I need to refer to it as this dot X and this dot X so let's go now add that to our program so I'm going to add a function called move and I'm just going to do and by the way what do I want to do in this I want to do exactly what I did in the previous example and I'm just gonna take this and put it up here the difference is and weirdly I'm gonna do something this is horrible I should not and and I'm let's do show at the same time why not I don't have to do them one at a time I feel I'm feeling confident I'm gonna do this and then I'm gonna take all this code from that show function and I'm gonna put it up here inside this show function and then I'm gonna delete this stuff down here and now I have everything whoops I need to uncomment it and I have everything for my class can I fit it all in one screen KY yes I can perfect look at this so this this is wrong avert your eyes don't don't don't implant this into your brain just yet but this is weirdly gonna work so we should be done in a way right I made this I made this bubble class I have a bubble object and it sort of worked by accident it worked because I have this global variable called bubble and it's the only bubble in the world but the template the blueprint should not refer to a specific bubble this won't work as soon as I try to add a second object this bubble this template needs to use this dot so all of the X and the y is to refer to bubble nonxml one now here it is take this implant into your brain this is a you know I should mention there are lots of other features of things I could do in here there's these things called gathers and senders and there's extends I'm gonna get to that eventually or maybe never because this is this is a good start the basic idea is to find the template the class define a constructor which specifies how that object is initialized and then add whatever functionality you want and then the world is your oyster to make bubble one Bubble to bubble one bubble to bubble one move show bubble to move show so look at that there are now two on the screen and I didn't have to change anything about the class the class is a generic template it knows nothing about where it might be used or how it might be applied it's just the template so this is a way of defining objects and it's going to you know this is also this is no good because this works for two but eventually I'm gonna want to have a hundred I'm gonna get to that in a future video and there's lots there's some other missing pieces here and that'll be in the next video but for now if you're watching this here's an exercise to do for yourself find a sketch you made that had some thing in it get kind of a simple thing thing moving around the screen maybe you didn't use objects in it at all try to encapsulate everything that has to do with that object into a class what are the properties that are part of that you know if you're making a rainbow the properties are the colors potentially I don't know or its position on the screen what are the what's its functionality it can appear it could disappear it can shine and glow whatever it can whatever it does make those functions try to create one object instance and operate it and then see if you can create a second object instance now you might have a problem we're both of your objects you make two but they do exactly the same thing so you can't actually see that there are two and that's the thing that I want to address in the next video this idea of kind of hard coding these values so that every single bubble always starts at the same place is someone problematic and I'm going to address that with something called arguments or parameters to the constructor so that's what I'll do in the next video make your objects share them with me and I'll see you in a future video unless I'm gonna still be here in a second because I may I might have gotten something wrong I have to correct it so now I'm gonna look did I miss anything super important or get something really wrong there I'm just looking at the chat lambda keyword bahbahbah that was a good take bah blah blah yeah it's you know what's weird about this is you know and why I'm kind of taking this approach is for me coming from a Java and C++ background this is like oh thank you for the class it's just like it all makes sense to me again where it's that whole like constructor function and prototype stuff is like what is this but I suppose if you kind of got used to that or if you approach program with more of a functional style this may be this is harder or more confusing but for me this is this is helping me okay so I'm getting some feedback too that was fine okay I didn't perfectly nobody in the chat is telling me that I did anything horribly wrong in this video tutorial I may be I'll hear from you in the comments but I will see you in the next video where I talk about constructor arguments shouldn't X&Y be declared that actually is a good question maybe I can address this so let me let me see if I can explain this king weak minus I so this is the weird thing about JavaScript it just want it's just like it's none because what actually was declared is the reference the memory I mean this is I think this doesn't need to go in a video tutorial is like supplemental but if I understand the question if I understand the answer correctly is what I'm saying new bubble I suddenly allocate memory for an object and this variable or that this keyword is pointing a variable being a pointer somewhere in the computer's memory to the data and stuff all that stuff for that particular object so I don't have to specifically say let I'm not allocating new I am kind of but the way the memory management works is probably is more complicated than I'm prepared to like really but the idea here is what I want to do is I want to attach an x and a y here and so the attachment of it is through the reference dot the thing and so if I now here I mean I could have easily just said bubble equals new bubble not put this here and said bubble dot x equals something and now that that bubble has an X but if it's part of the class it's kind of always going to be part of any bubble so that this the thing Java scripts gonna let you do it any which way you want but this is one particular style and if we are a Java or C++ or processing it would just like you know there would be the way to do it and that's the only way to do it which for people like me is like oh yeah thank you this is so much more comfortable I can't take the fact that I look on the internet and I see 50 different ways of doing the same thing all right yes so me I am so me also says I think the idea is that you aren't adding them to the local scope so you don't need a letter bar and that's also a good way of describing it alright how am I on time dual clock I still have 45 minutes okay so all right so here's the thing okay I think I'm ready for the next right that's another good point austin is making the point if i went back to the old code which is over here that when i when you declare an object this way you don't say let X here it's just these are the properties that the thing that I'm declaring is bubble all right okay okay the discussion is going on it's really just feel I just want to like read the discussion to you but I'm not going to I want to see if I can at 230 stop and try to do like a simple coding challenge for this week because I really like that I'm not gonna really have one with these object tutorials and I think maybe I'll just do like simple recursion and I brought so somebody we're gonna yell at me at 230 to like try to do that simple coding challenge and then I can wave this book the fractal geometry of nature by benoît mandelbrot around alright okay I gotta keep going so let me close these out um save I don't know make sure this is still working okay and I can make this a little bigger too so this video format who will be watching this later is about constructor arguments that's kind of so the first the other I don't know we'll figure out what's the title these later our end on a Rendon is asking why use classes anyway but and so let me try to come back to that but yeah but people are there's a lot of other features that I haven't shown you yet that are in theory for quite good for entre Corita programming okay all right hello okay so here's the thing hopefully by now you kind of have a sense of the principle of a capsulation and the idea of making a template to create objects item number one item number two is maybe you have a sense of what the syntax for writing a classes that template constructor initializing some variables that are attached to that object writing some functions that are the functionality of that object the reason why you might want to do this is because one reason why is just to kind of organize your code of ultimately I don't I could make this exact sketch without all this class and constructor and all that it just could make some variables but one of the nice things about this is I have two things on the screen I don't have two x's and two y's I just have two bubble objects because imagine if these things have a speed and an X Peter Y speed and a color and radius you know I don't want to have 15 sets of variables for everything I have to make I want one set of 15 to apply to a bunch of things but one of the things that I've done here that's not really scalable or sustainable in a way that's gonna be as useful is you know what if I want these but right now they they do move independently of each other which is nice but they always start at the same spot now I could change their starting location to be random but what if I want to specify where they should start or specify a size so look one of the ways to do that is I want to say I often want to say ah what I would like to do is not just make a bubble but I would make like to make a purple bubble or a blue bubble or I would like to make a fast bubble or a large bubble or a small bubble I want to be able to modify the way that I create an object and the way that I do that is by adding stuff inside here I add arguments to the constructor new bubble with a radius of 50 and an XY of 70 comma so let me do it the other way let's imagine that what I want I want one bubble to be at 200 comma 200 and I wanted to have a radius of 40 and I want the other bubble to be at 400 comma 200 and I wanted to have a radius of 20 now one of the weird things about Java Script is again it just wants to work so I could add I'll add that and I could run this code and I don't know what it still works it doesn't actually the same thing so those numbers go nowhere but the idea is just like if you watch my video about passing arguments to a function I can pass arguments to a constructor and if I do that what I want is for the constructor to receive those arguments so if I'm giving it three arguments 200 240 I need to define the constructor with three parameters I think I'm getting this right these are the arguments the values the things that are passed in these are the parameters the variables that go inside the actual definition of the function in this case the constructor so I'm going to add an X a Y and an R so I'm gonna say this x equals x this dot y equals y and you know what I'm gonna create a new variable called R this dot R equals R and then in draw I'm going to actually say I almost just type R times to almost just type r times 2 I need to say this dot and actually in p5 with the ellipse function if you want the with the diameter along the width and the height to be the same I don't only need one value so now what I should do right if I run this we can see I should be making two bubbles with different starting locations and a different radii radius so look those starting at the right location sighs looks the same what did I get wrong here uh hmm missing semicolon 4020 list our times you really should be different right oh they are I don't know I just probably forgot to save hold on pause I have to sneeze little mute myself for a second call okay so I'm very yes and so all right so this is the part that I need to and I agree with me I am Sabina saying prototypical inheritance is a headache and so that's why I like this is less for me using classes instead of the other way of doing this at javascript is less of a headache that's entirely the reason okay so I did just blow my nose I feel like I have to sneeze again maybe a cold is coming on I don't even know where I put my tissues they're over here I feel bad for everybody's watching this and it is a two thirty yet nope okay so uh now I remember what I want to say okay so you might be looking at this and thinking oh god this is like the most awful thing I've ever seen you mean those variables X the same as the Vista X and and actually if you look at some my examples in previous programming environments that I've used I often will do something called this temp X temp Y this is one of the most confusing aspects of programming with classes and creating objects and then this would have to be temp X right that would have to beat my intent are is that these variables inside the constructor they're temporary local variables just for the sole purpose of receiving the value and quickly passing it to the variable that counts so this dot X is the variable that counts it's actually the thing that I'm going to use to keep track of where the object is and draw it and move it but I I can't access it directly from up here I mean the ways that I could but they would be weird and they wouldn't necessarily be make any more sense so I want this 200 to go into this dot X I need something to temporarily receive it like 10 max and then quickly pass it to X so but I maybe I have a bad habit but I like I actually just like to name these the same name because I know that which ones which by whether there's a Vista or not but you will see that conventions like this or name them with an underscore or an underscore after or with a temporary you know you can come up with your own style but it's important rods that these are all just things I've made up like unicorn fluffy rainbow and this code which you know in many ways has its advantages unicorn I'm gonna just play this whole thing out fluffy rainbow just to prove the point here this works as well the same exact result the question is what kind of variable naming convention makes sense to your brain and being consistent kind of helps in there are you can follow other people's conventions and styles but I would say there are no real rules here and if you want to name your variable unicorn fluffy rainbow pink fluffy unicorns jump whatever it is I got it wrong but 128 unicorn is not fluffy rainbows but you should make a fluffy or somebody make a fluffy rainbow p5.js sketch it's gonna be awesome to share with me okay so I got a little off track there but the point of it is whatever I do whenever I put in here I say bubble 200 it gets sent all the way to the constructor definition some variable it's like saying let x equal it's like I'm initializing X with this value 200 it goes in here and this just if I have this here exists solely to set this value so that I can use it later so that's the real purpose of these template constructor parameters to receive arguments and pass them to variables of course you can use them in all sorts of other ways you don't have to follow this exact design pattern but it is kind of a typical standard one so if you're watching this video what I would suggest to you is see see what else you can add to this can you add a color what's the difference between making the color random for every bubble versus initializing each bubble with the color of what other properties can you add to this play around can you add another function like can you add a function called like edges that do something when the bubble reaches the edges is this even really a bubble what does it mean to be a bubble if we answer that question I don't think so so try to add your own constructor arguments at additional constructor arguments and see what questions you have and let me know thanks very much for watching all right yeah I'm just look I'm taking a break now looking at the chat did I actually kind of finish objectoriented program I mean just blenny more to it you know what this wasn't actually a good reference this because I did this so weirdly I feel like when I made these video tutorials in JavaScript and it's kind of like this oak so yeah cuz so the next thing is really the array stuff I don't necessarily feel like getting into that today so what I'm curious what it did I include the other the other relevant playlist here which is actually probably more is the learning processing one and if I go to objectoriented programming so this is Rho this is from this is from even longer ago like I have like no gray hair in this I'm wearing different glasses I mostly look the same though anyway I look much stronger I'm like the rock in this picture right now I'm just like spindly man okay I'm not serious okay so defining a class part one part two constructor arguments more on objects passed by value passed by reference what's in more on objects what did I do in this video covers objects is data for other objects overloading and authors communicating with other objects okay so I think in JavaScript you overloading it can I I kind of feel like it's 210 it's weirdly like how am I going this so fast I'm always running out of time I'm like it feels a little off that I'm not running out of time so what what I'm looking at this don't forget kittens yeah so I'm trying to think so this overloading thing is let me go back here I don't want to publish the code with this so what's interesting and maybe I guess I could do a video about this right now why not so the things that I need to do our objects talk more about odd let me make a list and I be curious to hear feedback especially in the slack group about what might follow next so one thing is objects like intersect other objects I mean talking to other like objects communication between objects so writing a function where you pass one object to another another is a this idea of quoteunquote overloading objects as data for other objects that's one inheritance is obviously another getters and setters I don't know that I ever want to talk about that getters and setters this is kind of like public versus private public versus private and inheritance and polymorphism so I definitely want to do inheritance at some point I definitely want to do objects talking to other objects and overlook all this stuff would be useful at some point so the question is you know today my goal is to get through this introductory stuff which I actually feel pretty happy about that I got through even though I botched the first video hopefully it can be corrected and so but I could do one more before I'm gonna do a recursion coding challenge I could also do a partner but I need to teach arrays before I do a particle system coding challenge I don't need to teach them because I can just do that and then cuz I'm gonna do the arrays eventually Pauline right do these classes have the Gotcha that they have to come higher in the code and the code that calls them not really as long as the whole page is loaded before you try to use any of it if those classes have been defined somewhere you'll be fine do a strawpoll I don't know why I'm not really feeling like doing the straw poll today I think I should leave this and come back to this stuff can somebody write this out for me in a list and like tweeted at me or something or I'll save it for later I think that I want a a little bit of like quit while I'm ahead today let me so many people are asking about the overloading I don't know if I'll eventually just make a video about this but cuz I need to think about this is a little bit not so friendly towards beginners but I don't know though people are gonna see this maybe I should just do the overloading what did I say I did again in this video maybe I could do this more on objects objects is data for other objects overloading and object communicate with other objects how long is this video I somehow did that in like this is in 13 minutes and it's 215 and this was made more recently by the way you can tell by the grayhaired stop it amuses me I don't please don't watch me do this strawpoll recursion but okay Simon is making a good suggestion I'm gonna do this recur uh what do you think recursion now more on objects first so here you go you have approximately one minute to vote on this and I'm going to answer some questions Ricardo asks when are you going to continue neural networks as soon unfortunately right now I am I feel like I should turn this volume down maybe the volume is actually fine but is I'm hearing it too loud the what was the question oh right now I'm trying to do videos for the courses I'm currently teaching and I was when I was started these internal network videos teaching about neural networks and then I had bicycle accident yada yada yada I'm behind on it so as soon as I can get a break and some time where I can kind of get back to it I will and I'm hoping that'll be before the end of 2017 but it will 100% know 90% be January 2018 if I don't get to it before the end of this year I think I will Danko's make a good point that I won't listen to what the straw poll is which is kind of true all right so I think that was a minute problem is you guys are behind me in time so did I really give you a minute I don't know if I did I think I should do the recursion challenge now by the way oh good looks like alright so I'll come back to the objects and I'm gonna do the recursion challenge now I'm just going to refresh the results refresh the results looks like it's only going up so that's what we're gonna do so I'm gonna I don't I don't know that this is as great as I don't know if anything can ever be as wonderful as that 10 Fred coding challenge I just feel like that's gonna be the epitome of everything I ever tried to do that's the wrong war but let's do recursion so I'm going to why am i losing what and this way also there's no risk of me not getting to it because the time is running out and I'm just gonna put it in this folder P 5 generate B if you're wondering by the way I've started using this tool called p5 manager that I made a video about people I've generate B+ I need to read some random numbers hello p5 generate B recursion and um I can go into Adam here and I have recursion and again I know there's a way in p5 manager for me to change the template but I absurdly prefer to just manually do it so let me just get this started here let me go back to the browser and go back kerschen let me minimize this and now one thing I do need to do is uh and I think you know with all this new classes and objects in JavaScript we definitely need so I need to erase the whiteboard oh okay I'll get some screenshots oh I should probably redo that constant video maybe my apology is it good enough okay woo good thing this arm works okay here we go recursion I know I already did the Const video but I feel like I just like kind of screwed it up but I feel like I should redo it right okay what's theirs that recursion joke but I don't remember what it is you know the recursion joke actually so first of all whoops I think I'm realizing like didn't I okay well I did it for a nature of code and then I think only I've only done it in JavaScript these like trees and that was kind of more complicated than what I'm gonna do now and that was coding challenge 14 so let's do it again anyway then I'll read some random numbers I know that's what you all really tuned in for it okay all right yes loops versus recursion that's it's simply gonna be a piece of this so here we go today's coding challenge is about recursion I'm going to make a really simple design of recursion it's not my own design it comes from processing examples I would have to look time out this is so silly that I'm doing this right now but this is basically what I want to do there's no credits to this okay but I'm gonna do it slightly differently anyway hello welcome to today's coding challenge about recursion so I'm gonna make an incredibly simple p5 GS sketch with recursion in it it's not gonna be the most beautiful thing it's not even really my own design it's just based off of a processing example that's been around for many years but recursion is the key it was a key principle behind the fractal geometry of nature so I have been Wat Mandelbrot seminal book on fractals here the fractal geometry of nature I have lots of videos about fractal trees and nature of code video style this is a thread of you know fractals being this self similar shape that exists in nature if you think about a tree a tree is a trunk that has branches and those branches have branches and those branches up branches and those branches have branches this is recursion this is selfsimilar shape the site well that's that's not a recursion ah remember I said I wasn't gonna start over and I my nose is running this is i'ma give me one more shot please YouTube shut down much should be allowed to be here Oh tail recursion and how it's now super efficient in j/s okay that'll have to come another time alright one more time I'm just gonna start over hello welcome to a coding challenge this is a coding challenge about recursion recursion is a technique it is actually a concept about self reference recursive function is a function that is defined according to itself this is what I'm gonna do in this coding challenge what does that even mean but I'm the reason why I want to show you recursion is the key concept behind the fractal geometry of nature so I have here benoit mandelbrot seminal book on fractals the fractal geometry of nature I have a wonderful book I encourage you to if you're interested in this subject it's it's the it's the beginning of everything in terms of this subject so I encourage you to take to get it for yourself or borrow it from the library and I have a lot of other video you can all link to them in this video's description I made fractal trees nature of code tutorials about fractals fractals being a selfsimilar shape a shape that's kind of made up of itself recursion is this concept of self reference a recursive function is a function defined according to itself so it's a really elegant way of creating patterns I I'm gonna do that right now I'm gonna make a really simple one it's just basically the I'm gonna build the example that's been in processing for many years or something like it from scratch it's from scratch and okay wait what was I lost my train of thought was gonna say next um from scratch and then you I've been so enamored with the previous ten print coding challenge which it was a simple bit of code and what people made from it so I'm hoping that the same thing is gonna happen I don't know what the hashtag should be hashtag coding train recursion some people come up with something better ten pretty I would say recursion but that's just recruiting I don't know the point is share all the things you make on Twitter and also in the readme file that'll be on github link from this video's description so let's get started so I'm gonna start with some really simple code I have a sketch which makes a canvas that's 600 by 400 I am just going to draw in the middle of the canvas an ellipse and it's going to be at 300 comma 200 and it's going to be 300 pixels wide and 300 CIL's high I always forget this but with ellipse if the width and height are equal I can just use one argument and there it is ah now one thing I want to do about this is I want to say stroke 255 and no fill so let's say for the sake of argument what I want now is to repeat this pattern I want this ellipse then another ellipse then another ellipse then another lips and they're shrinking as they move off to the right well the typical way that I would do that is with a loop structure a while loop or a for loop this is a control structure that allows you to repeat code like drawing ellipse and change what's happening each cycle through the repeat but I'm gonna do it in a different way recursion is much recursion a recursive function executes with a loop unto itself but it's a slightly different way so let me keep going with this and I'm gonna say what if I wrote a function almost absurdly just called draw circle and that function I just put this ellipse in it and what I said is let me give it an X a Y in a diameter and so I'm gonna draw the ellipse at X Y damnit diameter and then I'm gonna set call say draw a circle at 300 200 300 so this is like a totally like absurd thing that I've done the code runs exactly the same right this is the same what I've done is basically redefined the ellipse function and give it a different name and then call that so this seems kind of ridiculous but there's a reason why I'm doing that what would happen now just bear with me for a second what would happen if right in here I said hey draw another circle at X plus I don't know 20 Y D so this is now this idea of recursion I'm defining draw a circle according to itself so when I execute draw a circle it draws an ellipse then calls itself so it draws an ellipse then calls itself so it draws an ellipse then calls itself so it draws an ellipse and calls itself I'm gonna stop this eventually drops calls itself this could result in an infinite loop so I need some way just like with a for loop or a while loop I need to make sure I have an exit condition so if this function is going to recursively and you know this way it looks like something you're not supposed to do right you can't call the function from inside the function but in fact this is a technique that happens in many algorithms require this kind of recursive thinking what I'm doing right now does not require this cursive recursive thinking I could probably do this more easily in a for loop but in a moment I'm gonna do something else that a for loop wouldn't really work as well for so here we go I'm gonna give myself an exile weirdly let's just see what happens do I crash my browser yeah you know what so what happened is I got this error fortunately the browser was like smart enough to say like yeah yeah hey hey there buddy you are calling yourself way too much stop so it's a maximum call stack size exceeded in blah blah blah like draw circle circles wrong this is bad so it stopped but you could see I did have this result of it doing itself over and over again so I could add an exit condition and say well only actually only actually call yourself if X is less than width so if X is changing right so keep going until you get to the edge and now I could do this again and there's it stopped right but this is not what I want to do actually what I want to do I want to move but I also want to shrink the diameter so with each new ellipse I want the diameter to shrink so we can see that's happening here the diameter shrinks by half and I also want to do something where I move it according to half of the diameter so so now I'm moving each ellipse over according to the radius and shrinking which is half the diameter and shrinking it by half so there we go oh and I got the so I got the call thing so now I need to use as long keep doing this as long as D is greater than 2 whoops as long as D is greater than 2 not less than so there we go so now we see I have this ellipse that's moving to the right that's moving to the right that's moving to the right now let's think about this for a second so what I have remember what I have is an ellipse with a smaller one and a smaller one and a smaller one in a smaller one that's what I have now you might think well what if I want to also have the ellipses going to the left so I could pretty easily do that and I could have two for loops or one for loop that kind of grows and shrinks but what if what I really want is to say this is not an ellipse a circle with circles to the right and the left what it means to be a circle is to have a circle to the right and the left so this circle also needs a circle to the right and the left but then this one needs one to the right and left oh and this one needs to the right and left and this one needs to the right and left right and left right and left oh but this one right up this goes on forever this is this idea of recursion a fractal a selfsimilar shape if i zoom in on any given portion it's going to look like the whole the whole shape itself and this is a chute what's the term for that stochastic is what it's random but this is the I guess it's not stochastic uniform somebody in the chat will tell me give myself a break here for a second how are we on time 230 it's like the time of building so slowly today self some a deterministic heuristic no beautiful ok whatever I guess maybe there isn't a term for it stochastic if it's random but this is a perfectly selfsimilar fractal where every piece of it is exactly the same but one thing you would think about you could build a little randomness into here and that's actually referred to as a stochastic fractal and something like lightning would be that if you look at lightning right it's kind of all this like or blood vessels or trees but not every piece of it is exactly the same but the kind of idea of it is the same Wow also a little tangent there let's actually make I wanted this to make this happen so let me come back in here so now right this is what I have and so now what I can do right is I can say hey why don't you only draw a circle to the right and to the left now I double dog dare you with the cherry on top and some nondairy whipped cream low fat not low fat you got supposed to do low fat anymore anyway I dare you to try to recreate what I'm just gonna show you right now without recursion somebody will do it and my mind bulllike explode but it's this is the this is just like one two three four five six seven lines of code that's going to do something kind of phenomenal there we go so this is the result right it's not just circles to the right and left but it's circles look at this zoom in that looks just like what I drew zoom in this looks just like right now I'm zooming using the zoom feature of the Mac I'm using a Mac but could you actually draw zoom use scale or some other kind of trickery to like do this sort of like infinite zoom into the fractal could you animate this don't draw circles use color there are so many possible things you could expand on from here you know just to like keep going for another minute or two I could do them all so oh I could say hey put some circles down right y plus D times 0.5 and let me make the canvas a little bit bigger and look at this now what's crazy about this is oh my god I can't believe this has happened this is actually called the sierpinski triangle which formed out of all these circles which is a triangle filled with other triangles filled with other triangles for your electrons that's a fractal you could try to make I mean I mean this sort of weird roundabout way by putting all these things next to each other so what if I have them go up what if I have them only go to the right and down like this is like now I'm just too curious I'm gonna take out to the left so this is to the row that's kind of blue it's like the fractal thing on its side there are so many possibilities here so I want to think like so couple things one is this is now executing over and over again but I'm not doing anything to animate it you know I could kind of like give the initial size to like Mouse X so you can see it's kind of like I'm zooming in and out in a way and interestingly enough but so so there's a there's a lot of things I could do to animate but I'm gonna add no loop right now because I also want to show you you know if I were to add just a little bit of randomness into this let me go back to the original one but for example what if I said let new D and did I use var no I didn't have I don't have a variables yes let new D equals D times random you know 0.2 to 0.8 and so now I'm gonna say Plus nu D divided by 2 so I could use put some randomness in here I don't know what this is gonna do this is probably a bad idea for some reason I can't think of just yet and you can see I don't know that so this was I don't love what I got came up with here but you know every time I do this it's gonna give me a slightly different version of it it's not perfectly this is a stochastic fractal the quality of how the shape is repeating itself similar and somebody's telling me to do D times 0.25 in the chat Bay that's going to create a more interesting pattern but this so and again I have discovered from doing the 10 print coding challenge that the viewership of these videos is way more creative and has so many beautiful design ideas than I do so I really just need to stop because I don't have any of those ideas but I'm trying to show you some possibilities here so I am going to just do one other which is I'm going to take this and make this 0.25 which somebody in the chat was telling me to do oh yeah so that's kind of cool wait wait wait let me make the first circle bigger oh but maybe I need to oh but now I don't want to go over by / no yeah so that's interesting why make crazy weird recursive eyes anyway see I'm terrible at this so have fun make some parameters make some color choices make some design choices share with me on Twitter hashtag recursion code etrade Oh somebody I'll pin a comment what the some people come up with a good hashtag idea and I'll pin it to the top of the comments and also contribute to the readme and I'll show a bunch of people's recursive designs on next week's coding train which will be next week okay talk to you soon thanks for watching all right another direction up that would have been good okay so look at this it's 237 I almost weirdly am disturbed by the fact that I have extra so many things are wrong with today number one is that livestream never crashed number two is I think to be on schedule I did draw outside of the I did draw outside of the view for a while and I did have my microphone unit at the beginning otherwise I'm doing pretty well ah let me mention one thing I know this is the end I should have mentioned this at the beginning but here at NYU whoops we are starting a new program called interactive media arts it's an undergraduate program to do stuff in creative coding sphere in a much wider broader space than the stuff that I even just do on this channel if you're interested or thinking about applying if you're a high school student right now if you're a high school senior reach out to me directly please I'm at Schiffman on Twitter or some other means the PI Twitter is the best way I'm happy to answer your questions check out the open houses um this is a new program it's ready next year we're kind of wondering if anybody's gonna reply so I would apply so I have at least like to know if thinking about applying so because I'm curious and I think there's an early decision deadline coming up and then of course there's the regular deadline so let me know I would love to see some of you here I'm going to teach us part of this program supposedly if I don't get fired before then or if I you know maybe they'll just lock me in this room and I'll just be a 24 hour stream ah and now it's time for everybody's favorite part of the coding train storytime oh let's read some Gaussian deviance so dangerous two point three four to one point seven six six two point one one two well those are negative two points I don't know why I read to the side it's weird point four one eight point four OH three negative point five five six point two four two two point six one oh one point six one five point six seven negative it was and two point four two three I'll have to do more point one seven nine one point three one three negative point seven one nine point seven six and three point five nine one point four seven our negative point three one okay hey good night everybody and I'm here I can answer a few more questions I'm gonna be here for another four or five minutes cuz I apparently like some strange bizarre Oh Dan starting I didn't really start on time but I was only like three minutes late and I kind of made some videos and it's only two hours like last week I should fly straight for four hours and was like a mess okay I'm from Brazil and I make some videos about Python I was making challenge videos if this thing you created no no okay so this is a great question thank you for asking everything that I I'm not so good about being explicit about the sort of licensing of the materials that I produce here on the coding train 100% all of it well I mean I never say one percent but it's my intention for all of the code that I do in my tutorials and challenges to be MIT license which is the most permissive license I also am thrilled when people do things inspired by the videos so if you want to make your own videos redoing the challenges or I think the thing people do is like reaction videos but anything that remixes my content you are absolutely welcome and encouraged to do so if I'm using somebody else's stuff I try whenever possible one of the things that I really struggle with is that things get misattributed to me so like for example I did the ten print coding challenge because I love this book and then people you know you might get lots of I said this is the beginning but like oh then invented tendrá nobody actually said that but you know and this happens a lot with flocking I mean I've made a lot of examples of flocking simulations and all of my examples are based on the work of Craig Reynolds and you know I didn't discover processing myself I discovered processing because other people like I meet potaro and JT Nimoy or we're doing workshops at ITP about processing so yes I have this public face of this channel I try to you know I always you know number one there's actual rules and laws about copyright and licensing I try to follow those but I also just try to overdo it and be generous with thanking and giving credit where credit where the things I do come from so please do your own challenges share them with me put them on YouTube etc that book does exist for real so if you think about this why does this book exist so there are lots of types of things that you might want to study about the way how the world works that you want to stimulate that involve randomness and you might need a sequence of random numbers this could be referred to often as a Monte Carlo simulation and so yes and Simon is doing this it what Simon's videos on YouTube but really that's only 840 so I was gonna go to bed at normal time do I talk about Simon too much Simon you're the greatest do you want me to stop mentioning your name okay so why is this book exists so this book is from the RAND Corporation pre the times where we just had like a computers with pseudorandom number generators on them and if you needed a sequence of random numbers to do some type of scientific study you couldn't just like make them up because it's very hard for a human being to come up with random numbers you could flip coins for a while perhaps you'd get some kind of like thermodynamic heat gastrulation and measure it and would produce randomness but this is a book that people used just to look up and have a sequence of random numbers for some type of research so this is a reprint this isn't theory I would love if an original of this book exists that I would like on eBay or something I would you know within reason pay a lot to get an original copy that this is a reprint and I think you could get this on Amazon I should love to have like a coating trade book that was like I know that doesn't make any sense can you make something about voxels and Kenya makes more stuff with 3d so I don't do a lot with 3d let me one thing I do want to mention though I would like to do more tutorials about 3d especially this semester when it comes up in my class twitter.com slash p5.js go p5 XJS is the Twitter account so I'm gonna p5x je s and what if I search actually gl okay that's kind of funny um look at all this amazing stuff whoa look at this oh I that is awesome what's that game this is like that game I've played it before it's so cool okay wait I'm finding all my own stuff what I was looking for is here we go this is what I'm looking for actually is to highlight the work of KJ Holland on Twitter and also Stahl Jia who did google Summer of Code and I think I should just go to the p5.js account because I probably I think it tweeted about this come on recently that all this wonderful stuff you should look at all this stuff here we go yes so there's a I feel like there's a blog post on this and I'm just missing and I apologize maybe somebody can find it for me coding math YouTube channel is also great for math of maths of 3d stuff but stal jia and kate KJ Hollin a kate Hollenbach did a ton of work this summer on a WebGL mode and i haven't really had the chance to dig into it and try making some new examples but i'd love to do a new video tutorial about it so you should all thank them for the wonderful work that and and so I would love to do more with 3d and p5.js with this a3 Jas is a wonderful JavaScript library for doing 3d on the web to that I would certainly recommend will learning p5 make me more employable ask Fink bottom and I'm being told it's 247 so I'm gonna go in a second feelin camera I don't know I could get to work I should give it one more try okay turn it off on anyway I don't know here's the thing learning a particular framework or library or language like learning node or learning how to make an electron app or learning angular or learning react or learning p5 or learning 3j s these things come and go learning how to learn I think is the skill and so trying new libraries playing with them trying to different one comparing and contrasting learning how to contribute learning you have to be part of a community of people building software I think these are the vital skills as opposed to learning a particular technology it's easy for me to say that in the sort of like the world that I live in is having this sort of like fulltime job I guess teaching but I do think that this is really key so p5 chess is is really the space that it occupies is place for creative coders and artists and making visual stuff or sketching so you can think of it as a place to learn a place to prototype a place to make animations and games and so it's not as obvious of a link to like doing you know software development for a large company that's gonna build a massive website that involves a database and a serverside framework and all this front flying frontend stuff so there's so many things to learn but I certainly think p5 is a great place to explore creativity and learn about programming and build stuff and so that ultimately I think is something that hopefully can make you employable that's my answer machine 30 yeah make this answer into a video yeah somebody could just tweet me the link to that answer precisely and see if it'd make any sense 3d stuff Oh sell your a lot of people want us to sell your automata a challenge that would be good all right I'm gonna play my goodbye song I don't I know why I call this a goodbye song but it's just some arbitrary thing I found on soundcloud or Free Music Archive once when I searched rainbow I like this old timey style music fazer Dutch yes is great I've been trying to get it hopefully gonna have a guest I've only had more guests do a tutorial about fazer at some point I'm it's really my fault just in terms of like time and the amount of time I have a time it takes to organize guests ceiling camera sorry I don't like I'll try the ceiling camera one more time okay so can we turn it off and on concealing camera settings no settings ah that's it I found it can you see it look hi it's me look into the ceiling camera oh you know I could do that's really this is the look here's my marker these are my hands no feel like camera this is what I do this is what I like to do in the coding training and like to me the idea of having a camera above me ostensibly this is for like hardware tutorials but me I'm just doing ridiculous stuff with it and now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna be ridiculous and I'm going to add another existing and I'm going to do green Canon and now here I am i greased your baby nose up but let me take off my glasses whoa okay wait uh I have an itch well you know I have some mild psoriasis here on my forehead can you see that does that closeup look I'm kind of going bald and I have a lot of gray hair [Laughter] okay thank you everybody and see alright so yes it is weird welcome to the weird corner of the Internet and I will see you all next Friday I don't know what time yet usually every Friday morning a New York City time around 7 or 8 or 9 a.m. I try to post a time for the day sometimes it's early like this one as it's later I often try to tweet the day before but it'll sometime next Friday I guess I could try to look at my schedule and determine but that's what it is so thank you everybody for watching I'm gonna just check the slack channel if you want to join the slack group it is lucien bernard if i'm pronouncing that all correctly says i'm a freelance creative coder and processing one of my first experience with the creative coding coding training also helped me get started great and okay so if you want to join the patreon its do i plug this too much i feel like i'm plugging it because people seem to enjoy it and it helps motivate me and you know i use the funds a i don't know if this is a sustainable thing in terms of rocky earning income but i I used the funds to to put back into the videos in a lot of ways and to getting help with doing coding stuff and editing the videos and producing stuff like the crazy trailer which may be fun but I enjoyed it so anyway if you're interested please join okay so thank you everybody and here we go I am going to I don't know where I stopped to stop streaming goodbye and again the edited versions these videos won't come till the middle of next week but the hopefully this actual livestream archive will be up later today or tomorrow or sometime this weekend and if you really need to see it and it's not up you can always tweet me I can send you like a private link of it till we have it released goodbye everybody I can't find the button to stop streak me oh there it is oh thank goodness I recorded this to disk okay hit stop recording uh and you know please do not feel obligated to contribute I enjoy doing this I'm gonna do this anyway the patreon is a bonus for me it really helps out but it is not the reason why I'm not doing videos that you have to buy and there are they are ad supported but just because I want anybody's bill to watch them and I don't know if YouTube is the best place to make that happen and if there's places where they're not accessible or the p5 and computers aren't accessible but if I can help at some part bring coding to places in the world where there where people may not have access to some of those knowledge are tools I hope I'm doing a good job of that okay good bye
