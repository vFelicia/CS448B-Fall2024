hold on okay hi okay in this video we're going to talk about pendulums um now pendulums is really just this perfect perfect thing to look at right now because it it combines everything we've looked at really from the beginning of chapter 2 all the way up until now there are forces at play there's the force of gravity on the pendulum that's what causes it to swing but we need in order to deal in order to solve that simulate the pendulum we're going to need to look at trigonometry s and cosine again polar C polar coordinates and then we're also going to deal with angular motion the angle of the pendulum what's its angular velocity what's its angular acceleration so all these things are going to come into play and so it's a really nice it's a nice nice place to be for us right now now you know the question is how what how what are you going to do with this um on the one hand you might want to make a processing sketch with lots of pendulums if that's what you want to do perfect you're in exactly the right place but really what I'm hoping for this is if you can understand the pendulum scenario figure out how all the math works and apply it to a simulation then when you come across some scenario in your idea in your sketch with similar qualities you're going to be able to figure out the trigonometry problems the angular motion problems the forces problems okay so let's get started I'm I want to draw the pendulum I'm going to start by drawing the pendulum in two different ways this is a drawing a diagram of a pendulum at rest right there is this thing called an arm this is the arm and this thing called The Bob and and this is the Bob so this is our pendulum it's at rest now if we were to lift this up over here and let go it would swing back and forth like that so let's draw the diagram that way here's the pendulum now at an angle so an the the angle of the pendulum is a key property that we're going to need to look at and what do we mean by angle we mean the angle relative to the the axis of at being at rest so that angle Theta is relative the axis of where it would be hanging for at rest now what are what do let's let's let's start okay before we even figure out how to swing the pendulum you know sometimes this is a good thing to do when you're creating processing sketches like you know you want a swinging pendulum well can you even get the sort of static pendulum appearing on the screen in the one hand it's easy a line from here to there and a circle that's what we're going to do but let's look at what do we need in order to have this we need to know this location which we'll call the origin the origin XY we need to know the Bob's X Y and this is going to be an important value as well this is the length of the arm so what's the length of the arm this and of course we're going to deal with the angle Theta so let's actually just take a look I have a kind of a processing sketch that's already built um that do is doing just this part just to with the static what we're going to do in this video is we're going to piece by piece add all the simulation parts and have and eventually have this pendulum swinging okay so if we look over here uh we have a really simple sketch which just just has two B vectors one for the origin the top point one for the Bob's location and the length of that arm and we can see here that the Bob uh location is just the same x value as the origin but the yvalue is the length of that arm so that's all we're doing is want to is is drawing a line from the origin to the Bob and a circle where the Bob is so that's what we've got but that's only going to work if the pendulum's at rest what if the pendulum has an angle what if we lift that up to the side how do we do that okay that is part you know two of this video in however many parts okay so back over here let's take a look at that so let's say we know what the angle is we know the angle is say 45Â° or pi divided by four okay so we're going to say the angle or Theta has some value in this case we're going to say is Pi / 4 how do we get this location well let's take a look at something let's draw a right triangle here let's make this into a right triangle this is y and this is X origin uh from the origin we have to go down this much Y and over this x to find the Bob location assuming that angle so let's do a little trigonometry sooa all we need is SOA s and C so s of theta equals opposite over hypotenuse x / length opposite is X hypotenuse is the length of the pendulum in this case that is really important in our scenario in our right triangle the length is the hypotenuse the hypotenuse of that triangle is the length oh sorry cosine of theta is adjacent over hypotenuse or Y / length and this means that if we know the if we know the length and we know the angle we're going to be able to find the X and the Y because we can say x = length * sin of th and Y = length time cosine of theta this is exactly what we did in the polar to cartisian coordinate transformation video if you want you can go back and watch that one again we're doing exactly the same thing here I should say that things are a little bit flipped usually we look at an angle relative to the xaxis now we're looking at an angle relative to the Y AIS so you can see X has got s in the equation and Y has got cosine in the equation but if we can draw that right triangle and we can remember s opposite hypotenuse cosine adjacent hypotenuse then we can always derive these formulas and figure it out so we've got that let's go back to our processing sketch and put these formulas right in there okay come with me over here I I should like take off I have a sweater but anyway okay here we go uh now where where let's okay we've got this sketch okay first thing we need to do is add an angle variable to it so at the top I'm going to say hey float angle and that angle's just going to be zero for right now and now what we want to do is say Okay based on what that angle is I need to compute the Bob's location so what was the formula it's over here uh X length s y length cosine so if I come back here uh I can say Bob dox equals length Time s of the angle and Boby equals length time cosine of the angle now what did we miss there's one thing we missed in this equation here I'm going to come back over here for a second is that this Y and X is relative to the origin right we want to go this much y from the origin and this much X from the origin so we need to add we need to add the Y and the X to the origin's location so when we come back over here we're going to say okay the Bob's X location is origin X Plus that and the Bob's Y location is origin y plus that in truth of course we could have done this with uh we could have used P vector and the P vector's add function but just to kind of look at the formula in a sort of simplest way I think this is useful so let's run this now uh whoops I have an error can't find anything named length Okay in my in this particular sketch I named it Len rather than the full word length so I'm just going to correct that right now I'm going to run this and we can see ah there it is the same place that used to be but now we should be able to go and change that angle what if I made that angle pi divided by four right there we go now we have the pendulum at 45 degrees and I could do something like say I can start to increment the angle by some small amount and you can see the pendulum is starting to rotate and eventually it will come back I guess I should have subtracted that right it's moving but now we're not so so this is what we did essentially in some of our earlier videos we just have this thing moving with polar cartisian coordinates around and around now we need to actually look at why do we what is the force of the pendulum and how does that Force get applied to acceleration so let's go take a look at that and guess what we're going to use sign again s and cosine again okay so we'll let this keep spinning around kind of weirdly like it is and now so okay so let's come back to our pendulum we figured out how to draw the pendulum in the right place now what we need to do is figure out what is the angular acceleration of the pendulum okay so what are we talking about here here's the pendulum now the pendulum has a force of gravity on it that's the force of gravity it's pulling it down now the reason why the Bob doesn't just fall straight down is because you know there's a force of tension there's this Rod here there's this metal it's not metal whatever this whatever it is whatever it might be there's this arm here that's keeping it so we know the pendulum is going to move actually this direction right this is a right angle here so what we're actually looking for I'm going to draw another right triangle is this particular force that particular force is what we would call the force of the pendulum and interestingly enough we have have a right triangle here and if I extend this diagram a little bit and draw the axis for the pendulum at rest this is our angle Theta this is also our angle Theta so what we've actually done here this is kind of a little bit this is a big moment because this is kind of an important concept that's going to come up again and again in some future examples we've separated the out a particular Vector into components along an arbitrary axis so we know that vectors have components this Vector has an X and A Y component and we do this all the time because we have P vector v equals new P Vector X comma y right we think about the vector in terms of we know it's magnitude and Direction but really you know in the vector there's an X and A Y but we always do that relative to the xaxis here what we've done is separated this Vector out in terms of components relative to the axis of the pendulum and we need this particular component to be the force of the pendulum okay so what how do we get that well look at this what is if we call this FP I don't like the way I drew that let's just remedy that if this side is FP and this side is f of G notice something s of theta equals the force of the pendulum divided by the force of gravity whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa wait a second that's right right yeah of theta is opposite over hypotenuse that's the opposite that's the hypotenuse so what is the force of the pendulum it's just the force of gravity times s of theta now in truth there are some some missing pieces here and I'm not going to get first of all I'm not qualified to go through every little detail of everything that's happening in a pendulum in terms of torque and tension and air resistance and you know you could get into a really really elaborate simulation if you want to but this even just this much is going to do us a whole lot of good um uh we can add something to this which I'll do which I'll show you in a little bit later but this is this just being able to realize that the force how strong that Force is is sign of the angle if you think about that right when the pendulum's um at rest what's the angle it's zero what's sign of the angle zero so there's no Force there's no force of the pendulum um because the the pendulum's at rest um I'm sitting down so so sitting down like in its resting spot I could really use a script to write about someone wants to write one okay um so what do we need to do with this remember something Force equals mass time acceleration you know what is the force of gravity GF * m / distance squar all this stuff for us we can think of the force of gravity as a constant scaled by mass and the acceleration is equal to the force of the pendulum divid by mass so what we've really got in the end is acceler the angular acceleration of the pendulum is equal to the force of graph some constant kind of botch this times s of theta edit edit I'm not going to edit these someday I'll edit these let me go back and try that again okay for our purposes in this particular example we're going to consider the force of gravity to be a constant it is the equivalent of some constant times mass right because the more massive an object is the stronger the force of gravity so we're going to say some constant gtimes mass is the force of gravity time sin / Theta that's the force of the pendulum a constant the gravitational force times the object the Bob's mass time s of theta so what does that mean the acceleration is the angular acceleration of the pendulum is equal to the force divided by mass take G * mass time s of theta and divide it by mass and we have the pendulum's acceleration is equal to Su constant Time s of theta if that seems overly simple to you then great because in the end it's actually quite simple we're just scaling the acceleration is is essentially some constant times sign of the angle so that's why you know if you think like what wait sign oscillates theend oscillates it's all related it's all this magical soup of oscillation and trigonometry so but this is the formula we've now got this formula let's go stick this formula into our code and if you didn't understand this formula I don't know maybe rewatch the video and it'll make sense the second time or you don't know send me an email and I'm going to try to help do this explanation again u in the book maybe it's like it's edited so it's less um cockamamy okay um so here we are back again uh and now we're going to add this so first of all what's going on here this by the way 0 0.01 is the angular velocity the change in the angle is angular velocity so I'm going to go back and I'm going to add some more variables angular velocity and going make that zero and I'm make angular acceleration and I'm going to make that uh zero as well so our motion algorithm right is angle angle changes by velocity and velocity changes by EX acceleration and if we've got this we can see it's not moving why we haven't calculated the angular acceleration but we have this formula over here to calculate that angular acceleration G * s of theta G is a constant so we can just come over here and we can say angular acceleration equals some constant I don't know 0.01 * s of that Angle now a couple things are going to go wrong here but let's let's let this go okay first of all it's kind of swinging but it's swinging upside down so somewhere somehow we got our wires crossed and we you know we were doing this physics simulation and not this this diagrams and we were probably thinking of Y going up and in a processing window y goes down so we could investigate this but sometimes when something goes in the wrong direction you know we're we're processing programmers we can just kind of we we know we don't have to understand at all we just know multiply by negative 1 we'll go in the other direction so I'm going to just say negative .01 we're we're we're flipped we got to flip our world back upside you know processing points down we don't want to point up we got to flip ourselves negative one Okay now what's the other thing going on here I think it'd probably be useful to add a little bit of damping to make it feel a little realistic right a pendulum is going to be a lot lost in the kind of in the in the in the movement of the arm in air resistance so one thing I'm just going to do to like make it look a little nicer is multiply the velocity by like 99 each time 0 99 so the velocity reduces by one 1% so a pendulum doesn't swing forever it's going to kind of slow down and eventually come to rest and now if we run this hey that's pretty good it's swinging so we have our swinging pendulum wow it was as easy as that right if we know where the origin is and we know the angle we know the length we can calculate where the Bob is and if we understand that the angular acceleration of the pendulum is equal to the force of gravity times sign of that angle and we were able to derive that formula of the diagram then we can just put that right here in our code and we're good to go now so this was a little example of just kind of like whipping it together and draw and I guess actually I want to make a point here which is that um and this is certainly how I work although there's lots of different ways of working and farbe it for me to suggest that this is the best by any means but as you can see we didn't get ourselves kind of lost in objectoriented programming right now we just kind of have this main sketch and this main program we kind of set up and draw we knew we need a bunch of variables we're kind of working out we have the pendulum working now I'm not going to in this video take the next 10 minutes to move everything into an object and build that object I kind of have that preset for you but this is you know this is often a good way to work kind of work out your you know work out everything in just kind of a raw and a messy way in in the main Tab and then once you've got the functionality refactor and build it into a class and so what I'm just going to show you now is if you're following along there is an example in oh I don't want to um I don't want the app store right now um there is this particular example which we can see has a pendulum object the pendulum object the Constructor takes two things it's where is the origin and how long is the arm and then you can see in draw all we're doing is saying P.O run all your simulation stuff we've actually added a few features in this example you can click on the pendulum and move it um so this is kind of a uh you know this is just the objectoriented version but you can see that everything that we worked out is all right here in the update function so in the update function we have a constant for Gravity we have the formula for angular acceleration angular acceleration goes into the velocity the velocity is dampened then the velocity then angle changes by the velocity so everything we worked out is here now in the pendulum's update function the one thing I should say is there's one extra thing which is that we divided by R the angular acceleration is affected by how long that arm is and this makes the the pendulum feel a bit more realistic I'll include some links to other physics discussions of pendulums but you can see that now if I make the pendulum arm really short it kind of swings much faster than if I made the pendulum arm really long and if I grab it you can see I let it swing there's a much sort of slower uh acceleration there because the short of the if we're the the acceleration is inversely proportional to the length of the arm so that's one little addition to this example that makes the pendulum feel a bit more realistic so um I'll give you a couple I have a couple EXC ideas which literally just occurred to me now well one of them occurred to me now and the other I guess I had already thought of but um hold on I just I don't know why I feel the need to put this back to where it was 175 um but there's a couple things so one thing you might try to do is if you remember I think in the first oscillation video uh we we looked at uh this uh other video there was a video in a video and it was very um what's that movie I don't know why I'm trying leca and it has nothing to do with anything edit cut okay and we're back and I didn't just talk about that but I did cuz no one's editing this um uh you know where there's levels of Dreams oh my God just stop go to the next video okay the exercise here's an exercise um try to create a whole bunch of pendulums in a row all across the top of a sketch perhaps start them all at slightly different offsets from each other I don't know give them all slightly different arm lengths give them all slightly different starting angles there's lots of ways you could create some type of really interesting um kind of multiple oscill pattern by doing that another thing you could do is put two pendulums together right uh what if the end of one pendulum is the beginning of another and so on and so forth now here's the thing this is what's called a double pendulum and simulating a double pendulum involves all sorts of uncomfortable and math that I don't even I don't even I mean I'm going to pull up that web page and I'm going to have to go sit down for a while and drink I don't some orange juice or something because I get a little woozy but um so you could look into sort of real double pendulum simulation and you'll find pages on Wikipedia and wolf from math world and all that sort of stuff but one thing you could do just as kind of a little experiment is see what happens if just you use the fact that this pendulum has a bob P vector and this pendulum has an origin P Vector what if you make those values always the same so at least they're sort of connected not they won't be connected in the physics way but they will be connected just in the fact that the code always sets those locations equal what types of effects could you get through that so um so those are some some ideas that you might try with this pendulum stuff and someday I'm going to go and make answers to all these exercises that I keep saying um and if you really want one if you send me an email it'll sort of push me to do that at least for this one and I'll put them in some open source repository for everyone to see okay so that I think this wasn't so bad I was a little anxious about this pendulum stuff but I think we did okay there's some improvements here um but in the next video we're going to look at Springs which is just another case study right we're going to say hey pendulums hey Springs these are two examples you know we don't need pendulums and springs in all of our sketches but these are two examples of kind of working out a physics system understanding the math behind it and making it go okay I need to find a button to shut this off now
