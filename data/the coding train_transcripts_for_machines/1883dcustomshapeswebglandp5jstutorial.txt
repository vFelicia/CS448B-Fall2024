okay I've got another webgl in p5 video for you and in this one instead of drawing oh I erased everything on the whiteboard it's fine I don't need to go over there in my list instead of drawing a primitive shaped like a cube a sphere a torus a cone etc I am gonna make my own shape with begin shape and end shape so let's look at how that works so this has a box with a kitten as the texture when I'm done I want to see just a custom shape also with the kitten as a texture let's see if we can make this work okay so let's take out the box let's take out the texture just for now and let's say normal material hopefully this is gonna work now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say begin shape and end shape and I have another video tutorial just about how begin shape and shape and vertex works and you can go refer to that one once you're into the 3d world there's a lot of possibilities we could tile with triangle strips and do all sorts of different things but I'm gonna just make a single shape that has that has vertices and it's like a basically like a quad I'm gonna make a quad so I'm gonna say vertex just to start 00 vertex 100 comma zero vertex 100 comma 100 vertex zero comma 100 and I think an important thing that I need to path here is close so what am i doing I have 0 0 100 comma 0 100 comma 100 zero comma 100 so I this is my path and all of a sudden out the clothes parameter in end shape makes the last vertex connect to the first vertex ok so let's see this is the equivalent of doing plane right this is like doing plane but I'm doing it with begin shape and edge shape alright I don't see anything let's try fill there we go oh so normal material didn't work but that's fine Phil works can I get ambient material to work no so those seem like they might be bugs right now I'll have to investigate those who come back in this video or write something in the description but I really wanted to show you something about texturing and first of all let me just put Phil back the thing that I want to show you that's important is once I have these custom vertices I can start to really do weird things like for example what if this last vertex over here you know was a little bit more to the right I now have this kind of quad that's not a standard square and also like maybe I want to it's a sort of like Center itself so right now I could say just really quickly I mean I could redo all these vertices but I'm just gonna translate by like negative 50 comma zero and so now I kind of have this quad moving around at the center a bit more so let me put this back and we can see this is just like plain negative 50 I'm sorry negative 50 comma negative 50 it should be okay so now this is just like plain now what I want to do is texture this geometry so what's interesting about this is let's just say I add right now texture oops I'm gonna take texture kitten instead of film interesting website I don't see it why now something's happening but I don't see the kitten why not so this is what's really interesting about working with textures and custom shapes a vertex is defined by its X Y point or really in this case X Y Z that's what this is this is really zero zero zero 100 zero zero right I just sort of ignoring the Z but I probably put that in there if I want to take image data like a JPEG or a PNG or whatever and basically place that image data inside of that polygon the thing that I'm defining I need to say hey zero zero goes with what pixel this pixel 100/0 goes with what pixel this pixel now this would be kind of like a literal mapping of saying like this image gets mapped exactly onto it but what you see about this is you can start to do a lot of different things I will also refer you to a video about a flag simulation that I also have that does the same exact thing but with a more complex geometry so for the vertex function instead of just X Y Z I can also have you V the U and V coordinates are the pixel mappings on the image and I believe in p5 by default these are normalized so there are different ways this can be done but what I mean by normalized is this is actually 0 0 this is 1 0 this is 1 1 and this is 0 comma 1 even if this is a 640 by 480 image so basically so let's look at how that works and let's start adding those UV coordinates in so I think this should be so let me add the 0 in because I have a feeling it might not it's probably gonna figure it out properly without the 0 so I'm going to now say this is 0 0 this is 1 comma 0 this is 1 comma 1 UV and this is 0 comma 1 so let's try that there we go there's the cat on our custom shape now it's so dark let's just pump up the ambient light here all right so I just wanted to add ambient more ambient so we could see it now here's the thing that's interesting these mapping you now have a lot of creative possibilities like for example what if I just took out this point right what if I put this what if I need this a triangle and kind of move this point to 50 comma 50 so let's try that so this lap this vertex is actually going to be 50 comma 50 and we should see look and you can see how it's sort of trying to figure out best as it can how to kind of squish the kitten in and probably in this case just this rotation stuff is more trouble than it's worth you can see this is what it's done how its decided to try to smush the kitten into that geometry and this of course could move like I could say Mouse X Mouse Y which is going to produce a really weird results but you can see this is me kind of like stretching so you could imagine you could have an algorithm that's changing the geometry I could have many many more points there's so many possibilities here another thing that I might that I'd love to show that I think's worth showing is what if I reverse so take a look at this kitten see that kitten it's looking that direction what if I flip the pixels and say this pixel should go with 1 comma 0 and this should go with 0 comma 0 this should go 0 comma 1 and this should go with 1 comma 1 now the kittens looking the other direction what if I didn't flip the bottom I'm good no kittens will be harmed turning this like that's something weird crazy happen because the top was flipped and had to like twist it to get the bottom so and these can be variables right this could be these could be variables that are changing and oscillating I could you know if I go all the way back whoops let me get that let me get our kitten back there I could do something like I actually only want to see the top half of the kitten so the why are both 0.5 now that's the top half stretched into this stretch into the shape so there's a lot of I'm really just scratching the surface here but as you start to make your own shapes you can texture them and assign different pixels of different images and different parts of an image to different vertices of that sounds of that shape alright so hopefully this was helpful hold on my cap wait ready yeah you know there's still again after the time of this recording there seem to be some bugs with how custom shapes work in p5 WebGL hopefully any of you watching like decide to file a bug or look into fixing a bug in a friendly and supportive way and hopefully and and please tag me at Schiffman on github if you post an issue related to this video or of course you can also ask at forum processing org in the p5.js category if you have kind of questions about how this stuff works so thank you very much and I look forward to seeing your custom geometry with textures in p5 GS
