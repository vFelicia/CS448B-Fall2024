oh hello part three of pleating the data supposedly oh it's a lot of work just dealing with data is a whole project unto itself it's I've been here for like 72 hours straight I haven't even looked at tension flow yes I'm just looking at my digna and all I'm doing is color classification all right I kid I kid a little bit but it's true it's true so this is the third video I what I if you if you watched the previous two I started trying to visualize what the data looked like and kind of examine are there certain users that I should filter out that's bad data maybe I should just leave it all in there anyway I'm trying to build a model that looks at the color and classifies it into one of these buckets and this is my crowdsourced system that allows people to look at colors and click on one of these bucket so that's a little bit about like human perception what does the I sort of see in terms of RGB color alright so the code base that I'm starting with is from the previous video I'm just connecting to the firebase database and I am looping through and looking at each record one at a time each record has a user ID which is anonymous it has an R a G a B and a label so I determined you know not somewhat loosely I didn't you know I really need to spend more time and more thoughtful about this there's extra comma here that these are the three users that I would like to filter out so what I want to do in this video by the end of it let's have a JSON file that I can print if I wanted to I'm not going to print it hold in my virtual hands these are my real hands and use that to actually build a machine learning model from so all I need to do if I want to filter these out this is what I did is I made an object that just has those three user IDs as keys arbitrarily with a value of true and then what I can do is I could say if ret if if filter if filter does not include this records user ID and so let's just say let ID equal record user if it's not in the filter let's make a let's say all data is a big array and actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to make it an object you'll see why in a second that has a I'm just gonna call it like entries which is an array then I'm going to say all data dot entries dot push that record so what I want to do is I want to look at every single data point chen i'm begin there's some nice higherorder function i could do this in one line of code but i'm doing this very manually i'm gonna look at every record I'm gonna check the user ID if as long as that is it one of my user IDs that I'm filtering out I'm gonna put it in my all data dot entries array and then I'm going to say save JSON color data JSON all data now this is a p5 function that will then put this JSON file into my downloads directory and I could be doing this a node in the server side there's no reason we have clientside code doing this but that's what I'm doing right now so let's run this and see what happens this is my download data script okay a index up is not a function firebase huh I don't know save JSON okay so this may be let's look at maybe it's actually goes like this the data and then the file name I think that's what it's yes there we go so we can see right here this is downloaded now I can take a look at this file I can open that file up and we can see there we go here is my data set hi this was the surest video ever so now I have this data set do I wanna sew things that I need to do is I need to normalize the data set and I need to assign the labels numeric values because I'm going to need that for what I want to do with tensorflow j/s mmhmm so I mean I think I'm gonna to reshape the data and turn it into tensors I'll do that in the next video as well just keep sequencing this so you know maybe you could be more thoughtful about I don't know what I'm trying to give you an exercise to do at the end of this video I got nothing for you but you could build an interface for this where you could maybe you could port this to like a serverside script maybe you could save it to a CSV file those are some things you could try but in the next video we're going to do I'm gonna actually start working with tensorflow gjs I need to turn all of these things into tensors because tensors are the thing that I need to to create to train my machine learning model goodbye
