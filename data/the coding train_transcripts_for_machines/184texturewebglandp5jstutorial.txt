hello in this video about WebGL in p5 I'm going to attempt to explain something and implement something and that is adding a texture to some geometry so I'm kind of checking off this list and by the way a couple things that I've now realized I've missed is I've only shown you in terms of geometry primitives and there are some other ways right in theory I think this might be at the time of recording this video a little bit buggy because I've been doing some experiment with it there's no reason why I couldn't use begin shape and end shape to create custom geometry right to create my own algorithmic 3d shape in WebGL so that's certainly something that should be on the horizon for p5 and in addition to that I could also use a function called load model so if anyone wants to make like a nice model of a train or something send it to me maybe I'll make a video that loads up and I think typically there's probably a bunch of different file formats of 3d models but certainly one that I believe works with p5 as an obj so if you're making a 3d model and some other 3d authoring software and export it as an obj file you could import so but what I want to focus on here is texturing and what texturing is is instead of simply having a material this sort of that is just a color or an or a certain kind of reflective continuous surface that you can actually take an image something that you loaded it could be a live video recorded video or a static image and wrap that image around the particulars shape whether it's a sphere a torus a box of playing etc so I want to look at that texturing an image so let's go look at how we do that and to simplify things let me actually first start off by just making a plane so I'm actually gonna make a plane a plane is a geometry that's just a flat plane and I could give it a width and a height so I'm gonna just say 200 200 to make a square plane so you can see here's mine this is very similar just drawing rectangle but the fact that I'm using plane one of the 3d geometry primitives means I could actually texture this right now and you can see it's responding to the light the light is still on the scene so I'm gonna leave the light in the scene for right now take that off so now I also happen to have a directory of images I don't know anybody have a favorite kitten they want to see right now I think let's just go with kitten zero cute kitten zero okay kid zero is going to be our texture so what I'm going to add now is I'm gonna add preload preload is a function in p5 that allows you to load data assets media assets other things that are ready before set up and draw happen so I'm gonna make a variable called kitten and then in preload emits a kitten equals load image and I had a directory called kittens and I had a file called kitten not zero dot jpg kitten zero dot jpg and now what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna comment out the material and I'm just going to say texture kitten and the magic will happen we're gonna see our kitten Oh interesting so the kitten is like so in just look at the image itself is responding to the light so one thing I want to do right now just to simplify things because I don't want to worry too much about light is I'm just going to create ambient white light and take out this directional light that I worked on in the previous video just to simplify things and so now we can see there's our kitten oh it's spinning off as like in the end of Superman 3 which is a movie that I seem to reference way too often in my videos General Zod the kitten okay um so what else can we do let's just try some other shapes why not let's try box now we have Owen let's make the Box a little smaller now we have that kitten image on all sides of the box let's try sphere now we have to say now here we're seeing something that's now having so p5 and the WebGL render is making a decision it's like well here's an image here's some geometry this is my best guess as to how you intended to wrap that image around the geometry and in this case if I wanted to you make this appear like a planetary surface for example I would I would get actually us Oracle polarized image of like a texture map or something so there's a lot of work in terms of how you might want to design images that work well in certain contexts but we can see that that just works I'm just just seeing all that I'm just here for all the shapes Taurus so you can see there's the kitten wrapped around the Taurus and we can stop this now so I'm gonna go back to box o and you can see here even with different dimensions it's it's doing different things to the Kin so I'm gonna go back to box 100 and there we go so now I want to look at some other what's interesting about this is there's no reason why we can't use a video source so if if you look under a create video or create capture let's try to use create capture so I'm gonna say and setup I'm gonna say let cam for camera cam equals create capture I'm gonna say 200 200 oh wait no sorry I don't give it a size video I think that's how I do it create capture video let's just see what happens here okay so we should see up there I am so this is the capture element it's a separate Dom element that's taking the live webcam feed you can now see my secret green screen here okay it's right back I forgot that I was making a video tutorial it went off in my own world all right so a couple things one is let me just make that a little smaller just so we can kind of see it there but not have it overall in the screen and then now what I want to do is can I make this video a texture on the box so I don't see any reason why I couldn't just change this from kitten to cam there I am oh oh I could do my Superman 3 thing now you please just humor me just humor me turn off the video good something else I'm gonna do this my own personal enjoyment alright never mind okay moving on so you get the idea I can take and by the way if I if I wanted this to appear less I don't know what I want this to appear like but I can use ab cam hide in which case I could actually only see the video texture on the box so this is a way you can take any image like a live video and texture and I could change that to a sphere or a torus I do want to again at some point look at how I can start to assign image textures to custom drawn shapes with begin shape and end shape so I need to approach that in a separate video and just look at loading models and custom shapes so somebody remind me if that video doesn't exist in this playlist to do that otherwise you're gonna see it it's a point in a few videos from now alright I'm back at the end of this video I'm not sure exactly why but two questions came up in the chat one is how do lights affect texture and two how what about shadowing so just out of curiosity let me try putting a plane at the bottom so what I'm gonna do just to show you a little more sort of 3d stuff I'm gonna say with this spinning cube I'm gonna put a push before and a pop after so that the rotate does not affect anything that comes after and then I'm gonna add this plane so we should see here oops there I am the click but I want that plane now to look as if it's a floor maybe so what I want to do is translate maybe all the way down to the bottom and then rotate if I want to take this plane and rotate it like this to be flat I want to say this is the xaxis so I want to rotate X and rotate it basically 90 degrees which is a half pie let's try that so you can see there it is and I don't want what I want to do also is maybe only translate it a hundred down make the plane like really really big and maybe I want to give that a ambient material so it doesn't have a texture of white is that gonna override the texture whoa bugginess okay great so we can see now that there's like this floor making it white made it a little confusing but let's let's make the background let's make it it's fine so what I want to do is let me try to add some light there's an ambient white light right now let's take out that ambient light and you can see the floor it's not buggy it just takes a little while for the video to start the floor is now black but it does have an ambient material of white so let's try adding this directional light so I this is a directional light that I did in the previous video which just shines a light from far away at a given direction based on the mouse and I'm gonna make let's make that light white just too and I'm gonna just give it I might be able to give it just 255 but I'm gonna give it all three let's give that a look so you can see now look that light is shining and it's only able to see the sides of the cube where the light is and you can see there's a little going on based on the light now the thing is the shadowing I probably have to be more thoughtful about the position these objects in order to get the shadowing to work in a way where I might actually see so I'm gonna leave it to you as an exercise to try seeing what you can do with point lights and ambient lights and different shapes to see if you can get shadowing but you can see sort of the stuff that you've got to play with here and in terms of having a light that's shining into the scene with different shapes with different materials and different textures okay thanks for watching you
