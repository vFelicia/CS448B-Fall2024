Hello, in this video, if you're choosing to kind of follow this Programming from A to Z playlist as a course that you're doing over some period of time I'm going to talk you through homework assignment or exercise that I think would be useful to do before you move on to the next set of videos And if you're interested in participating in a slack channel where you could share and discuss these assignments please check this video's description for a link to the patreon crowdfunding system that I'm using for that particular slack channel But of course you could just do it and share it with me on twitter or youtube comments I'd love to see the things you guys are making So, here's what I think you should do Number one is I think ok, in the previous coding challenge where I implemented Jackson Mac Low and the Diastic Technique one of the things you could try for this homework assgnment is invent your own constrained writing techniques so, constrained writing is a sort of form of writing base on an algorithm or some set of constraints There's a French collective of writers known as Oulipo who pioneered a bunch of different techniques one of them is known as the "N+7" technique this is a nice website which I'll also include which implements this particular technique in French, it's actually referred to as S+7. And the way that this works the N+7 you look at a body of text you look for every single noun in that text you find the noun for every body of text you look up the noun in the dictionary, find the 7th noun after that one and replace it back into the text and now you have a new text sort of with randomly generated new nouns based on the order of appearance in the dictionary So, you might try one thing you might do is implement one of these algorithms; like make your own N+7 webpage You can see this webpage works very similarly to a lot of the examples that I've demonstrated for you another kind of famous example is, this is one of my examples you can find in the Github repository; this is using William Burrough's Cut Up method which is actually a physical method of cutting up text and folding text and mashing it up you can see that I have a slider which determines how much of the original text to keep you can drag a file in; use a text sample So one thing I'll mention is this frame of reference is a good reference for you to use where it's kind of giving the user a lot options; enter some text, drag a file in, use a preloaded text sample An Erasure machine; Erasure poetry not to be confused with the band Erasure music now it's a technique I'm going to load a text sample right now which is a spam email that I received at one point and you can see I'm using dom manipulation to click on all these words and actually erase them but I could come up with another system like erase every 7th word or erase every verb or erase every word that starts with E So, you know, I can also, btw based on how I'm doing this, keep the spacing, remove the spacing and what types of generative poetry could you create out of the Erasure algorithm So, even though I'm showing these digital versions of it, you might want to wait until next time, after you've watched the regular expression videos to actually implement your interactive web based version of it as a constraint on yourself, invent your own algorithm to do by hand Get a newspaper, get a magazine, get a book, invent your algorithm, write the instructions for the algorithm and execute those instructions and get your new text and then present those instructions and present those results on a webpage so think about one of the things I'm asking people to think about is how to have a selfdocumented webpage so instead of just presenting the result and then having a blogpost that explains it could you have a webpage that has the instructions has the results kind of documents itself and some of you might consider using Github to host it So get yourself set up Figure out Github pages Get yourself an account Reviewation of CSS for yourself Think about creative constraint writing techniques and generate the content and release it online So, give that a try, and share it with me however it is that you may find it useful to share and and I encourage you to, if you want to ask questions or discuss your work with me or a group of peers consider joining the patreon slack channel as well if you are watching so far and I'll be back in the next set of videos they might be there by now if you're watching this much later than I've recorded it but otherwise I'll be back by about a week from now Enjoy, and I'll see you some time soon! *raises arms in excitement* *continues dancing* thanks for watching! *still dancing* *ding*
