Kotick trained livestream from New York City now just want to mention that in a couple minutes I have a very special surprise guest so don't go anywhere if you were going to go anywhere but even before that I'm going to premiere for you the new channel trailer good music video coding train theme song thing I'm gonna premiere that for you right now I'm kind of just checking to make sure that people are hearing and seeing me you will see that for about a minute and then I'm gonna get started with today's coding train livestreamed thing that I'm doing okay here we go station creation you alright thanks for watching that I it had been a long time since a Lisa like 50 to 100 people in a row have written cringe into the chat so I felt like I needed to have that video from you in order for that to happen that video will soon be available for you to watch as many times as you want as soon as I make it public so you might be wondering what it is you're watching this is the coding train it is a livestream that happens usually every week every Friday my name is Dan Schiffman I think that's the correct pronunciation last name and I'm not entirely sure what I'm going to do today I have a few ideas of things that I want to catch up on and code mostly a pretty beginner friendly stuff I know I've been getting this a lot I started a few JavaScript machine learning tutorials I didn't get very far with it I had this bicycle accident and I've been getting just about every new video that I publish and in the chat I've been seeing people write when are you gonna do what are you gonna do the machine learning again what are you gonna do she learn again what do you do she learn again I will at some point try to get to that but I have a special surprise because I am NOT a machine learning expert but I have a machine learning expert that you may or may not recognize right here in the studio today to answer some questions and maybe show some stuff and just as like a fun let's experiment with having a live guest so I'm gonna do weirdly is I'm gonna take this microphone off because I I'm I only have one microphone and I'm going to present my surprise special guests right now a world it's ROG there's no life in you I'm going what I'm gonna do map chen it's it's probably also i'm old so you know a yes definitely snapchat somewhere but this is like a takeover and time to let Suraj talk and what I'm gonna operate least and here because I can look at the end I'm gonna monitor the chat and I will pull interesting questions from the chat and if you want to show anything or talk about anything there's a computer here there's a computer perfect so I have the computer access I've got I've got you guys and I've got about a bunch of stuff so let me just answer some questions so if anybody has any questions just put them in the chat I'll I'll answer them they could be about machine learning anything machine learning and of course personal as well but I so one thing I'm saying is a couple people in the chair saying oh I don't know Suraj okay so even though I think Oh everybody must watch Suraj's youtube channel yeah you don't I guess so why don't you can you take a minute just to introduce yourself maybe pull up your YouTube let me pull up my youtube channel okay the little selfpromotion here let's see okay straight to them not to the music video this is just go to the channel okay we're sure I can add by I'm gonna have dissolved okay okay guys so I talked about artificial intelligence on YouTube I'm like dan and I are very complementary he does the more JavaScript and I do Python but we can switch back and forth basically I talked about AI that's my thing I've talked about AI and ways that you can use it for recommender systems classifiers data generators anomaly detectors anything that you could learn from data from using AI that's what I talked about so this is my channel check it out if and you'll probably like it as well if you like Dan's channel we do a lot of similar stuff so that's me that's who I am and I'm just visiting New York because I'm talking with the United Nations and came to collab with Dan as well so now I'm going to answer some questions as well and first of all some people are saying that mic volume is too low so I'm gonna you don't okay do I have ability to move it up a little higher yes okay how can you use LS PMS to classify data that is a great question what so first of all what is an LS TM grapes also question LST ms r it stands for long shortterm memory networks so LS an LST M is a type of neural network right and neural networks are the the foundation behind Yai is so popular these days there's so many different types of neural networks it's there's a there's a zoo of neural networks in fact there's a literal zoo that we can look at here and the zoo just shows a diagram check it out of all the different types of neural networks there are feedforward networks as you can see here there are recurrent networks there are long short term memory networks there are all sorts of networks out there there are even lesserknown networks like hopfield networks and Boltzmann machines so if you're getting into AI for the first time you might be asking should I stalk about should I learn about deep learning deep learning first or schuyler and machine learning for first and the answer is the answer is you should focus on deep learning first because almost 95 or 99% of the time neural networks will outperform any other machine learning model almost all the time so once you get really good at deep neural networks then you can focus on the other machine learning models like support vector machines and linear regression linear regression and stuff like that but you can do all that stuff with neural networks they're an incredible technology so deep learning is like a sub category of machine learning or does that so and would you say that everything that's deep learning is also machine learning no no so it's a oneway is yeah it's a oneway relationship but she learning is just a the collection of all learning algorithms that you can use to gain insights from data so all and so deep learning is taking one of those models called a neural network and giving it two things giving it rocket fuel and a and a rocket engine what do I mean the rocket fuel is a data and the rocket engine gpus so if you give it a lot of computing power and a lot of data on neural network will help you find insights you didn't even dream could be possible and you can do this with a bunch of cloud platforms not everybody has access to amazing GPUs but Google Cloud is obviously a great solution for this you've got Microsoft Azure but to be honest I I don't like Microsoft if you're if you're a Microsoft person watching this it's ok you know what I found out that Microsoft has the biggest contribution to open source out of all of the big tech companies so that's pretty cool I will say I just Windows XP and Vista just left a scar on my heart that hasn't gone away anyway and court oh ok yeah I guess back in the day I was pretty young but yeah anyway here's a good I know if you were still going to work go for it go for the one question I think is good so if you want to get into AI deep learning what kind of math knowledge do you need and do you need to like go and learn math first and then you can get into or can you kind of learn at the same time it's a great question not what else like you know the end for sure I think I'm trying to one of the things that I'm trying to do on this channel I just mentioned so if you're interested in deep learning machine learning you should really just go check out Suraj's channel especially if you want to see all the latest frameworks and work with pipes on one of the things that i would like to try to do in this channel to complement what Siraj is doing is make some really beginner friendly AI machine learning tutorials that you can kind of do quick in almost toilet experiments in the browser with javascript so anyway that aside so I'm kind of curious trying to figure that out of it but what do you really need to know can you just get through through this stuff without knowing this so that's yeah so I I had this problem too right like if you look at a lot of these machine learning courses all you see are equations right like mostly equations and as programmers we don't actually deal with equations whenever we're building anything right we're dealing with code and sometimes we'll deal with some basic operations like add or subtract but we're not computing derivatives right so you might be thinking yeah should I just go and learn all of calculus and all of it no the answer is no these subjects calculus linear algebra these are massive subjects right and there are so many parts of these subjects that are irrelevant to deep learning there are only very specific parts of calculates and very specific parts of probability theory and of linear algebra that you need to know to do deep learning so you need a condensed version of these subjects and the best resource besides my channel obviously to look at this and this is kind of where I learned from I kind of gleaned my knowledge mostly from this book which is free it's online you can look at it in your browser and it's called the deep learning book and the authors of these books are first are Ian Goodfellow who invented generative adversarial networks probably the hottest idea in all of deep learning and yoshua bengio who's one of the godfathers of deep learning so definitely check out this book it's it's got like entire chapters dedicated to subjects that would otherwise be an entire textbook in and of themselves like so in Chapter two you'll learn about all the linear algebra you need for deep learning so super cool right and so it starts off by saying linear algebra is a branch of mathematics use for this right and then you'll talk and then it talks it's so cool it talks about exactly the topics you need you need scalars you need vectors you need matrices these are all you need tensors these are all basically the same types of things just sets of numbers but it's our way of ordering these numbers together right because that's what deep learning is it's taking sets of numbers matrices and continuously applying operations to these matrices for every layer and these are and that's why you need two linear algebra because you can't just multiply a set of numbers you have to compute the dot product it's basically multiplication but for a set of numbers it's our linear algebra is algebra but four sets of numbers right so four groups of numbers and yeah you only need parts of linear algebra check out the book yeah that's my answer to the question so another question I think it'll be useful is we taught you talked a little bit just now about okay well there's machine learning it's this broader field of research deep learning being one aspect of that neural networks out of it and giving it the rocket fuel so to speak yes what is AI how does that honey thing art what is art the top of artificial intelligence how does that differentiate that term and how does that what's the difference between AI versus machine learning versus deep learning for sure so okay so yeah there's a lot of confusion in this field and if you look at any of these articles by these popular tech magazines like wired or TechCrunch let me just look at one so one of them is like you know just like Facebook invents language or some things like Facebook and AI invented its own language right and so if you look at these articles you look at them and you say okay what's the topic here Facebook AI creates its own language and creepy preview of our potential future immediately show a picture of Stephen Hawking who is completely unrelated to what Facebook's AI did so let's just look at one more and I haven't looked at these articles before but let's just look at a single no it's a good call Facebook AI agents creating their own language is more normal than people think researchers say okay so this is actually a good this is a this is a smarter article but basically these articles take advantage of these terms that people don't know about and just kind of blow them out of proportion so I'm here to just tell you this AI is kind of like the biggest term right AI encompasses everything right artificial intelligence in some ways you can even say what Dan is doing in terms of creative coding processing that's AI it's just intelligence right intelligence is just is we are intelligent right it's the ability to learn okay how can we learn right and so if software is our way of automating this learning process taking a bit of it it's a bit of what we can do and automating it so it doesn't need a human behind it traffic lights can be considered AI right it's just yes no on/off but in the end AI is just the really big buzz word and what we really want is artificial general intelligence that is an AI that can do everything but the way that we have found the best way the best medium of making AI reality is using machine learning technologies and the most specific topic we can talk about all these machine learning all these are deep learning and so that's why deep learning is one of those hot words in the past in the past five years because only now have we started to get the computing power and the data we need to make these a neural networks perform incredible things so in order deep learning is the subset of machine learning and then AI is the biggest circle around all those things and AI in general is the ability to learn some would even say it's heuristics any kind of statistical model it doesn't have to learn necessarily but any kind of intelligent algorithm yes we could probably keep going forever forever yeah yeah one more quick thing I just I've been learning about brain computer interfaces recently and there's this really cool there's this really cool hardware device called the Emotiv that it's I think it's the easiest for developers to get started on I know there's also open BCI but there so there's a there's a hardware cost to building it but Emotiv is really just out of the box the SDK is really really easy to use and you can use this technology basically you put it on your head and you can control robots with your mind you can lift up objects like 3d objects in a simulation with your minds so think of the force from Star Wars and I think the reason I'm mentioning that is because I think there's a lot of potential to apply machine learning to these technologies and it's one of those things that no one has really done yet so there's a lot of potential for a cool side project if you wanted to do that maybe combine that with some cool visualizations using p5 but yeah that's more or less it I'm releasing a video on this stuff later today so that's why it's on my mind that was my next question so you were you're usually you I know you release videos Friday around what time around 500 p.m. PST so you really go downstairs and work on releasing a video right now yes exactly and what can you give us at ease I guess the tease this is the tease but Elon Musk's neural link and Brian Johnston Johnson's kernel and then Facebook's brain typing thing I just I'm gonna talk about what this really is and it's one of those really risky videos to make but let's just do this so well I won't get to watch it right when you release it but I'm definitely gonna watch it as soon as my live streams Oh perfect I look for that I'm gonna so I everybody stayed stayed there and put up some waiting music I'm gonna boot the microphone for a second and help Siraj finds his way out into the hallway you can come out of the corner somebody knocked on the door if we just like open the door we're like okay look who it is but bump do that next time yeah next time for sure okay so I'm just gonna hit you here and we're gonna go that way they'll be right back all right that was fun I've never had like I'm a guest before but never on a Friday and never another youtuber it's funny like I saw Suraj when I think we haven't met before but it came by and I was like hold on hold on hold on let me get the sound good mica mica microphone swing you around sorry sorry sorry hold on hold on everybody tangled this up can you not hear anything at all okay how is this okay how is this mic is good you can hear me okay patron slack group okay there's just random sadder than making it anyway I saw sir I said oh you're that guy watch on YouTube and I was kind of excited and then that people say that to me and I think don't be ridiculous but then I had that feeling when I saw him so I guess that's what happens Suraj is great it was really fun to meet him in person super nice funny charming and I hope that we'll get to do I would like to do more collaborations in general with people and I hope that I will get a chance to do more okay I'm going to Oh Alka and the chat is asking what bitrate are you set to because the but so one thing I want to say if you can if you can humor me for a little bit this is the first time I'm using let me close these windows here this is the first time that I'm using open broadcast studio instead of Wirecast the good news is remember how every week my stream starts to my stream crash crashes and after restarted all the time that shouldn't happen open broadcast studio seems to be working really well it has some good features I'm able to switch between shots really easily that's the whiteboard shot which the cameras off the downside is there might be some things that I don't that are different or that aren't working or a lighting wise so please let me know if okay so so what I'm gonna check because Alka is asking is settings output bitrate is 2500 so hopefully that's okay but Phileas fine I am willing to make changes to it if there's something really extremely off I would make changes to it right now but if it's just like more like feedback for next time please just let me know so a couple things I'll mention if you would like to support the work that I'm doing and join our patron group in the slack channel you can go to patreon.com/scishow to you you could get Cody trade merchandise I don't why I mention these things the links are all in the video's description oh yes so are you seeing like twinkle EES twinkling there's an issue with let me see if I can fix this there's oh yeah I have a bad HDMI cable and then odd the audio is out of sync let's see how bad it is because I actually adjusted and added a delay okay let me clap how bad is that audio sync so Alka I don't think that I could probably change the bitrate without stopping and restarting the stream which I'm loathe to do unless there's a serious problem so I will just investigate changing it to like 5k or something like that next time people are saying the audio is synced well a little off a little off is no big deal okay alright so I'm a little bit disorganized because I actually had a nice whole hour to get ready and plan what I was going to do and then Suraj came by and I was like lost all of my time but because I was having a fascinating interesting conversation about YouTube and machine learning and coding so I am going to well actually let me use the computer here let's I want to make a list of things that are on my mind to do today so things that I would like to do oh I forgot to have Suraj read the random numbers Suraj if you're watching you come back upstairs and knock on the door but I was thinking oh if I ever have guests they have to read the random numbers that's like a thing okay so some things that I want to do I want to talk about custom shapes so one I have two ways that I decide three ways really that I decide what to do in a live stream one is that people make suggestions to the rainbow topics github repository and your so many please post the link to that in the chat and you're welcome to do that number two is I take suggestions Oh Alka thing I can change the bitrate at any time okay I'm gonna do that in a second number two is I take suggestions from the patrons people have joined via patreon.com and from the slack channel that we discuss during the week what topics would be interesting you know I don't know patrons could keep me honest here do I really listen I don't know if I'd really do a good job of listening to the suggestions but I try to and then third and this is unfortunately the most the main reason why I pick certain topics is that I am teaching courses at a program called ITP it's here at New York University and there are supplemental things that come up in class or questions or things that I'm teaching about and I like to attempt to make videos about stuff that's relevant to what I'm already teaching this week so in that sense I'm teaching a beginner programming class and custom shapes using vertex and curve vertex has been a confusing topic this week I want to talk about let and var and also Const es6 that's something I might want to do a simple harmonic motion sign motto motion sine cosine I also was thinking about ten print oh and then data and api's is in one of my courses too so I was thinking about the Wikipedia API and also maybe like wind data there's been a lot of hurricanes and there's a lot of research going on in discussion about climate change and so maybe projects that around that topic learning how to get wind data from maybe like open weather map could be relevant and then of course continue matrix math series so anything else that came up time is up so so Simon it did suggest write inverting flipping a number I the reason why I asked you Simon about the bouncing ball speed thing is I think I have a video already that does that inversion but I do agree that that is a useful topic as well thank you for that suggestion I'm sorry for forgetting it so I'm looking at the chat now I feel a little bad I think neural networks is turning into the Chrome extension thing which like I say I'm gonna do it but I never get to it clap yes so Austin is suggesting classes getters and setters this I'm planning to do next week it just hasn't come up yet in the class and I want to I want to get to that next week so that's not on my list for next week I also want to look at in the future es6 promises there's another thing from es6 like some es6 maybe some of the array functions and then at some point this like es6 Arum the arrow arrow notation is that what you call it this thing so I want to look at all of those things as well oh the name yeah 10 print the Topher in the chat says 10 print the name reminds me of my first ever program I wrote in second grade oh I forgot the book I need my prop I might have to run downstairs to get the book today it's probably gonna be mostly oh yeah deep space is suggesting to strawpoll except everyone's gonna do that matrix math series which I might not want to do first and I feel kind of committed to the first two alright so while actually let's the strawpoll thing is kind of fun so let me let's go to strawpoll because I have some other things I wanted to talk about so why not I'm just curious I'm not necessarily coding Train can i paste into here no we'll have to do it one at a time vertex curve vertex simple harmonic motion 10 print Wikipedia API win wind data from open weather map what else inverting flipping number I'm not so sure as I'm I really like this suggestion I feel terrible that I'm like nah it keeps like by accident not including it but I also I don't have it in my head exactly maybe what you should make a video on it for me and then that'll help me understand what it is but I will put that in the list and then what did I miss lettin var ups and then the problem I was talking about this with Suraj I don't feel very confident with the machine learning neural network and matrix math stuff it's one of the things that I feel like I really need to like spend the day reading about before I come to the live stream so that's why I kind but I'm gonna put it on this because I'm just gonna see what happens here what would you have to do a run off let me create this poll so this is the URL for the poll somebody who has privileges BFD gh7 th and now while while people are voting there I'm gonna talk about one of the things that's been requested a lot I'm really excited to talk to you about this today is community projects what does it mean for people watching videos on YouTube learning about code to collaborate together on a project so I have two community projects and I also and that I want to talk about so the first one I want to talk about relates to processing day I've mentioned this before processing day is an event that's happening October 21st at the MIT Media Lab it is a day to celebrate the community that develops and mix stuff with processing and p5.js and related things you can see all the people who will be presenting and talking I especially want to encourage you to submit a if you're coming to submit a lightning talk to present a short demo at processing day but one of the things that I've been I am planning to do something live so the thing that I have thought about and thank you to tayon for suggesting this the organizer of crossing Community Day is to make an algorithmic design for name cards so anybody who signed up to attend will get a name card and one of the ideas was to put names in on a cloud so if I go to github.com slash coding train and I maybe I'll do a walkthrough later of this and I go two community clouds and thank you to me I am so me me I am so me is helping me now to maintain a lot of the github and code related stuff for the coding train Channel and me I am so me created this really nice system to submit your cloud idea so the idea is that can take this as your inspiration how would you design a generative cloud in p5.js so ultimately I'm hopefully port the code to processing to generate the SVG files and these are going to be printed with thin black lines so this is not about making a colorful image but rather an algorithmic outline and the names will actually be written in calligraphy so so if you are interested in this take a look at this repository I'm gonna click here on it it this repository controls a github pages site and the what you can do is you can submit your cloud you can either work on somebody else's cloud idea or you can submit one by writing a function in naming it and it will turn up in this menu so me I am so me invented this wonderful system that I'm excited about to use for future collaborative projects and if I just show you really quickly if we look at this code here generators j/s all you need to do is go to this file and write your own function so you can see this function draws a rectangle oh and then look at this it's even so sophisticated that you can then return some values that about where to draw the text but that's an extra fancy feature I love that feature but really you just need to write your own code here write a function you know I you know maybe you want to try using Perlin noise so you write a function called Perlin noise cloud you register it and you register it with a name and the author and then you call this register if you add this register function you submit as a pull request and it will appear as one of the cloud options so everybody maybe I should do a cloud as the coding challenge but that's what I'm going to do it process the community day so so that's one thing I to mention all you need to do is have a github account and hit this edit button now I'm not signed in so saying it must be signed in and of course you know if you're wondering what's get what's github how could I possibly do this you can watch my video tutorials about that topher is asking what and the name is what drives the cloud shape so this is a good question I'm I have to figure it we have to figure this out I think the idea if I'm really thinking about it is just a system that generates a different cloud every time you run the code and the cloud has enough space for somebody to handwrite a name in it so you can think of it as like there's a bunch of hello my name is sticker name tags that have a nice little generative cloud printed on them and you write your name inside the cloud you know it might be something slightly different than that but that's a good way of thinking about what it is I'm asking for people to create and submit so on the one hand this is a collaborative process I'm going to have a community designed cloud but you can also sort of submit your own design and you know obviously if we try to make figure out some appropriate way to give credit to those who have submitted code in the actual cloud design and if I do it as a live tutorial I can maybe give credit during that tutorial so please let me know okay right so this is an interesting idea so well the one hand this idea of generative name tags go that's with it the name could actually you're right it could be the name that informs how the cloud that's a great idea so you should we should try that that's wasn't the original thinking behind the idea of the name tag because we're gonna they're gonna be written in but but that's an interesting idea I love that idea okay so this is probably a terrible idea because I haven't launched a community code project really before so this is really the first one that we're trying to do in a formal way so I probably shouldn't do two of them at the same time but because I did a coding challenge last week about making a clock which I felt was in my mind very successful I really enjoyed seeing everybody's clocks and in fact let's take a moment now to see some clock submissions so last week I did a coding challenge about clocks and I'm gonna go to rainbow code coding challenges and I'm gonna scroll I'm a little bit bigger than I usually am gonna move this over I'm gonna scroll all the way down to the bottom and I'm gonna go to coding challenge 74 o'clock and I am going to look at these clocks now I know there were many more clocks that people made and said to me over on Twitter or via the YouTube YouTube comments so I didn't have time to kind of like try to find some of those and paste them in here so I really encourage you if you want to submit your clock to this list to just do a pull request on this readme file if you don't know how to do that pull requests send me a tweet and hopefully I can help you out but let's look at some of them so this is wall clock so it's uh let's look at wall clock beautiful lovely wall clock very traditional I love this is really interesting these nice quads that are drawn sort of thicker at the the top versus the bottom it has a real like physical quality to it this is really nice thank you for to whomever submitted this wall clock this is Andre uh Douglass digital 7segment clock let's take a look at this uh oh yes open the app no let's come back to it it might take a minute for it to get started let's look at Kline of film Rochin what's the chance I pronounced that of so many that chad is saying that that clock drew friction into the hand movements is that really true let's look back at that clock again and by the way this clock is released through open processing org which is a great website for sharing sketches and sharing code and that sort of thing oh yeah look at that look at that little spring action that is fantastic those little details are really wonderful I love that okay so now let's look at this circle analog clock and oh so one thing that would be helpful maybe is that when you submit it submit a link to it running in the browser so and one of the ways you can do that if it's just a sketch like this in a github repository is to is to make it a github pages site so I don't know if this already is a github pages site if anybody can help me figure out that link I would love to show this one let's see if this one came back alive I guess that cloud 9 thing is done let's look at this binary clock this should be interesting to see oh and this is made with jsfiddle that's kind of cool so maybe I need to make this a little bit wider so it looks to be like what we're seeing is binary notation of the current time the current time is 445 yeah I think that's right my brain cannot compute this easily in real time but I love it it's fantastic wonderful great job thank you to our gym now I'm gonna show dolly this clock whoa what just happened here I clicked on it this is a Dolly's clock which is oh this is beautiful design now this is is this a real am I just unplanned carry gear logic from a plaque processing sketch watch illustration and sketch file so this is great but one of the things that's really nice frizzle this is a beautiful design I love how much like really has this feeling of like a full watch in my webpage and in my whip in the browser a lot of these would be nice chrome extensions right for a new tab Chrome extension to make a new tab and just showed you this beautiful clock design but one of things I love want to point out that Dolly's done which is really wonderful is reference every single thing that helped inspire and inspire her to create this clock so one thing that really encouraged people to do is be really generous with credits in open source so always credit you know code where it came from suit Orioles that you used you know sometimes you know there's actual real questions of IP and plagiarism but I'm not even talking about that I'm just talking about the spirit of generosity and credit is and I you know it's easy to forget and I've been guilty of this many times in the past I try to do my best okay let's look at UPS where are we one more clock Oh Alka this is al cos physics or their more pull requests I don't know if me I am sue me or anyone with privileges as what is watching this right now could vary some of those pull requests I could login over here and do that I'm just not logged into my github on this computer so let's look at al cos physics based clock so this is wonderful so you so I guess I it's up to me here to describe what's going on but we can see here this is it is for 47 and 16 seconds and 18 seconds the 19 seconds in 20 seconds like a 21 22 23 24 25 so this idea of creating this physics simulation almost Angry Birds like tower structures with the time is really wonderful and I have a feeling that something exciting will happen when we get to 60 seconds so let's wait this is right this is what I really love about the clock designs is you can be so creative and nontraditional you can create a code version of your favorite clock or you could just make up something crazy that almost like it's hard to figure out to tell the time or maybe you make up something crazy that actually is a really excellent way of telling the time oh yeah that was really exciting I have to wait so I encourage you to look at this on your own time Thank You Alka for submitting this clock so let me look in oak lick and drag your mouse around the blocks oh look at this so I can also make all sorts of fun stuff happen okay uh okay so I think I better start now I have an excuse for not doing any coding for 50 minutes I don't know how long this livestream has been going because and let me try to because I had Suraj as a guest for a little while okay time to do some actual coding let me just see if there were any more that were submitted I could just look at the pull request Oh No let's look at the pull requests and I apologize for not keeping up with pull requests on all these different repositories is one of the reasons why I asked me I am Samhita help out to kind of act as a de facto github coding train coding train github pull request manager and so we can see there is another one here I don't know if p5 dojo is a clock but this is definitely a clock my clock so I can't merge this right now but we can view it right here and okay so let's look at this I'm actually just gonna do something real quick I didn't realize what webpage I was going to Oh lovely that's right so you can see this is a really nice variation of the clock that I made with arcs and hands but a couple things that are different number one is there's a in there's a hand that's doing once around for each second there's a lovely little digital readout down here which is a nice like little bouncing physics and the mint the second hand the like subsecond hands they're moving continuously as opposed to just like with mine so that's wonderful p5 dojo is a clock and it's from p5 dojo I haven't forgotten Simon about my strawpoll I'm gonna go look at it b5 dojo is a clock and p5 Jojo is also a person in the chat saying it is a clock so let's look at p5 dojos clock Krister Neilson looks like and I'm gonna go to files changed and we can see here a p5 dojo oh there's two clocks bezzie a clock Wu Bezier curves one of these days I'll have the confidence to explain how Bezier curves work I love this so simple so perfect I can just enjoy this so I'm I'm kind of guessing that all of the points of minute hour and seconds are points of a a curve I just love the simplicity of this so and very creative thank you for showing this sharing this and let's go to all over the place I let's go to I can keep track of my links here we go let's go to this last one QR clock this is interesting I imagine this kind of something to do with the QR code so somehow this QR code is telling us the time that's pretty awesome so this is pretty hard to read for a human but I guess that computer that's a really cool cool crazy idea and we can see here the actual time is right there wonderful thank you for submitting these p5 dojo okay why was I showing you these well one I wanted to show you these fabulous clocks i retweeted a bunch that people share with me on twitter also which we're really exciting to see and you know we really should probably make a website that's just full of clocks but before we do that the other community project that you can contribute to is and thank you all so again to me I am so me for making this repository is the twelve O'Clock repository so twelve O'Clock s is a artwork by John Maeda from the late 90s all made on a in the stock of a Mac OS 9 and released in 1997 the only way to currently run these historical creative coding this creative coding project from the late 90s is to get like a Mac OS 9 any later or a PowerPC and goal on 11 actually did this for a page a blog post for one of his courses at carnegie mellon university where he got them all to run and then kind of made some gifts of them so what i would love to do as a community is recreate this exact paid what we're seeing here but instead of gif animations the actual clocks running in the browser so what you can see here if you read this read me will give you more information and if we look at the published github pages you can see this is just a layout for all these clocks but the clocks aren't there right now so this is just a beginning so I would love for us as a community that's one of the inspirations for this speaking of crediting is the recode project recode project org maybe no sold I'm Matthew Epler Epler recode project let's this is this is a documentation page about it where is the actual link that's Matthew Eppler who also by the way has all these great video tutorials on YouTube how come I can't find the recode project website someone's gonna be able to help me to find this ah here we go recode project com there it is so this is the recode project which is additionally about looking at historical examples of artworks computational artworks made by computers and you know and it's there's a long history of this way that dates way way past you know what I've been doing for the last however many years and what what people have been doing for me for the years before that and so this is a project where you click on any of these for example let's look at random squares this is one we could probably do here by Charles susuri you can see here is a direct translation and experimental so I don't know is if I click on this does this mean we see the translation yeah so this is that in written in processing and this is the artwork so this I would love to do something like this for the twelve O'Clock project okay so thank you for that alka I think I'm gonna move on though just in the interest of time if that's okay so okay so we talked about those two things those are the two community projects strawpoll we can go back to that now cuz I really it's it's almost five o'clock and you know I I'm usually here until 600 or 6 or 630 I was kind of hoping to leave at 6 but I want to just only code for an hour it's not very much time for this week so let me look at what's happening with the straw poll let's look at those results I'm gonna give you guys the last last minute to to vote on it and I'm not necessarily gonna do what it says but I've got to consider it Siraj released this video yet downstairs working on it okay FM so I'm going to view the results oh look at this oh it's nice to see simple harmonic motion Wow Wikipedia API letting var vertex okay great well nobody's interested in the ten print is that cuz you don't know what ten print is I'm gonna do the dead bug that's great because I could do that probably is like a five minute coding challenge and it will inspire so many creative ideas so and we're gonna do that anyway so I'm not so sure about the continued matrix math but it is useful to note the interest and I'm just right now I'm trying to it's I know that there's a lot of viewers who are very experienced do not who I have a lot of experience with a lot of the stuff that I'm talking about but there are also a lot of new people coming to learn about coding and I really want to make this channel accessible especially this time of year which is September when students are taking their first programming classes and that type of thing yeah I didn't put machine learning on here explicitly so simple harmonic motion can I can I do a warmup is it okay so let's let me just commit to doing let and var for I feel like I need to dip so I should have done this voting thing let okay let's mmm let's start with the simple let's let me just do the let and var thing can I just do that as a warmup I think I think it'll be okay okay so let me get started here I am going to go to the desktop and I'm gonna say p5 generate B let var Const let's see if this works so I'm using a new tool called p5 manager I didn't actually publish that video but I made a video about it which will create p5 projects for me and now I'm going to CD into that directory I'm going to open it up and add them and we look at the code and I'm going to get rid of all the code and I'm going to now run a server and go to the browser ok and let me just make sure this is working I make that change there we go okay and one thing I don't this is sort of standard for p5 sketches but I like to remove the default CSS that comes with them there we go and also there's no reason for me to have a canvas and the camera went off ok no people asking why did you do the voting because that was curious I don't know it's voting really the best way to decide it's a good way so it's one way but sometimes the universe has its own plan in mind alright so now I need a marker I'm just I'm always unprepared but I'm even more unprepared than usual and I'm gonna do a video oh yeah p5 mode in processing I could use it I'm gonna do a video I'm that's the whiteboard that's me about let and bar and possibly Const now here's the thing I'm going to attempt to explain them and why what why what let means in relation to var know if you're a beginner and you're just learning to code what do you know just say let but if you've been using var for a while why is this there this new let thing and the one hand you could just say just use let instead of bar I'm gonna say this again in a second thinking this through and then I'm gonna try to explain what why let is different why it solves some problems in JavaScript previous versions of the JavaScript language but I'm not really sure I know entirely what I'm talking about which is really goes for everything but especially in this case so yeah can you guys hear people there's people in the hallway the doors not open but I will do I'm gonna do this simple harmonic motion next this is a warmup because I feel like I need to get warmed up because I'm but I'm if I make mistakes or I get this wrong please correct me okay all right here we go first of all it's very important to always make sure you stay hydrated okay hello over again this is a video sort of about bar but this is a video about bar in 2017 now I should admit that I'm really way way way behind the times because in 2015 something came out called es6 what is es6 well es6 is short for e c MC a script 2015 what's the chance that i got that right hold on a sec oh I'm in the wrong screen what is it called E CMC a script no ECM a I got an extra C in there okay this is an extra seat ECMA it stands for something some kind of consortium of Hmong mango loving astronauts I don't know but this is a consortium of people who come together to talk about what what is the syntax of the JavaScript language and how should it work and so in 2015 which is quite a while ago at this point the the consortium came together and thought let's instead of saying bar to declare a variable let's declare a variable right instead of saying var x equals 100 let's declare a variable by saying let x equals 100 and also quite possibly let's offer an alternate option by saying Const x equals 100 so currently right now if you were to write this into your code all three of these would valid JavaScript statements but they would all do something slightly different and I should also mention that one of the reasons why it's taken people like me years to get with the program is because even these aren't necessarily supported by every single web browser that people are using in the world I think at this point you know most modern web browsers support es6 natively and if you're a web developer they're professional web developer there are all sorts of ways to put something behind the scenes that so that if somebody is if the code is written in es6 but the web browser doesn't support it it works anyway this is not the subject of this video but this is a subject of what are these things they're by the way isn't there like es8 like I'm already way behind so I'm like here making fight yet yes six video somebody in the future when it's like es 712 will be like amused by this old historical antiquated like video this human being with actual like human body instead of robotic whatever anyway I'm off track now yes six is a standard I'm starting to use it in all my videos so what is the difference why so I'm gonna just tell you what the difference is in technical terms and then I'm gonna go and explain it var X uses something called block scope and here's the thing if you're just learning to program for the first time you go watch the variable videos and just substitute let for bar if you're interested if you've been programming for a while you want to know what this new stuff is about then this video is for you or if you just started learning a program and you really can't want to know this like level of detail then I guess keep watching let X oh my god I said it wrong it did it totally wrong oh by there's like there's like so many people watching this video we're just like screaming at their screen for like the last 30 seconds bar uses function scope let uses block scope and if you program if you learn to program in Java drop by in Java in C++ in processing which is built of Java and this is how I learned to program everything was always block scope it's the only way that I think I actually just when I even use var I'm just assuming it's block scope and writing code as if it is block scope but it's not and that's what's prone to error and block scope I personal mean they know I don't want to I don't want to be too down on function scope I'm sure function scope is a very nice scope and I would love to hang out with function scope and have some time together but I prefer block scope and so let's let me get this cube this is way too long of a video to explain this let me get to the computer and start to explain what I mean here okay I'm over here so I have some code and I am going to start writing some code so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say var x equals 100 okay let's say var x equals 100 I'm going to say console dot log X console dot log X this is a look a weird example to start with that I'm gonna get to some examples that will hopefully help a little bit more but what should happen when this code runs set up starts this first line of code should execute and what should say I don't know what X is are you nuts I haven't heard about anything named X now I'm gonna say what X is and if then if it was able to go onto the next line of code would say what X is and then it would console.log 100 but that's actually not what's gonna happen I'm gonna refresh all I care about is the console here I got undefined in 100 well that's not so unreasonable right because X is something that's undefined but shouldn't I really maybe possibly get an error there let's look what happens if I switch this now to let uncaught reference error X is not defined so you might say oh I like the other way better because it didn't break but here's the thing the fact that it is not letting you talk about that variable above where it was declared and initialized is is a is more is is a situation which is less prone to error let me show you some reasons why so first of all one thing that's interesting is I could do this let X then I could say X equals 100 and then I could put the console.log here this would now give me exactly what var did so why why what's going on here well there's something in JavaScript with var called wasting wasting I'm so proud of myself my posting is because there was a long period of time where people would say on what that is but now I do I think and I'm gonna explain it so if I'm hoisting what is hoisting so I'm gonna write some other code I'm gonna say I'm gonna say for VAR Ivy's bar I equals 0 is less than 100 I plus plus I'm gonna write a loop and I'm gonna like some stuff will happen here and then I'm gonna say var x equals Mouse X plus 100 and then I'm going to say if X is greater than 50 then bar Z equals 20 and ye and and then draw an ellipse but you know whatever bar y at X comma Y 100 100 so this is sort of nonsense code but I'm I'm writing this code to make a point there is a point when you write code like this in ES spot previous to es6 in javascript what the interpreter actually means you're actually modified before it runs it does this thing called hoisting and it actually does this I don't think right and then I'm going to take out it it adds like a line of code at the top of the function that declares all the variables and then deletes all the variable declarations so this is why this is why those variables with var there's variables with VAR have function scope because even though if I declare var down here VAR y equals 20 the hoisting process puts the Declaration of the top and it's a variable that's available for the whole for the entire function setup it has function scope even though it's declared and only used inside of this if statement so I can say things like console.log Y up here and I can do things like console.log I at the bottom so I'm gonna get undefined because Y doesn't have a value yet and then I'm gonna get what am I going to get down here console.log 100 because that loop is gonna finish and left eye with the value 100 so that's exactly what I got and even drew part of that ellipse and then so technically like this code is sort of problematic because I've declared two variables I've wasted two variables called I right so now the so this is really the this is really the issue this wasting process which happens behind the scenes and lets variables be available to a broader scope beyond where they are actually declared and used makes big code prone to error at least in my experience so you know for example if I'm writing a loop here if I'd simplify this like and I want to have a separate variable for I somewhere else I'm really just I'm running into trouble the fact that I can actually use this variable I afterwards is there's all these problems that could happen by accident if I had another variable that was more global called I and the scope can get really confused so I should probably do this video so using let is a nice solution to this problem now I don't know so why is it called let versus var I mean in my understanding of this is well why not just change the behavior of bar well if you change the behavior of bar then you're possibly going to break all this code that has been written over time so in order to write order to have a new version of JavaScript that has variables that only have block scope block scope they're only available within whatever curly brackets they're declared in whether that's if whether that's for a new name has to be invented so we just have to all change over and say like now let's just all use let let's use let I can't remember but let's use let let's use left let's use yeah I'm gonna just let them to use let let again this video could have been made 30 seconds by me just saying hey remember that thing called VAR it's called let now but there is actually a technical difference and let's look at that again right right now I'm gonna run this code and we see 100 i console log i as 100 if I change this to let I will get an error I is not defined and that's the error that I want I is only available inside of this block this is the block that's the block I has block scope if I put an if statement in here if mouse X is greater than 20 let J equal 20 console.log J I will get an error here because J is only available for this and you want your variables to only be available for I mean sometimes you need global variables I'm not saying all variables should have that little as scope as possible but they should have the smallest scope that is needed it helps you organize your code helps you be less prone to error I mean they're making errors is fun everybody should make errors but this is a helpful thing okay huh what do you guys think did I explain that what questions do you have I guess write them in the comments and I didn't get to talking about what Const is so let me try let me try to talk about in a separate video in the next video what Const is and if there's anything that I missed or some questions there's a lot of chat going on right now if you're watching this as an edited video later is there anything that I missed I'm gonna go check that live chat and talk about at the beginning of the next video and there's a lot more es6 stuff that i want to talk to talk about so there's classes and there's promises so only get to that stuff eventually but I just wanted to talk about in this video let all right how did I do I should do a straw poll like that was like on a scale of one to ten that was a useful and interesting video that made sense I would give myself like a three and a half but maybe you'll be more generous to me okay I'm looking to see if there's any questions question when are you going to harmonic motion after I talk about const super interesting and clear thank you yom that's i'm glad to hear that eight out of ten out of ten i was terrible okay okay okay fun fun out of ten ten oh you guys watch do nice you know i just saying this because i need the positive feedback great thank you guys okay so I think I should move on I don't think I did I get anything horribly wrong did I miss any crucial details it doesn't seem like I did all right I'm saying okay I'm thank you for all those comments alright I'm gonna move on and talk about Const this is not probably and more likely to get wrong okay I'm back for another video about stuff that's a es6 again if you're just watching my beginner programming videos and just learned about programming you might just go back to watching those this is a little bit of behind the scenes stuff very technical but it is interesting and it can be useful the thing I want to talk I talked in the previous video about let and var and the difference between those two things and you know you could for most sketching that I'm gonna do in p5 and making crit weird experiments I could use them interchangeably and not worry about it too much but there is another term that you're going to see you're gonna see people saying var X if they are using style previous to es6 or 2015 ECMAScript you're gonna see let if people are using es6 a more modern style of JavaScript but you're also gonna see people using Const and what does Const mean now there is no reason you have to ever use Const ever I mean somebody I'm sure come up with a reason why you you might have to but what I'm saying is for the things that I'm making I could just use let but my kotas perhaps a little less efficient in the way that it runs and uses memory so cost is only an option to help with the efficiency of how your program runs and manages memory on the computer because if you have some data if you have a variable in your program that you know it's value is never going to change the computer can be source can be smart about how it stores that information it doesn't have to like leave extra space for extra tough now I'm kind of oversimplifying but that I think is a useful way to think about it so for example if I know that I want to have a variable called cat and I want to store in it the number 99 I don't need to say let cat if cat is never going to have another value ever I can say Const for constant because cat is going to be a constant now here's the interesting thing this makes sense when it comes to just numbers but there's more to it than that what if you're declaring a function or what if you're clearing an object so let's at least first look at the simple simple scenario of working with numbers so I'm gonna come back over here and all of this I can do just in the JavaScript console in the browser itself so if I say let X equal 50 can you guys see this let me make a little bigger now I can look at the value of x and the value of X is 50 and I could say x equals 100 and now the value of x is 100 let's do this again let's say Const y equals 50 so now I have a variable called Y which is a constant its value is 50 now I'm gonna say y equals 100 uncaught type error assignment to a constant variable so you cannot assign to a constant variable you cannot reassign the value it's forever 50 so I was I feel like I need to go back to white bore but I don't think I do so what does this mean in terms of objects it's a little bit strange and I'm not sure I fully understand this behavior so I might have to like come back to this a little bit and I'm seeing alka putting some interesting suggestions in the chat here ok so let's look at what if I say what if I have like a particle constant particle and the particle has an X and a Y so it's really a JavaScript object oh I made it Const let's find we know what it's going to do when it's let particle equal it's just an object like anything so this is what it is it's an object it has an x and a y it's a constant but interestingly enough when you make an object a constant that doesn't mean you can't manipulate the inner workings of the object like I can actually say particle dot X equals 200 and that is totally valid so I can change those internal variables because those internal variables themselves are not constant I can even do things like which surprised me when I first saw this I can say particle Z equals 50 which means I can add another property to that object but what I can't do is I can't now say particle equals I'm going to recreate a new object I'm gonna recreate that object uncaught error assignment to a constant variable i cannot suddenly say particle is now the string hello this protects me from making some errors too because if I'm using a ver but I can't reassign it by accident is something of a different type so I can't make it a new object so again I could use let but this is something that allows the code perhaps to run a bit faster they use a little bit less memory so if you know that this is and maybe to protect yourself against some errors so this is a useful technique and mostly I'm explaining this because when you look at examples you're gonna see it in a place where you'll see it often at least where I see it often is sorry I want erase I click up these tissues to race with let Matt to maybe let's edit out this erasing or like speed through it or something I can't I also can't use my right and for erasing the way that I in mind most of my videos in the way that I've shown how to declare a function is saying function you know go like this this is a function definition I say function the name of the function parenthesis with whatever arguments are in there this is the equivalent of basically saying var go equals function or of course now we know it's actually the equivalent of saying let go equal function if i'm using es6 so if i'm declaring all these functions if I'm writing functions into my code it's often the case that I never want to reassign or alter that function that function is done so function I'm just intending to use in my code so you will see this quite a bit Const go equals function so you could consider this again this is a lot now let me type this over here so you can see it so in other words what I'm saying is let's say I'm gonna have some functions function go that's one way of declaring a function the way that I typically have done in my videos but I can say Const go equals function so again while this might offer some optimization benefits it doesn't necessarily offer a lot of benefits for teaching and education especially for beginning programming which is why I will continue to use the top syntax because if I'm going to teach somebody for the first time ever how to write a function Const go equals function is a bit more probably confusing that just function go so I think that's everything I should say I'm gonna poke pause for a second Siraj just released his video because I got a notification this should be this kind of edit this out did I miss anything about Const mmm that's important how does Const fact scope good question I assume constant uses block scope also so there was actually just an important question in the chat just now I talked a lot about scope in the previous video and I probably want to in some ways now that I think I probably made a video just only about the idea of scope but what how does Const affect scope so const also uses block scope let and cons both use block scope the same exact way the difference is const is a variable that can never be reassigned a Chuck spy in the chat is asking where can I learn all this stuff I think probably my beginner JavaScript series is where you can start from scratch okay I think this is good I'm not seeing anything oh yeah why not just cannot using the arrow syntax yet so let me mention that so one thing I should mention is actually es6 there's also another way of declaring a function that involves equal greater than and almost it looks like an arrow this is called the arrow syntax I'm not using this yet I will come back and make a video about this so you I could go even a step further with how I might declare a function by incorporating this arrow syntax but I'm not ready for that yet I got to take little tiny steps into the es6 pool okay thanks for watching these this this video about Const I hope this helped please ask your questions and offer your Corrections in the comments and I'll see you soon thanks that's called the lambda expression oh I'm just being told this is called a lambda expression thank you okay alright so we got those out of the way and that's some good stuff that I've done that's been on my list for a while and now what I'm gonna actually do is rename this folder simple harmonic motion rename maybe well let me do that okay let me just don't save we move this over here you talk amongst yourselves for a second go watch Suraj's video is still the same results here ok where do we add 530 we're doing ok so I got this one done you can take this one off simple harmonic motion I'm looking for my this one I'm just gonna call this I don't need to simple harmonic motion and one thing I'm going to show you is if you're familiar with memo aachen the artist mmm I'm most of all the name simple harmonic that Google will correct me yeah here we go so this is a wonderful series of artworks and sorry I am trying to run my server again this is a series of artworks about simple harmonic motion and it's sort of the inspiration for what you can do with this very simple idea I'm also going to look for so one thing I want to do is just search on youtube simple harmonic motion shipment I already have a video tutorial already but I don't think that I code anything from scratch in this one listen this one only has like eight and a half thousand views because one of my old videos let's quickly take a look at scan through it know that ignore the ad ignore the ignore the ad I apologize I apologize skip skip so you guys can't hear the video right now I could switch something to have you here so I'm explaining about sine and cosine then I already have some code example I'm just showing code examples and talking about them so that's useful but it's also in processing so this is worthwhile look at me look how look how young I am this video I have the same beard different glasses different glasses very very little grey hair and I don't have an elbow scar and I have much much more range of motion okay now you guys arm you care about this okay okay go away younger person you okay making YouTube videos really aged as a person let me tell you that's I think from to that I think I made those videos possibly in 2012 so I'm not sure all right let's okay so what I want to do I kind of want to just basically do this but I also need Anna Rick maybe I'll do this in two parts alright this is going to be a pretty simple one and actually probably these have wonderful sound that you won't hear okay a DNA strand honey all right all right all right everybody relax relax relax B I'm talking to myself here when I drink stay hydrated it was really nice to see everybody's feedback about you names guest tutorial that I released um she has a clip oh I'm streaming but I don't see myself you can hear me though right hold on everybody why you can hear me but you can't see me restarted the computer still can't see me can you hear me okay you can hear me let me look at this why am I not seeing any of the Blackmagic inputs No so can't see me alright everybody hold on a second let me try to diagnose this just give me a second I'm sorry I shouldn't have started streaming until I knew it was working let me up I found myself found myself and now you can see me I'm in the void how do I get the mean so that's here I'm gonna delete this I don't know why when I restarted the computer all the inputs weren't showing up it's crazy how I have to redo this stuff and while I'm streaming weird alright understand why these black magic things are bane of my existence sorry everybody this must be excruciating to watch here I am well it's alright I'm gonna try restarting OBS I guess oh no but I have to quit to do that hope that works no I don't think this is OBS is fault I think this is black magic well let me make sure this is actually on it is do I see it yeah sorry everybody I'm gonna attempt to sorry I don't want to just be streaming the not working thing I thought I'd just like I clicked the streaming button really quickly because I thought like restart and start streaming yeah because the computer froze but I'm gonna need to restart OBS to try to reconnect to the stuff so I'm gonna stop streaming hopefully I'll come back I mean I will come back no matter what but hopefully I'll come back quickly
