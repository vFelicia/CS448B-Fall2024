do do so do audio sound check now uh my audio should be better than it usually is because i have a new microphone but i am curious to hear from you what it sounds like let me know second audio sound check i actually had the audio of the music doubled so now this is a better check although everyone said it sounded good before all right can anyone actually tell that this mic is better than what i used to use last week i'll be starting in about two minutes or one minute and 40 seconds baby hello there's gotta be a universal way to say good blank with all of the different times good day but it might be the middle of the night for some of you good day i said good day um good morning good afternoon good evening good middle of the night to all of you hi this is dan coming to you live from the from an attic in brooklyn new york um where it is a beautiful day outside although getting a little chilly um this is not the time i usually like to live stream this is actually the time i usually like to take a nap but i'm wearing my cozy sweater i'm here on the internet with all of you um so far nobody's said anything like this has stopped working so i'm assuming i'm actually live streaming now i i've been working steadily to improve the quality of my live streams as you might remember last week i received some new i received i didn't receive them because i ordered them and they came but i installed some new lights so my skin and my face and everything should be looking positively aglow for you now the cool crisp dulcet tones of my voice should be arriving into your ear devices in a new and perhaps higher quality way because and i'm just going to hold this up for you i uh this is not a sponsored anything although hey i'm available elgato elgato are you listening um this is the elgato wave 3 mic that i ordered um and somebody in the chat raw heath just said oh no it stopped working but i'm assuming only raith is having an issue with the live stream right now rahith come back come back rahith i want you to be experiencing the dulcet tones of my voice in my new microphone i don't know i probably should get one of those things where it's like on an arm and it swivels around and it's just like propped right here but i don't know i don't know if that's for me every week i would like to make a small upgrade which incidentally i have no nothing left to upgrade so if you got any ideas for me let me know what i should upgrade for next week actually there is something also new that i would like to experiment with let me see here if we can get this to work this is a new feature that i will be using on the coding train um and i'm just gonna quickly test it right now i probably should do more to introduce myself and what i'm gonna be doing today but um bear with me i'm moving to here oh and i've got my glitch page open but actually let me remove this no wrong what no ah wrong button all right i have to do this manually um well this is very silly what i'm doing now i can't find my screen to remove it oh it's so hard where oh there it is i'm in emptiness it is so sad here in the emptiness all right this is fine just put that back um and it doesn't matter uh spoiler alert i'm gonna use glitch um let's see here so um everyone who is a coding train member meaning you've signed up through the uh subscription um no that's not the right i'm trying to under i'm trying to not use the word paid but honestly that's what it is um in there's a discord available for everyone there's a public discord for anybody who wants to join um i just posted a link to it in the chat but i also have if you would like to join the coding trade membership program i feel like for your membership in the coding train you will receive not very much to be perfectly honest but um it's a nice smaller community of folks uh we've got a uh chat a channel in the discord dedicated to chatting during the live stream and what i am very excited to demonstrate for you right now and most likely it's not gonna work i was having some problems but um david snyder and kobe who are um i can upgrade the green screen area says bruno oh wait see oh no let's let's make this i don't have to i need this on you know what i need to do i need to put this on a tablet i don't know why i didn't think of this i need a tablet another where we need a mobile version of this touch enabled click add it crashed so i don't know what's going on uh but i'm we're attempting to debug this i'm using a piece of software known as disk stream chat which i suppose is discord plus streaming and plus chatting but i always think it's trying to diss me oh i am used myself let's run it again i have a feeling it's gonna for some reason right now it's it's uh got this really wonderful feature where it works the second time i click the button but as soon as i click bruno i hope this is okay with you i'm gonna assume this is okay with bruno bruno can you give me a big thumbs up that i'm going to bring your chat message onto the screen right here i will wait because i actually so what i should say is that anyone who now posts in and i could use a different channel for this but in the members discord live chat channel just then um your message i have a mechanism by which i can click a button and your message pops up on the screen here using the this stream chat software by david and kobe okay i'm waiting for bruno to say okay in the meantime um bruno bruno is typing everybody bruno is it's okay says bruno so now let me go back over to here i really hope this works there it is look bruno's message popped up maybe i should move this like where where should this be ideally where should this be positioned won't move how come the ah what is wrong with open broadcast studio i can't move it that's so weird but anyway you can see bruno's message there and i can even show you that bruno said and i think this might crash let's see and it crashed oh well so i'm not gonna use this anymore probably unless we um can figure it out and i don't know how to get bruno's message off now um but this is my idea that um that i will be able to interact a bit more by answering questions and showing messages by selecting them and curating them and moderating them to have them show up on my fancy live streaming rectangle over here ah now uh keenan says daniel i have a lot of homework but i am watching you and kenan i have one thing to say to you and i think everybody knows what i'm going to say you can all think about it for a minute say it to yourselves please go and do your homework i mean my goodness i understand the desire to procrastinate but i cannot imagine that anything i do here today is in any way shape or form anywhere close to nearly as meaningful impactful and important as your homework so i encourage you to do your homework you know maybe you've budgeted your time you know you will have enough time then i suppose it's okay you could stay we could be together here on the streaming with the coding and all of that but um please please your dad is saying please do your homework okay it should be above or below your head i assume that's referring to the microphone it is below my head right now my head is cut off oh i have to slouch i think i need to move the camera back hold on everybody i don't have a wide enough area so let's see here this is probably going to cause all sorts of problems moving the camera back oh boy let's see what this does and there we are that's a little bit uh better all right so we ironed out uh we all right so what's happening today on today's live stream so first of all i'm um this is hopefully i mean famous last words were ever spoken by me a hundred thousand times in basically every stream ever but i hope this will be a little bit shorter than usual um i would like to be done by 5 p.m eastern time which is an hour and 15 minutes from now probably not gonna happen but um i i do have a limited amount of time there is some fun family activities that i am planning for this evening it is getting dark outside the evening is coming winter is coming and i do need to get to some other stuff but um i would like to do a number of things today one is thank our new member louise i'm not sure if louise is still watching welcome louise to the coding train you have joined just now you might have joined not even being in the chat because i get a message whether or not you're watching in the chat or not and when you join and for your joining of the coding train i will show you this train whistle i will ring this bell i will also go and find my book of random numbers because you will have for yourself a random number oh dear over there nope over here this green screen what's behind it's a whoa um well let's see maybe i will there's so many different ways i could fix this but i'm going to do it this way right now let's see how that does okay i'm not going to worry about it too much you can see me you can hear me let's find louise their random number and here it is two snaps in a circle and we are at 47 081 that is from row 6370 and column six so i hope somebody the uh coding train uh secretary who's recording this in the coding train book of numbers members and their random numbers will be saved for all of history and time forevermore now that we've gotten that out of the way let's set the tone for today and let's read from our book of random numbers ah i need to figure out where i last left off and the way that i do that is by not showing you my screen for a second and finding my way over to the coding train discord okay wait i just got i got just swept away in the music for a moment um looking for coding train live links live links command option i documented again once i tag name i hadn't have index zero style of visibility was hidden option command i and now we're back and the next random number where i last left off row 14 column two i'm still on page one i mean it's kind of amazing like i wish i had thought of this eight years ago or whenever i started it ten years ago whenever i started recording videos when was my first live stream it's there on youtube it was from many years ago i think that was more like 2015 if i'm correct but some of the video tutorials are were recorded in like 2011 2012 but i'm on row index 14 column zero one two eighty seven thousand five hundred and 517 64 969 91 826 8928 there's an animal in the attic with me i don't know it's either a cat or it's a dog oh it's a cat we'll see if the cat comes over kitty would you like a random number kitty what there are people watching this i kind of forgot that for a second i don't even remember where i am someone remember the last random number i read shoot okay go back ugh well i was starting on robotic oh my god my that this is a wash we're gonna go back we'll do this again this is i'm just getting warmed up all right all right all right somebody will tell me what random number was the last one i read and i'll find it and then i'll post it and everything's gonna be okay all right what's happening today i'm gonna start doing some uh projects and actually i'm going to do the same thing i did last week because i want to start training a machine learning model and once i get that model cooking i'm going to be baking it in my machine learning gpu oven i'm going to take a break and look at some community contributions so things that you the viewers of the coding train have made and submitted on the coding train website then i will come back and work on making a glitch uh well it's not a glitch application it is a node a web application hosted on glitch um to be able to uh communicate with that machine learning model that when it's fully baked and crispy and delightful and very healthy we're gonna make a nice healthy low fat that's not a thing anymore low i don't know what the low that you need is it's gonna be a good a very nice very nice machine learning model okay so let's go to um my uh friendly uh my website from my friends over at runwayml dot oh there's something new oh i wasn't sure if this would show up i don't think i have anything special unlocked in my account i cannot be distracted hold on i'm just opening up my slack communicates i just see if i have a slack telegram no slack telegram so i was asking if this is something that uh is publicly available it says beta i'm sure i could show it it's on there it's on their social media but i'm not going to get distracted we're not doing the green screen right now i'm going to come back to that i am going to go to here train and i want to do something that i have not done before zoom on into it is train my own uh custom object detection model now you might recall on hereto with the coding train youtube channel coding train object detection that there is a video on said youtube channel called ml5.js object detection with coco ssd this is a pretrained machine learning object detection model with 80 um 80 predefined categories so very limited amount of objects it's looking for and can detect and give you a bounding box so you can watch that video go through the code shows you the example what i was not able to demonstrate in that example is how to train your own object detection model and basically you know for example i think what i'll do i mean i could do oh let's do the rubik's cube i was going to do the train whistle but i sort of feel like the rubik's cube might be by the way i was having trouble my bra is having trouble solving it okay here it is um the rubik's cube might be a kind of nicer interesting thing to detect especially because i can it's got so many different colors on different sides i wonder if i shuffled it this is an interesting test case of object detection so let's use the rubik's cube although really i do love this mug so and i kind of want to make an after detection model that detects my mug i mean there's nothing special if only this mug were made in rainbow colors it would be everything i'd ever hoped for and wished for in my entire life i am a simple but a simple man who lives i don't live in the attic but i spend a lot of time in this attic talking to a camera that's what i do what's happened to me but i do love this mug it brings me great joy and happiness you should find something in your life that you can love and that loves you back like this mug loves me i understand why those like you know late night talk showy like things they use a studio audience because it's very weird to just be on my own i can make my children sit over there and just watch me the entire time that would basically torture them what was i doing right so we're going to train object detection model we're going to um uh have it uh find the rubik's cube okay so but the sort of key difference is here um you know i should say so ml5.js to be clear is a javascript uh library from machine learning built on top of tensorflow.js um and runway is a web application a company that provides a service here essentially to operate different machine learning models in the cloud um it does cost money um you can sign up for it this is not a sponsored ad for runway i am the founders of runway are former students of mine at nyu and i'm an advisor to the company so in that sense it's kind of is an ad but um i'm really just showing it to you out of my own enthusiasm and excitement to try using it so i'm gonna go here to object detection and actually so before before i can train the model i need to collect my data set so this is the way that i'm going to do it this is the way [Laughter] i'm going to go to new movie recording and so there are a lot of different ways you can collect an image data set you can see by the way my little behind the scenes here um oh i did get some here's the other upgrade i'm gonna make i have these like led lights let me turn them on um so i'm gonna by the way but you know this is why i make edited videos now because people do enjoy the fact that i just get distracted and like can never get anywhere that's what the live stream is but plenty of edited videos where i'm focused or at least i'm not focused that part got edited out or coming soon so let me go here and turn on these lights so i just turned on those lights um those will blink by the way if anybody signs up for a membership um but the other upgrade i'll be making hopefully by next week is um and i don't know what that did to my uh key here but um the idea i had i thought this would help like make the key better but i think it might actually be causing me some issues i bought white gaffers tape so i can gaff tape the various cables and things for these leds with white gaffers tape so it doesn't look as ugly as that black kaffir state so i am now going to hit record and i'm going to just record a video of me um with this rubik's cube kind of showing it and using it and i really don't want this to be more than like actually uh 20 i guess i can i can sample the frame rate however i want um let's try to get some different sizes okay let's just go for 30 seconds okay beautiful i'm going to hit stop let us save this to the desktop by the way i was doing this already with some other tests um and i'm gonna just make i might as well use this directory structure i'm gonna call this rubik's let's save this as uh rubik's rubix that's all well and good i actually i don't know what i think i want to do just to have these be less um i don't know if it really matters but i think that i want um let's just at least export it as 720 uh because i don't need super high resolution images for this i'm sort of afraid to go down to 480 although it would make total sense to do that i have a feeling runway once i upload my data set it's going to be resizing all these images just a much lower resolution anyway so that's fine what i'm attempting to do again is collect a data set that i am going to have to hand label so this is going to be one of the most exciting and riveting things i have ever done on the coding train you're going to actually sit and watch me hand label a data set for machine learning it's really exciting um but and i could have certainly um used you know sort of uh scraped the internet maybe doc looked uh did a google image search for rubik's cube and gathered a data set of images that way i could have taken a lot of photos with my old tiny telephone camera and uploaded those but i actually find a quite a useful way to collect a data set um is to record a video and then extract all the frames of that video so the way i will do that is with uh ffmpeg and so i'm in my uh console here on my computer i type in ffmpeg and i see all these possible commands so this won't happen automatically on your computer whether you're on windows or linux or mac you will need to make sure you go and find um i guess go to ffmpeg.org it's a complete crossplatform solution to record convert and stream audio and video it is a really excellently incredibly useful tool i use it frequently um and basically you can see here the sort the kind of foundational example of what you do with it you call you the command via your console ffmpeg dash i i believe stands for the input video input.mp4 and then the file name of what you want to convert it to so this would be how to convert very quickly this mp4 video to an avi file but it there is so much more you can do with ffmpeg in terms of extracting audio and um automating so many kinds of video processes so the one that i want to do is and if i can well i need to go to the desktop um under images maybe i think this is where my that directory was um ffmpeg what was it called again rubix here we go and i'm going to say ffmpeg dash i rubik's 720 does anybody happen to know and i really wish i could pin marcos message to the screen right now but does anybody happen to know the command from ffmpeg to extract it to frames i want to say it's dash vf i don't know if that's really true um i know i know that i need to say fps equals like let's do let's try just for a second one frame per second so i just want to get one image every second from the video um and then i think i can just say like frames what do you do to like number them like if there's this would be now the file name would be i'm going to call it like rubik number number number number dot png if i wanted them to be png's do i want them to be pngs or jpegs i have no idea let's try this okay so ah that one seemed right but i got could not open file frame oh because you know i feel like ffmpeg should make that directory for me but i don't think it will so i made the frames directory uh let's try this again that was super fast did it actually work if i look in frames there we go so now i have frames of the video um and this is probably not enough um this is like how many total uh 35 i think i should do let's delete all these and let's say hmm i mean how many am i i think i could do i think i could annotate 150 images right now i think that's reasonable i've got i don't have my watch on i've got like another hour here at least so i think i could annotate 150 images we'll play some music some royaltyfree music by the way in the market for commissioned musical themes for the coding train i'm already in touch with some people i have some ideas it's a very slow process because i started thinking about this probably over a year ago but if you are a composer and a musician uh join the discord please reach out you know you want to compose and record some music i'm looking for uh contributions in that area okay by the way if there could ever be the coding train musical i will just and what's the expression i suppose die and go to heaven i don't that's not really how i think it works scientifically speaking but um boy that would make me very happy okay um let's do five frames per second that was 178 frames i'm going to go back to runway here and i'm going to click object detection let's do a rubik's cube and by the way i probably i should have done both of these because i can train an object detection model with more than one object in particular in my data set so i'm doing this in the simplest way possible i'm gonna create this now um i'm going to upload oh which oh i'm logged in it's fine i'm meant to be logged into my other runway account it's all so confusing but this is fine this is fine i will i will do that later i'm gonna go to desktop images ffmpeg rubik's frames hit upload and we'll wait for these to upload can we do that thing in the edited videos where the time speeds up that would be nice right i guess i could log out well no i'm already uploading it ah i keep just messing this up you can see by the way oh how different how what a difference a year makes this was a data set that i uploaded a year ago in an attempt to work with uh thanksgiving turkeys okay frames here we go click uh next now um what is the next step i need to create an annotation group so i can't say that i entirely understand what an annotation group is in terms of the runway interface but i'm assuming it means a collection of labels um so um you know if i were doing uh rubik's cubes and train whistles my annotation group would contain both of those labels but i just have one and i don't have one that i've done before so i'll make a new one we'll call this annotation for coding train live stream rubrics give it a very long name and then i want to oh and then i want to put in the label will be rubik's that's the one label i have i'm going to click start annotating hopefully this will load i had a problem with this the other day um somebody can report this as a bug to runway where when i first load this page nothing comes up and i think that let's see if i just click on image two if i recall correctly what i did last time to fix this uh was oh no it worked so i don't know why that first one didn't show up but there it is so this is what i'm doing i'm looking at these images and i'm going to annotate where the rubik's cube is but there's no rubik's cube so i can click skip there's a skip button all the way down here that i realize you can't see skip but i can also just hit the space bar which will be much more efficient so i'm going through the images now here is the rubik's cube so now i'm going to annotate it i'm going to draw a little square over it and that is the rubik's cube and i'm going to click next so i believe there are other tools like this but i really appreciate how kind of quiet and meditative and relaxing this is and how easy it is to do um you know i can move this around and you know resize it i could be really i'm not going to be very particular about it this definitely appeals to my obsessive nature to try to like very precisely annotate it but i want to move quickly and i think that i want to see if we can just have some nice relaxing um music like to annotate by how many do i got to do talk amongst yourselves everybody for those of you wondering why didn't he just do this before he started live streaming and then he could show us when guess what look i actually already did this here's the finished version i'm just going to show you the beginning of the process nope that's not how this works people the whole project all the pieces i will demonstrate to you oh i'm really doing a terrible job by the way what would be really cool is to build a system by which we could crowdsource this so what if i could give you know runway could think about this what if i could give this url out and all of you who are watching this right now could participate in the annotation process what this song's over already what number am i on 40 hey i'm not i'm like uh pretty far along here i don't know what oh these are all the halloween things i had i forgot about the halloween music oh no this always gets me like a copyright violation the gold the goldberg variations let's try this oh yeah this is good oh my god why not alright everybody montage annotation montage hey welcome henry whitaker by joining the coding train right now you have interrupted me from my special hand labeling process of machine learning imagery but i thank you actually you've saved everybody because we were just stuck there was nothing else we could possibly do but now having joined the coding train henry i will now find for you your very own personal random number oh i got the timing of that way wrong it is on row 8915 column zero one two three four five six seven six thousand four hundred and sixty nine thank you henry for your support mwah it means a lot it helps me upgrade my studio and keeps me going it motivates me it fills me all of that stuff wrong one okay back to annotating i think this is not annotating do you know what this is it's dance notating kind of makes it go a little bit slower but it's much more fun i really need a standing desk here in the attic that's the other upgrade i'm going to make this sitting while live streaming does not work for me all right let's move faster people oh that was a terrible one i really had to go back and do this again like with much greater precision where are we now halfway there people halfway there dance notation what's happening in the chat anything yeah so in the chat there's a little bit of a discussion going on that uh here's a bias of how uh here's a human bias here's an example of human bias see i really need to bring these messages up on the screen so i don't have to read them um but um i'm gonna read this uh dan's fingers are present in each annotation of the cube then the resulting model might not be able to identify a cube lying on a table because it wouldn't be surrounded by fingers exactly so if i wanted to have a very um sort of broadly functional uh model that could recognize and find a rubik's cube in any image this would be a pretty terrible data set because the rubik's cube is only ever present in one environment uh the environment with me in it with this green screen background with my hand holding the rubik's cube so i would want to collect a much more elaborate and varied data set but i would say that one of the things about what i'm doing here which isn't necessarily a problem is my use case might be i want to build something for myself that can find the rubik's cube in my hand when i'm holding it because um and also i have don't have a single example of it without the same color on one side so that's certainly a problem but um i could imagine uh in an interactive uh exhibit for example or some type of uh interactive context where you can really have control over the environment that having that fixed environment in your data set actually uh has a lot of advantages oh this is just not good i just gotta get at least slightly more i probably also don't need 150 so this is kind of maybe a little bit ridiculous what i'm doing but i can't stop now can't stop won't stop oh what is this weird i don't know if this is gonna be a problem but i'm just gonna also all the blurriness i didn't really think of that because i was moving it around a lot and um i mean should i mark it here like should it learn it be able to see it with my hand completely covering it i'm gonna i'm gonna annotate it that way this is this is gonna be an interesting experiment uh and my goal here in many ways is not to do this so that i have a very like a model that's working incredibly well i mostly want to demonstrate this process so that if any of you want to embark on it you might have more time or more sort of clever ways of collecting your data and being more precise about annotating it where are we how are we going 122. boy i feel like i've slowed down by the way having an actual night i'm using a track pad for this which is kind of sad oh did i finish wait what's going on no i don't see the images anymore weird hold on uh let me click here uhoh uh rename export what do i do here edit annotation group boy okay this will be done soon don't worry it only takes about four hours to train them i'm just kidding i'm gonna let it train for as long as i can manage to wait so what's it like to be a machine learning researcher you may ask let me tell you something boy is it exciting ah yes let me move this rectangle here and slide it a little bit over a little bit over here and all right dance notation that's one way of doing it i know i'm getting to the end now i love you rubik's cube you are my baby yeah oh there's more it's got to be the end now right what is going on what was i doing [Laughter] okay come on almost there almost there almost there people all right oh this is probably a bad idea let's give it that some training again okay no rubik's cube no rivets cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube no rooms cube no rooms cube no rooms cube no rubik's cube no rubik's cube never looks cubed everyone's cute no rubbish we are done people close next um i am going to select a pretrained model as the base model for this uh training um i right here we can see i could choose from other models i'm pretty sure the last time i checked this that actually oh no there's also yolo version three tiny interesting i wonder optimized for real time oh interesting i'm imagining using this in real time let's train it with both i'm going to just run this twice i mean i'm going to have this run twice i'm going to set let it go 5000 training steps i might stop it early i'm going to click start training and then i think if i go back to um oh no train and i do object detection again and let's do a rubik's cube um tiny real time question mark it's going to let me use a question mark in my name my experiment take this uh i already have these annotations next let's choose from yolo version three tiny and so now i have both of these going um and we can see them here as my two uh training experiments that are going so let's open this one in one window and oh it didn't it didn't open in a new window what did i click the wrong thing rook's cube i want you to open in a new oh weird it's like that's fine um then let's go to train uh rubik's cube tiny okay so we've got them both going so now i'm at the point and let me just click something here this is really bothering me there we go um wow louise it looks like you joined and you made it into the discord welcome that's so exciting um i i wish i could click your messages to bring them up on the screen look at this glow that's going on here i think it's the leds there so what's gonna happen now i now am letting this run um we can see both of these are running um just to be clear let me let me clarify a little bit about what's happening with runway so nothing besides my browser is actually running on this computer right here the one that i am operating here what i am looking at is a web interface to a set of servers that are runways presumably runways web servers and runways web servers are what are hosting up and showing me the interface and all the status updates and runway additionally has access to um what i'm assuming is a large number of gpu optimized for machine learning cloud servers so one of the the what you're for paying for when you sign up for runway and use runway is ease and efficiency really and in many ways so in theory i have a windows pc over here with a pretty good graphics card maybe i could figure out how to set it up with a training system and cuda and tiny yolo version 4 and all the stuff that i need to just train my model right over here on my own computer um but by having runway have access to a sort of preconfigured and readytogo cloud server with all of the dependencies and configuration settings it needs i'm just upload my files annotate them press a button for training and it's going to run it and then make the finished model available to me so um you could certainly do the same kind of thing also with google colab notebook you know an aws instance spell paper paper space these are other kinds of cloudbased services that have gpuenabled machines that you can do machine learning and other things on a runway is kind of my favorite tool du jour to use and one of the things that is the most exciting about it for me is just this huge library of models that i have access to and these are new actually there's a there's a youtube channel called artificial images i don't know who runs this channel but i've been recently quite tuned into it and it's been using um runway for a lot of things making a data set a walkthrough tutorial so this is all great i really got to check some of this stuff out um and i'm kind of do trying to do some of this kinds of stuff on my channel as well um all right so um what i think i would i'm going to do a couple things here hmm i really messed up so i apologize for this because i'm totally going to ruin everything right now um i'm going to check back on these models in a little while i i have two runway accounts because i want to be able to have an account with runway where i can upload data and do things in runway that are you know with my own private data so to speak i mean i can't i don't really have an example of data that i want to use for the runway that's private right now but i often do this with lots of things i have a separate account which is the one i stray logged into on streaming so i don't buy accident like open my email and that sort of thing um but i messed up and this this shiffman runway account is the one that i intended to be my private account but i'm already training these models i'm not going to uh but i'm going to log out and i'll come back to check on them in a little bit i'm going to go to my coding train one i can't get this right i've done this so many times i don't know oh i know what's going on i also have different logins to this browser and i'm it's fine it's fine everything's gonna be fine talk amongst yourselves do okay so now i'm in my choo choo account and we can see here that i've actually been working with this already um this past week i have some really weird models that i was training this is let's take a look at this one this is not what i meant to like show you um add to workspace what is going on here uh oh wait why do i have workspace work model workspaces what is going on i think runway changes interface my models train hosted this looks different all right i got to create a workspace add to workspace okay fine new workspace uh coding train demos and uh let's just run this model for a second so this model is a style gann model that i just trained off of images of my face looking in different directions wearing different glasses and things like that so um i wanted to um start with a style gan model i probably should just go to the sky gan one which is what i was actually using just to demonstrate the next phase of what i'm going to do which is demonstrate how to use runway beyond just the interface itself and essentially treat it as an api with your own code and any moment now it looks like it's about to spin up it's it's got this model running in the cloud my dan faces style model so just to be clear this is not an actual photo of me this is a stylegan generated version you can see it's uh got some kind of weird aspects to it and i mean i do look kind of like that i was wearing this shirt i was standing in front of a green screen when i collected this data set um and we can actually sort of start to like move around in the latent space of me oh my god so weird what have i done what monster have i created so creating an image synthesis model is one that you can do um and i need to i really need to get my act together and do a whole bunch of sequence video tutorials about this process right now i'm just kind of playing with it but let's move on over to glitch i'm gonna hit stop so uh i believe the current pricing and runway is about like five cents per minute when you're running the model in the cloud um so i'm gonna hit stop so that i don't use up too many of my credits and i am going to go over to this here called runway ml template and i'm going to hit um edit project i wonder if this one's actually running i think i disabled the model let's see actually doesn't look like i disabled it because i think if i disabled the model it would have um are already um it would have already given me an error message so one of the things you can do with runway is once you have a model like this coding train dan faces one um i can go click over here onto network and i can host this model so i've done this kind of stuff previously probably about a year ago and i used the runway desktop software that is still something you can use i really prefer the mic is off um i don't think the mic is off i am seeing everything working just fine so hopefully uh somebody else will tell me and confirm i think the microsoft i'd be getting a lot more messages um i'm gonna click host this model and i'm gonna host this model and now i have a list of all of my hosted models aha this is the one that i am actually using with this code sky gan the sky gan model and this model will you will see in a moment where am i going here uh generate uh images of the sky so this is a style gan model that's been trained on many many many uh images of the sky and one of the things you'll notice ah there we go look at this daily limit reached so you can all go to this url runway dash mltemplate and you will not be able to generate your own sky because when you do generate a sky it costs me but i actually have some free credits so i'm not paying for any of this right now but it the actual cost the runway cost is one cent per request so i in this template that i've built i have built into it this json file which always saves the current number of requests and i have also placed into this.env file which i don't want to show you right now just hold on a second going to zoom in on it like this for a second um where one of the properties of the dot env file in addition to the tokens which i will show you in a moment so i can regenerate them is the daily limit so i'm going to change this daily limit to 100 right now that should restart the glitch web application i realize i'm jumping right into the middle of a project with lots of pieces and things leading up to it that you might not be familiar with that's okay bear with me um ask your questions join the discord to get help um and i could see that peter is here in the chat hi peter nice to see you um and let me come back to here and now i should be able to go back to my web application and we can already see the count is at 18. let's see if i generate one it's gonna it's gonna run out it's gonna run out of its daily limit uh we've just collectively spent a dollar on generating sky images together so the reason why i've built this in is for uh a number of different reasons but um one is just to like have a protection layer a sort of rate limiting it's not something that the runway interface currently has as a feature but i've built it into this template um so what i would like to show you how to do is how to create your own uh web application where your p5.js or any other javascript html css code communicates and works with runway and ultimately i'm going to do that with the object detection model that i'm currently cooking um here in my machine learning oven and my machine learning oven is somewhere in the cloud i mean it's an underground bunker if we're being honest here it's the server is likely not actually floating in the sky with rainbows and birds tweeting about that would be nice though so um so what's next um so let's look at this code for a second and um um and and by look at this code let me go back to here so in the runway interface i could also by the way just turn off the model that's another way for me to make sure you can see i've had 1 399 requests on this model to date having used it so i could click this uh code snippet here and what you would see is that there is a javascript library a runway hosted models library that allows me oh there's my token i didn't i've sort of forgotten i'm not showing you the token why is my key so off is it really the um these leds hold on i don't know why my key has been actually really good recently maybe because the my lights are so much brighter i guess that made it a little bit better i turned the uh those leds off um max is that the max that i know who's in the chat i think it might be um hi max i'm all nervous max is watching um anyway back to my back to what i was looking at here so uh now you all have my token oh boy let's just let's quickly i just realized let's quickly disable that model the request didn't go up so you could written your own code very quickly with that token if you could have copied it out and put it into your code but looking at that code snippet again then the idea is i can create a runway hosted model object with a url to the model uh token is i heard a weird noise like it was the cat it's the cat all right i really wish the cat would come and say hello um i forgot what truncation is we can look it up in the runway interface i can query the model i can get an image back this is what i'm actually doing in my code however it's actually going to look a little bit different because if and i could just paste this right i've done this i could paste this right into the p5 web editor copy paste that put in the p5 web editor run it have my style get example working up and running immediately it's awesome but what would be the problem is my model url and my model token would be there right in the code and anyone on that web page could grab those and i want to keep those secure so what i have done here with this uh runway ml template and in theory you can use it by only ever using this server.js file i'm not sorry but you had to use the other stuff too but you could work with this without having to write your own server but i have a server a node server that's actually doing the runway communication and you'll notice in the code when i create the runway model by the way does anybody does anybody know this is i think it's i don't know what the equivalent family friendly thing of a drinking game is but yes i put a quarter in the jar every time i show my api tokens on a stream but you can see here i'm calling on process.env runway url runway token which means the code itself does not actually have the token in it instead i'm having like a crazy deja vu because literally recording a video tutorial on this yesterday that will go with my discord bot series but instead the the keys are stored in that dot env file you can see that little heart key thing this is something that only i or other you know uh um approved editors to this project can see so if you were to go remix this project like this code is open source you can go to the url to it i'll paste it in in the discord i believe if i go you know you guys can all confirm this to me and go back to our discord where did discord go um in the live channel links channel and just paste it here so you can grab that url go there you'll see all the code but when you go to the dot env file it will be empty because i'm not packaging that up with the example so that's a really convenient and this is not unique to glitch this is a common sort of standard for how to save um you know secret important information in environment variables across different web applications okay so what i what i want to show you here is let's look at the actual p5 code does anybody know by the way how to increase the font size in the p5 and the glitch web editor i have not been able to figure out how to do this i know i could zoom the web page but it like grows everything which kind of makes me a little bit crazy but i'll just do that for right now look at all you nice people popping up anonymous anonymous who are you who are you watching i know max is watching and peter and klaus and stray and seon and shrey shrey is watching it twice are you two people but um all the rest of you are just these anonymous little smiley faces hi anonymous little smiley faces i love you all what time i said it was gonna be five well we'll see we'll see so here's here's what i'm trying the code is quite simple on the client side and i'm rather than programming this whole thing i'm just going to talk you through it and then i'm going to make some new version i'm going to remix it and make some new versions of it to do other things so one is i'm creating a canvas it's a 640x480 i'm creating a button that button called generate right we can see all this here canvas the generate button this is all p5 code for manipulating a canvas and dom elements it's not your sort of traditional uh javascript but it's the way i like to work with the p5 creative coding environment um i'm making this sort of span um dom element because i want to show the count that's rather unnecessary but um you know we got to tally all the votes uh i mean um count all of our requests to the uh to the runway server and then when i press the mouse this function send vector is called it's the callback to the mouse pressed event on the generate button so what's going on in that function well every model in runway and if i go back to browse models and i search for sky gan and i come up to it and let's just add it to create why do i need to create a new workspace isn't there shouldn't it like add to my existing workspace where here's my model workspace i'm so confused uh i'm just not going to worry about this something is going on somebody will teach me how to use runway by the way there's a slack for runway and somebody should i'm almost taking notes so i give all this feedback to them um so i don't know codingtrain2 i don't know why i have more than one workspace was i in my other account i don't think so yeah where's the other workspace so strange um but with every single model where does inference know where what am i looking at view i think i want to look at here i want to look at where it shows me the sort of specs the model the inputs and the outputs and i'm probably all saying this and this is this always happens to me where you're all saying how to do this in the chat and i'm just completely incapable of seeing it my models no model workspace yes all right well i know what it is and it's telling me right here uh vector so um the inputs to this particular model are vector oh i'm gonna have to make a whole video about this i've talked about this before i don't wanna get into the weeds of this right now but uh in an image in an image classification uh context the inputs to the machine learning model would be the image the outputs would be the labels here something this is a generative model so the inputs is actually really just like a bucket of numbers uh like a noise that's like a list of noise and that list of noises the signature that signature input which will generate a particular image so that's what i'm doing um in my uh code wherever that was where i am i know the expectation for uh stylegan is to receive 512 uh input values a vector of 512 numbers i think an appropriate range is between negative one and one but i'm not entirely sure and so i make the inputs with the z is often referred to as the z vector or the or the latent vector is another term for this and then i don't see the runway code anymore the reason is i'm actually going to send the vector to my own server the server is essentially middleware is that the right term it is really just its job is just to like pass the football pass the baton that's a better metaphor i think it's a relay race the runner is running up with its vector it's passing the baton to the server who's gonna run it all the way to runway the server is really secure i mean it's not that secure to be honest but it's it's much more secure i'm sure there's the security flaws in what i'm doing but it is secure in the sense that it's got the sort of secret keys to talk to runway so you can see i'm using the javascript fetch function my endpoint on my own api that i've basically written to that node server is called runway so and then uh the server's keeping track of the count and if it's reached its limit it'll just log the daily room it was the daily limit was reached otherwise it returns the outputs from the model and that's an image which i can generate and draw so this is looks this is identical the way i've set this template up is if you send the inputs to the node server's runway ml endpoint that node server if i look all the way down here will take the body of that request as inputs and then call await model.query so this is the actual runway call and if it comes back and works um it sets a status to success and returns the outputs otherwise i'm just keeping track of this count right this is my like highly advanced rate limiting methodology i have a variable which is literally a count and as it goes up if it goes above some threshold which is defined here in the environment variables you can see by the way here's the url and the token um in the in the environment variables uh if it reaches that uh account um it is what's it trying to say then it just sends back it doesn't actually query the model and i also i'm doing um i also put made an endpoint to just like check the count so for example i think that if i do slash count here you can see that um it's at 100 and if i went back to here and i went the count is also being stored in this json file i don't know why it says five there something funny happens with me with glitch i don't really get it when you're writing to text files or json files the browser doesn't always like refresh the latest contents but if i set that to zero and it'll it'll like save it and then go back to here oh and my app went to sleep i thought i had by the way i have a glitch pro account i thought i boosted this but you can see now the count is zero and then this won't actually work right now because i think i have to say i disabled the model but you get that's the entire story uh um so let's see and right so protecting it by an ip there's a variety of other ways you could protect it also let's see here um what questions do you have about this let's check our models that are cooking i'm going to go this is so ridiculous what i've done here by using two runway accounts let's log out and let's log into my other runway account this is not a necessary thing for you to do go under train and uh let's check these models let's see the this one is 46 percent done and this one is 28 done let's take a look at the one that's 46 done so you can see here um what what's what i love about the runway interface is it's actually showing me its progress while it's training so it's running a bunch of training images through the model this is not showing me my annotations right this is showing me its guess based on the current state of the model based on the current step and if i go back we can look at step 1200 600 you know all the way back to one foot right this was early in the training process it was finding the rubik's cube everywhere and around step 750 it sort of found it in two places it's getting more and more accurate and you know i might venture to say that i can stop this from training because it's done but this is the sort of like metric this map metric which is mean average precision a measure of a performance of an object detection model it summarizes both the position how many of the predicted bounding boxes correspond to the true bounding boxes as well as its recall which measures how many of the true bounding boxes have been correctly predicted by the model so i would like to see this at a hundred percent um we can look through all the different example images this is probably good enough for me to try running it in my own application right now but let's let it train a little bit more and i'm pretty happy with how tiny yolo is working so since that is a faster smaller model it's probably the one i'll want to use i wonder if this is something i believe tiny yolo is compatible with javascript and i wonder if this is something that runway i mean i realized the business model here is to use their cloud servers but i wonder if there is a possibility of doing like an export to javascript so i could download a sort of like local i think you can download any mod it does let you download any model that you've trained so you can work with it locally but i would what i would like to download is a javascript compatible one okay that was confusing as hell right nitrous oxide apologies i don't know which part was confusing but um you know i'm kind of just bouncing around between a lot of different things so i recognize that this could be confusing all right so we've got some nonanonymous people welcome welcome to this glitch application so what do i one of the things that i've been wanting to make as an example for my course um and i'm going to go back this is very ridiculous what i'm doing here um i'm going to i can't believe this is what i'm doing but it's too late for me i'll log into this one and i'm going to look for models i want to look for a particular model called spade uh spade landscapes so this is an image uh segmentation model which will allow me to like it says generate realistic images of landscapes from sketches and doodles let's take a look at this one and why see it's me asking me to make a new workspace again i don't get it i don't get it uh coding train three electric boogaloo okay um now we're in this model i'm going to choose an input source which will be a segmentation and i'm going to run this model so runway again one of the reasons why i love using runway is i can just immediately play around and see how the model works before trying to build it into my own application so let's look at how this model works while it's booting up this is an image segmentation model what does that mean usually an image segmentation model is for doing the inverse of what i'm about to do we can see this in let's see if i go to ml5 and look at body picks for example this is an image segmentation model actually let's look at um unet i'm just curious about this one um let's go here really quickly and see if i can grab one of the examples and i'm just curious to see if this works i haven't run this one in a while ah open broadcast studio virtual camera uh so frustrating here when i uh let me just let me just search uh body pics so this is what image segmentation typically does it takes the as the input the image and labels different pixels of the image as part of a given segment so in the body pics model it's able to recognize the human form and label different parts as torso green maybe thigh as purple right thigh left thigh head and sort of segment the image that way and you could use that for a variety of different creative applications that i'm sure are swimming around in your head right now what i love about the inverse of that for example if i come back to this particular image segmentation model is that it's doing the reverse it's this is a generative model it's generating an image and i am providing the segments via a color map so i'm going to create a scene oh this is like perfect for doing like like a bob ross like pseudo fake i should really set that up and just have like a little wig and a little like thing that i can paint colors on and have it generate the landscape for me this is great that'll that'll be next halloween or april fool's day but i can sort of paint over here because this is where the grass should be and you can see it's starting to generate this image below then i'm going to add a river that's going to flow like through here i don't know if this makes sense let's add a river i don't know that's very weird what i'm doing let's draw some trees some trees here and some clouds in the sky and there we go oh look at my beautiful landscape i am such an artiste um so what i have done with this model um is i have generated this image from this segment map so this is fun to play around with runway and um if this is all i want to do then great but what if i wanted to create my own p5.js sketch or processing sketch or other type of app software application where the uh the segment map is the segmentation map is generated a different way i actually what i want to do right now is just recreate exactly this so i want to go look at that glitch template and recreate exactly this interaction but with the with my own code so first i'm going to hit stop then i'm going to go to well actually one thing i really want to do is click this export colors because i really need to get the colors right so let's click um export colors um and it came in as an uh csv so i'll take a look at that um in a moment let's just put that over there whoops how come you didn't show up over here where are you colors um and i'll find that later let's go to um whoops let's host this model and host the model i'm going to have to not show you my api keys to turn this one off just i don't need that one on i'm going to go here so now i want how do you do this in runway if this is my project i think i can still do remix so i'm going to re i'm going to show you the process of starting with my template and remixing it so i'm going to hit remix and then this will be and ideally my goal here is to create like many many many examples in glitch of working with different models in runway um so i'm going to call this a spade coding train oh that's a coco ding train yeah it's got to have the choo choo on there this is everything here we go right no put a little dash there there we go this is like the best name of any glitch project ever spade coco ding train uh now i'm going to hit and look at this so i should be going to the env files and nothing is there so just to be safe and secure i'm going to make my daily limit 5 to make sure that as i start putting this in there if my token goes out into the wild or the url this project goes out into the wild i'll i'll have some protections it's fine let's just make it 100. um and then the server i'm suggesting doesn't need to change the server is totally generic as long as i send my request to the runway ml endpoint on the server the inputs come in go to the model the outputs go out so i just want to work on my p5 code so here i am in sketch.js um this is and i need to do this differently so very quickly um let's not worry about runway for a second this image should be send uh it should it should be called send image because i am not sending a vector the input to spade cocoa is an image oh yeah okay so um i'm going to take i'm not going to worry about this just yet so let's actually comment all this out just for the time being um and let's uh let's look at this in a new window failed to start there's an error in my project right the error in the project which i can see here by going probably under tools under logs is that there is no um valid token so hold on hold off on that i will i'll put the token in in a little bit and what i want to do here is instead let's say background 255 function draw i'm gonna say uh ellipse i'm gonna make this in the simplest way if mouse is pressed ellipse mouse x mouse y uh 32. so obviously i would probably in the sort of fantasy way of doing this i would want to create a whole drawing interface where i can select colors and change the size i'm not going to do any of that right now i just want to see uh it draw and let me get one of the colors so if i go to the desktop and i think this is the colors can i open this with i don't know what um visual studio code can i actually just bring this in to like assets well no i don't want to open numbers are you insane uh great so here we go so let's start with sky which is this color um and i i could lo i would want to load from this file and make this much fancier but again i'm doing the quickest hello world version of this i can think no stroke a fill and just use that hex color and by the way i i think there's a way to disable these but because of the weirdness of p5 and how it uses the global namespace for its functions glitch always thinks these are errors nobody knows how to just like tell glitch to stop um that would be good i copied the html code into the style.css file i certainly did when did i do that it's so weird is that like in all of the in my template i did that let's just take that out i don't know why what what happened there that was very weird um so the glitch app is attempting to wake up but i'm gonna need those api keys so let's let's go so what i'm actually i think i'm going to go back to hosted models runway and i'm going to grab if i click on this it's going to copy the api key to the clipboard oops sorry i'm missing i'm going to go back to this view and i'm going to right now i'm going to attempt to put the api key into the uh runway i'm into the env file without you seeing it let's get the model url just so i stopped getting those errors so i've got the model url and the token and i'm going back to my code and that is now done and i can show it to you again all right so i have put the api keys into the dot env file um and uh now i should see this send vector is not defined where did i put send vector in send image send oh whoops right so let's also comment this out great so now so now i can draw just by i i can only draw one color and i can only um go and draw one color and i can only um draw one color and one thickness sorry what was the other part ah i'm getting tired it's five o'clock we're going to do this then the object detection model oh i was going to do commute i gotta do some community contributions yeah um so okay next let me rethink this a little bit i'm gonna make the background that color so the background will already be sky and then i think i'll just try to draw clouds so if i go look at the assets where did i upload that oh no it's here um clouds oh clouds is just this so let's just try it with sky and i'm drawing although let's try c i'm just curious here let's try c um so if i say fill here and now it's going to default with and i can draw excuse me the c down here coming back let's make this a little bit bigger just so i can do it more quickly great now what do i need to do i need to send the and i what i want to show you is going to leak my keys again but that's fine i'll regenerate them i need to adjust this code so the first thing that i need to do is get the image in a format that i can use to send to runway and the way that i will do that is by turning it into a base64 encoding of that image so how does that work i am going to say image64 equals canvas you need to make a variable to store the canvas when and what happened all the red dots went away i talked about it they disappeared did somebody do something to make that happen what is going on oh my goodness ah okay so simon is clarifying thank you simon for this my use of language here i'm talking about image segmentation models and then i was saying what we're doing really is the inverse of it and there actually there is a specific name for that it's called a reverse image segmentation model thank you for that um clarification um so uh imagecanvas.elt so let's talk about what's going on here canvas is a variable that's holding on to a p5 canvas object the p5 canvas object is a wrapper of the native javascript browser canvas dom element that happens to exist in the dot elt property and then i should be able to say to data url is that the right name of the function let's look this up to data url javascript yeah so the to data url function returns a data uri containing a representative of the image into the format specified by the type parameter defaults to png so there's a lot of ways i could configure this but this particular function is what i want to turn the image essentially into a string now it seems like a crazy thing when i turn the image into a string i think i've talked about this in some of my video tutorials but this makes it very convenient to pass it over a uh a post request to send it to a web server um okay so now where was i here so did i get the name of the function right ah i didn't actually it's to data url with capital url so that would go here and let's just this is a little bit ridiculous for me to do this but let's just console.log it so we can see if this works i'll paint a little bit hit generate and there it is this is the entire image encoded as a base64 string of characters um so now if i go back to here i don't want to console.log that i want to create my post request and the inputs are now this is what i need to look up in runway i don't recall what the inputs are i know it's the image it's probably something like this is probably what i send it but i'm not entirely sure i need to look it up in runway but it's going to show my api token so i don't mind i'm going to show you how to do it with showing your api token and then quickly regenerate your api token so first i'm going to do is i'm going to disable the model so it's not active then i'm going to click on view the code snippet and that's where it's showing my api key and i can see the input says ah it's called semantic map so what i'm sending is something called a semantic map and then the property the value that's the property name the value is a base64 image so um let us how do i do the regenerate the token edit right down here so this is me regenerating the api key which i'm going to do and i'm not going to let you see the regenerated one i'm going to copy it i'm going to put it into my env file the new token is there go back to sketch.js where am i where am i where am i let's turn i can come back to show you let's turn the model back on activate it um and uh this is supposed to be now we remember a semantic map so that's semantic map and send it to runway uh wait for the res outputs and i don't let's just look at console log outputs okay so i'm going to look at the output that comes back let's refresh this page hit generate sending the image now it'll probably take quite some time for oh it came back look there we go i have an output which is guess what a base64 encoded image status success and the count is going up so i can go back to the code and i can now um put this stuff back in um the outputs it wasn't well what was it called was it it wasn't called image was it so weird um why do i have an error now oh i have two things called image 64. uh input image 64. 764. let's call it that that's why i'll just leave this one this you know i'll just rename this variable to landscape because why not um and then i forgot what it's daily limit reached come on people have a little pity on me here come on you don't don't you want to bring generated landscape imagery out into the world in a way that we can all enjoy um i am going to against my better judgment go to here set this back to zero and try to beat everybody great so oh it's so this is this is something this is another bit of feedback for the for those of you who are taking notes it's weird that the property is called output here and in skygen it was called image like i feel like that would make sense for that to be pretty consistent across runway models so i wouldn't have to keep changing it for every example um so but here under sketch.js i'm going to call this now outputs dot output and the this is a spade coco generated a landscape and let's try this one more time i need to refresh the page oh there we got it look at this that's my generated sky let's draw some ocean on it and try to be faster than all of you people and there's the ocean oh this is so cool and i'm at eight thank you people please please all right um i guess what i'll do just to shut it off for a minute here um so this is why i should run this stuff locally so only i could run it and then deploy it to glitch but so i want to do something now i want to change the code i want um i want to make a variable called output image and that is going to be output image dot create image blank so i want to create an image dom element that's sitting below the canvas and then rather than make a new one here i just want to take the existing one let me put the alt text in hopefully this works i have not tried to do this before um let's put this in here and i think i can say like output image dot elt dot source equals image 64. right this would be setting the source of the image to that base64 encoding which would make it appear in the drum element i think is that right does anybody know uh um cannot read property create image of undefined oh equals create image okay all right so now all right i've disabled it if you could please hold off on running this for a moment i guess i could make it a private project but i think um let's see if this works great and then if i do this it generate uh daily limit reach come on people we're gonna use this isn't even a sponsored live stream i'm using up all my credits i don't even know um all right back over here i'm gonna be doing my object my model detection my sorry my um my object detection example i'm gonna be doing that locally you won't be able to see it uh i just want to see if i can get i want to see if it'll replace it with the new one all right so that works now if i do this and hit generate again great awesome it's working shutting you down people all right so this works now that it's going to always update this one and maybe i don't need 640 by 480 just to be able to see it um what i'm going to do now is have it update uh as i'm drawing so this is going to use a lot of requests and this is where i would want probably more like a socket connection or something to the model but let's just sort of see um let's see what happens here so if i go back to sketch.js and then essentially this send image function i am going to call it recursively i am going to call it immediately when the program starts and then every time after i've updated the image i'm going to call send image again and let's see let me set the count back down to zero let me turn the model back on to activate it and now it should be updating um as i draw so i didn't pick like really smart colors here but you can see here as i'm drawing it's updating below and i should obviously turn this off um i should certainly um what am i saying i should certainly like so there's lots more next steps to this but i just wanted to save this as a basic um example and i'm realizing here also this should say spade spade coco p5.js example i think actually i should publish the example with the generate button so i just want to i just want to clean i wanted to show you how it worked to do it continuously but i'm going to take that out i'm going to take this out i'm going to take this out and um i just want to leave this let's what would happen if i made this 320 by 240 would it still work just as well so i think it would just sort of be easier to see um uh yeah actually so this should i it should do this first because i do want to see that always filled up let's turn this back on um let's go to the server and i'm gonna set the count to one whatever it may be and now let's just see if this is working again it's weird why why is that why isn't it why won't it put the image next to it well whatever so now if i draw here and click generate there we go great and i can turn it off all right this example is finished thank you for watching what was the thing that i wanted to fix here oh i don't think i need the console log um here right now okay all right so this you can use um as an example to um work with a runway all right um let's take a look at our i really gotta do let's do some community contributions it's 5 20. i got to finish up here going to be done soon um uh okay hey everybody it's time it's quite late in this stream usually i try to do this at the beginning it's a nice way to start off and say hello to the community and people watching the coding train but i it's very important to me that every live stream i show some of you work because you the people of the coding train are what power the train itself you are the engine that produces the steam that drives the train uh so let's go on over to our discord and i am going to type in the wheel command and what happened what happened to the wheel what happened to the wheel i think the stream chat bot is down oh it's because we can find it it's right up here so here's the wheel of community contributions um thank you to david and oh um king over here on the uh i forgot the user's name who did some of these new features um let's spin the wheel so this pulls from some of the contributions that are on the website um and ultimate didn't we look at ultimate tictactoe i kind of remember looking at this one already am i wrong about that uh i looked we looked at this one yeah well did we i really haven't remember i looked at somebody's ultimate sec tick toe but this now looks unfamiliar to me let's move this over by the way so i'm not in front of it so much also i like to see my friendly masked sun there um where where were we here okay so take turns playing on the highlighted board however you move determines where your opponent will place their next move the first player concord board claims that board right ultimate tictactoe is playing mini games of tictactoe inside a larger tictactoe board oh i see i don't really know what's going on here but this is really cool wait why does it switch so i'm playing both players oh you don't put you do one board at a time it just does a random one next so you each get a turn in one cell and then you get a turn in oh oh it it goes around randomly so like you really have an advantage if you get lucky right like this is just luck now oh who's going to win i'm playing against myself i'm rooting for o i think o is just friend more friendly looking than um x come on oh you can do it place your bets people place your bets wait oh x gets to go again shouldn't this square be done oh it's got to go here oh it's going to go here all right oh looking good oh uh oh yeah this one's already done where am i now oh x next gonna block o where are we now here here x i must finish this must finish um it's not random i'm being told uh interesting but o has a good spot oh where where am i now here x is going to go there oh can i get three in a row like that probably not right uh oh where where am i now here x oh yeah come on oh you can do it so don't tell me the logic of which one the game ends when three oh a move yeah someone tell me the logic of which one it picks i'm curious um where are we where are we oh x is doing really well whoever wins this down here oh didn't oh just win didn't oh just win oh no x had already won that one it's very i'm very confused uh okay wait wait wait and now i'm i'm lost people uh oh is it over i'm so confused what happened oh there's no o can go maybe wherever it wants yeah okay now it's over right yeah oh one thank you this is pretty cool i think like i'm like two hours into a live stream my brain is like nonfunctioning suppose you okay the square you select in the mini board determines which mini board the next player will play in oh can you start a new game and let the chat play it'll be havoc to read but it'll be fun for us says adrian this is an excellent suggestion however um i don't have a mechanism for um doing that so i think i'm this is really wonderful i apologize to the creator of this for me being um the brain dead person that i am amrit ammar um that i did not understand the logic here also i'm playing against myself so who knows what i would have done with that logic but now it makes sense to me that there is sort of like a meta strategy inside the regular tictactoe strategy which is really interesting to think about i would love for it to i think some of the color choices are could be more evident and you might be able to use like a fill even also to like highlight the active square i'm often confused like you know something to like separate the individual three by three tiles might be helpful so i think there are some visual augmentations you could make here to make the sort of like the distinctive areas and and the sort of interactions more clear um but um this is a fantastic project ding the bell ring the train whistle and let's move on to uh look at one more spin that wheel well there's a lot of tictactoe ones coming up today resizable tictactoe let's look at this one resizable tictactoe pvsp click oh this one i did look at i definitely remember this one right this one we've looked at before so one of the things we need to do one of the things i would like to do hi code guppy again welcome thank you code guppy a member of the coding train um so um thank you code guppy all right now um well i we looked at this so one of the things that i really would like to do is make some improvements and advancements in this sort of community contribution sharing system uh the wheel is great i think there's probably some nice design upgrades we could do with it um having a sort of a database or an api that keeps track of what i've shown or kind of like tries to um highlight people who haven't had their things shown i know there's a lot more that can be done with it so apologies apologies for skipping that one but i'm really sure that i looked at that one before in a previous so let's let's spin the wheel and look at one more yeah this one i also we also did look at because i remember that raycasting was spelled wrong ray casing with pie game so i'm just gonna double check and confirm but i i have a very yeah i have a very specific memory that this one came up already let's like refresh the wheel entirely to get 10 new selections and spin that wheel i think we need some music to bring us better luck and guess what everybody the coding train is brought to you today by tictactoe it's a simple game fun to play for all the family and yet it seems to be what everyone is so let's take a look at it by gamer5000 raw gamer 5000. i'm mispronouncing your name on purpose okay uh we can change the size and we can play look at this it's cool so much tictactoe i love how you can do this in real time it'd be interesting to think about if you would started to play it and um you resized it and it kept what you had played so far like you're sort of zooming out let's see let's see if there's any interesting thing that happens when you win animating the line drawing yeah welcome to the tictactoe coding channel youtube channel where every week we talk about the game tictactoe how do you play it what does it mean where did you come from who loves tictactoe more than me nobody yes all right one more one more one more that was a little weird that like yes that i did that was that made me uncomfortable i hope you're doing all right oh it's the editable game of life remember the editable the edible game of life all right we looked at that last week we've got um 10 print i'm excited for this a web 10 print is one of my favorite coding challenges that people contribute to um just to look at it briefly it's this coding challenge um it's actually i don't i don't know if anyone broke the record but this is one has so many contributions it's a really really simple uh system of drawing uh one of two possible lines in a grid that's famously from this one line commodore 64 program um if you're not familiar i think if i just go to tenprint.org with this book by this collection of wonderful authors all about the sort of like history of it's really in a way it's like looking at the history of creative computing through the lens of this one line of code highly recommend this wonderful book let's take a look at this particular version of it by near b oh this is cool this is interesting so at first i thought huh this looks to me like it is essentially um identical to the original 10 print challenge and i was about to say that's wonderful there's no reason why anybody shouldn't feel free to submit their own version of basically the exact same thing and getting it working however there's something quite different here and i i now have a very clear picture in my head of what i am assuming is going on here but i'm curious to let to see if the chat um you know i know you're about 30 seconds behind me here so i'll have to sort of vamp for a second but if anyone in the chat wants to try to make a guess as to what is going on here why how is this different from the the example if i just go back to it again if i just look at my particular example which is this from the actual video itself looks very similar but there is a different quality to it let's refresh this just to see it again so zork master says i feel like that's using some sort of noise that's my thought exactly too so i'm assuming that what this is doing is it's mapping the probability or not just mapping the probability it's picking the left line or right line or the whichever direction the line is going based off of most likely some purlin noise like algorithm rather than pure randomness so in pure randomness and if i one thing we can do that's nice if i go to full here um we can see um i can quickly click over to look at the code and you can see noise x off y off so very quickly it's you can see how it's i'm checking to see if the value is less than 50 or greater than 50. so just to demonstrate this more clearly if i were to replace that with a random number between 0 and 100 that's what we'll get oh but also the line has a different um it looks to me like it's always brighter when pointing to the right is it tying its stroke also to the noise value or the random value in this case that's really interesting i didn't think of that so those are the looks like the two changes if i if i take that out we can see here this is the original 10 print code but by changing it to uh using uh a noise algorithm over a two dimensional space and then additionally and i already like um got rid of that but additionally changing the sort of um the weight of the stroke weight of the line or actually it's not the stroke weight it's the the brightness of the line that's those are really clever um adjustments to maker there's so there's so many rich and deep possible kinds of things you could do with this one algorithm that's just ah i love it so much okay uh unoriginal pun has woken up in um australia is that right where are you located on original pond welcome to uh the live stream i am going to have some water here and i'm removing myself we are finishing up here but um i'm gonna do one more thing before we go so let us go back to the rubik's cube um i need to sign out of runway here and go back to this account because i'm a lunatic the uh rubik the tiny one completed you can see oh the other one is at 97 so we could compare and contrast these but let's look at this one so this one uh trained completed let's add it to the workspace um we're going to call this coding train demo i'm going to i'm going to give myself a lot more space here i'm going to just test it out here in the browser with camera then i can select the actual webcam here um let's run the model and wait for it to pop up here and see how well this goes this is exciting okinawa oh unoriginal pun i have got to get in touch with you i knew there was some reason why okinawa japan was in my head okay we'll be in touch on discord i've got i've got to speak to you about okinawa japan all right let's see so this is what i was told this was happening to me the other day this i'm told is a bug in the runway interface the fact that it is uh flickering back and forth to the edge so this means i've really got to do it on my own unfortunately i cannot abide by people um um going to the the url of the glitch project in real time i suppose i could like go to full screen and glitch or like this and then you can't see the or maybe what let's do it this way this is kind of cruel of me but um or i could just i could just develop i'm going to develop this locally can't i just like i can clone a glitch project right so if i go back to this will be good good for us to know how to do when i have to sneeze so badly right now i'm going to mute the mic oh that was the most amazing sneeze of my whole life do i have a box of kleenex up here somewhere in the attic i can reach the ceiling a nice tin ceiling here in the attic i don't have a box of kleenex i think i'll be all right for just a few minutes um whoa what happened the camera is doing some crazy adjust color adjusting here all right so um let's go back to the runway template now there is a way if i go to edit project how do i get the um the github url of a project somebody will somebody will know this and tell me in the chat tools custom domains import import export here he is git url so that's where it is by the way under um tools custom sorry under tools import export get url so let's go back to terminal here um let's see if we can clone it so i'm going to develop this locally just because i want to like keep the key not i don't think i can keep the key secure but i don't want to like use up a zillion requests to um the runway uh library and i just want to um be able to operate it just myself i think you'll all understand why okay so what's it called now runway ml template perfect um let's open up the code so here it is i need to make a dot env file and if i look in here the things that i need are i i can kind of not worry about the daily limit right now so i'll just make it a thousand so that i kind of have something in there um i need to get a where do i create the model how come i don't see this i'm so blind there it is runway url runway url equals and runway token so let's go to runway and um close all this stuff oh stop there i was using up some credits there just running it let's do network let's host this model uh host model and i'm going to get the api key actually let me where do i have i wanted to just sort of test it with sky gan let me just test this with sky gan just to make sure it's working where do i go model workspace back to models sky gan sky gan network host this model host this model so i am going to grab the model url put it in the url then i'm going to grab the token the api no the api the api key i don't know why i call it runway token i guess that makes sense it's an api key i'm going to remove my screen paste it in hit save hit close and come back so i believe now if i were to uh run this whoops uh oh i guess i need to do npm install to install the node modules run the server nope writing out count not a number what's going on here count 100 writing out count not a number check day oh i forgot about this whole check day thing this is weird i mean i don't really care about this right now so i'm just going to comment this out i don't know why that's not working i have a thing that i wrote that it resets the count every day so my rate limiting is like 100 requests per day but i'm just going to like comment this out because i don't really need to worry about the rate limiting right now the url provide is not your hosted model must be in the format i think i did something wrong with getting the hosted model so hold on people uh going back to here looking at my.env file oh i know what the problem is i know what the problem is nobody has actually did i actually figured out before the chat did oh how exciting so um let me close the dot in via file so here's the problem the problem is that like loading the uh information from the dot env file works out of the box on glitch glitch is set up to know about it automatically but i need to use the dot env package then only the dot env file will only be loaded if i require the the npm package.env and call the config function so i should say node npm i dot env so i have that now and now i should be able to say node server what's this shrink wrap thing okay great so the app is going and it's listening on port i guess i why did it why did it pick that port i guess there's some weird things i have to change when i'm doing this locally uh process.env port oh um well i want to put this in the env file but i have to every time i look at the emv file it's like danger danger will robinson um port i'll just do three thousand um close that and okay so i should be able to go to localhost 3000 and click generate oh it's doing it already let's make sure this works great i got my sky gan and look at this the count is just going up by one each time because nobody else can run this but all right so let's now change this over to using the object detection model um so i am going to go to my p5 sketch i am going to say let video video equals create cap create capture video then uh video dot hide function draw image video zero zero and uh width height so let's not worry about send vector or uh calling that right now or the oh i'm gonna keep the generate button in there right now okay allow and of course we have the obs virtual camera i will switch this i can just do it like this why i have to do this always and forever okay i've got my video showing up there next up we've done this is all the same that i already did i should go grab actually i'm going to do that let's go back to the glitch project that i was working on spade coco choo choo coatings spade coco um let's grab this this is a much better function for me to use um as my basis um now i don't know i don't believe it's called semantic map my guess is it's called image and what's coming back is not an image so i can get rid of that let's take a look at what comes back so i'm just guessing that this is what i'm supposed to send to runway the other thing i need to do of course is go to my hosted models and check and get the rubik's cube url now i've got to go back to my.env file again sorry everybody i'm going to the dot env file dot env file now i'm going back to runway and i'm getting the api key i'm putting the api key in my.env file there it is and now i am going back to sketch.js closing the dot env file excellent and i think i should be able to say let's do let's create button like uh detect let's call this object detect and then call this object detect so i'm not 100 sure this is all correct but in theory when i press the button it'll send the image of the video uh to runway the server node server will manage that and give me back the outputs which presumably would have the label of the thing it found the xy width height let's see so i need to go to here hit refresh let's hold this up ah cannot read property to your data url of undefined i guess i didn't check what i was doing here what am i reading uh canvas so actually this should be the video i want to take the video uh and and turn that into a data url and send it so this is a case where i don't want to send the canvas so hopefully that's all i needed to do there's an error to drill could not be function ah you know what it is video canvas and i probably have to say video load pixels i think in order to turn it into a data url i need to not look at the dom element but the canvas associated with the dom element that has the pixel data loaded on it i think we'll find out i'll try it without load pixels in a second detect okay wow it froze everything up that's weird and shouldn't say like console log not saying console log sending image hmm let's check one of the things that you should always check when you're doing this is is the model awake or asleep this is weird that the model is not waking it should be turning yellow here all right let's let me double check what it's looking for um let me double check what it's looking for so i'm going to switch back to just showing me because when i look at the runway example code it has the api key in it image threshold i also need a threshold so i'm just going to show this to you without the api key visible so in runway the inputs are the image the base64 image as well as a threshold i would assume it's using a default threshold and then i should get back bounding boxes categories and scores so let me make sure everything is right here let me make sure the url and the token is correct in the dot env file yeah looks absolutely looks right um server let's console.logs is there any error in the server i didn't actually check oh the requests are going through i i know i need to show you my screen but why i'm kind of confused because this should show it as waking up ooh sky gan is waking up because somebody's running that glitch application i should turn this one off uh that's not the one that i'm using right now um let's go here and you know maybe i just need to also add threshold 0.5 let's try that threshold 0.5 and let's make sure that base64 image is actually working properly it just got stuck there okay froze so that's definitely a base64 image where did it get stuck though i don't log understanding images oh i got an error here the model experienced an error while processing your input double check that you are sending properly formed input parameters hosted model.info method so let's do that boy this was this was this is supposed to be the end like i'm like it's almost six o'clock i'm going an hour later than i said but i really want to get this to work uh let's turn this off uh take close these things uh close these things um so let's look again um looking at the code snippet uh threshold number from point zero one to point to one this is weird um okay so i'm just gonna do something here in the server and when i run the server i'm gonna call model.info just to make sure that that's working properly so let's do that something weird is going on right that your app is in port 3000 count 100 why is this not communicating with the model let's add some additional console logs here ah there we go okay default okay this is the inputs are channels three default name image type image default point five minimum consonant score max one threshold name threshold okay so image base64 image and then i should get objects back so maybe the model oh it's awake now i know something i guess maybe something was going weird with it let's refresh this page oh there we go the bounding boxes came back rubik's scores status success bounding boxes looks like these are normalized values now why why why why why why did this stop why did that stop on the client function draw oh hold on i have something i have to do on my phone the alarm went off i have to do this at six o'clock so at 5 59 i need to uh stop for a second why what's so weird what happened here that caused it to stop let's let's it's just um okay now i'm going to detect call detect that's still going why did the canvas stop why did draw i mean i recognize that this is like an this is an asynchronous function did like the load pixels act of loading the pixels let's let's comment this out see if it works ah so load pixels messes it up but it can't get the um can i call like update pixels and that'll like get it going again no that's like a p5 bug it shouldn't be doing that all right i'm not gonna this is a p5 bug that's unrelated to what i'm trying to do so i'm gonna just not worry about that for because i i gotta stop i gotta stop live streaming somebody will help me uh figure this out i have two minutes so i need to do something very important on my phone but uh i have an activity that i do with my kids and you have to book it 48 hours in advance or you know due to like covid restrictions um and if i don't do it right at six it's for like monday at six it doesn't like i you have to join the waitlist so i'm watching the clock here um so let's just draw um let's do it this way um let's i could copy it you know what i could do this is making me annoyed that i want to fix this even though it feels like a p5 bug uh let video copy oh i can just do this can i do this ah it does the same thing because get is gonna load the pixels of the video in order to copy it okay never mind i won't worry about this let's look at what comes out bounding boxes okay nothing um so let's um i think if i do uh make a variable called detections is an empty array and then if i say detections equals outputs dot bounding boxes is that what it was called let's actually oops let's get 558 when says 5 59 i'm gonna stop for a second you know i'ma stop now you guys have to bear with me while i refresh a page on my phone over and over again and then i'm gonna finish this off this is such a weird thing i'm doing sunday monday 6 pm you all will think of me at 6 00 p.m on monday if i get this too early to join too early to join too early to join too early to join too early to join too early to join really to join really to join too early to join too early to join too early to join to really join that's good come on change the six o'clock already really enjoy it's really to join it's really just refreshing this over and over again too early to join early to join yeah join join join join yes i got it okay monday at six o'clock all right excellent uh so the bounding boxes are uh an array with four values in it and i assume this is normalized to the width and the height so i could say here now in draw four let i equal zero i is less than what did i call this detections sections dot length uh let cube equals detections index i and then i want to say x equals dot zero times width y equals cube one dot dot height times height what do we think do we think these are the width and height of the box or do we think this is the bottom right corner of the box does it explain that to me anywhere i mean looking at those numbers what would you guess i don't think they're the width and the height that would be huge must be the bottom right and bottom the corner so i think i would then say x x1 y1 x2 y2 2 and three and then i could think i could say rect mode corners i think that's what it is in p5 if instead of specifying the xy width and height i want to specify the corners and then i would draw a rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2 stroke 255 no fill stroke weight uh let's make it pretty thick eight all right let's try this now so um no rubik's cube the model must have gone to sleep during all that time this model has trouble waking up it seems so that's green i'm impatient oh i'm so close to being done with this live stream wow why did it break so this is also a weird bug which i would uh sort of assume is maybe a runway issue where did i have that querying the model yeah all right let's restart the server so the model's not returning oh there we no the info yet i suppose i could try oh it's yellow that's a good sign it's waking up if anybody has watched this entire stream has been taking notes on all the different runwayrelated things that have come up that would be so amazing to compile i would be forever grateful but with even with like the time codes of what they are because i want to get in touch with the runway folks um after this is the audio peaking by the way i'm seeing a lot of red actually in my i'm turning down the uh gain a little bit i'm seeing a lot of red in the um monitor i'm using still yellow ah no it it it's it's awake i think okay no bounding box there we go amazing oh this is so cool a custom trained object detection model working like essentially perfectly i mean look how good this is this is crazy the thing is i wanted to get it to work in real time and i don't understand why the video is frozen whenever i call load pixels such a strange thing so that's i guess i'm gonna have to work that out later i'm gonna publish this the glitch right now um with obviously without the the environment variables if anybody wants to you don't need like you could work on debugging this for me without the runway call like for example this should still work just fine if um you know i don't actually if i if i if i don't actually query runway like just the act of loading the pixels right so if you want to debug this for help debug this for me with p5 like if i take out all of this just comment all of this out right now let's be sure about this refresh it right just the act of calling load pixels freezes the canvas element of the video it's not supposed to do that and i don't recall that it used to do that i wonder if that's a like new bug and i mean i'm using the latest p5 i mean again i've got to stop so i've got to turn this off but that's one of the first things i would do is go back and try earlier versions um this this feels like a bug in p5 so let's just wrap all this up by um i'm gonna put this back in um i am going to add a how do i do this i'm going to add a dot env file no not in public a dot ev file sorry um i don't come on make a new file down here thank you a dot get ignore that's what i want to do and in dot get ignored uh ignore emv node modules um i don't really need this but that's fine count is fine that's fine readme find server i don't know what this is i don't know what this shrink wrap yaml thing is let me just take that out because i don't need that for what i'm doing that's it seems like a glitch thing i can also take this out um okay so now uh let's make a branch called main um let's call this sorry what am i doing this is updating to work with object detection then i'm going to go to github.com codingtrain um what is this runway ml object detection uh object detection object detection model with runway ml node.js and p5.js um no i don't want to create a repository i do want to create a repository but i'm using an existing repository so there we go then okay so this is what i want to do add this whoops origin get a remote dash v oh cause get remote remove origin okay oh yeah okay and then git push origin main i guess so now all the code for it is here um and i can put that in this chord if anybody wants to look at it let's see did the just streambot come back no uh run object detection um okay there we go so this is the if you're in the discord under live under links that's the github repo and why not just put this on glitch now i should be able to do um so the runway ml template that was the first one the spade coco ding train choo choo runway ml template is the next one for spade coco and now new project import from github i think this will work um and just paste this in import from github there here let's see what happens let's re well i'll let it load let's give it a minute here so this is the end by the way everybody um i'll be back hopefully next saturday we'll be taking at least one saturday off in um let me pause this for a second i will be taking at least one saturday off in november i i scheduled to take the saturday of thanksgiving weekend off um i am not going anywhere for thanksgiving i am not having anyone come over for thanksgiving it is i don't think it's really safe or advisable to do so um you know everyone's got to make their own decision of course um you know following their your local guidelines and laws um but so it's conceivable that i might live stream that weekend but um we'll see a lot is going on this is a very busy time of year with the nyu semester which is wrapping up soon which is a good thing for me in terms of more time to stream but um let's just see here i i believe if i look at this there shouldn't be anything in there yeah right so this you can now also find this project although i want to rename it to runway ml object detection so now i should be able to you should be able to see this project as well here oops i'm it's on the readme sorry about that so um i don't i'm going to disable the model right now um and the api keys aren't in this anyway but so that that wraps that up so what is coming next on the coding train yesterday on friday um i recorded four uh secret there there are five i have five in the can now five video tutorials to come out the first one is using ml5 convolutional neural network part one the second is using ml5 convolutional neural network part two the third is using the ml5 pretrained convolutional neural network model doodle net the fourth is uh posting gifs from your discord bot and the fifth is oh no the fourth is dot in using a dot env file to hide your api keys with a discord bot which if you watch today's stream you you're familiar with that somewhat and the fifth is posting gifs so hopefully those will come out soon um if you um i've been doing um recording sessions on fridays it's a little bonus if you want to join as a member i will you can sort of tune in to those um recording sessions if you're not a member don't worry you're really not missing anything because ultimately all the content from those recording sessions get released eventually but if you want a little early access or to interact in that way you're welcome to join the coding train membership program um hopefully at least one of them will come out next week my process has really slowed down for better or worse um but i'm working with uh doing some video editing and getting the descriptions and the captions and all that stuff done before they are released um i'm looking in the chat to see if there's any questions or otherwise things coming out question mark wheel ah i'm told the prefix changed there we go question mark wheel the prefix uh in in trainbot 2.0 just streambot had changed okay um so anyway i hope you enjoyed today's live stream i feel like last week was such a you know disaster it's an unmitigated disaster i suppose to put it away hey patricia parker hold the presses stop pause let's everybody take a moment to welcome patricia parker welcome for boarding the coding train we'll ring the bell for you and blow the train whistle your membership is greatly appreciated it is really just i've been honored and thrilled and thankful um and for each member of the coding trade at some point you will get some stickers in the mail i'm getting myself that's actually been um actually the sticker mailing process is really working quite well much better than it ever has before so stay tuned for more about that that's happening soon um a lot of you got them recently but all of you have joined the last few weeks um you should be getting them soon i know poor david has been waiting like two years and there was like some a lot of mixups that happened so i apologize to david but patricia your random number is and again we really need a system for keeping track of all these on page 187 row 9 308 column 4 73 thousand eight hundred and three thank you patricia reset my song uh greetings lars from denmark um i know i i was thinking what i would do actually with the um tutorial about how to post a gif to your discord bot that i would release two versions of it one with me saying gif and one with me saying jiff it'd be exactly the same tutorial but i'd have two videos i think i really will do this so i'm just gonna have to dub it over or use machine learning or something i think i should dub it over actually but just that you know and then this is where you post your gif and then this is where you post your chat so i think that'll be pretty awesome um all right bruno's asked me if i regenerated all the keys leaked early i think i did but i i think i i either regenerated or then i disabled the models i'm i'm i'm letting this run for another two minutes i'll answer any questions that i see in the chat um by the way what's fun what's funny to me about the membership thing is i literally that message will come in if somebody just happened to join at this time not actually tuning into i know i said this livestream so patricia i don't know if you're actually there but please um make sure you if you are there patricia make sure you sign up and get information about the the discord yes the way it's pronounced is definitely um gif that's how it's pronounced am i from denmark i am not from denmark have i ever been to denmark nobody asked that question but i'm asking it no i have never been to denmark that is i've got to get to denmark an unoriginal pun if you're still watching i gotta talk to you about okinawa japan um i'm in the market for a place to live for a little while and i have fantasies of going to various places and for some okinawa japan is kind of on my list uh if uh patricia is here hi patricia um if you uh live somewhere beautiful and amazing in the world uh i have a um what i'm hoping is a six months period where i could with my family go in a little adventure you know assuming this is far off in the future i'm kind of assuming that um the world will hopefully be mostly recovered from the pandemic currently that's a huge assumption obviously but i'm starting to plan for that uh possibility just to look forward to something um i hope that you have something to look forward to boy it's really depressing whatever there's 20 seconds left uh don't go to denmark norway i have been to norway okay can i tell you about one of my favorite places in the world ah i have some of my favorite memories in life from this place and i'm going to tell you all about it right now it is the island of roonda in norway this is where it is right here i can zoom all the way out i spent three or four days there with my family i believe it means bird island um and we went on hikes we hiked all the way out to this lighthouse here and by the way there's no way to get to that lighthouse other than hiking and it was like at hours and hours hike and i had a threeyearold and a uh sixyearold at the time it was a really amazing adventure and i actually asked when i got there the proprietor of the lighthouse which you can stay overnight there for free if you hike out there i asked the proprietor if there was maybe a boat that could take us back and they laughed at me in a friendly way it was quite kind of funny we hiked back ah i had such an amazing time you can we went there to see puffins so we were the wrong time of year there were no puffins but i really just had i would love to go back there that was really um just an amazing time um on this little spot that uh in the world that we visited okay 16 seconds left um all right everyone i will see you hopefully next stay tuned probably next saturday but some saturday in the future here on the coding grain hopefully in the morning again on my time but we'll see goodbye this dot never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward let's look song to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens kittens this is usually the part of the live stream as i'm packing up that i i like to do a little behind the scenes here take down the green screen you can turn off the lights i i gotta listen i'm very curious listening back to how this microphone is if i even have it like set up correctly come on control center turn off the light oh darkness oh it's so dark i didn't realize i had all the lights off now it's gonna be okay today is not broken it has not frozen this isn't so at least turn on the regular lights which i now i'm realizing that's why the key was weird i have these other just regular lamps that usually brighten up the green screen that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things thanks everybody for watching over and over again i think i have successfully put everything away this is the big grand finale of a song kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens of dastada
