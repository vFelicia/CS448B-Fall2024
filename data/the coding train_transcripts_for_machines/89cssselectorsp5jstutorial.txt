hi in this video I would like to look at two functions that are part of the p5.js Dom library they are called select and select all and the nice thing that we're going to get you and me here in this time and space that we're in the nice thing that we're going to get from this topic is not just those two functions but more about CSS selectors if you recall in this there's this idea in CSS where you have a selector select or I don't know in the year 2050 we'll be saying select or but for now I'll just say selector where you have this selector an open curly bracket a close curly bracket and then some name value pairs that assign style information so I don't like this panel switching so let's say for example you have an HTML file and inside that HTML file you have a body and inside the body maybe you have a paragraph and another paragraph and maybe you have a button so there are three elements here so in the previous video I made about CSS the only selector I talked about if I recall correctly is that you could select a tag so if I put P here then any style information that I put here like font size you know 12point any style information that I put there gets applied to all paragraphs however here's a question for you what if what you want to do is this I'm very little room here by the way it seems like I might be in a big space very crowded the thing you're I'm banging into um what if what if what you wanted to do was apply this font size only to this paragraph well in that case there's a concept known as an ID so okay so let's make a list here over here I'm gonna make a little box here what are the kinds of selectors now I'm sure there's a much longer more indepth explanation of this that involves lots of like sub detail ideas of how you combine selectors and subcategory selectors but at its core there are three main kinds of selectors there is the tag itself so all members of a tag type so button would apply to all buttons on the page P would apply to all paragraphs on the page and you know you can extend from there the other types of Dom element now there's a new kind called an ID which is a single Dom element so you can give a Dom element an ID as follows P ID equals unicorn so by this is called an attribute so this is an attribute for this particular Dom element it gets an ID in addition there's a space there I'll type this out in the computer which will make it more clear but there's a space between the P and then you say ID equals unicorn so now if you wanted to apply style to just this you might think what you would write is just the term unicorn this is not exactly correct though now this is conceptually the right idea but IDs are indicated by this pound symbol or as you people who live in today's age would call it a hash symbol so the same thing you use for a hash tag this pounds a pound but you know I like I think of the old phones I mean new phones have this do the pound symbol anyway it's not important but I like going off to the page here so if I say this pound unicorn that indicates I'm looking for an HTML element with the ID unicorn now you could do weird things like add the ID unicorn to this one but you should not because the third kind of tag sorry tag is the wrong word that's a tag pair paragraph tag third kind of selector is called as a class so class is a way of creating a group of elements your own group grouping a bunch together so let's say you have a hundred paragraph elements on the page but you want a way of selecting or applying a style to just those ten you could make those all the members of a certain class you could add a class could go across multiple kinds of Dom element so you could have a bunch of paragraphs and a bunch of image tags and a bunch of div tags and they could all be members of the same class so there and and incidentally the class is indicated by a dot so a tag is just the tag itself P if IMG div an ID is a sign via this hash symbol and a class via the dot and if I wanted to make this paragraph a member of a class you know class equals rainbow okay so this is I said I'm just gonna talk about the Select and select all functions work but I'm sure starting from this place of CSS which i think is actually maybe a nicer place to start so I want to look I'm gonna open make an example that looks at how you apply a particular style to an ID to attach to a tag to an ID and to a class and once we have that I will also show you how to then access elements on the page via those same ideas select all the paragraphs select all the buttons or select this single button with a given ID okay so coming back over here I am at 6 minutes here let's make an example now to make this example what I want to actually do is and the volume still working I want to actually do is I want to start adding some HTML so let's do this p ID equals unicorn and can you see this class equals rainbow unicorns and then I'll make another one that has class equals rainbow and this is unicorns and rainbows I need more space here for my weird so you know it's actually a unicorn it's a single unit a unicorn and this is rainbows this is more rainbows and this is you know just a plain paragraph just a plain paragraph so what I'm showing you here is that I now have four paragraphs if I select by paragraph I'll get all four if i select by unicorn ID I'll just get the first if i select by the rainbow class I will get all three so let's look at this if I hit run you can see there all of the paragraphs now let's add some style and let's say unicorn right this is is font size 16 point rainbow is I'm not just do font size just to be font size is 12 point and P font size now something really strange is going to happen here 8 point and let's actually let's make these quite a bit bigger 48 24 12 so let's look at what's happening now so something strange is going on here which I didn't even really anticipate when starting this video but I think this is kind of an important way of looking at it what I probably should have done to be more clear is done something entirely different to all three kinds but notice all of those are paragraphs so they should all be 12point right but some of them are members of the rainbow class those are 24 points and one of those that's a member of the rainbow class is actually has the ID unicorn so it's a 48 point so one thing you'll notice is there's a kind of a hierarchy here an ID the more specific you are the more important that style information is assigned so in other words the font size 48.4 an ID overrides what it was given for the class or tag but we could do some things here too so that's one thing that's important to see class overrides tag ID overrides class cuz you're getting more specific tag is very general like all the paragraphs class is like well a group of those paragraphs an ID is like no no no no not all of them not even a group of them this exact specific one so that takes greatest precedence it's not the you could think it's the order that I wrote it there but I'm almost certain that if I move this from here to the bottom it's the same so it's not the order it's the it's the order of precedence is not the order you type them it's actually goes from tag class to ID but let's let's make this a little bit more clear let's do something like padding a 16point background color you know F 0 F and then rainbow is the ones that are rainbow actually so let's and then we'll split the background color here and then the font size for unicorn is 48 points so this I think makes a bit more sense where you can see that all of the paragraphs get 16 point of padding all of the paragraphs that are members of the rainbow class get a purple background and only the one that has the unicorn ID gets a font size of 48 point so this is a way of looking at how selecting by tag or selecting by class or selecting by ID will allow you to address elements and their style in print more or less specific ways now this video is about 10 minutes long that's it at the beginning I'm going to talk about the Select and select all function and then kind of to lead up to that I wanted to look at the different ways of selecting things which are come back over here which are which are by tag by ID or by class so actually I think now what I would suggest to you is create for yourself a page which has a whole bunch of Dom elements in it use different tags paragraph image button etc give some of things IDs give group things by class and see if you can assign them all different styles and how that works and what what overrides what just play around with that for a little bit because in the next video what I will show you how to do is what I said I was going to do at the beginning of this one is then start to select them into you bring them into your code so that you could dynamically assign behaviors or events or callbacks or dynamic styles via this idea of IDs and classes and that sort of thing so that's what I'll actually do in the next video but I'm going to say like stop prepare yourself the page and then in the next video we're gonna look at the JavaScript aspect of that ok so thank you for coming and listening to unicorn and you the unicorn and rainbows show which apparently is what this is and I'm going to hit come Mouse come I'm gonna stop this video and start the
