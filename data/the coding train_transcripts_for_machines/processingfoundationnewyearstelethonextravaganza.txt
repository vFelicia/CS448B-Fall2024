uh so uh oh boy hello happy almost new year's wait it where is it somewhere we must it must already be a new year somewhere in the world tell me in the chat where you are and how long it is until it is your happy new year hello my name is dan i am your happy new year wisher of today i can't tell you by the way so i have about let's see i'm just just just on a real rough count here uh 10 12 you know 14 15 16. i got like 20 plus different buttons that i use to operate the live stream as it's going and at least half of them are not working right now so i had a little glitch there yeah little sneak preview of a guest that we're gonna have on in a moment um sorry about that summer you appeared just as a blip by accident as i was switching windows around um but um i've got i was about to say i have lots of fun things planned for today but i literally have well i have i have one thing planned which is our guest who's about to come on and talk a little bit about the processing foundation so because i don't have anything planned if you will uh indulge me and bear with me let me try to plan things and talk them through right now as i begin with this live stream so first of all if this is the first time you've ever tuned into the coding train welcome thank you i wore this special sweater for you it's not a processing sweater unfortunately but it is themed coating train themed uh i don't love that it's also a branded sort of thing but it's uh i believe this is like a chris minesweeper christmas tree so hope you enjoy that uh i wore it just just for you all of you all some number of people uh oh and i'm seeing in the chat great happy new year from malta is that five minutes and 54 seconds to go or five hours and 54 minutes five hours and 54 minutes until uh t minus 84 minutes captain like i feel like india is i think like it's gonna be new years in india some point during this stream just picking india because i have a sense that's like 10 and a half hours or 11 hours difference and it's noon right now i don't know somebody will tell me so okay um usually i have a very as everybody knows who is a viewer of the coding train i usually have an incredibly well organized structured stream where i methodically go from segment to segment tutorial tutorial and everything is well documented and perfect today won't be like that at all it never is that way that was a joke um but today is a day of new year's resolutions for me uh the 2022 i'm hoping uh well will be a better year than 2021 and 2020 and we don't need to go into we don't need to rehash how much this year uh was not so great uh for a variety of different reasons at different on different levels for all different people all over the world hopefully we can have a little moment of happiness and joy together in this virtual coding train online space today but i have some personally i have some exciting things that i'm really looking forward to in 2022 which is the ability to dedicate a lot more time to the coding train so if this is your first time tuning in welcome it's gonna take me a couple weeks to get my feet under me i'm still working on a new studio it's going to be solarpowered as of january 5th i'm that's the date where i'll be installing some solar panels here to power all of this equipment um i have as i've talked about a sabbatical from my teaching position my day job so to speak which will allow me more time to hopefully stream every week and produce more tutorials that's not what today is about but i just wanted to let you all know if you're just joining come on board i've said the water is warm but there's no water on the train the train is moving at a at a leisurely pace there's nice views out the windows comfy seats uh little laptops for everybody to code on i don't know where i'm going with this but i want to welcome you and i hope that we can spend a lot of time together being creative coding playing teaching learning from each other the best way to get involved with the coding train community is to join the discord but that's all i'm going to say because today is not about the coding trend i mean these things all blend together on some level but today is not about the coding train today is about the processing foundation i don't have a prop uh i feel like i need to hold something up uh the processing foundation is a heart my heart and soul it is a nonprofit uh dedicated to uh that that dedicated to bringing coding to the world uh in creative and exciting ways we maintain different software platforms run various educational and community initiatives and there is a fundraiser going on right now um uh uh i see by the way i see i see i've seen names in the chat that i haven't seen in a long time and it's making me so so happy to see them um and so i'm gonna get to all the ways you can donate and pull up that page and i have a little like uh back channel dashboard thing where i can see if somebody donated and i have my ukulele and i have i'm hooked up to gpt 3 to generate me some lyrics so every time somebody donates i'm going to sing which is probably actually a reason why you shouldn't donate you won't want to donate but i don't know we'll see if it really goes the other way then i'm going to keep singing until you donate how about that um but um uh uh uh my guest my wonderful guest is um waiting in the wings and i wanna uh bring him on and get that out of the way so um every year when i do this is this is i don't know which number maybe this is like the fourth processing telethon it's usually before the uh for the 25th the christmas holiday oh my goodness oh no hold on everybody i've got a slight issue okay i've got a pet issue here okay everything's gonna be fine but one of my cats just escaped because i left the door open so were you all were you all like this won't take more than a couple minutes for me to resolve uh actually you know what i can pass it on to soccer while i'm trying to rescue the cat the door to the outside is closed i'm in a garage and the garage has a little extra room attached to it and there's some construction being done in the house so i moved and i moved the cats to the garage do you hear the meow do you hear that yeah okay that's four grand i was lost because i left the door open as i was rushing back and forth to get everything ready and she's terrified and i'm gonna just go get her i'm gonna uh i'm gonna put this music back on and we'll be right back or wait darth sober do you wanna you wanna all right let me greta is fine i'm going to retrieve her this is not going very well okay so uh let me go back to what i was saying this is the um fourth or maybe fifth time i've done this usually i try to do it before the holidays couldn't get that together this year but i'm making it in right under the wire today is the last day you can donate for this year's annual processing fundraiser there are various rewards i will pull up that page and show you what there are what they are i'm planning to donate because there's a beautiful community catalog i would like to get but i want uh dorothy and other members of the processing team have come on to talk about processing um in the past uh and so i wanted you to get to hear from someone directly on the team and so i'm really excited that i have and i'm going to switch over here and now you're seeing me in a different camera and hopefully you're seeing sober and still hearing my audio saber will you say something just so i see if your audio is going through hey hey coding train all right so i can hear i can see sauber's audio going through everybody in the chat wants to see the cat um sovereign this is perfect timing i'm going to let you take it away for a couple minutes and talk about processing um i still can hear you i'm just going to go in and rescue the cat yeah do your thing take your time hey folks um great to be on a coding train and i'm going to talk a little bit about uh some of the work the foundation does the fundraising that it supports the programs it supports um and tell you um a little bit about what um what happens with these programs and then um you know see if there's questions or none so however much time dan needs to corral uh his cats um so uh let me introduce myself a little bit and then i'll share a little bit of a graphic that i have describing the programs so i'm cyber khan i'm a teacher in new york city i've been with the foundation for about three years i started as a community member um started uh hosting events um and then i'm back by the way hey dan how's the cat cat cat made it back i was gonna bring the cat but uh the way i was able to retrieve the cat is i walked over to her and she darted off back into the room where she's supposed to be and then i close the door so later we'll see maybe i can get a cat cam going sorry keep going i will by the way since you mentioned if people have questions i'll keep an eye on the chat you don't have to do that and if questions come up i'll note them down and um and ask you when when you're finished and apologies for not introducing you i'm glad you're introducing yourself thank you all good all right all good yeah so um education community director now processing foundation and uh what i do in that role is uh support educators in our community which is which is odd because almost you know most people in our community are sort of educators or students and then help put up some programs so i want to describe those uh dan's described them in the past uh quite a bit i'm sure dan will uh share more about it um and then there's lots of other programs that community members do too and the organization does too that are upcoming that um i don't have on this list so let me share my chrome oh you know what i have that error of like this is the first time you're trying to screen share on chrome uh on zoom so let me just give me one second let me let me deal with this issue i think i can not restart zoom and do this worst case scenario you can also oh no i see it you see it okay cool all right great um all right so let me just jump into it so uh processing foundation what are some of the programs uh that we do and that they're upcoming in 2022 which is why i wanted to come on and jump on with coding train today uh the reason i actually became part of the foundations that started this event and we've been doing it in person and virtual last couple of years and it's for educators and students mostly k12 oriented and what happens is kind of like what happens on the coding train but more like a 45 minute version of it here's a workshop on doing something fairly basic with creative coding so if you have any teachers or students that need that kind of uh slow pace uh this event might be for you and we're probably gonna do something in late actually that you can join uh so that's one of the programs that the foundation supports uh the second one is something that is maybe even more appropriate to share which is uh we support community members putting on their own events and they're called processing communities they've been happening for the past couple years you can organize one virtually or you know if you're able to do it in person and we're happy to help you um and i'll share the links for each of these types of events in the chat in a minute after i'm done talking you can also email us at this link at this email address below if you have questions about it there's a couple of more that are you might be interested in uh probably heard about them before but uh i'll love to remind you about them um if you're a coder and you are past high school and you're in some sort of postsecondary education uh like you're in uh college or grad school or in a some sort of coding boot camp or some sort of post secondary education you can come and contribute to the open source projects the foundation supports and this is through google and it runs through the summer and we've been part of it for a bunch of years and that's upcoming this year again and then the last thing that i had to share was um the foundation supports fellowships too for artists coders collectives and then more recently teachers and you uh conceive a project you execute it with us and these can be software but don't have to be software generally they're not software um and they're called fellowships and they also occur over the summer so this these are the four things that i could think of that are worth sort of sharing with you all and the last thing is a lot of this stuff to like see what community members are doing or saying about it uh the discourse is the link for that so those were the four things that i could think i'm trying to think of there's something big that i forgot um but oh the last thing i wanted to say was um you know just like dan's hoping to do a lot more in 2022 i'm hoping to do a lot more with my ninja especially with processing foundation thanks to all the fundraising that has happened recently and i think just like where the community is i think there's a lot more that you know we might have on this calendar uh in a year or so so i'm excited to see what other things we can sort of add to the list of things that we do every year that was it for me dan anything that i should talk about or mention i'm listening to you through the zoo so i couldn't hear you right yeah sorry i was actually muted in both places sorry about that right i'm i'm a little bit uh technically frazzled today no that was terrific um i don't have uh um i will what i'm gonna be sort of periodically pulling up different things from about processing during the stream i'll go to the foundation website i'm gonna show the donation page uh we're gonna i'm gonna code some stuff in p5 or processing so people will get to learn more about the work of the foundation and how to get started in coding if it's new to you i guess um the one thing i think that would be great for you to share just if people want to get in touch or have questions especially if they're teachers i know you do a lot you've done these sort of open office hours for um k through 12 teachers what's the best way to get in touch with you and or the processing foundation more general broadly yeah so that email foundation and processing is probably the general inbox and then my one is sauber processing.org yeah if you need help like if you're an educated you're like what do i do in my classroom or hey i run an after school i need help with curriculum or if it's something more serious like hey my district you know needs some support and we're interested in what you guys do uh those are all things i can help with and i would love to help with and i think in this coming year in the next few years we'll have a lot more ability to like sort of support people in that way so please do reach out especially if you reach out in the past and maybe we weren't able to do too much uh we might be able to do a little bit more and this time around so you know please don't hesitate to repeat a question you already asked us so yeah i'll put all the links in the chat i'll i'll hang out and uh it's just i just want to say it's such an awesome thing you know especially in the time of covet to like have the coding train as a place to hang out when there aren't too many other places uh tina hang out in person here we are again uh you and your community being that space thank you yes this is uh a labor of love that sort of uh ebbs and flows for me in various ways and i'm excited to try to tie a little bow around this year and sort of set us up into set myself up and the community up into the new year so i just want to read before you go sauber mark says great presentation sober month on says absolutely love what you guys are doing with processing keep up the amazing work and best practices well i really need to take learn from best practices please teach me all of the best practices i only have the worst practices uh says this is very nice happy dear to you okay so sauber will be around in the chat a little bit but even if not um if you have questions about the processing foundation this stream's got like a couple hours to go so you can always ask them i will be able to answer them or point you to the right person or of course foundation at processing.org for education specific questions or about some of the initiatives that sauber mentioned you can email sauber directly saber at processing.org and we'll put that stuff into the chat sauber if you're if you post something into the youtube chat i'm going to click on you and make you a moderator because i believe you can't share links or email addresses unless you're a moderator so your first message you can just say hello you i might have done this before if you happen to have been in the chat before and i did this but we'll find out momentarily all right thanks so much yeah happy new year dan all right happy new year to you too all right i'm gonna click off this zoom end meeting for all and here we are okay i'm back just me oh help help me everyone i i mean you would have thought right you would have thought it's december 31st my last day of teaching my last class was like i don't even recall now the 9th the 10th the 12th it was a while ago it was like weeks ago all this time to figure out and plan and be prepared to have an extravaganza here on the last day of the year and the truth of the matter is i have no plan um and so we're just gonna see how things go i'm gonna be reading the chat i'm gonna be answering questions um and i'm going to sing some songs and i definitely want to code something and i have a couple ideas but thing i'm open to your ideas but before i do any of that just give me a moment here oh wait a second we have something that just happened um now ah yes chris dennett donated thank you chris dennett no this one no now i want to launch into my which is again not planned my donation uh schtick thing that happens but i'm not ready to just yet um because i've got too many things open and uh i need to bring the computer over here and i need to go to donor box processing so i want to talk about how you can donate so give me a second here where's the button does this button work hope this button works oh yeah there's sober let me make sauber a moderator uh add moderator okay so sauber you should be able to post links and things now everyone's asking me about this sweater i i kind of regret wearing this sweater because every year during the processing telethon oh hello children have you come to join my live stream oh they're they're like they have hoodies over there's like sheets over their head they're running they're running away from me as fast as they possibly can all right enjoy enjoy um uh try not if you if you can manage without turning the heat on in there it makes a very loud noise so but if you're cold you can turn it on okay no no you're fine okay so many distractions working from home people gotta love it um so uh let me talk about the sweater for a second just it is i i saw it advertised online this is me engaging in like impulse purchasing commerce i believe it is sold by microsoft it is a christmas tree with minesweeper on it i think they're sold out so you can't get one it's unaffiliated you will not make a donation to anything you're just filling up the giant banks of corporate america by buying this uh so someday next year let's put this on the universe let's have uh coding train processing holiday ugly sweaters uh made that everybody can buy to celebrate and donate depressing i do have a coding train uh sweater which was made for me um and you uh you can check my twitter makiko made it and there was a whole video about it but it's kind of like it's a i it's i i need to preserve it it's a little bit it's it's it's it's got a little bit of wear on it so um all right anonymous donated over to here so um the processing foundation sauber talked about the processing foundation here is the processing foundation website right here on this very home page of the processing foundation itself you will see this wonderful call to action pick up your copy of the processing community catalog a hardcover 900 page book with over 600 pages contributed by community members in celebration of not one not two not five not ten not fifteen not eighteen not nineteen but twenty years and we're past twenty like we're like almost twenty and a half years at this point of processing itself started uh the project created by a processing software project created by casey reese and ben frye august 2001 um i did a live stream for the 20th celebration where i got an ibm thinkpad and tried to run the original original version of processing you can go back and watch that i do actually have i will say i'm just going to walk over here and show you i also purchased off of ebay when i was preparing that live stream let me switch to here oh oh it's uh keyed out one of these boy the green screen uh is really i think i can change this to just give me a second here so you can really see it there we go one of these a beautiful clam shell can i open it i can't open it just give me a second clamshell max and i was um working on getting processing to run on this um and um and yes and uh thank you sauber was wearing sauber's hoodie as much what i should be wearing i don't have one i only had a tshirt and it's very cold because i'm in a garage in upstate new york and i can run the heater in this garage and it's not very strong and it's very loud so um so it makes so i was running it this morning anyway stay tuned for a future live stream and one of the things i want to do in 2022 is a lot of retro computing by the way interestingly enough it says on the back here and if you can read that auburn university at montgomery uh apple computer inc uh let's see what year uh this was assembled in taiwan um is there a year or anything on it i don't know 1999 1999 apple computer so this should be able to run the first mac version of processing which you know if we're really feeling ambitious i could try to hook this up today but that's probably not the best use of the live stream all right so um okay so back to this view now ah all c you're perfect all c year year all c or i asked what are the rewards this year i'm so glad you asked so if i click here you can see the various rewards um um and so for 25 oh no you can't see them because i'm not showing them to you for 20. so this is what you'll get to the donor box page for 25 you will receive a pack of 10 stickers including the first ever printing of the new processing logo stickers and to see the new processing logo there it is right here this the new website and the new identity was created by design systems international i talked a lot about that on previous live streams by the way they're just i don't know i'm just putting this out there you might be seeing a new coding train website sometime in 2022 and if you like the processing foundation website you're probably going to like the new coding frame website because you know i'll talk about it later later later but you can see uh i don't know which ones of these logos but p5 stickers processing android but this is just beautiful maybe we can do code something with this today um but i think what the most special thing is here under 75 now first of all to be clear this community catalog will be freely available to download for everybody if you want a printed hard copy version of it for 75 you'll receive a limited edition printed copy of the processing community catalog plus a pack of stickers and i just want to say there will be there just might there just might be some coding train stickers and some coding train stickers that are only available as part of this in that pack as well so first ever processing logo sticker and never before seen coding train with a processing logo together in one sticker possibly um so take a look at that um so but the community catalog is really i want to see where i can find some things to show you about it um and then oh so you can see these oh yeah look look at that there are the stickers never before no printing there you can see they're not here on my laptop i don't got them i don't even have them but i hope to get them the processing community catalog so let's so you might have you know if you've been part of paying attention to the processing community um the to commemorate the 20th anniversary there was a call for community submissions to celebrate shared accomplishments and i believe the the catalog is something like um 700 pages somebody can correct me on that so this is a rendering of what it will look like with a 500 donation you'll receive the silver edition for a 75 donation to receive the standard edition orange oh wait a second see i'm just going to donate so what i would like to do today is match any donations that come in up to five hundred dollars which seems like some sort of selfless act but it's a purely self because i i would be purchasing it anyway for myself because i really want to have the community catalog there is a coding train page that i made with the community coding train community that's in the catalog and i know many of people in the chat uh give a shout out in the chat if you are uh if you made a page for the catalog i would love to see your name and celebrate you um so uh but i kind of like the orange but um 500 you receive the special silver edition uh 75 received the standard edition um this is a bit of a table of contents of what is in the catalog there's an oral history some articles and things that are written by members of the community there's about pages around education initiatives a bill about the history you can see some sample pages of what it looks like um and oh good so oh and this here so i have um i have a uh access to the dashboard so um anonymous donated a hundred dollars so before you okay gotta get my cardio in today so before you all donate um come a little bit dizzy hold on i got a little bit dizzy there before you all donate through youtube which is wonderful for you to do i'm leaving that open that any donations that come through that button on youtube will go direct i seriously got dizzy i have some coffee here i think that'll fix me up um it's been a rough week for me i we don't need i need to go into all of the all of the trials and tribulations of my last week you could join the dakota trade discord and i can write a a narrative essay about what i've been through in the last week if you want um so uh what was i saying here though ah yes so if you donate through the youtube link 100 of those funds will go directly to the processing foundation uh youtube uh google covers all transaction fees for nonprofit giving on the youtube platform however the processing foundation will not have any access to your information google obviously does whatever you're using to you know whatever they've got on their back end so we cannot give you the rewards through your donation through the youtube button so we i encourage you and welcome your donations but if you would like to receive the rewards i you i encourage you oh my goodness we hit the goal i was hoping we i mean i'm glad but i was kind of hoping we'd be like a little bit below the goal could we just change that goal to like i don't know 50 55 000 maybe i don't know but um uh um but um so i would really encourage you to donate here through this uh platform now if you've already donated through youtube and you're now realizing you want you know let's say you just donated 25 just now and you wanted the stickers um first of all us just i would say forward and send an email with your receipt forward your receipt to the youtube donation to foundation processing.org you can cc daniel at thecodingtrade.com um and hopefully we can work that out for you no promises i believe we've been able to do that in the past if we can verify your donation we could make sure to send you um some stickers or whatever reward level but if you really want to make sure you're receiving a reward if you want your name to appear here i'm trying to scroll down under the um under the donor wall the official donor wall on the processing donor box um that's where you'll want to donate and for every donation and i'm a little bit worried i know i think this is the thing that people enjoy because i make a fool out of myself because i'm not really very good at singing or playing the ukulele for every donation that comes in i might have to do only every any like um uh donation at a certain level for any donation comes in i will sing a special version of the new year's song ald lang syne for you let us begin for this is for this is for um everybody who donated so far is there a way that i can see real quick no unpin message well i guess i should pin that i don't know um so so this is for anonymous anonymous 150 and chris dennett anonymous anonymous and chris dennett and this version of aldlang sign is written by david david keck should should this dot be forgot and never typed in line should this dot be forgot and and cause an error on a line four at four for out of scope ref my dear for a simple brain forgot we'll take this and a dot and place it where happy new year okay they're gonna get better or worse i'm not sure which so uh if you like that i don't actually have another version of the song to sing because only i didn't write eddie myself i just put out a call on twitter which i just assumed you know everyone around the world is immediately going to stop whatever they're doing and write their own version of lyrics for the song but you can go you can go right here right now to coding train on github slash ald lang sein train the chat just went very quiet it's making me nervous did everybody leave oh it was just like a delay oh everybody was just quietly wrapped in attention to me singing and now they're coming into the saying things um you can go here and you can uh there is the original version uh written right here and all you need to do is edit click the edit button and add your own version of the song and um zachary mcarthur says the singing has improved from last year i'm not so sure about that it's kind of you to suggest um and but if you also if you don't know how to use github you don't have a github account well first of all you could also just post an issue with the lyrics in it um or you could i don't know jump in the discord somebody you could get in touch and somebody tweet at me at shiffman um uh maybe some somebody can figure out how to get get those song lyrics to me uh jap7n says i had so so much fun this year with processing p5.js also teaching it to my 10 year old son and students at the art academy where i work thank you he says thank you to me thank you to you um i i honestly really i really love hearing these comments and i'm very grateful for them um i am not at the moment i do not at the moment have a window open to um the coding train discord um but i'm taking a look now to see if i've missed anything wait when somebody tell me when is the first like okay let's just uh uh i wanted to make like a one of the things i thought we should do is make a live realtime new year's clock for various places so maybe what i could do let's let's work on this i've got an idea i mean i sort of had this idea before what if i could collect um and alex 1999 says how are you do you feel better i do feel like i've been sick negative tests but i'm a little unsure i have many vaccines in me i don't want to get into it but it's been a rough like week where i was feeling very uneasy and anyway but i feel pretty good today um and i'm here live streaming with you so uh knock on wood um but we'll we'll see i'm still waiting on uh pcr test results um thank you i am 63 years of age retired my grandchildren are coming over and i'll teach what i learned today because retired 32 years is a knuckle tracker i look for i'm getting up there i mean uh i'm not retired and i um i don't know if i i would be amazed to be retired for 32 years but um i'm thinking about it i think maybe this is it i'm gonna retire after today although i think i think i've got i think i could there's room for improvement here so i don't think this should be my last live stream so um a new countdown every hour yeah so i was thinking some kind of new year's countdown in p5 or processing we could have fireworks go off the fireworks could be in the shape of the processing logo this is what i was thinking of programming today but i would like to um kind of collect uh cities around the world where current viewers are watching so there's some ways i could do this i think probably actually to be honest it would be easiest for me to just quickly create a quick google form and then put that out there so let me do that this is uh we're gonna we're gonna um i'm gonna do this real quick so i could go to my um youtube analytics i'm sorry i'm not chuck i'm logging into some things here uh um where where are we going here uh password manager here just listen to this quiet you're gonna be so tired of this song by the end of today oh my goodness one password don't fail me now not a sponsor 2022 lots of sponsorships open i should not be talking about sponsors today oh my god dollar sign u i asterisk ampersand one capital w oh my god did i just speak my password out out loud no i was getting my brain it's amazing i can read actual letters and say other ones at the same time okay new form any moment now uh where are you watching i guess there's no reason why i can't show this to you now country i'm short answer uh please answer only once um should i ask for your latitude longitude i don't think so time zone just in case that helps i think i'm only going to make country required okay i think we've had enough of this music now how do i do the thing where um manage our responses are collected or protected so like i think no no i definitely don't want to do this limit to one response all right well we'll see how that works send shorten url okay so this google form is about to go into uh the chat it's about to go into the chat do i have the live stream open somewhere um and here it goes so now you should see that google form in the chat i don't see it over here there we go um where are you watching all right i'm going to go back to here for a second while i quickly see if any responses come in not yet but also one thing i'm going to do is i'm quickly going to go yes bruno is saying can i check youtube analytics i can check youtube analytics but i don't believe that there's any way through i looked into this briefly yesterday that the api will give me realtime analytics on people who are watching i'm going to now look at just the countries and i'll show them to you i've watched in the last year so let's go to the last 365 days and audience and um top geographies see more so this i'm going to um i'm always a little bit averse to a little bit um so let me show this to you there's got to be a way i can download this so while we're waiting programming with time zones is horror well we're going to see how it goes all right where's my button all right so this uh in case you're curious this is december 31st 2020 to december 30th 2021 the last 365 days if you've been curious as to who watches the coding train you can see the views in uh 17 watch time uh us there right at the top india coming in at number two uh germany coming in at number three united kingdom canada brazil france australia netherlands italy poland indonesia russia spain turkey sweden vietnam south korea mexico philippines israel japan taiwan argentina belgium romania hong kong ukraine portugal switzerland denmark pakistan bangladesh thailand singapore south africa malaysia austria morocco hungary norway egypt czechia greece ireland colombia finland nepal new zealand and saudi arabia that is just the top 50 results use exports to view up to 500 results so i'm just constantly afraid of showing some private information um here so i'm going to look for where the export is now uh where do i where's the export button there's got to be an export button um more post playlist no how do i export it says i can export oh download ah there we go comma separated values great let's do that all right so maybe i'll use this rather than the google form i mean i'm basically redoing coding challenge that i did a coding challenge for 500 000 subscribers but that's okay totals chart data table data okay um is this going to give me more than 50. let's look at this data how do i current view please use exports to view up to 500. all right all right let's let me get out of this for a second oh i have 49 responses um that's great all right so now um let's get into coding some stuff and let me check donor box because you know and let me check uh to see if we have any new lyrics come in is anybody writing lyrics for me all right we're gonna check donor box all right everybody let's see if another donation has come in i'm gonna hit refresh the last donation was cliff i think cliff deserves a song though we're gonna hit refresh kiffin gish all right time for another ald lang syne now this one's gonna be a little bit tricky first of all doesn't this seem out of tune to you let me tune let me tune this this is very important because as you know my singing is clearly perfect so it you know be such a tragedy if anything were slightly out of tune okay all right too sharp turned down too flat turn it tune up okay uh oh andrew did you donate but not write anything on the donation wall so i'm assuming if you're not appearing on the donation wall it's because you don't want me to shout out your name during a live stream i feel like putting your name on the wall is sort of opting in that's the best i can sort of think of but andrew if you did make a donation i um i have i believe in you i have faith this song is also dedicated to both kiffin and andrew now let's just check to see if maybe there's any issues or pull requests no nobody's written lyrics for me to sing how will i ever go on aha well um i've got my uh window open here to the open ai's gpd3 uh model and this is the prompt um that i wrote so i'm gonna take this one out so we'll get a new one just fresh the prompt that i wrote for gpt three is i love to sing the song alden here are the lyrics here are the lyrics i wrote my own version of the lyrics that are computer science themed here they are now i'm going to i'm going to save this here save this as my preset and i'm going to hit generate oh no oh this is not going to should we should we why why why let's try again oh you know what i need to go up here ah there we go this looks better oh my god okay this is kind of awesome oh wow except i don't have the chords here hold on i think i probably know the chords but let me just open up two windows just so i can kind of see them over here uh can i oh this is so hard no no go get get rid of this thank you okay over here move this way this is all going to be fine in a moment shall shell all them shall the bites forget forget when they first met and oh no no no no no no oh wow i went boy okay wait i can make this work can the chords be ai generated no yeah the chords are ai generated in the sense that i am definitely artificially intelligent sure shall all the bites forget when they first met and the bits been friends air they forgot will for they forget those halcyon days yeah those halcyon days essence air bites had a name for bits before they schooled in bitwise ways the bite abode air bit swapping up bite was invented and long before words like gigabyte came along into this complimentary of memory and i can't i can't match it up this is terrible i'm the worst okay hold on let's just do the last two lines for all bits will take a cup of bitful joy and buy bites on bites well done a cup of bites thank you thank you thank you thank you see i i i don't know if people should donate uh i gotta work on this some more maybe i've maybe there's some ways i can improve my gpt3 prompt ah all c all c or i made a pull request okay let me have a looksee here uh make sure everything is copacetic um uh where do i go for that um we're going to oh oh my god what does that must become of my life pull request linux distros okay let's take a look at this one oh this is good this is great thank you all i'll see your eye the next donation i will be um doing this one now unfortunately i just realized i want to um i want to merge this pull request and for some reason i'm not signed in i need to factor this um okay you know you're watching a professional live streaming broadcast when the person who is hosting the broadcast has to go and log into their phone to find their twofactor authentication code to log into some website that they need to use for the live stream uh authenticator you know christmas worked better because i had a wide variety of songs to choose from there's only one new year's song that i can think of which is all like sign okay verify there we go so now uh let us merge in the linux distros version of the song which will be the absolute next version that i sing so all we need your coding flows a bit better than your singing is true and me i am so me so nice to see you it's been so long i'm still the same disaster as i've always been uh let's take a look uh at our donation page we're never going to get to coding if people keep donating um our last donation was from kip and gish and also andrew n i believe and i'm hitting refresh rodrigo cold okay looks like we're getting the linux distro version right now i wonder if i should just do this one with a backing track let's try that oh linux mint my dear owl pie linux will take booboo to mate eating in a live stream is a bad idea but this orange just looks so so delicious i was gonna eat this before i started to give me a little energy you know what would be good five nine seven seven one two eight nine eight one four zero three four one seven six five five eight seven zero zero five eight four five six six six one four four eight nine zero seven nine two five eight one two six four huh i don't even write me lyrics i have a book of random numbers um that was for the the that was for matia uh who i noticed in the chat said they made a donation um but that was before today but wanted a song so i let that one go a little bit more all right i'm not sure backing track ukulele uh i don't want to check i need a break i don't want to check any donations right now let's get started on coding something so i'm trying to think of how i want to do this so i could use your help here pie land sign uh i there's a couple options one is uh a web page just has cities and countdown timers uh it could actually be a map maybe i should make a map with little countdown timers on the map and then when they reach zero little fireworks go off should we do that um let's take a look just um through a history of the coding train and if i go into coding challenges and i go to visualizing 500 000 subscribers let's take a look at this project that i made this was done of course i'm not logged in oh great um this was done um saved over two years ago if we look at the video i should really like visualize the p5 or processing community this is from july 9 2018 and if we run this code we'll see so this is a good starting point for us all right maybe uh in the interest of time um i it might make sense for me why did it just change colors that was interesting this is using this mappa library which wraps the leaflet wraps different other mapping libraries one of which called leaflet and i'm getting a sort of version of the map zero zero i'm loading subscribers geocsv let's see what that file looks like let's download this so one thing might be interesting to do is actually just um kind of rerun this with the data that i just created what does this data look like so let's let's go open visual studio i'm going to use visual studio code today and then i'll move stuff to the web editor so people can share it make tiny fireworks in the map only in the line of the time zone oh i like that ah we could watch the we could watch like this little line go by of the time zone and have little fireworks go off in it all right we're totally doing that that's going to be fun uh that's going to be fun all right so what am i in oh remember that autoencoder project let's close that out i need to get myself a little bit organized back here um um let's go to terminal here yeah sure update where did i download this um shoot probably under downloads yeah visualizing let's just take this let's go here so we're going to make an improvement off of this previous coding challenge which will save us a lot of time so i'm going to try to let's first make sure it runs i'm going to take the headers off just for a second um i'm gonna run a web server open it up get my javascript console okay so this looks good this is running just fine um and i'm sorry simon i see your comments here i'm sorry i'm not i have too many things open let me actually don't i think i don't need this dashboard open so i can see the um discord chat as well um you know one of the things that i'm thinking about doing in 2022 is uh doing some streaming on twitch uh once a week because the twitch platform has a much friendlier api features where i could do things like zach's suggestion maybe like have things happen based on like who's currently watching that kind of thing um all right okay so um so a couple things one let me go over here i just want to do some cleanup my i don't know if you can hear my children's loud noises i am going to get rid of p5 dom and p5 sound and i just want to make sure i have the newest version of the p5 library so i'm going to grab it from here uh all right so everything's still working i wanted to tell my children to keep it down but i'm not gonna be that guy today no it's fine i can i can i can power through this um it's very distracting you're a little bit loud in there um all right so let's take a look at this okay so we can delete the local versions of the p5 libraries and let's look and see what's happening in this sketch all right so we're loading this csv file called cert and i think i need to make the font a little bit bigger for people to be able to see let's go to 32. so this is a p5 sketch it has this it's making this instance of an object from this other library called mappa which is going to allow me to display that map i'll get to that this is some sort of configuration stuff for example i want the map to be centered at latitude longitude 0 with a zoom of 1.5 so if i change this to 0.5 for example and went back and hit refresh you could see i'm zoomed further out but you know it's something that can be changed in real time um so but i'm going to go back to one and that looks good to me and we can kind of move things over but i guess that this is actually the view that i want to see but i'm not going to worry about that right now um that line will take we'll do we'll do a sped up version of it okay we'll do like a time lapse version uh um stop deleting my posts sorry about that uh says that line will take five hours to cross the atlantic yeah and i'm i'm i've got like 45 minutes here to go let's see what we can get to happen all right loading countries.json so countries is just a lookup table with a lat and longitude for every country and then the data itself is country name country id subscribers comments watch time minutes so let's first just try to get some new data so this is the new data that i just downloaded i don't know i've chart data table data totals i don't know what any of these things are but let's let's bring these in so let's look at uh actually it's a hole let me undo that no i won't let me make a uh organize this better make a folder called data this is the new data i'm just putting this in here okay just so i can see what it is so chart data is the date the geography and the number of views i don't understand what this is what oh this is oh it's per day wow that's insane so i could show a time lapse of people i'm like i'm off in a whole other project now but that's interesting chart data table data geography views average duration watch time hours total and i'm not sure i believe yeah i don't know what this oh what oh total u.s so this is what i want if i want totals of views and then just totals is just the total views per day oh that's interesting i mean i don't know what the what i where i'm wandering off into here but let's this is the this is this data i could use for the same exact graph but i want to do it a different way hmm i'm trying to think about this i could i could also go back to um if you'll bear with me i'm just going to go look at the spreadsheet where people entered where they are and um of the people currently watching which might be a little bit more exciting i just don't in case there's some trolling in there i want to just like scan through it there are 52 responses so um let me repost that link in the chat so i also want i'm going to download this data in a moment i mean i could obviously connect to the connect to it in real time but i think i want to freeze it so hold on i'm coming back to the live stream where's the chat um okay oh all right so i think i just posted oh we got another donation we have to do another song i just posted the form so i think what i'm going to try to do actually first is put one dot for everybody currently watching so please if you don't mind you know on our system here as best as possible enter into the form just once please put a real city and country i'm going to look up the latitude longitude and time zone i think via some kind of api and we'll see how that goes so for example um i'm going to go so you can enter that stuff in i'm going to go back to my code and uh um just hold on i'm going to just take a one second break here while you're entering in that form okay so let's just say for the sake of argument that i have um i'm gonna i'm gonna not load any of this data just for a second so all i need is a lat and long to p to make something okay i want to go for more the one dot this dot yes this i could actually get the this dot image so if you don't mind letting me simplify this enormously because i think that'll also be more helpful for those of you who are just watching just right now so we're going to um i'm going to no i'm going to not have this normalizing code we're not going to go through any data just yet we're going to get a country like us i'm going to get the lat long for that country if it exists i'm going to not bother with the count i'm going to push 1 we're going to get this i don't need this min max i'm not worrying about the diameter wait lat long the diameter is just going to be 20. just for right now what have i done wrong am i missing a bracket something is wrong let data oh this is an extra bucket right what's going on here country no no okay i'm just hard coding in a country drain map overlay canvas okay hard coding in a country i'm getting the lat long of that country if the lat long exists pushing it into an array and then i'm so confused oh i see this is like uh there we go this is what i'm doing that's the mistake okay now for every country it's not going to be this is not going to be a country anymore forever i'm just going to call this like a viewer of data map the viewer's latitude and longitude to pixels fill oh i see adds this weird frame count thing going fill zoom is the train map zoom scale draw a circle with the viewer's diameter times scale okay so if all goes according to plan this is a very very simple bit of code for me to just draw one dot on the country of the u.s okay cannot read properties of undefined reading us countries u.s there it is um okay country equals us console log lat long let's try this 28. oh i forgot to load i forgot i was commenting out loading the data but i need this data okay there we go look okay my one dot all right so now um let's just make this four okay so now what i can do is i'm going to go back to this google form that hopefully everybody had a chance i'm going to give everybody um i think we've had some donations so i can maybe do one more song i don't know i don't want to do any more songs let's get some momentum going here um i'm just going to go back and i'm checking that google form now uh oh i have 80 responses that's great and i'm just looking at it no bad words that i can see nothing obvious there could be some and by the way um it's interesting to see okay great all right so i'm gonna st i could i can redownload oh 81. so i'm going to download this data um i think i can show it to you um you know i will quickly move away if something appears unseemly in here um so um basically uh um hopefully i can manage with uh the like strange way all the data is formatted but we can see all these locations so let's now uh just download this and you know sometimes it makes it easier let's do download as a csv and i'll come back and redownload this later if more people are entering viewers csv so let me bring this in over here into data and we have timestamp city country so um where am i here so i want to load i'm going to call it viewer data viewer data equals load table um viewers.csv comma header and then like so i think the way that i go through this for i'm it's in the code i had it in here so let's take a look i can't remember the way that i go through a csv um for load table let row of youtube data dot rows okay let row of viewer data.rows and then let country i'm just going to do start with country equal row dot um row dot row.get and so i'm using the so what am i doing here p5 has a special function built into it called load table which will parse a csv file for you otherwise i'd have to like load it as text and use split and chop it up by commas and so i can use this kind of fancy low loop to look at every single row and then what i want to get out of every single row just for the moment is the country i actually want to use the city i'm going to get the city the city is what i want to use so let's just go straight for it get city and then i'm going to say console.log city and let's just see what happens okay looks like there's a problem loading your data file viewers.csv ah it is in a folder called data there we go great so we can see i've got a list of all these cities now so i should be able to how do i find the latitude longitude of a city there's got to be some nice api i can use to do that api lat long of city geocoding well this is an ad i probably shouldn't start with whatever was advertised to me smarty streets developers geocoding api google has one open weather map i've used this before um okay i need an api key i have an api key somebody in the chat tell me if you if you have a better one and q q one of the p5 leads of p5.js is in the chat hello um you deserve a song i'm going to check in a minute um sorry as i look at my phone to try to find my open weather map password i'm like i have all these notifications let's see if i have it shared saved see this is if i had a chance to prepare in advance open weather map i i have a password now the question is what email did i use i'm going to just click away from this while i try to log into this and see if i have a valid api key which you will all immediately have access to so this this api key is going to be no good uh i already forgot what i was typing remember me that was not i think i mistyped the password and that did not work but could it be no this is not going very well this is not going very well what i'm trying to do right now in case you just tuned in is i'm looking for an api that can if i can pass it a city name i can get a um if i can pass it a city name i can get a lat long value and i know that open weather map will do this and i should just create a new account so i'm going to go through the process of doing that and i'm going to show it to you to the extent that um i'll create a new one under my coding train email uh well i don't usually use google's password manager thing but let's use it right now um i'm kind of them very robotic account email already taken oh maybe that was the password this is such a failure this is what anybody else anybody else have uh um anybody anybody else has a a better um suggestion ah all right um g um la long city to lat long lookup table maybe there's a big json file i could download cities of the world in json cities it's 12.4 megabytes so that's a good sign oh look at this this is good i'm just gonna use a big giant file i mean we're going to have some issues with spelling errors but we're going to do our best okay all right so we're going to download this save this as cities.json okay so um we're going to load cities equals cities.json so we're doing this based off cities now and what i'm going to do now is also just say and if i look at cities how is it organized it's a big array so okay okay okay okay i know it's a big file you don't want to look at it so big um i did tell them to quiet down but they did not listen to me there's some chattering away happy on december 31st we're just all having a party no school today let's play play play loudly loud no no more out of the dad is trying to concentrate really hard on coding a really important project with some small amount of people watching is no good my city is not on there armor we will correct that for you so any cities that are missing from this file we will add in manually okay we can do that uh console.log city let's just make sure this is coming through uh data okay cities are coming through there's an error country is not being defined okay where oh okay let's take this out okay sketch 36 so that's the viewer data how come this didn't come out console what i don't have this data it seems cities dot length undefined cities load json data cities let cities okay oh it's an object so it's not actually an array it is an array how come it didn't load it as an array and this is fine can i just do let city of cities oh no so this is not iterable all right i have an idea i'm going to put it in an object now i have to get all the way to the bottom which is going to be very hard there's a lot of cities this is crazy what i'm doing it's got to be a better way get to the bottom get to the bottom of this okay oh come back to me no that's not formatted correctly it really hates this 12 megabyte file what have i done can i just put it in make it the first ah shouldn't that work all right let's hold on okay see you later uh it is a big city's object array from cities me oh i could have done array from cities uh it's not 2022 yet max oh this is what a wonderful group of people in the chat watching me have a total meltdown here trying to just load a 12 megabyte json file which was probably a terrible idea in the first place because now i have to match up the way that you typed your city i know it's not a dictionary i'm going to make it into a dictionary that's what i'm trying to do okay hold on yeah i know it's not iterable i don't want to iterate it just yet for all the iterable okay just give me something here there we go look at that look at this i made it work the way i wanted it to once again i got a little bit dizzy oh i think i'm going to pull the muscle in my back all right everything's going to be fine everybody getting there it's a little kind of warm in here even though it's quite cold in temperature okay everyone so now um for uh four let city of cities dot cities this should work console log city there we go look at that look at that boom boom boom oh i'm console logging like 128 bazillion million cities this is terrible it's never going to end oh dear what have i done what have i done what have i done okay we got to the end what's that sound weird weird creaking hum what strange creature is roaming through the attic of this garage okay um all right now next up i want to make a lookup table so we're going to call this city lookup and make it an object so as i go through every city i want the name to be the thing that gets me the lookup um console.log oh but so um city dot name dot to lowercase so i definitely want to make everything to lower case that'll help a little bit okay those are all the cities to lower case um let name now we're going to i'm sure there's higher order array function magic that i could do to transform the array to like a lookup table object but i'm going to do it manually i'm going to say city lookup city lookup name equals that city so all of the metadata associated with the city i can get to just by its name this way when i go to the viewers and i get their city and i say to lowercase i should be able to now say console.log city and then console.log city lookup that city to see if i can get the metadata so let's see and then let me just put in a little like line breaky thing so out of the 80 or so values that i currently have of people watching two locale lower case thank you to locale lowercase i've never used that but i like that suggestion oh again just as i put that there and my i have a discord notification which is nothing to do with anything okay two lowercase we're gonna celebrate the new year i gotta check donations sink some old lang sign uh next year could be a rocket that goes from one city to the next one and get some fireworks at each city that's a great idea this i'm hoping is going to get somewhere at some point okay so holly springs we got stuttgart seville batumi sturbridge golden colorado hmm paris blacksburg so new delhi new delhi we got so some aren't working so why didn't it get bangalore let's see if we can figure this out like bangalore should 100 be in there is there another way it could be written that's my question so all right let's print out all the ones where it doesn't find anything oh we have a donation i'm gonna have to do a song has anybody written me more lyrics or do i have to use ai again because refresh here any pull request no really only two only two includes includes ah yes that's a good idea but first let me make a list of okay uh let me i'm gonna like make a list of everything that it doesn't have so this is only going to print out any that it couldn't found bangalore is now bengaluru thank you akshat so this is good to know so this we're going to do some data cleaning everybody all right so toronto and there goes the heater sometimes you just can't stop the heater from going on um so why is toronto not in there that seems crazy for ron toronto is there but why is there a toronto in the u.s that's weird there's a lot of toronto so that doesn't make any sense there's so many cities with the same name this is really going to be a problem all right let's go to um the uh the data here so let's so this should be bengaluru let's just check if bengaluru is in there yep so that we can fix bangalore should be bengaluru now we can fix okay now why did it is there was there like a space with toronto it's the first one which is a little weird salah north richland hills amman regai phoenix phoenix this is why i want to use an api now so it's there what did i miss this seems weird well i guess i should okay row get city to lower case data city look up city uh oh it got four it got four phoenix's i'm lost yeah good point oh i have a console ah i have that there no wonder oh my gosh no wonder thank you for that oh my goodness that was like the worst the worst error i don't know what to play for that all right okay so this makes more sense probably like accents we got some commas here so these are the cities that didn't work i bet you if i get rid of the common new york there we're gonna do a little bit more yeah we're gonna do a little bit more cleanup west niacc the problem is i really want to send it the full country because there's going to be some serious problems there um columbus i can fix um golden i can fix by taking out the state i mean that data is good data so i okay so i'm going to have to leave the fact that some of these don't work right now just to see if we can get to having the dots appear on the map okay let's see here so we're going back to the code so now so for each viewer so now i want to create a viewer oh i'm just going to say viewers dot push that data and then and then here oh i guess it's called data what did i call it no this should be viewers so each viewer gets the city data pushed into an array and then each viewer of viewers and i forget what the object looks like so let's just console.log viewer and then i'm going to say no loop and see if this works okay good so now why do i have a oh yeah country latitude longitude name so it's just latlng so this should actually still work lato but this should be lng and um i don't have i'm just going to make everyone 16 pixels and that should work so let's see and then i'm going to take out the new loop see what happens okay this is currently why am i still console logging something oh yeah this in theory is a dot for everybody watching right now uh everybody who entered instead of reg regular okay so the problem is i need a better way of getting the latitude and longitudes but and also if two people are in the same place so a couple things i want to do i think i'd like to give everybody a little bit of random offset um and uh also give some alpha so let's just so we can see if there's more than one i think if i just do random seed five it should like where is the city that more than one person entered like if two people i don't know if somebody can tell me what city this is over here that maybe two people entered or it's just coincidentally like like were there a lot of new yorks this must be all the new york people the normal person donate okay can people see themselves is somebody is somebody a rally north carolina so i forgot what the point of doing this was oh we're gonna make little new year's fireworks and countdowns for all of these spots all right let's see everybody knowing now here's the thing if you do not see your dot here if you do not see your dot here what i would like you to do is reenter to the google form so i'm going to do i'm going to check donations and do a song but i'm going to get everybody to reenter their data so but now if you see your dot here you don't need to reenter your data if you think that your dot isn't there if this is you if one of these is you um it's not showing up reenter your city name matching uh whatever is in this so like montreal like why is ah because of the accent so montreal didn't show up because of the accent so i need the correct accent so i could correct some of these but if you're still watching um and that's if you're bangalore also please change it because i changed those mango manually so i'm going to redownload the data so let me repost the form no i don't want to share this i want to i want to share the form send the form so i'm going to post this form back to the chat we're going to get fireworks going you need to make it so you can edit your responses can i do that yes okay hold on that would be excellent okay uh settings allow response okay i have now allowed response editing so hopefully so you can either also edit your response edit your response you can see i have 90 responses now or you can just reenter it because if it failed it'll still fail and the correct one will come in okay so now i am going back to um the stream and i am oh yeah now oh the link to the city the what the cities look like so where did i find those anybody remember where i found those let me actually cities yeah this is it so this is i'm also going to post this into the chat this is the list of the cities so you want to make sure your city name matches i could remove the accent that could be a way but let's try to match the accents okay everybody so now we're going to do we're going to do some donation thanking while we wait uh we're gonna do some donation thinking where is support p5 okay oh whoa so many donations have come in i don't understand the order here cliff is where we started oh matthieu was right there so we had uh machia i sang a song for roberto thank you stefan thank you indy long live rodrigo okay here we go everybody we are going to yeah don't alka don't worry the time zone is irrelevant now um you can ignore that all right i'm gonna hit refresh everybody okay we're gonna see did we get some new donations in to support processing in the year 2022 here we go everybody yay all right david keck keep dance singing careful what you wish for yarn ray for more people in science thank you rodrigo called so many people do we have a new song to sing i don't know if we do there's a new song in the readme all right all right this is to dedicate it to all of you donators who donated here david guillerm rodrigo everybody but those are the ones since the last time here we go i'm looking for the github uh and let's see here i guess somebody who had permission merged or added one linux distros [Laughter] this is kind of amazing i have been trying to change the auto encoder to color and can't figure out the right dimensions from kfont 22. kfun um are you in the discord um i i really want to work more on the auto encoder i actually want to turn it into a video and so i would love to help you with that and let's see how this goes should should tenser dim be denied and cause a fatal error should i lose my mind i'll comment out the working code and start a fresh next time oh tenser dim oh tenser dim oh tenser dim oh tenser dim how do i match your shape how i forgot where i was what is the correct shape wait how does the song go again and start a fresh next time oh tense or demo tense or dim what is the correct shape oh wait i start over be denied and cause a fatal error should i lose my my mind i'll comment out the working code so slow and start a fresh net next time oh tenser dimensions what is the correct shape i am losing should i lose next time see you later tonight have a great evening st petersburg russia is in the json file but it wasn't showing all right we're going to find out all right so now everybody's had a chance i everybody's had a chance to reenter their cities or edit them i'm just scanning through it oh responder updated oh that's so cool montreal responder updated updated the great great great and we've got some new cities um cacao rock club okay we're gonna see all right bengaluru excuse me oh that was a little i think you know all that singing it's uh everything's oh you're not even seeing what i'm looking at um we're gonna download this again okay this is our this is a spreadsheet of everybody this is perfectly accurate it's a onetoone perfect list of every single person watching and what city they're in no mistakes download to csv and i'm going to grab this and say viewers this is going to be now this is going to be really good i'm going to keep track of this file and the difference between the previous one by naming this viewers dash 2 version control magic okay so viewers dash 2 then goes to can i just like drag it into uh visual studio code oh where where are you no computer ah what is going on i don't know how to use a computer help finder where did you go oh my god you're the worst i cannot operate this machine i cannot operate it what has happened okay hold on there ah what just what viewers too your virgin my virgin control was too much for it viewers dash two sketch so we don't need this very simple sketch here viewers dash two so just to remind you i am loading the spreadsheet of all of the viewers who entered in their city their honest city of where they are with the precise spelling of the way that it also is in my giant json file of cities and latitude longitudes good this is the optimal absolute best way of doing this nobody could possibly come up with a better solution and then i am going to for every city that the viewer is i'm going to look up and put it into an array with the latitude and longitude then i'm going to find that latitude longitude convert it to a pixel location and draw it on a map and i'm gonna hit refresh and we're gonna see everybody's location this is looking pretty good do we have new zealand nobody from new zealand no australia alaska i really want to do like some hovering over we can see some clusters so here's everybody currently watching the live stream at the moment now we need to celebrate new year's for everybody so uh let's see where uh oh my god um where has it like like what see like what time it is in malaysia for example um oh my goodness happy new year malaysia happy new year ah man we missed it we missed it happy new year happy new year oh jason i wonder if your athens got put into greece because of my highly sophisticated system so these are the ones that aren't showing up because i need to correct them this still didn't show up i don't know why but montreal worked right so we're still missing some zurich maybe it has an accent in it st petersburg you think it's listed as it without the full worth saint i don't know anyway this is this is gonna have to do because i've got a lot of time here folks we're gonna make some fireworks happen okay we're gonna make some fireworks happen it just turned midnight in pakistan ah wait i'm seeing in the the discord chat string normalize replace we'll strip accents uh uh all right that's that so i'm i'm i'm gonna i'm gonna post this and hope um that people can help me make it work better but ultimately i should really be using a geocoding api which would probably let me put stuff in in much more arbitrary form i should have i should have probably spent a little longer with open weather map but we're going to go next to fireworks and we're going to grab this code oh are you kidding me oh that's the saddest thing i've ever seen i wrote this code so long ago it's not even using classes okay so hold on i probably hopefully corrected it in the web editor version because i i have been doing that periodically yes yes okay so now we're gonna make a new file we're gonna call it firework.js put that in here i'm going to make a new file call it particle.js and then that goes here now i forgot how this works um let's just so we make a firework and then update and show and if it's done splice it okay so this shouldn't be too hard so basically i need now in my main okay so first on index.html i need to reference firework and particle so i'm now pulling in the coding challenge of fireworks and um i'm going to make an array called fireworks and then in setup i'm going to say fireworks dot push new firework i don't know what um right i just give it oh no i don't even give it a uh oh wait because it doesn't i'm just gonna all right fine it gets its own location and then and then let's just write a nice little loop to draw them we're going to see what happens here gravity is not defined firework.update i guess i must have made a global variable called gravity apply force gravity huh well let's just make an arbitrary vector pointing down oh there it is did you see it there's the firework hey that's exciting okay okay this is good this is good so first of all the map is very bright so um a couple things one is uh the firework colors should probably be much darker it gets a hue and where do i draw the particles here okay so let's just make them darker so i think it'll show up better oop no stroke is not defined where did i type that here there we go see that beautiful firework that went off there now what i'm going to do i could have just asked for lat long i should have had everybody just enter their lat long we could go back and do that okay all right so now what i want to do is one at a time each dot is going to be starting a firework so um now where the firework begins is x y no where's the firework it gets a random location so i want to be able to give the firework a location so i'm going to pass in an x and y okay i'm gonna pass in an x and y and then um so in my sketch now i'm going to have a counter viewer counter equals zero i might want to sort all the viewers by time zone so we'd see the like happy new year ripple across um and i'm going to say in draw if and let's just do it once every 30 frames uh new firework so hold on the the x y uh so uh uh viewer equals viewers uh viewer counter is that right like i want to get what is the current viewer and then i want to make a new i need a new like pixel location i need that pixel location which i can convert that viewer's latitude longitude to the pixel location x y and then create a firework at pix.x pix.y and then a new firework yeah that's good and then i'm still going to draw all the viewers just so i can see and then i should be able to say viewer counter plus plus viewer count is not defined what did i call it viewer counter say viewer index let's whoops let's call it viewer index so viewer index viewer index and obviously i'm going to get to the end of the array at some point but i'll deal with that is there is the mic making weird sound do we see any fireworks oh they're going way yep i see them they're go okay so they're launching way too high so i believe in the firework um which actually makes a particle and it gets an initial velocity which i need to make much less um let's just see if that helps and i don't understand where the gravity thing happens i'm not going to worry about it where was this gravity thing happening i don't understand i don't remember this code oh yeah there we go so they're all being the same color right now and they're okay so this is good yeah i think there's some interference going on i thought i had that corrected with this mic but i'm gonna not worry about it okay wait wait this is good all right it's just very hard to see why is it in a different oh because of the random seed okay we don't need that random seed anymore so let's get rid of this all right we don't need to draw all the dots or oh yeah so let's do that i bet you i could zoom and pan the map also automatically yeah yes print the city so let's have i like this idea so first of all i want these particles to be more visible hue saturation brightness yeah that's better darker so if it's not a firework do this otherwise and then text all right so let's get the city in here so now when i create the firework new firework oh uh oh yeah so i don't want the city here and what i want is to see the city um let's just put it in a fixed location just for a second is it font size or text size i can't remember i think it's text size in p5 city is not defined this city is not defined number seven line seven when i made the firework when i made the firework oh god where do i make the firework here oh now i need the city the name viewer was it name i don't even remember city is that what it is hold on console.log viewer name name so uh make a firework viewer.name okay particle.js oh particle js right silly me yay the cities are popping up well it's something happy new year everybody happy new year goa happy new year chicago happy new year grito all right how do i make this appear a little bit longer and so the other thing i want to do is have them ripple across the map so i think i should sort them so and i should probably have the city name uh i have an idea all right we're gonna we're gonna clean this up a little it's 215. how's everybody doing you stall still with me people actually watching um all right let's try to clean this up a little bit if we had some more donations do we have more new new lyrics do i need to sing some more we're going to finish this off to make something nice not that what we don't have is isn't good already but let's think about how we're displaying the city name well let's first do the sorting so uh i have my list of viewers right viewers is an array so what i want to do is say viewers.sort you know what let's do the x y as part of the viewer here so when that data is the city's data the pixels whoops so data's pixels are converted from its latitude and longitude i mean obviously i should sort by latitude like but i'm going to just use pixels so i could go from right to left it'll make my life easier um so the um so then now down here i actually can just say the viewers pixel.x and the viewerspixel.y and the viewer's name so let me just make sure that this still works okay wait why why is it not getting the lat and the lawn sketch line 43 sketch line 42 oh what what i'm so confused oh well that's obviously a mistake hold on why is it printing out the actual data and then undefined i'll do the fireworks with shaders yeah i don't think so what did i miss here i'm just trying to make things a little simpler grow city oh because some of them ah ah i forgot if i'm gonna do more stuff i need to do it here got it i have it has to be valid then i should be able to say yeah yeah of course give me the pixels uh sketchjs 41 no oh no no yeah ah this goes here okay this is right now i'm getting the data metadata for a given city if i couldn't find it just show me that i couldn't find it otherwise add the pixel value to that metadata and put it into an array that took me way too long to get okay toronto stockholm okay but i took the fireworks out that's fine i no data.pix no the fireworks should still be in there why are the fireworks not showing now what happened to the fireworks console.log viewer.pics all right that's weird is the map not oh because oh i always have to ah no no no no i can't do that the x and y is something that has to be processed and draw because i'm dynamically calculating the pixel values based on the map orientation so this was a lot of wasted energy for something that i cannot do i will have to sort by latitude and longitude fine i can handle that so sorry everybody this has to go back here that was a digression that was a very bad idea and now we should be back to fireworks at the proper location of the given cities okay all right so boy did i waste some time there so let's look at let's think about let's see if we can look at a nice like image of the globe showing us latitude and longitude um so i can like think about sorting it so i want to sort by longitude longitude being the long lines latitude being the so let's try sorting let's just try sorting it by longitude and see what happens so if i were going to go here and say viewers sort and then i need a function that compares a and b two elements of the array and i want to say console log a dot lat b what was i saying i was gonna do longitude b dot longitude just curious all right i get all these numbers now are they strings the question is are they strings because in theory i could just do return b dot long minus a dot long i mean i can make sure they're a number by doing this let's see what this gets me yes look at the happy new year going across okay so i got to do something about the text i got to do something about the text of my uh the city we got to improve that and we i want these to be much sparklier so we're going to we got to make these nicer so let's deal with the t where am i drawing the text i'm just absurdly hard coding drawing it somewhere um so this dot firework so i think i actually always want to draw it whether it's exploded or not as long as yeah as long as there's still life so i'm gonna do uh this dot firework dot is it pause does it does the firework itself have a location no it has a particle yeah this dot firework.pause okay so this should give me the city uh 64 is kind of huge and um text align right aligned and center and then let's draw it over by like five pixels and i i want to fix the okay let's see this should work better this is an improvement i did right aligned why did i do right aligned i meant left or i could just do it center center and put it above that might make more sense so how do i do this where do i get that zoom value um because when i'm drawing the particle there's like the zoom of the map i should have it fade that's what i should have it do okay hold on everybody um i think i mean this is going to be as good as i'm going to get i'm just going to have to hard code the the size in where does it where did i draw it again all right right here okay make it 16. let's get rid of the stroke and does this have like a lifespan does this one have a lifespan i think it does or is it the particle's lifespan i don't know i think it's the fireworks lifespan what is it doing is it drawing it twice let's see if this thing was actually a thing it's 255. that lifespan's not going down why not if the particle shapes into the name of the city then explodes yes that would be good oh no i don't have time for that i do have i've i have ways to get there that's such a good suggestion though wait okay hold on hold on um we're gonna celebrate new year's i swear in some way at some point i want to get so particle if it's not oh if it's not a firework that's only then its lifespan goes down well i'll have its life span go down uh whether it's a particle or whether it's a firework or not why is it not fading let's see here all right hold on i can make this happen on my own accord we're going to go into the firework and we're going to say uh this dot fade equals 255 oh is it because the hue saturation brightness thing this dot fade this dot fade minus equals 10. i don't know why i can't get it to fade out but maybe i shouldn't care it also should be the same color there's so many ways this could be improved oh but i do kind of like it it's something it's a project it works in its own weird way okay all right what can i do to improve this i don't know why the fading is not working um maybe because of hue saturation brightness maybe the text i mean the order shouldn't matter like what if i put just hard code 10 in here it's really making me crazy there we go it's because of the rgb color mode the rgb color mode is messing that up yeah there we go that's what i was going for should just have a color palette not used i don't know why hsb but i want to use the same color as i don't know why the alpha should wouldn't work oh no now it's working except they're all the same but each one should get a new one oh no i so i put that back in there why why why why why why why why why why why why why why is this a bug in p5 have we found a bug in p5 that alpha doesn't work with rgb hold on everybody we will test this okay so um let's draw now a rectangle zero zero two hundred four hundred okay so alpha blending is clearly uh working alpha blending is not working why does anybody anybody see like right like hsb the alpha value is not uh all right we're gonna change this is really making me crazy because i really want it to fade i also want it to be courier font because that yeah but it's hsb is where the issues oh the default is from 0 to 1.0 says bruno ah aha thank you this is probably the case and i just didn't realize that there we are bruno thank you the default for the alpha which uh that's fading out way too fast okay this is better already now i wonder if the text shouldn't actually move like the text should be where the city is all right so this is right so this is what i wanted um i would like i don't know about the font but um okay so now the question is oops the text is not this doesn't really work i'm not really live updating everything's location according to the lat long i should be doing that um because it's really just generating them from where they start but i'll that could be fixed but i have to wrap this up because it's almost three o'clock um and uh like share this somehow or improve it in a way that people could make their own version of it all right so what what should i do what more can i do here before i say goodbye um so we could first of all have many more particles like 500 i think the particles themselves could be bursting out a little bit less far um and or slowing down a little faster um well that's pretty extreme that looks less fireworky so no they should be fading out faster that's that was the mistake for it to be more fireworky i feel like it needs some maybe all the particles should be different colors oh no no no no no no no no no that's the wrong thing it's the lifespan going down oh so where does the so i'm not even doing the life span correctly here this should be 1.0 so this was a mistake in my previous version and an update where does the lifespan go down so confused how come i don't see where i am decreasing the lifespan i don't think the firework manages everything show apply force apply gravity apply force update splice it's weird i don't see that's right that's where i'm using the life span that's where i'm setting the life span that's where i'm checking if it's less than zero i think i deleted it by accident so that's a problem should be an update so anyway let me remedy that yeah i think i just messed that up i don't know they're less fireworky than they were before oh yeah happy new year so what if i sent off a few i think it would be better if i sent off a few in like random locations okay i've got an idea i have an idea this is gonna be better okay okay i'm gonna make this better everybody then we're gonna put this away i only want to change which city i'm on and i should say i should future proof this modulo i only want to change the city every once every second or so and actually we can we could we could even take a little bit longer then i could say if random one is less than like so every 10 frames about create a new firework we could give it a little um we could also have a vector we could also make a little random vector to offset it a little bit so they're not all in the same location oh and it's doing the city multiple times so i like this better already but i think the city should not i think the city shouldn't move it should be doing something more interesting kathy's saying go spend all right i can reduce the number of particles i think but i like this it's more of a pop pop pop exciting thing let's um let's expand the um uh the uh the offset for each of these i think it kind of works i think the text should maybe actually be a different color and over top of it we need some sound effects actually i think i'm kind of happy with this i think it actually just happened faster so um like what if yeah i like it happening faster i think the text i have an idea for the text that's going to make things better um the text where am i drawing the text i am going to go back to text align left and then x plus 25. i don't know how i feel about the text uh i don't know how i feel about the text um repeating itself so many times so what if the text like the firework didn't move okay i even i have an idea what if the text didn't actually move no but it's still why isn't the text just appearing on top of itself oh because i have that random offset where do i do that offset okay i'm going to give it the raw city x i mean i'm really grasping at straws here um this is going to be done in a second i just i'm obsessively want to fix this last thing where the text is is very readable um and when i create the firework now there's this offset but i can just give it pix.x pix.y and now there's so much that could be refactored here there we go i like this better i want the text to fade out a little bit faster so it's not as overlapping so let me do that then i'm going to be done i think i want a different font also oh this is very important stuff here where am i drawing the text again i've already forgotten in firework and it's fading out uh yeah because it's happening much faster now but also we could be way more zoomed in see i want to follow the map it's much it's really nice to be more zoo montreal is not there what i don't know what's going on everybody i'm sorry i think it's not i don't have things properly updating yeah it doesn't yeah i agree all right fine let's go back to all right hold on this i think this is this is where i want to be with this i just i it's got an issue where i can no longer move the map around i i don't know why it's totally off with certain latitude and longitudes what have i done it looked like everything was so right to start i i'm am i not using the zoom properly oh something's wrong with the zoom that's weird i broke something right because if i go back to my original code oh no that doesn't work either no oh yeah oh no it works i just was it was caching let's just see something latitude yeah you know it probably is it's probably that there's these small cities that are named after other cities in the u.s and so that's messing it up because of my silly because there's probably a london colorado you know because i'm not properly looking up the cities but i'm going to leave it at this i'm going to upload this so people can mess with it and make a nicer version of it you can all i can imagine so many improvements i don't know how long have i been going here are people still donating um but i i think um i think um i'm sorry i'm looking at twitter right now this is i think where i'm gonna get to all right what's all right so let's see let's see i think it's time for another song what about you maybe some random numbers we'll leave this going in the background we're celebrating new year's all across the world and i'm sorry for all of the incorrect city locations um let's zoom this in just a little bit good there we go okay all right now let's look where we last left off david keck had said keep singing dan do we have any more song lyrics well that's the question we have any more donations i have to make my donation i guess i'll do that the moment i log off we've definitely hit 500 for sure do we have any new donations we certainly do we have gerard we have stephen kazur we have barry and we have jessica now am i do i have to rely on ai my random number book or some new song lyrics let's see uh there's a pull request there's the auto encoder okay let's take a look pull request stop deleting my song's song processing oh i want it this is great all right oh but we don't want to put python in the bin just to the side just to the side we don't want to cast up we don't want to cat we don't want to uh say mean things about other programming languages thank you anonymous so i'm gonna i'm gonna see if i can flower up this song in real time but i love that it's got processing in it okay so we're gonna merge it maybe i'll maybe i'll do some oh it's already been merged okay wait a sec or committed is it merged revert i don't know what's going on i don't know how to use i don't know how to use this version control i just like to rename my files dash two okay let's go to edit here and go down to okay should hexadecimal be forgot and c sharp not for today should basic just be to basic be my childhood memory and today today i code with really ruining this i'm so sorry for javascript is fine my dear nj sun it does shine we'll put the python aside for now but python is wonderful too for sake of process sign okay all i want for new year is code okay i could maybe make that happen i'm sorry i'm very uh i'm very sensitive to sort of like programming language battles and i um for me it's very important that all programming languages are great to use for different reasons at different times on different days i happen to love using processing in p5 we're here to celebrate that community but that community welcomes in you learning and programming with csharp and python and basic and boy does json does it shine all i want for christmas is code all i want for new years is code okay i could go back to some previous year's songs wait you changed the chords on me i don't know these chords so it does you also changed the chords on me i was doing it in c i think i know them though so it's fine should hexadecimal b forgot and c sharp just not for today should basic just be my childhood memory and today i code with processing for javascript is fine my dear i can't transpose it in my head and json it does shine we'll put the python it doesn't bite aside for now but python is wonderful too you should learn it for the sake of yeah i was struggling the other key but i need pictures of the chords i don't really play the ukulele i just learned those chords this morning or yesterday i i spent a year learning the ukulele like two years ago but i haven't picked it up in at least a year all right i'm gonna be done unless there's more donations um there was something came up though oh yes um where is my holiday songs um all right we can go back in time we can go back in time to 2020. no um all i want for new year's this is pretty good boy these were those were the days i had all this free time everybody wrote all these songs i don't have my ukulele book with all the chords i have a whole book do i have any of the um do i still have the tab with all of my old oh my god i do i don't need a lot for coding there is just one thing i need incentives can keep on floating underneath binary trees i just want the code to work just waiting for you to be done make my code error free all i want for new years is my code to run yeah baby i don't need a lot for new year's there is just one thing i need i don't care about these pixels underneath the computer screen don't need to know my set location or rather the print projection algorithms won't make me happy with a high complexity i got off there high complexity i just want was that even the right song lyrics are the right song i have no idea oh and cranium this is for you go to snowman do you wanna code a snowman we can color with rgb oh i need the melody if you wanna code a snowman we can color with rgb we can coat a stack of circles and a triangle for a nose that's pretty sweet you've just got to use ellipse you can use circle now stroke weight background and then add in a fill that's why do you wanna do you wanna go to snowman it doesn't have to be go away daniel hey wait what's that okay bye oh so me all right thank you ed cranium for your donation 7m chop 7m join today cap 7m welcome to coding train membership today is not about the coding terrain membership program today is about the processing foundation its 20th anniversary in the year 2020 it's not 2020 it's 20 20 21. it's gonna be 2022 what i don't even know what's going on anymore but thank you for joining a random number coming your way find the google form join the discord et cetera et cetera reach out um and all that stuff i'm so tired it's three o'clock how long have i been going three hours ah buffer overflow is exactly right all right are we doing another song okay um let's check uh our donation board um where's the donation page here it is jessica parente do we have another donation do i need to keep going because i will i will keep going i'm really hoping there's more donations i mean i want there to be more donations i just want them to not beat in this in the next two minutes so i can say goodbye i'm gonna have a wild party tonight let me tell you okay everybody thank you thank you thank you thank you oh this has been the cody train um you know the worst thing you can ever do is eat on a live broadcast i've been doing this for three hours and this orange has been here this entire time my mute button is even broken this is going to give me a little boost a little vitamin c little natural sugars encourage you eat the fruit of the land i'm gonna just take a look at the chat i'm gonna wish everybody a happy new year i want to say happy new year everybody i was going to do kind of like a year in review of the coding train but i didn't get a chance to prepare that it's going to take me a couple weeks to get my feet under me in the new year but i have a lot of plans if there are things that you find that are the most useful to you or that you'd like to see more of join the discord let me know support processing um how loud is the chewing it's got to be like just like the most grating thing on your ears right i really hope you enjoyed today this barely happened this year i really want to i know i joke about it but i really want to be able to do more work to prepare and plan for fun projects and goofy shtick and have guests and all of that this coming or maybe it never will nature of code though my new year's resolution here's my new year's resolution to all of you have you been wanting to see a second edition of the nature of code book come out with all javascript examples i mean it's kind of already there but it's not finished and wrapped up and made it a nice neat little bow and you could buy it as a new year holiday present by next holiday if you wanted to buy somebody a physical copy of the nature of code book with in javascript as a present that's my new year's resolution saying it here putting it on the universe otherwise i just want to be a good person and i want my kids to have a good year they'll go to school i want all of you to have your coding dreams come true um i love you all this is such a special thing that i get to do i'm in this garage i want to get this garage set up i want to figure out get this white board working you can see it's apparently not working music is really filling me it's just like generic thank you

processing if you can say it's the last day for those rewards um if you oh whoa whoa whoa whoa let's do this um if you got nothing to do today um let's go uh coding train let's make a new repo coding train oh happy new year 2022 code from today's live stream let's do this i'm going to make this repository then i'm going to so i will accept pull requests to just make this nicer and more interesting but also i would more than that i would encourage you to just grab the code and make your own version of it share it on social media as we all and maybe i'll work on it more today so that tonight we can i can have a nicer um um happy new years all over the world message to send out i wanted to have something that was like a really nice happy new years to the processing community around the world that was kind of the goal didn't entirely get there but i think i would gladly gladly um accept pull requests to making this prettier making it work nicer um and adding like the processing logo and the message messages of love and happiness and support and joy to everybody so i'm just putting it up in its raw format um let's see then i'm going to go to settings and i am going to go to uh pages has its own dedicated tab okay i'm going to just use the main branch all right so oh how come i made it in shiffman not in coding train uh hold on we are going to do settings transfer transfer ownership this is what i always do by the way whoever tells me to type this to confirm i always just copy paste it i feel like i'm this is like i am being so bad i'm like i was like such a rebel oh my god yeah i i'm sticking it to you internet rules but really i'm just hurting myself aren't i because i don't know all right transfer oh you got to be kidding me now i need to put all right let's see if that works okay uh just transfer it okay um so now where do i find it by the way if you want to write me some new lyrics i could start a tick tock and i could just sing old lag sein on tik tok right i made a short of me trying to sing one of them just out of uh on youtube to see how that would go um all right so here on github coding train slash happy new year dash 2022 by the way i don't know why anybody would want to do this but as soon as i the the whole stream archive will be there so hvhbot who's asking um as soon as i uh shut this down i mean you should be able to rewind it right now but it'll certainly be their archive under the same link so now if i go to settings pages should be here all right what's the issue oh mixed content shoot oh what did i do what's insecure element what did it what does it oh okay that should still work right that must be why um let's make sure this still works i don't know oh this still works okay so couple things one is zoom and i gotta make that https so oh i didn't actually all right i'm just going to be lazy and go to um code sorry everybody we're getting there i'm gonna go to where was that just in sketch.js edit look away don't look at how i'm coding best practices where are you in the chat best practices within the chat best practice is going to come and chastise me where is it i don't even know where it is okay zoom one https this is what i'm changing here by the way zoom one and i'm adding https thank you me i am so me for posting the link um i'm hoping that tonight i can make a nice little video like like we can improve this page that's not like it's missing things like it's missing the processing like celebrating processing it's missing the cities being in the wrong place it's missing a way for people to add their own city there's so much we could do today all together because well you have the whole day free to contribute to this um now let's go to i should know how to get to the pages i'm just going to do it the way i know which is here and i'm going to go to here this is ridiculous it'll go to here please work yeah but i think that's just because pages hasn't uh republished yet there we go okay why is it not full screening this map oh i had it hardcoded at 800600 what is wrong with me i didn't know that this is definitely the way to work on a project editing the code on github and expecting github pages to wait to just see if your change has worked okay last let's put it back to 1.5 this is a great idea this is a great idea and change this to window height what could go wrong nothing i tell you nothing commit and he's not any second now any second now any any moment i got nothing i had nothing to do just waiting just hitting refresh having it weirdly centered incorrectly everything about this wrong to caching all right hold on everybody i no longer can tolerate this let's pull down this repo no no no no no no no hmm this is not the one i'm working on i don't know i don't know why that's i just want to leave this in a state that is somewhat manageable somewhat viewable um okay oh i forgot i did that no wonder i was like messing around for no reason okay why is the zoom okay that's better there we go okay okay fix zoom etc okay nobody look nobody look i'm pushing directly to me nobody look nobody look nobody look cover your eyes avert your eyes just don't speak don't look there we go now we just have to wait for it to rebuild so hold on i can do this though this is fine okay how much can i zoom in a little more and still get the whole world no by the way i would totally take like a dark theme for the map all right this is pretty good i just want to make sure new zealand is there all right good enough oh no okay hold on come on rebuild rebuild github pages there we go okay it's kind of zoomed all the way out but i don't care there we go all right everyone uh this is our happy new year okay so so i uh i mean i want to say i'm going to work on this more i don't know that i really will but i will be glued to my github pull request notifications so if you have an idea for how to visually improve this to how to pull the longitude values from the cities more accurately um i will also gladly if you want to continue to enter your cities in um i'll put the form uh if someone wants to pull requests to the readme i'll link to the form i need all the help there's a way this project could come together or maybe this is just how it is this is my happy new year to you um i'll just do one last check because you never know you never know you never know you never know if somebody has donated and i hope that you're just not donating because you're waiting for me to log off so that you can donate because you don't want me to sing anymore i totally get that do i get to go and be done today i'm really really hoping i get to be done thank you everybody donate the processing have a happy new year all around the world a p5.js new year to all of you this needs so much more to wish you a p5.js processing foundation new year but it's about all i can manage oh no no no no no you're now no no no i mean yes yes yes i mean yes yes thank you your support goes a long way to supporting all the people who work on processing in p5 and the fellowships and google summer of code and all of the things that happen and uh i don't know if you have a particular request me i am so me but i think a nice ald lang sign random numbers might be what's called for might be what's called for here i was i was gonna go um i have to find i've to find where i have the chords here okay so i am reading from the book a million random digits with 100 000 normal deviants i could do another gpt3 lyrics but i really think we're just going to start from the you know what maybe 2022 will be the year that i actually figure out a way to read through this entire book we're gonna start on page one right at the beginning of the story this is my new year's song all lang syne as played by daniel shiffman on the ukulele who doesn't really know how to play the ukulele but just learned a few chords this is the table of random digits to the tune of ald lang syne as performed by me and case anybody wants to do anything with this later i'll just let you have this version of it one zero zero nine seven three two five three three seven six five two zero one three five eight six three four seven three four six seven three five four it's really hard to put random numbers it's really hard to put red numbers to the tune of something when you don't really really know the song or like my dear five four five and four five four eight seven six eight zero zero nine oh nine is good kind of rhymes with all the blank sign zero nine five nine zero nine one one seven and thirty 39 39 29 happy new year everybody oh i think we just do we'll just do we'll just do the the real lyrics should all acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind should all acquaintance be of kindness yet and days of old blank vine thank you everybody i'm saying goodnight goodbye good afternoon happy new year wishing you a happy new year from all around the world with processing in p5js if you donate now there's no more songs i can't do it i'll see you next year on the coding train i'm coming back in full force i really hope what if i would like to live stream every day what if i did new courses new videos new styles i don't know if anything could happen i probably won't be able to do any of it because life is really hard thank you for being with me for tuning in you are all the best and um i don't have any more oranges to eat i'm gonna go do some grocery shopping um uh have a cup of tea relax see love each other um code is fun and great make something creative make something for your work make something for your friends but also take a break from it be outside or the inside or all the other kinds of things you might do get a sweater play the violin learn to play the ukulele cook i made the most delicious vegan bolognese sauce the other day it's like their possible meat from scratch my kids get through their minds and i'm like 20 22 i'm gonna cook more that's what i ended on all right uh goodbye everybody i'll leave this up um as i slowly turn things off and feel free to contribute to this maybe we can make it do some wonderful things later 32 minutes to go in east africa happy new year to east africa 32 minutes to go are you tired you must be tired of the old leg zion song all right i am saying goodbye um and i will see you all in the new year my mute button
