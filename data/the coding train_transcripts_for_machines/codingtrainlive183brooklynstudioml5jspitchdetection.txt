I think I'm live but I don't actually know hello and welcome to the coding train oh I do have my whistle it's so nice to see you maybe you don't see me maybe I'm doing this hello thing and I'm just doing it to myself because I don't see anybody in the chat saying that they see me yet I do see open broadcast studio over here streaming I do see myself in a confidence monitor I feel confident today I have a confidence monitor I am new confident Dan oh you do see me yay oh that's interesting my stream dekha is not hooked up properly observer so I this new tool I have so many things to say I don't even know maybe you've never watched before you have no idea where you are I'm very very excitable there's like new notifications thing I just got like a message I was by the way if you tagged me now in slack a little message pops up on this screen that I have over here that's kind of cool I didn't do that on purpose it just happens but I have this like Elgato stream deck not a sponsor but could be a sponsor and supposedly when I press this button it's going to oh did worked dude in the attitude in the chat by the way this a little bit more volume okay okay this I can probably do this I can probably handle a little more volume a little bit afraid to turn it up because all signs point to being plenty yes Marcos it does work your message popped up here on the screen hmm all right a little more Vaughn I have it all the way up oh I know where I can turn it up I have by the way all new equipment new lights I really want to show you something this is what I'm the most proud of this hold on a second this is very I have to show you this I have this'll just take a second I don't have it set to like there we go what is this why it's on there okay here we go look at this I mean come on look at this green screen there's a little bit of shadowing but there these new lights coming from all sides very little shadowing you know I almost want to just do the whole livestream like this that's just too wonderful okay I better turn that back on though I think that's probably the best plan all right let's turn this back on chroma keying myself out is my slack in dark mode I have no idea um I don't think it is I just installed this III I don't even know where to begin this is I should have thought about what I was gonna do oh no now it does tell me my stream deck has come online and it tells me how many people are watching all right this is gonna shock you I have another button I could press I'm a little bit afraid to press it so this is what I really have not completed yet the other side first I don't know why this is so dark looks kind of dark I don't know what the quality is interesting thing is I have this camera on autofocus so I can walk up here and I could talk to you like this this is me streaming to you talking to you saying hello welcome to the coding training all of my facial imperfections please enjoy the gray in the beard all right that was weird but okay back I probably should set the focus to this whiteboard I do have smarter surfaces magnetic whiteboard wallpaper on the wall but it needs something called vinyl on over vinyl adhesive which I don't have so I'll be going to some hardware store ordering something then I will get that and then I'll be putting that on the wall so that I can do some white boarding I mean I can move this out of the way you can see the wall I mean I'm tempted to just start drawing on the wall because why not but I'm gonna put the white it's magnetic too so I can hang stuff up but for today I just have this rolling white board and I can do things like draw well this this this marker is terrible I can draw a kitty cat by the way can I just plug something I probably shouldn't do this oh I shouldn't reveal I shouldn't reveal but I have an Instagram you should follow it's on my Instagram I have new cats the cats evidence' gram right now there are four kittens living in my house two of them are about to be adopted so I will just have to but if you want to follow them on Instagram it's mango and goose those aren't there those are the middle names mango and goose this is what people tuned in for it right for me to talk about my cat cats the gram do remember how there was this thing on the internet called the coding train and you would learn how to code and there was this friendly person who would come and teach you concepts and you would make creative projects it went away and it came back and then there was just like a totally insane person showing you about their new whitewalled enclosed room with no windows and very bright LEDs shining on me boof I hope you can hear me still I haven't even bothered to check the chat or anything uh I've seen how the chat says seeing Dan's facial hair in 1080p definitely made my day guess what if you thought that was good I I'm sure I could get this up to 4k suited because these cameras the new cameras I have do 4k I am NOT I don't believe I'm capturing 4k I'm certainly not live streaming in 4k maybe try looking at the camera a little more yeah needs to move so here's the problem everybody's telling me to move the lights to the ceiling I would like to say that I could do that there's a real problem this is me touching the ceiling it's a very low ceiling it's just like a couple feet above my head there is no grid it's this this is not an ideal space I might move all this equipment again because the lights should definitely be on the ceiling but my sound is good when your face isn't close to the camera that was weird I don't know what that means oh by the way I have this crazy like noisecanceling thing on so people were telling me that maybe this is too much let's just do a little debugging of that for a second just so you the larger audience can help me with this oh yeah you know it's really sad it's really sad I have something to announce I don't have any so it's a fight I can't let me see hold on maybe maybe just maybe uh three percent I've been charging this tablet which has my sound effects on it for like the last 45 minutes and it never came alive and it finally just came alive and it's at 3% so let me give it a couple more minutes and then we can have our music again I was gonna do a drum roll I don't know actually let's wait and see has it been 30 minutes yet I don't think these cameras are going to go to sleep I don't know that I've tested this I really don't think they're gonna go to sleep people're tell me to look at the camera more so I always have looked directly at the camera right now I'm looking directly at the camera I don't know if this is effective but actually what I do with this new setup I have these confidence monitors I find myself looking at those but maybe if I'm looking at the confidence monitor it doesn't really feel like I'm looking at you like if I would walk over here and say and unfortunately this is not on auto focus so you just have to live with my blurry face you know when you stream in a room by yourself it causes you to do strange things that you would never ordinarily do in front of other people or maybe that's just me most people would not do that strange things currently seven minutes your audio levels are consistently six to ten decibels too low alright so the wonderful thing is that I have a full focus right 4x4 audio interface which this lav mic is going into I need to do another sort of tour of this studio and explain all the equipment it's a lot of this it's the same principle but different stuff so I am going to come over here and I'm going to pump up the volume I'm gonna need Christian Slater for this but I think I can handle it okay I just pumped up the volume a little bit didn't do it scientifically I just turned a dial who doesn't even have any numbers to like tell me whether I'm in an 8 or 9 or an 11 but I think it's there when you're at your desk it looks fine when you look at the confidence monitor when at the whiteboard is a little more jarring somehow that's interesting let's try that again tell me if the volume is better oh it's gonna talk to you about the noise canceling I have going on okay let's see so what you're saying to me is when I'm over here and I'm looking at the confidence monitor it's kind of jarring but if I look at you at the camera look at you I'm looking at you looking directly into the camera this feels more like we're friends we're here we're gonna code all that sort of stuff yes No so you tell me all right so um what's going on today so first of all this I don't this is not I would say this is this is not the season premiere I feel like I might need to go to a seasons model because my life is entirely built around academic semesters and I was thinking of having like a fall season and the spring season and then a summer season and then a break so I might I'm thinking about doing something like that because even though my hiatus was much too long this summer in in the end it was almost a full it was possibly over two months so I don't don't intend to have a hiatus that long from livestreaming but I do think each summer like taking a month break is I'm just doing so and so I'm that's not really the important thing right now I'm just looking at the chat to tell me everything is perfect no improvement is needed the monitor care louder you know people are talking if the whiteboard is reflective don't worry about that I'm going to I have Matt the wall covering that I'm going to this is just a very temporary thing the wall covering we'll be Matt is Matt so we won't be too reflective I'm best at the sound delay oh the sound blaze gone so interestingly what I one thing I want to just show you sound is absolutely good enough thank you Peter what's nice about this too when I get these popup messages from slack is it has a little face so I see a little face hi thanks Peter alright let's let me go here I just want to show you one other feature that I have here David Cohen is asking are you on Twitch no no no I mean I could be it's a thing I have the technological capability to do but for whatever reason I stream on YouTube YouTube streaming person thing I don't know not on twitch at the moment okay so let me go to this is the thing I want to show you audio advanced audio properties no that's not what I want to show you filters okay I'm going to demonstrate something to you at the moment right so this room in addition to the ceiling being right there this room has some very loud ventilation incidentally if you're wondering what's behind me right over here is a bathroom anybody in there if I have to go which I often do the fight stream for like three or four hours it won't be very far away which is nice on the other side I think it's a shirt shop so there might be some loud noises simply not soundproof in here and there's a very loud ventilation sound it's not that bad but it's a if I were trying to record you know a you know those were like a fully room or trying to record a podcast would be a problem I think with a lav mic and live streaming the the buzz the hum from the ventilation isn't a huge issue but you don't hear it right now because I have OBS an open broadcaster do you have noise suppression on so I'm going to turn that off for a second so now you should be hearing I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat now you should be hearing the sound of the hum now I was monitoring myself on a headphone on a Helen a headphone this is a headphone this is headphones now I can hear myself it's a little bit weird cuz there's a slight lag and I hear that hum i'm gonna click noise suppression and it's gone so i like this without the noise but people the other i did a test livestream with a smaller non public audience and some of the people said to me is a little creepy how silent it is so there is a suppression level variable that i can play with but i couldn't really make it do anything i'm gonna do something with it right now so I am going to way better without the noise canceling so that's your voice is much clearer alright this is gonna be our first ever and also something's weird about the color right doesn't the color of this background look different than what it used to be or am I just crazy because I have a different monitor over here so many things let's do our little strawpoll exercise for the first time straw pull just try this one noise suppression yes and I like it I like the quiet no it's too quiet alright so this is going to be the pole I'm gonna hit create pole and this is the URL if somebody could oblige and place this URL in the if someone could place this URL in the chat thank you and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let you hear this again so I'm gonna talk throughout the whole thing and then I'm also gonna do it and do it and Simon is pointing out to me there's also a noise option that one I tried and it causes a lot of like clicking and going in and out so that one really didn't work very well the colors are a bit off the window is not white right is that but no wait it's weird is that my like setting oh you know what it might be is there like a display color settings or something like I thought what it was was night the thing that's called like no not this that like night vision thing on iOS is not iOS with Mac OS which is somewhere in Energy Saver where is that is there a setting where so we hold on let me do the sound thing first there's like a setting there must be like a color setting thing which I don't know why I'm staring at this as if I'm gonna find it let me do the noise thing okay all right here comes the noise the noise suppression is on noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on these pretzels are making me lose suppressed notes this noise suppression is making me thirsty that would have been better the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on north suppression is off the noise suppression is off you need the link somebody post the link display night shift tab yeah oh so I wasn't the right place yes but night shift is off so there must be some other kind of color this is what I'm looking for display color ah do you think this is the issue on definitely honest better oh I'm gonna books ah alright I the syllables are clear off there's a middle ground to have the noise suppression I agree I don't know how to set it I can't find the middle ground I want to find the middle I live in the middle I'm all about the middle alright hold on let's try other color profiles could this possibly whoops ah look did that do something there's nobody there's really nobody who has admin privileges in the chat to post that link there we go thank you okay week Mon Nathan growl is going to help me okay I'm ready I'm here I'm following your instructions I'm at your command people tell me what color profile to use hi Gaelic that's so nice I'm so glad to hear that you started programming from watching this channel no no I found the night show people are yeah I forget that you're in the past I am in the future you're in the past oh wait let's see if I can get my sound effects going oh I'm only at 6% after all of that time charging okay it's true tone so I'm supposed to select true tone I don't know how computers work I don't see an option called true tone calibrate what do I do no I don't want builtin retina I want this ah Pro capture no wonder true tone what do i do what do i do it's a color LCD color match so do anything did that do something turn off true tone there's where we're going to I turn off true tone I don't know how to do that open profile all right let me get my sound going somebody will tell me turn off true to know how completely incompetent I have a master's degree and interactive telecommunications I can't even find the charger charger ah here it is I have a charger I have a USB C 2 lightning charger display display tab uncheck true tone okay thank you NIT eh display display uncheck display display tab display display tab I see no unchecking true tone oh there it is but this is for the retina display it shouldn't affect the output to the capture oh I guess I did it do Apple RGB 1998 is that better turn the computer off him at haunt again two tabs to the left yes I can't tell if it change did it change I'm sorry for those of you are here for the coding well there will be some coding today but it's I'm haven't even been a half an hour you oh no no no no no no no no no no no I do not not new message color is better now okay great what did it the true tone or the Adobe RGB who knows let's check the straw poll hmm so more people are voting for the no noise suppression I don't know how new oh I'm sorry pronounced Nidhi didn't help me did I say it wrong nighty sorry I don't know how to pronounce 1998 and true tone off is too white oh no like this like livestreaming settings by committee is a really bad idea but hold on I'm over here trying to get some music playing so give me a minute here 1998 seems more oldfashioned rap I'm gonna I'm gonna put that back i I do like the idea of being like an oldfashioned retro live streaming let's go back to color sync utility I did not need that okay System Preferences displays your turn is off oh I see automatically adapt display make colors appear consistent in different ambient lighting conditions got it so let's go back to house this regular Apple RGB or whatever it was on it was like HD how about this HD 709 a meaty haha mailed it to does that work makes me so happy it's so sad I have this Elgato stream deck and I've only used four buttons so far so eventually I'll get some more come on here we go let's get to not now I don't need to verify don't want to verify anything just give me my music okay I don't hear it do you hear it whoa super loud coming in super loud coming in alright everybody now what I used to use for this is something called loopback whoops yeah yeah yeah it's a little little behindthescenes magic here there we go wait we have 30 minutes yet switch over here yeah you don't music is gone you need to add the music to this shot why is it so dark am I crazy is this like really dark oh the cameras like Auto stuff I need to put the camera on manual left is much louder this gyms bonus a little weird okay well so one thing do you know what that's my fault I actually have separate control it's gonna be too loud sorry buddy request from Michael Michelle underneath the pronunciation help for this time is it better now the weird thing is the mic is picking it up so much so I just turn the mic off this is the audio without getting it from the mic this dog this dog the start that this stock song never forget the best on but somebody composed that song for me so almost inaudible like when you say was almost inaudible it's always almost inaudible now I or when I when I mute my microphone it's inaudible this is really good for me to be biking all this Oh the laptop mike is the laptop Mike oh you mean I don't know laptop Mike so I don't understand what people are telling me no to sound inputs right now are this Mike and the the music is inaudible is the music inaudible right now oh now I'm throwing it stop this stop this I have to remind everybody that it's very very you know I'm just an idiot to this because I can actually monitor it to get hot where's my air conditioning a we too loud but better than before I have very fine control over this audio hey it's coating garden with CJ here okay hi Cody garden with CJ alright beam your name is CJ I don't have to refer to you as Cody garden with CJ but it says on my screen love your icon a little plant alright I think I'm done with my good down I think I'm it's as good as it's gonna be we got it I got to do something else got some color got a computer alright so welcome everyone to the coding dream I am your host Daniel chief Mon and I am here to read to you from my book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates because what we need in this world in these turbulent times is a way of relaxing a meditative experience a way to connect with each other and for me very strangely it happens to be reading random numbers seventy one thousand three hundred eighteen 68,000 876 53,000 986 1289 fiftyeight thousand nine hundred and thirtyfour seven it was seven to seven ninety five twenty seven thousand five hundred and thirty seven twentythree thousand three hundred and fifty three twenty one thousand five hundred and twenty five six thousand one hundred and fifty five fifteen thousand one hundred forty six thirty seven thousand four hundred and seventy eight maybe a thousand five hundred sixty six thirty six thousand eight hundred and eightythree twentysix thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven so what this is is a youtube channel where I oh I have to interrupt myself again oh this is I'm the worst because oddly enough to switch to the other camera for some reason I have this like it was doing some cleaning and various things that have this perfectly green little towel which I could use to like erase the whiteboard but I'm gonna get a dirty so I just really feel like I need to walk into the other scene wearing it also what's gonna be fun is I will show you this very very strange mysterious can of paint what is going on with this weird can of paint you know what's going on it it's got green on it that's the actual paint I painted that whiteboard okay so I was saying is this is a YouTube channel where every week and I think it's gonna be Friday's for the foreseeable foreseeable future I think that I'm gonna alternate between doing live streams that are in the morning my time which would be about 900 a.m. my time eastern time you can do your math as to where you are and 500 p.m. Eastern Time so today was a 500 p.m. Eastern time today I heard from a lot of you that like it's midnight my time it's 100 a.m. my time I'm gonna stay up to watch you know get some sleep take care of yourself it's much of your health and your your sleep and your is much more important than coding and me and YouTube and all that nonsense but to the extent that I can alternate different times to help people with different parts of the world catch the live streams I'm happy to do so and it works well with my schedule because sometimes I have something the morning sometimes there's something in the evening I do feel a little bit like Friday at 500 p.m. is not the best time for the live stream I have a very busy week if you haven't watched before I happen to have this strange fulltime job where I work at New York University it's actually where I am right now I'm at the new building in Brooklyn so in this building on the floor where I am is a program called ITP interactive telecommunications program I would pull up all these websites or slides but do that there's also an undergraduate major called ima or Interactive Media Arts downstairs for me is the inter integrated digital media program from the Tannen School of Engineering upstairs is the Clive Davis Center for recorded music remove recorded music Department one floor up is the NYU game Center did you know let's see if there live right now this would be amazing if they were they don't think they are NYU game game I can type game Center live YouTube here we go this should get us where's the live streams oh there we go so they were life looks like it was live stream yesterday come on people oh you can't see this watch the game Center live we can help them out here um so anyway check out that anyway you gave centers here I'm hoping to do more some stuff with them maybe invite some guests go upstairs I don't know we'd love to collaborate with them as well elsewhere in this building I believe there's a computer science department there's some engineering departments there's something called cusp which is the Center for urban studies and planning I believe lots of stuff in this building it's very exciting I love being in Brooklyn I live in Brooklyn and so there's a lot of convenience now it took me a long time to get back up and running with this equipment in this room so hopefully I'm gonna be here now for you know until the middle of December every single week I have some ideas and other things that I might try to do with the channel a little surprises hopefully plan which I will speak to but what I wanted to use today for beyond what I wanted to use today for beyond just kind of testing the equipment and getting back in the habit of doing this is to say like it's hard like I didn't really feel like doing this again today I mean I hate to admit that because this is one of the things that I enjoy in my life the most and the community that's around and the people that I've met and the people who leave comments and watch the videos and create all these amazing things that I never imagined to be possible from these videos but you get kind of out of the habit and I was like I just want to go home like play with kittens I have kittens I mean I there are four kittens living in my house right now it's a little bit nutso and we need to those other two kids are being adopted I think two is the right number I mentioned on Instagram you can follow some of mango and goose fill up that Instagram come on that's so but I'm now that I'm doing it I feel really good and excited I feel like there's a lot more work to do i i'm i don't want to livestream with a lot of the you know there's a lot of nice inside jokes in terms of the imperfections and things that don't work and the camera shutting off but i would like to have a bit more of a professional operation mostly just to have a higher quality content so there so that's what's happening the channel is meant to be for a beginner i have if you've never watched before which i don't know if it's so many of you i have a thank you k weak bond for posting him to the gents awesome i have what am I trying to say sorry i thought of the kittens again when i lost my train whoa that was loud of thought does it say to yeah that's funny because when i press the button you see the choo choo and then a little later i press the button whatever so what i want to one of the things i want to use today for is to get organized i have a lot of new stuff that i'm planning stuff that's coming together but it's taken longer to come together so i actually even though this whiteboard is a little bit janky for today i'm going to use it to make a list of things that I want to accomplish this fall and through December in terms of content on this channel and then I really want to try to stick to that or use it as kind of guide a checklist so to speak and you guys can help keep me you all of you watching can keep me honest in terms of what I'm getting to and not getting to so I'm gonna first I'm just gonna brainstorm let me first figure out which marker works but I could type this up so I could make this a type list but I feel like doing this on the whiteboard and then we will write it down ah look at that this is a much better marker I don't know why what's the difference I'm going to come up close to you and show you as far as I can tell there's no difference between these markers they're the same but this one works and this one doesn't okay so things that I want to accomplish this fall so there's like leftover stuff I better call it leftover tictactoe minimax I remember this was left dangling can you see this at all yeah you can kind of see that it's not the greatest the something I gotta do something more with the Rubik's Cube I don't know what that's gonna be definitely have to do something more let's talk about machine learning so that's another topic I want to do something called a latent space walk space walk that's definitely something I want to do I probably will use runway for that a runway m/l that's something I definitely want to do I want to spend some time on the ml5 this is not a thing that exists on the internet right now but I have a version of this new I tweeted this out so a little bit I apologize for the glare this is a new function in ml 5 called neural network that allows you to train a model from that from scratch you basically what allows you to do is you if you have a data set if it's in a JSON format or a CSV format you can load it in ml 5 will create a neural network architecture for you based on just some heuristics making some best guesses and then you can train a model and use it so that's something I absolutely want to do there are probably like so this this is what's off the top of my head so let me take a look at the chat right now and see if anything has come in by the way I'm getting much better at solving the Rubik's Cube I didn't actually brings in this summer fry birthday my kids bought me everything by four you know whatever my family bought me a nine by nine Rubik's Cube which I spend quite a bit of time it took me about most of the day to solve it but I could solve it now that was a lot of fun okay tree data structure that's a hint I Claire p5 Jess that would be good let me come back over here for a second so the other so where do you find ah yes so thank you Simon brought something up which I'm gonna put so I'm gonna put that under J s topics like these are really just like programming topics um so let's call that generator function this is something that I've been meaning to look at and maybe talk about at some point over here I should write challenges so this will be like new challenges and again this isn't like these are the things I'm gonna do this semester this fall winter and nothing's gonna change I just want to have a little bit of a plan and something to work with so that I'm kind of keeping track of the larger picture and getting a sense of like what people are interested in tree for the minimax yes so okay so let me see what else don't forget n dimensions all right so n dimensions okay yeah people are asking for oh you doesn't change automatically people are mentioning reinforcement learning that I that I'm very interested in I hesitate to write that down right now because it's a bit more of the purview of what I plan to do this spring I mean I make a year behind at this point and where I wanted to be with that so I kind of want to put that there but I don't I'm not super ready to commit to that right now okay WebGL and shaders Oh P something that I would like to also have as a general topic if I'm sort of thinking of topics is like open source so I think I could do more with git and github but I probably need to detail that a bit better okay so a bit harder for me to use this stream deck but I do enjoy it okay so a couple things one let me you know most of you I think who are watching or familiar with the channel I'm getting the sense but they're probably people have never watched before so if you're looking for to sort of learn about the coding train you know use two first stops one could just be the channel homepage but also the coding train website itself and this is where you'll find some of the categories of the kind of content that I make so there's coding challenges which are really just you know oneoff videos I want to do more computational geometry hello so many things you can see these here so these are them and you know if you see it's a wide variety of topics relating to algorithms and drawing in various things well I really have made a lot of content it's kind of a big thing Oktoberfest thank you for mentioning that so maybe we can do I can plan to do something around Oktoberfest write that down over here a functional on Oh Opie stuff so what am I missing from the sort of yeah so I think I need a more specific suggestion than that but that is something an automated switch for they can't write you yeah yeah I probably should do that I don't know okay then there are tutorials I mean do I need to what I might like to redo some of these beginner ones that are quite out of date but I guess I'm gonna hold off on that right now alright so let's go look at so another place where I kind of compile things that I'm interested in I had people suggest is this github reap positive repository called a rainbow topics I really keep meeting to change the names of these repos to be like Train themes they're like be like stations or stops or something like that but when we were this other when I was when I would we when this was a different channel with another name back in the day it was called rainbow topics I just can't bring myself to change it so let's look at this so one thing I'm gonna do is sometimes when I'm interested in something I like assign it to myself so let me look at that first okay autoencoders uhhuh well this I did ah yes marching squares marching cubes absolutely want to do that let's write that here marching squares cubes that's one it and the reason why I'm making this list I have another sort of plan now already P and this is a little bit our DP algorithm is something I really want to do toothpick I did toothpicks oh you know I'm not really standing in the place where I'm kind of like off my because I'm usually over here and then I have more room here not really fully used to this layout yet Fibonacci spiral part four of nerve evolution what was that water ripples I mean I have to go through all these yeah I think I did this ah Bora Rose is definitely happening but I have a plan for that so I don't but I'll put that put that on the board I did pull the roses but a more roses a slightly different thing flocking challenge I did wait are these no they're the only opens Wow we really got to go through these kmeans clustering yeah I do want to do that tree that tic tac toe I did no more no more fluid simulation please Alam spiral oh this is patron recommended ASCII art generator that's kind of like a fun one I don't know how I would do that something around like ASCII art let's do that so David is telling me oh and David could you a Voronoi yes actually um JavaScript promises okay well so many so many things are coming in hold on hold on when it is high what are they dying everybody Voronoi I died I'm afraid of that but it is something that goes on the list I think I need can I just please right now just put de Launay triangulation and then if I can manage to do that the next step then then you can tell me to do Voronoi I need to build up to it okay so the other okay we hold on David had said something procedurally generated textures yeah what did I mean by that I so apparently in a video I said that I wanted to generate do procedurally generated textures I think I'll need to like go back dive back into that tictactoe ai yes a wire world cellular automata to C++ yeah okay interesting all right so um now let me look at another so the course that I'm actually teaching where I need to make some videos to go along with it github.com slash Schiffman no no it's in the ml 5 organization under intro to ml arts ima oh how come I'm not signed in I guess I won't worry about that right now so I'm gonna look at this syllabus because I want to make videos for all of these things so I've made videos about image classification I've made videos about transfer learning I'm gonna be making a video it goes under the ml list but I'm not ready to it's happening for sure but I'm not ready to announce it yet but it has to do with so I'll be coming to that pretrained models physical interactions so I think that I want to do so another topic is image segmentation models in ml 5 so that's at the moment that's you net I guess I'm you net and there's another one body pics so those are two I mean that I would even do today you might have you know I'm kind of like I feel like I'm here till 700 so another a little over an hour but I have some other things I think I might do today but that's that goes on that list there I've already got the ml 5 neural network data collection model training data collection model training convolutional neural networks what the heck did I mean by that oh dear oh not I don't know what happen I don't know what I'm doing with that so on the syllabus I don't know what's happening with that recurrent neural networks I do want to do more with so let me go back here so I want to do I want to do I want to do interactive sketch RNN I have a sketch or an end video but I want to do interactive sketch are an N and that is going to relate directly to doing RDP so I need to do our DP to go along with that I'm gonna move this opensource thing somewhere else because the machine learning list is going to get long so opensource what did I have right now we you really just had to do something for hack tober fest I wrote git and github but I actually feel like I need I don't want to put general things on here I do that too much like I want like specific video topics so like generator function is a specific video topic soak a week suggesting explaining how filters and pooling layers work yeah I would like to do a video on that I'm waiting into the territory of where ml5 kind of like hides and obscures those things but I'm gonna talk about it in my class at NYU so I don't know let's I'm gonna table that okay data collection in a Python environment trading and uh magenta let's put that on the list this is not my strength but I'm gonna try to do something with did I make a video and sound classification I did but I'm gonna do like a maybe a melody generator RNN so I wanted to do something with that run more stuff with runway I'm gonna do like yeah I mean this interactive image synthesis so that's also a thing that I want to do I did a few videos like I've done videos on this already but I haven't really done the videos on this so I'm gonna do interactive image synthesis for sure which is another basically image segmentation but in the other direction so I'm gonna say image I know that segmentation but like in the other direction so interactive image synthesis so and I should emphasize that for these topics I'm really using higherlevel tools so I'm using ml 5 and I'm using runway which is why I'm not sure what to put about like CNN on here convolutional neural network because I don't think that what I'm gonna do or have the time for or the the ability to really this semester is like program a convolutional neural network from scratch but I could use tensor flow ji you know what we're putting them putting that on there CN n because even if I don't do it in my course at a minimum I could talk about what a convolutional layer is and go through it and then make a convolutional neural network in tension flow DJ s that's a topic I feel confident in so these are all my ml topics these are some challenges that I want to do what are ones that are like highly requested Tetris thinking of game things that people are always asking me to do so oh so this is what I'm going to do next so Simon is asking doesn't melody generate or go under the challenge list probably but I'm not worried right now I'm not worrying about where the video is actually gonna live I'm just trying to organize the topics so yeah I might make it a coding challenge like melody generator but it's still with so we'll see okay so the other thing the other way that I look for these topics is by going to I'm gonna clear my filter that our assignment it's gonna look at the open issues Atari breakout I've never done Opeth because I had a guest meaning she do breakout but you know people would enjoy seeing me do it so that's a great one we add that there oh you know what's left over here's another left over neuro steering don't call it so that live stream never got edited into a condensed video which I think would have value for people because right now the only way to look at my explanation and demonstration of that is to watch like two or three hours which maybe some people actually want to do but I would like to make a shorter video out of that then this is what I like to do ah neat neat yes so neat memory game with numbers that sounds like fun let me sort this by most thumbs up so this is another way that I sort this by most thumbs up so we've got a bunch of these already storm hydrology simulator wait when did this appear I don't even remember seeing this oh wait I think I know this channel oh my goodness totally missed this totally miss this what I totally miss I totally want to do this okay oh my god I better login so I can reply to this where's my phone needs a twofactor this baby getting tweets from people asking to post my cats to Twitter oh yes I'll post my cats to Twitter don't you worry oh no I got to get some code here Authenticator plugging my stickers yeah 946 this is probably is this insecure for me like doing this live I don't think it matters it's gonna regenerate itself okay I don't know how did I miss this oh here by the way frequently is this is oh that member joining Joe Paris gets a choochoo this by the way is basically just sums up everything I think this if people could just like screenshots his I feel like this like just summarizes my entire life right here and I would just use all of them oh it didn't even I forgot how to do it that's so weird I was like oh it's just like being slow whatever there we go store but be very very careful about doing these emojis correctly there we go good enough good enough okay well I've lost a lot of viewers could work Schiffman ah a new member thank you thank you to Joe Paris for joining us a new member I'll talk about the membership stuff in a minute okay going back nope going oh here okay computer vision fluid dynamics 3d water physics computer craft Turtles Oh bro Noi electron I totally will happily do that so that goes under J s topics or open source let's put it here electron tetris pi day github tires in convert Karman vortex street and that looks terrifying tariffs oh no no we're fluid stuff help that marching cubes oh oh I like this this is awesome Collatz conjecture like that so I have by the way I have a whole new way I'm gonna pick challenges that I've just thought of it like kind of a sort of thing about it today so and those are two David Wright's those are two things I saw in rainbow topics I'm not sure what that's referring to another new member candle hitokiri no all right so I think this is I'm just doing this one page hexagonal grid what's this exactly yeah I think this could actually be really good and Oh red blobs games is like one of my favorite websites and this is looks like some very helpful information that I could probably follow I'm looking for there we go look at that yeah let's do that so that's also a coding challenge so this is good cuz I've got I'm at the bottom of the whiteboard here there's another new member with a Cyrillic name Russian name I believe that I cannot pronounce one two three four five six seven eight nine so this is a good these are things I need to get to that I did before I mean I'm sure there are more things but let me talk about now Oh nightbot yes I've so many people have recommended nightbot to me I don't know I don't know if that's like I think let me I guess I guess I can make another category here I've kind of out of room but which is stream improvements let's brainstorm some of these right now so nightbot what else oh I want to do more with the stream deck I guess I'll just put things here if they come up all right Oh pacman and whirly noise yep so I'm a little bit afraid to do pacman but I'll put it on the list I'm very afraid to do whirly noise but we shouldn't live in fear of these topics there we go all right so I think I want to do some coding today so let me just talk about some kind of administrative stuff in terms of my plans so I am revamping not significantly the membership slash patron program I haven't I'm not fully decided about any stuff and a huge thank you to psy who has come on board as a coding trained community manager has been thinking through a lot of this stuff communicating with those of you who have joined helping you make sure you get your stuff in the mail if you have questions about being a patron or a member or if you are one and you haven't received something that you were promised please reach out directly to psy you can do that in the slack channel through a direct message if you don't have a slack invite then you should reach out to info at the coding train comm or sigh that's CY at the coding train comm David I do want to showcase contributions yes David do you think you could make me like a bitly link or something like that because that way I can just get to that document you made very quickly so Nathan go to bed and don't worry that not all the livestreams won't all be at this time this is just this week I'm going to definitely do some earlier in the day okay so one of the main things that I'm changing about being a patron or a member is I don't think that were male people signed books anymore I would love to be able to get people signed books so I'm trying to think of a new gift and I'm working with standard so if you're not familiar with a standard they are a company that does a lot of different services for different YouTube creators oh you can't see me I've been in the wrong screen for like the longest time there I am over there camera bot is a must yeah okay stream improvements camera bot so I'm hoping to launch a new merchandise store with standard helping me design some stuff and then also have a special like gift that would go to patrons and members only and hopefully I can't I don't know I the spirit of what I'm doing I would like to send this gift out to everyone so even if you joined like however many years ago but that would most likely anyway I'm still figuring that out but will the thing that I'm changing is that I'm going to YouTube membership platform and people are joining through YouTube there are two ways that you currently can support the coding train one is through patreon and one is through YouTube membership YouTube membership doesn't have levels right now and patreon does and so I think I'm going to add those levels to YouTube's membership and then there are certain things that YouTube's membership allows me to do for example have YouTube member only live streams and you get little I mean emojis and because that's what people that sort of things so I'm conflicted I'm not choosing to shut down patreon yet but I might recommend if you want the full suite of benefits to join through you to youtube memberships anyway and I'm happy to answer questions about that or talk about that more at a later date so sarcasm as a service wrote joined up just in time to get my sign book I hope that doesn't mean you joined today you know here's the reason why I can't send the sign books I'll tell you why I can't figure out a way to do it that doesn't cost more than $50 to ship a book internationally it's also a tremendous amount of work and get behind and people who they get late they get lost in the mail so it just doesn't seem very sustainable and I don't even know if it's a thing that people want that much so I if you have ideas or thoughts about the various types of things that people are interested in and benefits I mean mostly I don't wanna spend too much time on this because mostly I'm here just doing this YouTube livestream thing it's nice to have this community of people who are part of the member program it's sort of like it there's many benefits to that beyond just like you know some funding for the channel that allows me to do various things and hire people to work on projects and like sort of keep myself motivated to be honest but that's not my my highest priority but I do want to make it something that is sustainable and meaningful for people who are joining but you're not gonna miss anything by not joining you will not miss anything all the content that I do will always just be on the channel or you know on github and that sort of thing there's no a premium content okay so and some people are asking about the member only live streams so the member only live streams are typically live streams where I'm testing out an idea or doing an offline recording session of something that I'm gonna publish as a recorded video so the only thing you might miss if you don't catch a member only live stream is a little bit of behind the scenes sort of chatter and flourish like really if I'm trying to figure out I'm Nathan I think I saw a message about helping me tune the audio settings like that I would do in a member only live stream well as much as you all might have enjoyed me for a half an hour trying to do a whole lot of audio testing okay discord server has been suggested I yeah yeah where's that discord I am very open to that I feel like I'm out of my element here as like an old fogey not that old of a foggy fogey nonetheless and I don't know right now the ways that the community communicates are git and github for all of the sort of code examples and suggesting topics sorry github is not get and github github is the website where I keep all the source code and there's the issues for topic suggestions a better system for topics you suggestions it's definitely needed and wanted but that's the system right now there's YouTube YouTube comments I used to read I still intend to read every single comment I'm like two months behind I kind of like popped in and out but I just like lost the ability to keep up with it but that's the place where there's community happening YouTube comments aren't my favorite place in the world you the people that I hear from seem to be wonderful people and I'm very lucky and privileged to have thoughtful comments and I think you know there's there's lots of reasons for that that are unfortunate that not everybody is so lucky to be able to and not be harassed online as but so that's one place so we've established github YouTube you know there's social media I'm not a huge I'm not super active on Twitter but that's where you'll find me the Instagram is run by psy we have a Facebook need to do some more with that so there's also that the member community where is really a place to like ask coding questions share cat pictures and just kind of like enjoy each other's company has been a slack channel but you know it's not sustainable for me to pay for slack because it's around five dollars per person and if someone's joined for five dollars like it doesn't even pay for itself so some people have suggested discord and maybe there's me I think there's an unofficial discord there's a reddit so that's me I'm really open to and maybe we can have some more discussion about that in what is currently the existing slack Channel okay I did spin up a whole Mastodon instance when I was on a Mastodon kick it was about a year ago but I let it as many things happen on the internet I just let it fall away that's that okay all right could you please do a video you have videos on map and reduce how about a video on ma nodes and transducers New York's video on the wavefunction alright so here's the thing what I would like oh I thought of another coding challenge I don't have room on the board anyway I might even just do it today I'm tired I gotta do some coding before I go so again this was my practice get back into the swing of things I have some other so I have some other things that I'm hoping to do some a new kind of video that I'm gonna try to do on the channel but I almost think too much about it before I do it pipe I shot a pilot and it was like a total mess so I'm gonna reshoot that pilot and see how that goes it's a video that I could kind of video that I can do when I'm not here at NYU that I can actually do from home so that's that's coming let's see if it's not alone be a livestream thing David Schneider asked is there a way to pledge more than five dollars a month with YouTube memberships I thought I was mentioning this and I think I lost my train of thought and didn't get there so David you really you can get my attention without doing a super chat but thank you very much so yes so YouTube memberships has multi tiered levels I just haven't put them in yet so I'm working with psy to do that and if in an ideal world those would be up as of next week so but that's that's that's the go I'm gonna have equivalent levels on YouTube and patreon and I would just remove the patreon but whenever I say I'm gonna do that I hear from above at your Villa sites please don't do that I just like using patreon as a platform so I see no reason not to keep it open but it's a platform that I'm less invested in paying attention to I mean there's a lot of downsides of doing everything on YouTube so I have mixed feelings about that but I think I'll get some benefits from the YouTube channel knowing who the members are but who knows welcome to I'm getting all these new members welcome to a new member bilal shot hello and thank you very much okay I believe people are joining when I've done absolutely nothing but talk for what is now an hour in 20 minutes geez Louise I need a little break I don't have any of my by the way I'm seeking seeking an animator with a special love for unicorns and rainbow like aesthetics who might like to work on some interstitial animations that I can play during live streams like about to start on a break and technical difficulties reach out I guess right now on Twitter if it send me a link to like your reel or portfolio or something I'm looking to hire somebody to do that kind of work okay that's not promising I wanted to see if this example worked as I was thinking of using it I was thinking of trying to do I since I you call a lien out of tune and the ukulele tuner I have doesn't have a battery I was thinking why did that not work I'm handed taping here let's see is there a pitch detection example here let's try the piano pitch detection let's close this there we go this was a coding challenge I was thinking of doing today can anyone tell me if I'm getting anything remotely accurate that I could actually use yeah I think I could do this if it works it works all right so that's one thing I could do before I go the other thing is here so I happen to listen to I don't know if I should admit this I mean I actually don't mind admitting this but I happen to listen to a podcast you know I had a wheel a spinning wheel quite a long time ago right you've seen me do this right where I will go and I go to this like I think it's like Schiffman github do slash randomizer I think is where it lives and I've done this and I'll take my list of coding challenge ideas like marching squares RDP more rows and like ASCII art right if I take that list and I put it here into this randomizer and I go to spin I get this nice wheel which I think I can grab and I can I thought I could spin it or I could press this button spin the wheel and then it picks one randomly and I have you kahlil's a little flat and I would then oh sorry let me do that again sorry I started looking at the chat so I used to do this and I would have a bunch of options and then it would pick one and I would then try to do that as the coding challenge and work fell off I wasn't sure what the pic I'd like put this away and today I was been listening to this podcast where the podcast has a wheel I've never seen it because I'm just listening to the podcast but they spin it I think there's a website actually where they have the wheel I think it's called it's called rob and a Kiva a podcast like that look it up maybe we can build them like some software tool for their wheel if they don't think they already have one but at the end of each podcast they spin the wheel for the topic for the next one and it occurred to me that that's the missing piece for me and they have like a wheel they have a wheel waiting room they have rejected ideas so I feel like what I did today was my little exercise of like things that could make it on to the wheel like this is a list of topics that if I spun the wheel and it landed on one I could be willing to commit to doing it the following week so in other words instead of like having this list and being surprised by the topic I would pick it in advance I'm not saying that I would I'm and so I would do somewhere in between like going and programming the whole thing like all week and then just coming in coding it live and no preparation whatsoever I think that no preparation whatsoever gets me into a little bit of trouble with some of these topics like for example Delauney triangulation no preparation whatsoever is totally fine for me for like ASCII art probably for the Mara Rose you can potentially break out some of these but some of these that require some research and thinking so I would do a little bit of research and thinking and reading and prepare not code but I prepare little materials and then I would come and do it as a coding challenge so what I proposed I was gonna do this I think I don't have time I was actually gonna do a coding job today which was like program a wheel spinner and then we as a community could like make it and I would have several different JSON files that would be and maybe I should do this actually that would be like the wheel topics the wheel waiting room and there could be certain things like we could get really crazy with this where there's like one thing on the wheel is like actually a separate pick something random out like it could be there could be like a game spot so maybe there's like a larger spot that just gains and then when it lands on games I would pick a you know pingpong ball out of a bucket that I don't know what the next metaphor is or the next visual like that I would pick you know breakout Tetris or pacman or whatever so and then and I don't know that I would do a wheel spin every single week because some coding challenges would require a full live stream some coding challenges can be done to 15 to 20 minutes hahaha and then other weeks I really want to be going through my con and machine learning content for my course so it's gonna be hard to balance all of this but that's kind of my plan right now and if I can get this other way that making videos off the ground I might actually mostly do the coding challenges through that mechanism which is a way of doing a little home studio that I'm sort of setting up it's currently there's no electricity in it little little T's are there for you so I think live streaming will be kind of an issue but you know I can record a video with the extent that my battery will last it sounds very ominous I know but you'll see you'll see coming soon all right so I don't know what people think about this is Dan who is sighs so sighs spelled CY and they are the community manager for the coding train working on social media and communication with the patrons and members and helping me set up this new merchandise store and also special rewards for patrons okay all right so ah thank you perfect timing the list to the contributions thank you David the chiming couldn't be more impeccable bit dot ly to an m4 KY q TMC writes spinning wheel is lazy I'm not sure I fully understand that I'm not sure if like you mean like I should do something more interesting than a wheel spin but no I actually would love to have a big physical wheel that's what I really want I'm not good at making physical things well this work did I type this in correctly awesome so um thank you I'm David Schneider a member coding trained member who prepared this so in the time people have been submitting contributions to the website and by the way coding trained community contributions there if you don't know what I'm talking about or how to do that you can find this video which is only 12 minutes long which is shocking for me which is describes how to go through the process of submitting your contribution to the coding training website oh I know what I'm going to use the wheel for right now this is perfect oh this is great okay hold on I've got a plan 630 this is not a plan that can be accomplished in 30 minutes but this is what I'm thinking I'm going to do a coding challenge which is make a spinning wheel yeah yeah I know it could be like a bingo machine I'll get to that and then I'll spin the wheel to pick a number and show some community contributions and then I'll try to make a ukulele tuner and yes I'll go set the point of the ukulele tuner would be to have a visual a visual to show you that you know this is a note I want it to be this is how far off I am okay okay so how do I want to do this I have this already as the thing I could also just use random org to pick a random number say the wheelspin is a little bit crazy because there's 78 so a so a bingo machine would be better the wheel needs to make a spinning wheel noise definitely definitely does how did how to approach this right now I need to think I'm not gonna read them okay it's just gonna fix up treating them to myself is it weird that I'm not reading them out loud now I'm not even thinking cuz I'm thinking about how it's weird they're not reading them out loud I did the Plinko machine before which kind of works for this I like the idea of a bucket full of compart five for your blinker challenge with numbers yeah Simon and I think alike prize wheel an Amazon fairly cheap bingo machines too but they're more spending money is no object for me if I could get myself a bingo machine whatsoever I will spend all of my patreon money on a bingo machine for sure that is not a not even a question you have to read them out loud okay good point all right what if I did one of those um prices right things right now well welcome to member Luke Finch where you like to pull down the big thing and it like spins around I could do that probably in processing see this is why I need a plan I can't just come here and expect to come up with the idea in my mind spin the wheel bingo spin wheel pling pling Co Co dice rolling oh that's an interesting idea dice rolling that sounds like a very elaborate physics simulation though that's not within my realm of possibility right now can I just gonna do the ukulele tuner let's do the ukulele tuner let's let's do the ukulele tuner so by the way all of you who are joining actually a very curious question when you join as a Youtube member in theory are supposed to be taken to a screen that has a little like welcome message with a link to a Google for did that happen if not please email CY at the coding train calm okay don't think you have time to make something tonight I know I could do a spinning wheel I feel like that's like a quick thing it's like everybody always wonders how our quirks nice beginnerfriendly coding challenge we're gonna make a spinning wheel an ad so what I can put I could divide it into 78 little slices right or I could pick random numbers another way it's sorry K week actually I believe it's not coding train com I don't think I have coding train comm coding train comm is listed for sale so I would totally spend $1,000 on a bingo machine but I'm not spending it on a domain name that's just ridiculous give me a break duh the dye is very important it makes it sound important I am the coding train I'm not coding drink I am the coding train what are people in the hallway can just hear me you just hear me in the hallway probably it's gonna say choo choo in the chat you know that I'm gonna do it okay um all right it was pretty fluffy okay once for tens and ones for you the wheel snowflake emoji I'm trying understand what that means I'm definitely a snowflake if you pre chose the value reverse simulated the wheel Luke your math is missing an important piece of there's a certain percentage which is mine I'm listening from the hallway John Walthall your name has a hall in it that's believable but I'm gonna need a little proof but need you to knock on the door if you're in the hallway but I need you to knock on the door okay this sitting around trying to decide is no good we're gonna make a ukulele tuner and see how that goes no no crap is it look at my password manager I can't remember how come I'm not logged in anymore oh wait it was like trying to dashlane me in right oh but I don't know what that is okay what am I looking for yes my password manager really hmm all right I guess I forgot my password uh I can only assume this is the email I used does it send it see how unprepared I am now I'm gonna look at my email this is ridiculous okay I got an email reset my password oh I remember what I made it now because I didn't actually like do it with my password manager and this should be good enough okay I am going to do a coding challenge how's the focus am I out of focus is this okay what do I have I have the noise thing on I'm gonna turn that off because if this gets edited into a coding challenge it's off okay then then we can always no run like a noise suppression thing after the fact okay I'm also gonna need I remember like when I first by the way this is the second attempt at this long time ago and it totally didn't work at all but there was like a frequency to piano note like Wiki Wikipedia page I think I looked at piano key frequencies which I'm going to need and there's like a formula for it but I can also just look up the actual frequency here great so this is what I'm looking for the ukulele would be which the ukulele is ukelele notes are no I want the notes for the strings it's gonna give me a nice yeah AEC G and this is gonna probably be like a four is that right someone's got to know this where's that 440 that's what I'm guessing uh okay all right focus is good okay thanks everybody by the way just another little plug coating garden with CJ has had a ton of content I did I get notifications on fication boyfriend using something called like feather J s I've never even heard of that go check out the coding garden with CJ I've been not live streaming forever and but there's so much happening on the Internet okay just try to think of what's a good opening for this coding challenge hello and welcome to a coding train coding challenge this is my first kind of challenge in this new coding trade studio oh my goodness but my ukulele is very out of tune and I actually have a ukulele tuner but the battery's dead so I thought here we are let's see if we can make a ukulele tuner in the browser using p5 GS and ml 5 j s voice just got lost right so Oh editing is a wonderful thing to do this I'm going to use ml 5gs library which is a machine learning library that I've used in tutorials and various other coding challenges it's built on top of tensorflow GIS and it is friendly it is I would start the whole thing over this is just like the old days I get to do this as many times as I want see this is a paintbrush which was used to paint this wall behind me hello and welcome to a coda challenge oh that is terribly out of tune this coding challenge is making a ukulele tuner and it is the first coding challenge that I'm doing here in this new coding train studio I like it better the first time to 12th root of 2 to the power of the number of halfsteps yes yes I can barely play a guitar all right here we go last time no more breaks no more stops this is ridiculous that I do this I have to not do this anymore this is my new year's the new studio resolution is no second takes editing is fine editing is fine just no second takes hi oh hello that was loud hello and welcome to a coding challenge from the coding train it sounds better than the other room I'm glad to hear that there's no echo in here and I actually have carpeting that I'm planning to put down which isn't put down yet but once it is it will be okay I'm back with a coding challenge oh and my ukulele is very out of tune I'm in a new studio the tuning of the ukulele did not last in the move to the new studio and the battery and my Glalie tuner is dead you don't need to know all this information so I thought what's a better opportunity than to do at coding Johnson I've been wanting to do for a while which is make a ukulele tuner that would work in the browser and so to do that I am going to use some JavaScript libraries that I use in a lot of different videos one is ml5 j s ml five is a machine learning library built on top of tensorflow JS it has a lot of pre trained models in it one of which is a pitch detection model I think I could use that to to the ukulele I hope we'll see how well it works and then I'm also going to use p5.js and this is the p5 GS web editor I'm gonna try programming the whole thing right here in the browser and see what happens so what do I need to do so I guess the first thing that I should do is import the ml 5 library so I'm gonna go to getting started oh look at this actually the easiest way for me to do this is just click on this link which makes a p5 web better sketch with the ml 5 just library added so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna go back over here and I'm gonna click over here and then over here and I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna run it and make sure it's happening there it is so ml 5 has now been loaded we can see the version is zero point three point zero since there are zero point three point one I think there's a slightly newer release let's check that out who knows you're probably watching this when sometime in the future where we don't keep track of open source software by numbers anymore this is release rainbow but yes my suspicion was right there's actually a version zero point three point one so let me go and update that by changing it here hiding the point one this is very important that this is in this coding challenge you must learn to update your amplify version when you are making a ukulele tuner and then I'm gonna I don't need this console log anymore although I guess I could try it one more time just to sort of see there we go and for a minute just because I'm kind of standing in front of stuff and I don't have it set up I'm planning to record everything with these separate green and separate background but I'm not ready to do that just yet so I'm just going to do a screen recording so I have that just in case at some point match up if Ed 'its is together needs to take me out of this so I'm now recording the screen okay thanks Marcos all right all right where was I so now that I have my p5 sketch here I can go back to the ml 5 website I'm gonna go to reference and here we can see one of the things about ml 5 is all of the different functions that are in ml 5 are separated by media category there's this other category called helpers and boy do I have some videos coming up about that for you someday soon I'm gonna go to sound and I'm gonna look at this pitch detection one so here's the documentation time out hold on a second what just curious when I there's a little there's a mistake here I just realized I think everyone I had the pitch detection one going oh I have to upload the model that's crazy so that's a mistake the model isn't hosted all right let's see here I didn't realize this was gonna be a little extra layer of complexity I need to figure this out before I go any further here it is here it is okay great so let me just I don't know how big this is so let me just download the oh you can't see I'm really not standing in the right place the camera I need to do something about the where everything is this should actually I think I should be putting the sounds on the other side of me but it's not really easy for me to do that right now I'll leave that here I'm downloading this huge thing this is ridiculous it's at 38% so I can plug this right now see I'm just so out of practice here there we go this is what I wanted to do the stream deck can be over here oh you know I'm such an idiot I could just move the desk over and like there's no room to the right of the computer for anything yeah how about moving the desk dumdum okay hold on everybody now I have my sound effects and my stream deck and I'm standing over here and I'm more to the side I'm bigger than I used to be people told me when I was doing a test that I was too small but now I think I'm too big okay okay okay to this download okay sorry everyone I think I am back to what I was doing it's very confusing the camera is like a little bit there we go ah I think this works for me now I'm like I just have to angle myself a little bit okay but it's the desk now and the whiteboard camera shot good question no it is not the whiteboard camera shot does not start until right about here which if I go back is you know pretty far off okay should I just start the whole thing over I should definitely start the whole thing over right yes right exactly that's what I think I'm so glad we agree on this okay here we go yeah I really would like to have a roaming camera in this room because then I could then I could I could like show you the stuff in the room but another time okay I think it was better to have this up non FFT pitch finder revisit yeah there's there's many other ways to do pitch detection but whatever I'm gonna do it this way oh my you clearly is very out of tune what luck this happens to be the make a ukulele tuner coding challenge what a coincidence I'm here in my new studio located it's not my studio but it is a studio it's in Brooklyn at New York University and I'm doing my first coding challenge from here um I I don't really know what makes sense that I just like if this is a moment to do some sort of particular coding challenge I don't know I'm just gonna do go to the ukulele because the tuner I have the batteries broken my ears not so good so we'll see if this works I'm gonna use the ML v JS library this is a JavaScript library that I'm lucky enough to participate in its development and I try to make tutorials with so this works well it has a pre trained model for pitch detection which I'll talk about in a moment and then I'm also going to use the p5 web editors a little tricky to do this in the p5 web editor because it could involve I'm going to upload a bunch of stuff but the good news is I already have the ml 5 library right here all you need to do if you want if you're in the p5 web editor at editor dot p5.js dot org if you go to the ml 5 website under getting started you'll see that all you need to do is either add this script tag or even better you can see that here where is that where is it where is it where is it there it is sorry should just started with this all you need to do is click on this link which will open a web app a sketch in the p5 web editor with the ml 5 library already important ok so we're there I could make sure this is working by saying something like you know console.log ml v dot version I'm going to hit run and I see the version down here so I've got ml 5 going now what do I need to do next so if I go to the ml 5 website I'm going to go to a reference and in reference I can see that the various functionality of ml 5 is divided into different categories based on media and what I definitely want to do is look at sound here I want to find a sound model and lo lo and behold there is a model called pitch detection now I should mention that there are ways of analyzing a sound for pitch but you don't need machine learning for I'm you can do FFT analysis and look at the different various amplitudes of different frequencies and pick the one that's left there's a variety of ways in people much smarter who know much more about sound could tell you how to do that and I'm sure you can find other tutorials but I'm here I want to try to use the ml 5 library but this really begs the question like well how is this working you said something about pre trained model so ml 5 is comes with a certain model known as crepe I don't know if that's how you pronounce that I like to say clip which is a convolutional representation for a pitch estimation or clip I like fruit little banana maybe a little Nutella it's kind of good I don't know it's too much for me then to tell us this is about pitch detection and so you can read a lot more about this particular model and what data was used to train it which is always a question you should ask when you're using someone's pre trained model because there's a lot of things that go wrong or right or be problematic potentially about a model based on the data it was trained and this paper describes that in more detail you can even run this demo in the browser I'll do it right now let me not allowed I don't know why it's not allowing my microphone oh here we go let me tweak yeah yeah I'm gonna always allow and I'm gonna hit refresh I'm gonna click here to start the demo I cannot do anything well this this is really a fail all right let's skip that let's not you oldest about a big magic yo I'm not starting over again you could click on this link over here to see a demo of it in the browser but we're gonna do this in ml 5 and thank you a big THANK YOU to Hannah Davis who actually did the porting of this model into ml 5 and I'll include some links to her work in this video's description ok so here I am on the ml 5 documentation page and it looks a little bit like yeah what's going on here so I need to create a pitch object and there's some sort of like string dot slash model what's that audio context mic stream model loaded slot stuff I need to figure out here well the first thing I want to figure out is all right well I see I should now I'm looking over here and I see the chat and real cygnus is asking what's just asking not criticizing didn't he use this little while ago and it didn't go over well yes and have I done how am i taking the time to check to see if it would go well this time no but here we go I think it's gonna work because the bugs that I found last time got fixed we'll see the first thing I want to tackle here is what this dot model is so a lot of times when using ml 5 it's going to load the model files from a URL and you might actually put the URL into your code or ml 5 might just know the URL automatically it's saved on a Google server or some other server and ml 5 it's saved on github and like pointed to by ml 5 in this case this is a case where I actually need to have the model files with my code this was probably gonna change just by making this video i browse we probably should host a version of the creped model that you could access through ml 5 more easily but luckily if I go to the ml 5 data and models github repo where I am right here github.com / ml 5 j s I can navigate to models pitch detection CREP and these are all the model files so this is very typical of any pretrained machine learning model they'll be a JSON file the is essentially the file that describes the model oh this is the neural network architecture these are all the pieces of it I could actually even click in this and start to like look at it you can see it's the model topology what it's using various things like that we you know investigate this more on your own and then there's all these other files which are the actual weights the numbers the sort of secret sauce of the model after it's been trained all of those little parameters of the neural network are all stored in all these files now I've actually downloaded all of these already and you can see them they're right here in a folder on the desktop here so what I want to do right now is add all of them to the p5 web editor let's see how that goes normal I've really only worked with like uploading like little media files and sound files but I think this is gonna work so I'm gonna go here I'm gonna create a new chart for you to see this but I'm gonna create a new folder and I'm gonna call this crops up and then I'm gonna do add file and I'm hoping that I could just select all of these and drag them here oh oh whoa I'm not plugged in anymore you can't upload files of this type that is definitely a problem so how did that other oh I have a feeling that the way this was uploaded was like through a secret backdoor to the web editor will that work no no don't I have a better idea no better idea better idea so the fact that they're here sorry here means that I can turn this into a J s deliver right because J s deliver and github work together no this is not where I want to look don't you love how everything always goes wrong there's a way to turn any github repo into a CDN like this so I should be able to do j s liver github ml v j s repo ml5 data and models and then just the path so if I do pitch detection crepe model JSON to see pitch detection crepe model JSON yes whatever reason the lighting in here of share life is pointing out my gray hair the old lighting used to really like obscure the gray of my hair I don't know why but it's looked much more visible in here you know it's it's distinguished package size exceeded the configurate limit of 50 megabytes try what but the model dot JSON file isn't 50 megabytes is it it's 16 kilobytes these are tiny files doesn't make any sense oh the whole I forgot models okay thank you Thank You Simon models I think right here right yeah boom all right now let's see just curious I'm gonna grab the example I'm sure this is once again I could just do this like locally and then oh are you serious says it loaded the model trouble believing it no it didn't load I got an error hold on yeah 403 what's in error 403 I mean it's not gonna work it doesn't host it like this does it huh did that actually work oh wow that works oh great so I could just use the URL to it Oh silly me I'm going to back up here okay okay okay I think this is couple have no viewers left thank you for sticking with me in this we're gonna get there okay where am i where am i where am i it's here so if I go back to add file I'm just gonna do this again to like cuz this is where I left off so I forgot that the web editor currently only supports certain file types like JSON or CSV or a JPEG image files sound files so these model files that include all the weights that can't be uploaded to the web editor that's something that might change in the future but luckily I can actually I can actually just point to the model files that are on github itself so this particular URL right here where all these model files are stored there's actually a way to turn any file that's sitting on github into a URL that you can load like from from a content delivery network and so a way of doing if this is a nice blog post that I found on go make things calm that just shows this base URL so I can always access files through this URL cdnas deliver net /gh for github and then the path to the username the repo and the path to the files so I actually have done that right here I'm gonna hit refresh and you can see look this is that model dot JSON file and now I can actually look and see oh it's all of the configuration information about this particular model and I can grab this and I can put this into my code so let me close this I'm gonna go to the top I'm gonna say Const model URL equals and I'm gonna paste that in there so now and then I actually want just the path because I want the model to load all the files so I'm going to then remove model JSON and this is the path to the CREP model and I can go ahead and just delete this from here this folder it's gone I guess I need to also delete the files one at a time let me do that and now I am ready to start putting in some code so I'm going to make a variable called pitch detector let's just call it pitch I'm gonna say pitch equals ml five pitch detection let me give myself some more space pitch detection I'm going to go back to the reference page and these are the things that I need to load so let me copy paste these are the parameters that I need to pass in name is here Oh I'm sitting here wondering why I have an error and of course if I declare a variable as a contest I can't just have it not equal anything and then assign it later so this is gonna have to be let and I'm gonna make a lot of people angry right now by making everything let just to sort of like simplify things and now I have the I've now created a pitch detection object now what I want is to give it a bunch of arguments to create itself one of which is the model itself so this is no longer a local directory of files I'm going to say model URL I need to get this audio context in Mike's stream let me come back to that but I also need a model loaded function so that I know that the model has been loaded I can't type there we go all right so audio context and Mike stream what are those things well let's hope the documentation tells us audio context the browser audio context to use hmm stream media stream the media stream to use I'm a little bit lost to be honest but can I get some more information you know what I think we might do here is let's just look at the example so the example here if I look at the example code it's showing that ah perfect so an audio context I could just get by saying get audio context perfect so this happens to be something that's built into JavaScript it's part of the Web Audio API I would assume and I'm sure somebody in the chatter or somebody will leave a comment to explain what this is a little bit more but I'm just gonna go ahead and put it in here I'm gonna say audio context equals get audio context and then for the mic stream this is actually me connecting to the builtin microphone or potentially I could specify a different microphone and that I'm going to connect by using the p5 sound library so I can make a variable called mic and then I could say mic equals p5 audioin I believe is the function so this is the function this is part of p5 sound KS which incidentally is a library that I have accessing here in index.html look at this I am on such an old version of p5 let's update this stuff I think the current version is 9.0 so while I'm here I'm gonna update that go back to here and then I think I can get this mic stream from the p5 mic object I'll just look it up here Mike dot stream perfect so this p5 audio and I need to say Mike dot start start pitch Mars I don't see any function Oh aah Oh interesting look at this so I wasn't paying close attention I didn't really I didn't really think what I'm doing because it's I got to do two things here I need to load them I need to access the microphone and I need to load the model when I load the model I want to connect it to the microphone and maybe I need to think about the sequence going on here because as you know if you've done programming or watched a kodi train video before things in JavaScript have an asynchronously so maybe I don't need to do it this way that's in the example but I probably do let's try to do it not the way that's in the example and see if it works it's probably gonna break without being thoughtful about the order so I'm just gonna say Mike dot stream right now then I'm gonna say Mike dot start and I'm gonna have a callback like listening and then I'll write a function called listening and I'll say console.log listen I'm gonna take off this auto refresh because it's doing crazy stuff listening okay here we go so let me uncaught syntax error invalid or unexpected token line 20 what I don't see any invalid token lying Ted listening can I read property start of undefined there we go so this is an issue cannot read property start of undefined why is the mic undefined let's go back to the example new new I forgot to say new so the new keyword is very important when you are calling a constructor to create an object you're required to say new there's something really interesting that's going on here which is that I need the new here new p5 audio in but how come I'm not saying new ml5 pitch detection Oh do you know why it's because people like to do things in different ways this is actually a little bit more standard from what I understand in the world of JavaScript this is not actually calling an object constructor a little clue to that is the lowercase P right there this is calling a function that's part of the ml 5 library the function itself calls an object constructor but you actually don't bend and the new happens in there but our interface to it as the user of the library we just called a pitch detection function that's why I have sometimes I say these are the list of functions in p5 instead of like the LEAs or the list of objects or classes but this is actually calling the p5 audioin constructor all right let's see if that fixed things all right listening model loaded that's promising so it was happy it seems to be happy with the order that I'm doing things in now right the order of the example is to make sure the mic has started and then load the model but this doesn't seem so upset maybe it's going to work okay and it's in pausing for a second to think about what I'm doing next okay so what's the next step well what I want to do just from just to get this working is that the pitch is going to come in as a real number a frequency value so I just want to draw that frequency value in the canvas so how do I get it presumably there's some callback there's a callback model loaded but I need to actually tell it to listen so let's go back to the I could look at the example but let's look at the documentation pitch get pitch and here's a callback so this is what I want to do this is like the function that I call to ask for a pitch and then when it hears something it console logs it so I should be able to do this in the model loaded function I'm gonna say pitch get pitch and then I'm gonna write a function called got pitch because I'm trying to do this in a very longwinded highly descriptive way where I now have a separate function called got pitch and then it receives an argument like frequency and I'm going to actually draw that well no let's just console.log it console.log frequency okay let's run this bottle loaded because I make some eyes all right here we go la pitch frequency it is not working at all well I got an error could not fail to XD all right this is not working because it failed to execute create media stream source on the audio context parameter one is not of type media stream I have a feeling that this is the problem right I did things out of the order now is the problem assuming the order is the problem so I need to make sure the microphone is ready before I start trying to load them on so in this sense let's try to re let's try to redo this order so Mike audio in Mic start listening once I am listening then I will load the model then once the model is loaded I will call get pitch got pitch if I look at the documentation get pitch oh oh oh wahwahwah I forgot something else really important I can never remember this I don't know why ml 5 functions callbacks are all written with this style known as error first callbacks so you must include two arguments the first one is the error this enforces you to think about error handling which is the thing I don't really think about but at least a low five is trying to get me to do it and I should try to be I should be an error checking kind of person so this should have error frequency and I could do a little error handling like I could say if if error console dot error error otherwise console dot log the frequency and I'm now actually realizing that there's a slight inconsistency in the way that the pitch detection model works in ml five one of the things that is all of the other features of ml five do is they return an object so maybe it gives you an object that has the value you're looking for a confidence score so probably the raw frequency shouldn't be in there it should be an object maybe it actually already is and I'm wrong about that let's try running this one more time oh no I like that I'm seeing something nah do we have an error the terror that the debtor let that all right so what's going on here frequency is no and only did it once do I have to continue to call get the pitch it doesn't do it continuously I think that might be it let's look at the example so this is promising and that something came out did the air come out know if it was an error that came out it would have been read because console dot error will print something to the console that's read so frequency came out but frequency came out as null that's fine it detected no frequency I wasn't making a sound and it's not checking anymore the reason why it's not checking anymore is it doesn't know to keep checking I have to explicitly ask it to keep checking so I say give me the pitch and then once it's got the pitch it logs it and then I say give me that pitch again so this is a little bit of like a way of kind of calling this recursively this is the kind of recursion cuz it's not exactly it's a loop really so let me let me run this there we go so when it detects a frequency it console logs it and let's see higher frequency frequency so now I don't want to just see this in the console anymore I want to create a variable I'm gonna call it freak and I'm gonna I'm gonna set it to zero just so it has some value to start with and then here I'm going to say whenever I get a frequency sorry what's that got pitched oh right here I'm gonna say if I don't want to give it a sign it null so I'm gonna say if frequency freak equals frequency I might want to account for null in a better way and then now in the draw function which is quite unnecessary but I'm gonna do this anyway I am going to now say whoops give me some space under here I'm now going to say textaligncenter text 3 quick C I'm gonna put width / 2 height divided by 2 and let's say let's do text align Center center so it centers in both horizontally and vertically I'm gonna say a fill to 55 and texassized like 64 and then I'm gonna say frequency to fixed too so I want to see two decimal places and now let's run this okay hey let's grab the ukulele so the ukulele notes are a ECG is that right AEC G so this should be an a this should be 440 if I'm right so there's a there's math that you can do this with but I can also just look it up here yeah right there look at that even it's even highlighted I guess it's highlighted cuz it's like a four so this is the frequency I want so let's just say I just wanted to I'm gonna just tune the a string then maybe I'll like do the rest but kind of like speed up the video or something for you so I'm gonna tune the a string people in the chat are pointing out that I could also just use a tone generator that's probably a smart idea let me do that right now just to see that it works so hold on a second let me find that URL I wonder if it's not able to pick that up Oh 440 yes about rapid mouths yeah so I think it's I know the mic is not picking up from the speaker and I wonder why that is it's getting it now why was it not getting it at 440 sorry if this is driving everybody's ears nuts oh you can't hear this that well I'm not piping the audio out let's go over here it's pretty good not perfect all right let me let me watch your ears everybody lower your volume I'm gonna send the pitch out through the multi output device so lower your lower hear volume for a second here comes is that manageable for you to listen to I know you can hear it but now I'm actually sending it out oh no I'm not yeah yeah I'm sending it out through the laptop audio itself is that bad or good there we go perfect where did that ad was that bad I see I see one comment Oh God so I could turn it way down so I'm gonna turn it way down it was it just fine before so I'm turning this way down now and I'm gonna try it again Oh barely register at all should I just have done it with just picking it up for my mic is that better what's 730 it was fine before so I'm overthinking this so guess what everybody I'm not gonna send it out I'm just gonna send it out through the speakers and let my mic get it and you know what we could always was better with just the mic okay great so never mind okay so now it should now let me just make sure yeah okay all right I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it just with the mic okay all right so thank you to Alka in the chat who suggested this online tone generator I'll include a link to that also in the video's description I'm just going to play it and as I do this slider we can see the pitch is pretty much the pitch detection is matching I mean I'm talking which is messing it up is matching the tone that is generating now you'll notice it's not perfect right this is a machine learning model that's been trained on some data set of sounds and then it's making a guess a prediction of what it thinks it is this is not a 100% accurate analysis that you could probably do mathematically especially with a pure tone but this is an approximation that would hopefully work with a variety of different kinds of sounds that might be harder to analyze and pull out that exact pitch also no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to sound I'm just trying to get this to work all right so now what I want to do is I want to make some kind of like visual indicator so I think what would be useful here is for me to draw maybe I should draw some type of rectangle that is big when I'm Way off or smaller or maybe it's when I'm above the pitch I'm drawing it to the right when I'm below I'm drawing it to left some type of and I'm sure you hopefully will make a version of this which are much nicer more thoughtful interface but to do this I think all I would need to do is say let's difference equal I want this frequency what that frequency is minus 440 so right now I'm just tuning for a I'm just tuning the a string so then I want to draw let's do rect mode actually let's not do rec mode center let's draw a rectangle I'm going to make it white for right now I'm going to say its position is what's the size of the canvas 200 200 4 and 400 so I'm going to say it's a 200 comma 50 let's move the text way down and then so I'm gonna move this like down here and then I'm going to make the width of it difference I'm just going to multiply it by 10 just to scale it and have the height be 50 so let me just try this for a second and let me play the tone oh whoops so this is actually where the nice thing is if I give it a negative width it seems to draw it as a negative it draws the rectangle in the opposite direction I don't actually have to flip it so the question is I think times 10 is actually quite a bit so let's actually not multiply it by anything let's think about what are these differences like it's 500 that makes sense a 60 60 pixels is pretty reasonable so let's get the ukulele now or actually let's let me still use the tone so let me make it let me set it to a four let me play it so I'm not seeing any rectangle there's a little rectangle there we go I mean talking messes it up because it gets a different pitch of my voice but I could also do something right now it could be a little bit more thoughtful about this and I could map I could say let amount equals map the difference between if it's between like a hundred it's off by like a hundred and a hundred to a value between zero and one and the reason why I'm doing this is I could use the function lerp color so let me say I have the color red which is to 5500 and I have the color green which is 0 255 0 and what I want to do is when it's all the way I want to get the actual I want I want to have the actual color the lerp color solar color gives me a linear interpolation between two colors like red and green oh this is actually not what I want to do I want it to be green when it's in the center so actually I want to map the absolute value of the difference I want to map the absolute value of the difference and those are this is much easier now between zero and a hundred and I want to then when it's zero it's perfectly green when it's a hundred it's red and I don't know if this is going to actually look right and but let's do let's try it so we can see here now if I try to tune the good ukulele let's make this an a4 again that kind of works now the gig 100 is way too small says Simon I should through the chat it makes me want to cry alright let's um let's let's um let's make this a little bit fancier all right I need a bubble shift the bubble to the center yeah so this interface is terrible and there are definitely better ways I can do this a dial would actually make a lot more sense I mean I should use a dial like rotating a dial from left to right a slider shifting the bubble yeah when exact Green is zero with ya you don't even see it yeah so alright so this interface as many people that are pointing out its pretty terrible I don't know what I was thinking I know much better interface would be like a dial I encourage you to try to make that um let me at least do like something that moves back and forth so what I want to actually do is always draw this rectangle for example I don't want the size of the rectangle to have anything to do with the difference so for example I can change this to like rect mode Center and then I can draw this rectangle like 200 pixels wide so now there's always a rectangle there and then what would make more sense for me to do is to draw a circle that appears in the rectangle like 200 but at an exposition so let me just put one in the middle that's like 50 like a circle that's size 50 so that's sitting there in the middle and now I can have this circle move back and forth the exposition can be like plus the difference so for example so the difference I guess divided by some amount for right now and again I want to be much more thoughtful about how I'm doing this but I guess I'll use the I'll use the tone generator so this value 100 is a way off let's try making this like 400 oh what am i what's going on here oh it's to hold on yeah I want to make it smaller yeah it will stop here people are sending me images in the chat of tuners yes I've seen those a dial with an arrow would be good if you send me pictures in the chat it's like I have everything font everything built up so big I can't see anything anymore I can barely see the picture so generally speaking it's not super helpful the circle should change color when it's bang on the lerp color is really weird I agree I thought the lerp color would be such a good idea it's not log scale would be better I pick there's a lot of better ideas I'm trying to think of what's a simple yeah let's not use lerp color I think the lerp color was an interesting idea and you know really just having like dials that like fill in or low there's just so many nicer ways of doing this people are sending me pictures of like tuners and how they work should then CJ is writing the chat should the max value in the map be related to the width of the rectangle yeah that would make sense right so if I if the width of the rectangle is but I'm dividing difference by ten so like a way to do this a little bit more with a little bit more care would be to take this divide it by ten there have this be the like half the width of the rectangle I think which the width oregano is 200 to make this 100 and then just have that also be the offset so if I do that but the alert color is just really weird and doesn't make any sense it's really like not a good interface this lobe color thing at all so I think what I'm going to do is actually just make a much simpler interface where I am going to have this circle move back and forth I'm not actually going to change the color of the rectangle I'm going to kind of do it the opposite way I'm going to comment this out have the rectangle be white I'm going to make the circle red and then I'm gonna say if the difference is less than 2 Phil 0 255 0 and let's make it less than 1 let's try to really tune this thing and I'm going to also draw it I'm gonna scale the drawing by 10 ok all right so now and let's draw a line this is terrible I'm so bad at interfaces I shouldn't be allowed to do any of this I'm gonna draw a line at 200 sorry at 0 at 200 comma 0 to 200 comma 200 and let's let's draw that line here and say let's have the rectangle be have some alpha to it let's say stroke one hundred and Stroke wait for and then I'll get rid of the stroke here and all right so now why is it green Oh cuz it hasn't gotten a frequency yet I got to give it a frequency I'm tuning it getting tuning it getting closer oh no no it can't be less gotta be absolute value gotta be absolute value and we're gonna map I got a great idea now now we're going to map so we can do things like this now do I need logarithmic scale why isn't why is the alpha of this rectangle not changing yeah I thought if the difference is a hundred the Alpha is zero we're losing my mind what oh no I didn't rerun the sketch oh oh yeah I didn't I have an I have a crazy idea I gotta stop doing this okay so why is there Oh cuz that's I keep thinking that I'm hitting this button is rerunning this sketch there we go okay so right now and this should really be I feel like this shouldn't be an ellipse it should be a rectangle I should really turn on the auto refresh now cuz that'll it should be a rectangle that is that is at this location and then it is like five pixels wide and six fifty pixels high and it should be ten pixels wide and 75 pixels high and this should be stroke weight one there we go okay here's my interface I worked very hard on this I am now going to play a tone and I'm going to try to tune it and then when you get there and I'm gonna let myself be within three frequency values I'm going to say also this Auto refresh was a terrible idea Phil 0255 zero okay ready that's tunas ukelele five is way too much let's have the threshold be one there's my ukulele tuner you can see that is not the right note so so many things need to be thought first of all if that does not sound right this is gonna be a much better way of tuning it better than I thought all right now really quickly what I want to do is actually allow myself in this one sketch to tune all four of the strings and I really should be stop this video right now and not go any further but I would like to do this there's so much that needs to be and you will do that you will also make a version of this with an interface that looks like an actual thoughtful tuner is this playing the whole song or no it's just like us these so let's let's make an array of the notes so I'm gonna make an array so I'm gonna say notes equals and I'm going to create a bunch of objects for objects and each object is going to have the note and the frequency and the note for example is a and the frequency is 440 so I don't know why I did all that work when I just want to do this so there are four strings on the ukulele there's a e C and G so let's look up those frequencies the e is e it should be a efore which is this 329 623 C is I think it is going to be is it middle C I'm pretty sure it is 261 six two five six and then the G is actually G 4 I believe I don't know if they're 100% right about this so now the thing that I want to do is I want to find out what am i tuning against so first of all this is this is horrific I cannot bear this code that I have written so let's at least make this a little bit better let's make a variable called threshold and again I should do like a mapping or whatever let's make that threshold one and I will at least put that there so we know and again it's ridiculous that I have these if statement in two places but that'll be fine but the first thing that I need to do is actually figure out which note am I trying to compare it to and I want to automatically do that so I don't know actually which string I'm playing less I did some kind of like crazy computer vision thing but I'm just going to like find the note that it's closest to and tune against that so what I want to do here is I'm going to loop through all of the notes and I'm going to find the closest note is an index like zero and so and then I'm just gonna say negative one right now and then the record the record difference is I'm going to start with infinity and then I'm gonna say the it I'm gonna say the difference is notes index i dot frequency the actual frequency minus that if and I'm sure I could use reduce or some kind of fancy higher order array function but let me just do it this way if the difference is less than the record difference then the closest note is I and then once I've done that I have the closest note so now and let me just keep that difference oh I have it in record disc difference so difference equals record difference and it's not less than its absolute value sorry gotta have that absolute value in there always gotta have that absolute value in there and then the the actual note itself can I use this variable name is the notes index closest note I mean I could have just I don't have to save the index I could have saved the object but yeah let me save the object notes index I know it's index I don't need to save the index and that's closest note and then what I'm doing is I'm showing the value and then I want to draw instead of where I'm drawing this value right here I actually want to just put the note on the screen as well which would be where do I do that where do I actually draw that difference oh the text is up here so I'm going to make this much smaller and then I'm also going to write here say I'm going to say text size 64 I'm going to say closest note note and this I'm gonna place like 150 pixels up and this 50 pixels up let's see what that does great so now I should be able to tune all of the strings so it should detect here so why is it not giving me any information we're gonna have to debug this first of all okay let me look at this so let me console.log oh let me just make this no console.log oh you know what I didn't do I'm missing like a super obvious thing I forgot to set the record difference equal to that difference well duh okay here we go so my a is pretty okay what I'm at a console log record difference and closest note for worst let's put the absolute value here and then I won't make this mistake if the difference right I need this this has to be the absolute value as well that's a roughly a problem all right here we go everybody I think this is good now I really need some finer grain this is really I need the negative difference oh I need it here okay everybody everything's gonna be fine so when I'm getting the record I want the smallest one but then when I use it down here you know if it's negative or not is kind of important right no I'm using the absolute value everywhere oh except for drawing where it is all right how about this how about that huh huh how about that if the absolute value of the difference is less than the absolute value the record difference then the record ref is different but I see the negative for use down here I would like to be able to see more movement so where is this divided by ten give me a break divide yourself by two people whoops wrong string it's not really into what did I do wrong by G is wrong this is the wrong G I'm trying there any last things I could do to improve this I could do slurp using lerp never hurts no sound fro there's no sound from the soundboard oh you weren't hearing that Oh cuz I turn it all the way down well alright is this good can I be done save sketch okay this has been my first coding challenge in the new coding terrain studio over here at New York University in Brooklyn I made a ukulele tuner it has the worstever interface for ukulele tuner but I do think there are some nuggets in here it's nice to see how that pitch detection model works I would love it if you made your own version of this you could go to the coding train com find the page for this coding challenge look at the instructions to submit your own actually a video tutorial for how to do that if you make your own ukulele tuner and you put it on the web I will tune this ukulele with it in my next live stream so thank you very much for watching and I will see you in a future coding challenge goodbye I don't like the tiny needle moment movement personally I don't like it at all either it's awful we'll see if matsya can work some kind of magic to edit this let me check my phone I've been doing this for three hours apparently hold on this is texting my family was wondering what I am I said I'll be done by 700 so thanks everybody somebody help me remember this list there's 371 of you watching which is 300 less than started oh that's weird that's very weird this camera did this camera go to sleep or did a cable go loose weird ah I wonder if that camera went to sleep this camera yeah it's way I'm looking at the confidence monitor which is not looking at the camera this is me looking at the ever thank you for watching I'm really I'm the wrong height I stand back here thank you so much for watching this live stream um I didn't get to show any other community contributions I really think I have to end now though I'll be back next Friday at a minimum I'll be back next Friday I have this whole list of things if anyone wants to help work on the wheel let's start a new repo in I mean I have that like wheel spinning thing but I want to start over and I want to make a wheels should do the wheel spin right now right what what am I gonna do next week I should do the wheel spin right I mean I actually do what I said I was gonna do right if I'm gonna do one of these next week uhhuh if I'm gonna do one of these next week I should do one of these next week should do what I say I'm gonna do I scaled it if is this a quick fix instead of what would be the next previous string oh okay yeah all right is that a like thing that I could my brain is totally dead so marching squares are TP more I'm not gonna put more rows on there because I'm well actually I'll put it on there if it lands on it then good planning it ASCII art de Launay I don't think I spelled that right Tetris oh my god please no breakout Collatz conjecture heck oh please hexagonal grid I would love to do that next week that's not such a good idea pacman no whirly noise No oh my god okay okay everyone I am going to spin this wheel and whatever it comes up on is what I have to to in my livestream next week just I'm gonna take one Mulligan I so first of all I think I should I'm not gonna do it right now but I think I should get like a veto so like one time between now and the end of 2019 if it lands on something and I want to veto it I could spin again we could come up with some other goofy rules let's just spin it next week on the county train whatever this is I'll see you next week where I will be doing the Collatz conjecture I will read up on what that is I will look at the issue thank you to whoever submitted that I'm sorry David thank you so much for preparing that list I'm I would love it if people let me just at least let me show one community contribution because it spent so much time working on that and I've already like lost it contributions random org this should allow me to pick a random number right numbers integer generator I want to get a number between 2 and 78 inclusive one random number between 2 and 78 both inclusive and get the number here we go I know you can't see this 41 okay so today before I go I'm gonna look at one oh and cybers has telling me to watch the number file awesome okay I'll watch that one community contribution hung the spreadsheet number 41 let's see whose it is it is by it was sentiment analysis by Lee ima papa it's a link on code pen with 41 Y Lee I am a Papa submitted a bunch of things we're gonna look at this one and we were gonna check it out oh look at this which some kind of like sentiment analysis should I press this button what does it do is that the is this the analysis I'm getting Vito please typing happy happy happy joy joy oh when I got it three okay so it's this is sentient analysis with the bagofwords technique where it's looking at words that it knows are associated with a positive or negative sentiment probably adding up the score together and I love that we see the score here I love this little animation of like now calculate it and then that the result is given with an emoji which is really awesome excellent work thank you for this community contribution I hope they'll look at more of these in future live streams and I will now take you out with my goodbye song and I'll be back I'm gonna do more next week than just that that's just the coding challenge hopefully next week I'm going to come and maybe do something else from one of these other topics or and I probably should have put the leftover stuff the tictactoe minimax should have definitely been on that list so we got to build ourselves a better wheel one that adds like a wheel waiting room perhaps even if like topics and like this sort of core topics I don't know I don't know how to do it yet we'll figure it out well it's good to be back I have to say enjoyed this I'm exhausted they need to be the weekend which thankfully it is and I'll see you all next Friday I'm stay tuned like if you subscribe and click the bell and all that nonsense you'll get a notification when I schedule a live stream but we'll see wheel that you can load a CSV too so that would work it doesn't have to be a JSON file CSV would be fine which so we could have like a Google sheet even that's just like keeping track of all this stuff how people enjoyed this today I don't know I mean it's good that I did this again we'll see if this could be edited into a coding challenge video that interface was horrifically bad for me I would like the chance to like not do live streaming to try to like suppressing my ideas out somebody won't make something all beautiful you always do internet always do follow mango and goose on Instagram those are my cat's I don't do the Instagram the cat's do the Instagram Ryan says great stream thanks that's nice of you um I actually don't have a way of I don't I don't have not set up local storage that is a great suggestion I'm gonna go over here and add that to the JavaScript topics local storage I don't think this was the marker I was using because it's not the good one but that's something that definitely should go on the list of things I want to accomplish this fall all right so I'm going to go over here where I have a YouTube streaming control room where I can shut down the stream but first can you go back to open broadcast studio and I'm gonna click stop streaming bye everybody I will see you next week or sooner or later or who knows I really have no idea goodbye
