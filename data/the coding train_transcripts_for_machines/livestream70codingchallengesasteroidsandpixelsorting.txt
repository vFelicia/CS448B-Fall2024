learning coding would be really rough throw your hands up in the air and say in nothingness do you wanna learn to code and make some awesome stuff when you're coding with whether you're a power this is all brand new over make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect your face you can make it jump to Lightspeed into outer space you can generate a maze that can go on for days you can make your own terrain and some purple red you can make a retro game to see how it's done and then tweet some keys to make it yours for everyone make some deleterious or Twitter hello I'm here good morning welcome livestream Watchers I hope that you can hear me okay I've got a eye on the chat over here I had a little bit I'm about an hour later than I had hoped to be my voice a little bit scratchy I have a little bit of a cold but I'm full of energy and excited to be here I know there's been a lot of new people subscribing to the channel in the last week and I see the chat is kind of going crazy and so welcome you know I don't know what happened but YouTube I guess changed their video suggestion algorithm and for whatever reason it picked up two of my videos the snake game coding challenge and the purple rain coding challenge which really just like won two videos in the sea of many but for whatever reason those were being suggested all across the board and I'm getting for just in the last week it's kind of died down today but I there was a few days that were I was getting 10 to 15 amount times the amount of traffic I usually get which is thrilling and wonderful and so many nice comments a lot of complaints but that's that goes with the territory you do people complain they have a legitimate complaint some not so legitimate complaints interesting complaints vechile and criticisms and lots of actually constructive feedback which was incredibly useful and interesting to read so I want to get started doing a new coding challenge in a moment but since there are so many new a happy birthday Fung Li since there are so many new people joining and watching I thought I would just talk a little bit about kind of how this works in terms of the live channel now I have some tea everybody always asks hey what are you on and I always say chamomile tea i I just like this I guess at least when I turn on the camera and start live streaming so wow there are so many people in the chat it's very hard to keep up with but I'm keeping an eye so one thing I one thing I'm a little bit later I'm about an hour later than I had intended today mostly because I you know a lot of there's been a shirt there I'm live from the school for poetic computation in New York City and they had a wonderful showcase over the weekend and lots of stuff was hectic and things got moved around so I just set up a lot of things again so I have a little bit less time than I had hoped for but I hope that I'll still be able to do some interesting stuff with you guys I'm hoping that next week before the holidays come I had a little bit of extra time to do some more live streams especially with so many new viewers it's kind of I want to try to generate more content if I can so let me talk a little bit of slither is a great suggestion I'm just peeking at the chat of how this works so my name is Dan Shipman I come on live Oh hopefully once per week I've been I've been pretty regular about once per week I missed maybe two weeks in the last three months but otherwise I've been once per week somewhere between one and three hours and this and I do brittles challenges about code and typically I work in either JavaScript or in Java and in job I always I'm usually I typically use a framework so in JavaScript I use something called p5.js and in for Java I used something called processing and you know every once in a while I dabble in something else like some nodejs I might introduce a few like pythons tools for some machine learning at some point in the new year but so and some of my videos follow a kind of sequence a tutorial sequence and some of them some of them are just kind of like oneoff videos and so I this fall I've been doing a lot of videos around a text analysis and text generation for a course that I teach at a school called ITP which is at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and so this is the URL for the website for that course and I've been kind of doing these once per week but I thought since so many people joined in the last week and there seems to be a lot of interest in energy around kind of quick coding challenges to make simple 2d games that I want to kind of put the core stuff aside I need to just fix this camera I can see that it's the green screen camera is a little bit off I want to put aside the core stuff for today and just do some coding challenges and the first one I'm going to start with is asteroids so I'm gonna get to that in a second yes boy people have great suggestions and there are a thousand people watching you've got to be kidding me I can't see that is that is totally insane Wow oh and guess what I have a new song let me let me give you this a couple more logistical things so if you like what you see I highly encourage you to subscribe you can go to coding rainbow comm unfortunately I've had to change the name of the channel coming soon I'm gonna have a new song and a new name but for now you can go to this website still you can subscribe I appreciate it if you subscribe it really appreciate if you watch the videos if you send me feedback you can also become a patron and I have a slack channel where I answer questions and talk about the different coding challenges and then I also want to mention a lot of people I've had this is one of my favorite comments I've had this comment maybe 10 to 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 times in the last week I don't know why this is the comment some variation on this I don't know why YouTube suggested this video I know nothing about coding I didn't even think I was interested in coding but I'm fascinated and I love watching so that to me is so thrilling I don't know if any of you who are tuning in sort of got a live notification and aren't programmers or have never done any coding before but if you're interested I it's harder to find but I do have two particular playlists that are geared exclusively to beginners with no experience whatsoever and this is one of them here 1 to 6 foundations of programming in JavaScript you don't need to know any anyone to any background in programming to start with this tutorial and then I have another one which is called learning processing and I guess if I go to my channel really quickly it might be woops this is wrong user slash Schiffman if I go here and I go down coding challenges this one so this one will give you a fresh introduction to processing which is a platform a programming environment built on top of Java I would love to say I get a lot of questions about what's processing I'd love to get to some of that we'll see if I can do that today all right so welcome one thing I would like to know I'm sorry for my voice a little bit skeet by the way I'm gonna try to take it easy today a little bit because some of you might remember that two months ago I had a little bit of a cold and I and I just overdid it with recording videos and teaching lost my voice for like a week and a half so I'm hoping that does not happen today one thing I'm wondering about is if the focus is okay if you guys can see me the cameras were low out of whack and I'm not the only person here so I click go and focus the camera that walk back over here then refocus it so can you guys let me know if you can see me okay if I'm standing over here typing and back I'm kind of looking in the chat so they let me answer this question that rapper Mauro asked which is what was the difference between p5.js and processing so I'll briefly mention that both of these opensource projects are maintained and developed by something called the processing Foundation which is a nonprofit organization processing has been around since 2001 so it has a long history and it's built on top of Java so you can download it run it I'm gonna do a challenge with it and a little bit so you'll see it later and everything you're doing in processing is actually Java so even though there's a lot of helper functions and some things that happen to let you avoid some of the sort of ugliness of Java so to speak if you learn processing any program processing you are learning Java you're writing code in Java so that's processing P and p5.js is a new relatively new project just two or three years old and it is a framework for write that's built in JavaScript so it's a JavaScript library so and the things that you make in p5.js can run in the browser both of these environments have a downloadable editor that you can launch and use but I don't actually in my videos I'm not using the p5.js editor for web programming there are so many ways you can just use any text editor you can use an code pen online there's so many ways you can kind of do browserbased development with Java based development you really need like a development environment most people would use something like eclipse or maybe NetBeans or something like that but but processing is a really nice simple one that just like kind of works has a nice play button you can make stuff run full screen you can do graphics and animation work with hardware lots of stuff and if you go back not to plug my step and watch the tutorial videos you'll get to know it a little bit better okay so I have a new song to premiere now I don't have a new song to premiere but one of one of the patrons of this YouTube channel let me see if soundcloud lost lost GH bear with a collaborator I don't have no idea how to pronounce this paddle paddle paddle applause created a song called kittens I think I had a video where I was demonstrating something about like loading images and displaying them and I kept saying kittens over and over again I always love it when people do remixes of some of the audio so I can play them and use them for dancing background while I'm like setting up so I'm gonna premiere on this live stream this new song while I get set up to do an asteroids coding challenge so I'm gonna play the music and I'm just gonna be here kind of like fiddling away at the keyboard and trying to get set up I am looking at the live chat on YouTube I'm also for patrons I'm looking at the slack live chat as well and you were there please say hi in there and I'm trying to kind of look at both of these at the same time this dot song will come later don't worry okay here we go unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I really lives in my mind can you guys hear me at the same time as the music compliment a lot of people really change sorry everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay I'm really getting something like sound that was a valid syntax I forgotten these employees that I will use the seamlessly over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis states that I will use continuously over and over again to do the kidneys of kings okay perfect timing I hope you guys enjoyed that song by lost GH bear and on a bluff and I think I'm ready now to do an asteroids coding challenge I have a local server running I have I have why are things kind of frozen here let me close some of these windows there we go I have browser open to a sketch I want to make sure I have a console viewable and then I want to make sure my code is viewable and I think I'm ready to go pong ping pong ping pong so yeah that song for any of you are interested please that song for any of you who are interested I'm over here for a second by the way can you guys see this okay I'm going to use the whiteboard a little bit for when I have to explain some things in asteroids oh I don't know where'd I put that marker hmm I need my whiteboard marker hold on everybody we're so close to getting started with this asteroids challenge just let's see need to put on another song for you guys where's my whiteboard marker but alright we'll just use this blue one I guess I had a black one that was like a nice fresh one oh very bright okay I'm getting a message voice a little louder and the music a little quieter okay hold on everybody okay I'm getting some messages for about about everything so couple things my voice is a little bit quiet and the music is maybe a little bit loud so one thing I can do let me just adjust the let me just adjust the sound for a second really quickly and I think this will make that a little bit as always I always forget to dis stop hopefully that's a little bit better the the voice is fine okay now I must told that the whiteboard is a little bit too crazy bright let me see if I can fix that a little bit because the settings on this camera changed and I can fix that maybe that's better so hopefully that's a little bit better and you can read that okay all right I know there's all these new people watching they're like what is this channel you take like a half an hour to do it hey mister this is one of the complaints I get in the comments don't watch the lot of people don't watch the live stream please way too much time which is absolutely true and I admitted that sorry by the way I also wanted the most amusing comments I got in this sea of traffic last week is there's a conspiracy theory out there on the internet that I have all the code I'm going to write prewritten over here because I keep looking over here and then typing the reason I keep looking over here is because that's where my monitor is that's the YouTube chat is if the the chats a little out of control I don't know if there's any ma if there's anybody a moderator in there feel free to I don't know do what you please move a bit to the left because you're blocking the screen hmm I don't know how to what to do about that okay okay so here we go all right I am going to now start I need to cycle the cameras a little bit afraid to do this because everything is a little bit tenuous here but I'm gonna do that and I'm going to start all right I'm gonna start doing asteroids so okay couple one thing I want to mention so I'm actually doing a collaboration with Siraj us how do you spell this Suraj yeah here we go Suraj ology Suraj geology it's been ride this is Suraj music video so what we're gonna do here we're gonna make this a collaboration I'm gonna program asteroids as a html5 JavaScript game and when that's done I'm gonna send this game to Suraj who does videos on YouTube about machine learning and he is going to train a bot to play the game and figure out how to get a really good score now the truth of the matter is the version of the game that I'll build in the champ in in the challenge probably won't have all the scoring stuff I'm just gonna do their bit core functionality so I'll work on it some more afterwards so and the other thing I'm gonna do which is a little bit different so you know what you guys what some of you might not realize if you're new here cuz it's like 1500 people watching is that what I do is I record these long live sessions and then machiya Blanchette who's watching helps to edit them down into a shorter or coding challenge or tutorial videos that get uploaded separately so I'm gonna do something a little bit weird I'm gonna time travel a little bit and I'm gonna record the challenge and then after I'm done I'm gonna make a pretend intro to it because I wanna I want to do that I feel a little experiment today I want to do the intro after to see if I can like because I want to talk about Suraj and all that sort of also to make sure that it like went okay and then then you know if the game is sort of problematic then I might do a different game with Suraj later something like that so I'm gonna get started right away now okay um here we go I am over here here we go so what I'm going to do is hit refresh I've never actually felt nervous doing these I feel like nervous right now cuz there's so many people watching and so asteroids a lot of people so sometimes every one of the big questions I get is oh do you like practice these in advance or do you think the through do you plan them and sometimes I do and sometimes I don't for example I am planning to do a coding challenge about mapping with doing a like taking a spreadsheet of cities and lat/long values and plotting those and I did do some work to figure that out and prepare it so when I do the coding challenge I have that in my head all the thing that I'm gonna do right now asteroids doing is pretty much cold I mean I have definitely programmed aspects of this and physics things and moving things around but the actual game asteroids is in my head I have not programmed it before so let's get started I want to image search asteroids to have this asteroids game there we go so and let's see if I can this looks good I want to have a nice image here although I guess I'm going to record the intro after so okay so here we go I am now thanks for all the nice there's a white half circle in your webcam I don't know what that means okay I'm okay here we go I'm trying to figure out how to do this because I'm gonna do an intro after but I'm just going to kind of do a quick intro as well right now half circle in the screen bottom oh yeah oh shoot that happened again so I have a light there to help with the shadowing problem I think I fixed that thank you for noticing that okay here we go OOP burger that's one of the comments in the chat okay here we go I'm ready I'm ready I'm ready I'm nervous I'm ready I'm gonna do this okay all right here we are I'm gonna start programming asteroids from scratch uh not entirely from scratch because I mean was a framework called p5.js that has a lot of hooks in it for drawing and animation but the actual game mechanics I'm gonna just sort of figure out on the fly I haven't done this before and we'll see what happens if you want to know how long this takes just look at the how long this video is and then you'll know but I don't know because I can't time travel into the future although I mean if somebody figured that out for me will be very helpful for a lot of things I need okay let's go this is the game asteroids and here we go so the first thing that I need to do is I think I should program the spaceship the thing that's in the center of the screen that you can kind of like turn and then push around so what I'm going to do to do that is I'm going to create a ship object and the framework that I'm using is called p5.js which has a lot of things will allow me to draw the triangle pretty easily but it also has a vector a vector object built into it so something that I want this ship to have is a position and I'm gonna have that position start at the center of the screen which is with divided by two and height divided by two and then I'm gonna write a function called render where I draw the ship as a triangle so how do I draw a triangle there's a function in p5 called triangle and all I need are all I need are three XY coordinates so what I could do is draw a triangle like this if I think of this as like a zero zero then this could be like five comma five this could be like negative five comma five and this could be like negative five comma zero so that would give me three coordinates of the triangle but maybe these shouldn't be five that should be a variable that has to do with the size of it so I'm gonna come back over here and I am going to now add this dot R equals ten and I'm gonna say a triangle is three points what I'm looking over there negative this dot R negative this dot R this dot R a lot of this dots this dot R this dot R and then zero negative this dot R so what I want now is to create a variable this is just to get the ship called ship and then I'm gonna say ship equals new ship this is called this constructor function and creates an object that has a position on R value and a function called render so I can now say ship dot render and I can run this code and we'll see what we've got look there's a nice little triangle but it's up there in the top left corner because I didn't actually use the position so something I can do in p5 is I can say translate the translate function translates the coordinate system by an X and a yvalue vectors have an x and a y value so I can take translate by x and a y which essentially will position the ship now where it actually is so I now have that triangle there I could make it a little bit bigger I could also say I could also say no fill and Stroke 255 this fist don't fill the interior of the triangle and give the stroke a white stroke and now I have a nice little triangle right there in the center excellent so now what do I need to do I need to be able to figure out a way that when I press the right arrow key and the left arrow key the triangle rotates so let's figure that out the ship rotates so one thing I should probably add here is of a variable called it could call it angle but I'm gonna call it heading so I'm gonna say it's heading is 0 and before I draw the triangle after I translate I'm always going to rotate by this dot heading so we can see now that's that now what if I change the heading to 90 degrees will be pointed to the right hmm that's not exactly right well it's not pointed to the right because p5 in most computer graphics environment think in terms of radians which is a different unit of measurement according then degrees so to the right 90 degrees is PI divided by 2 radians so I can actually say PI divided by 2 and you can see now there it is it's pointing to right so that's the heading now what I want I mean the heading is something arbitrary I can start it at zero for right now so what I want to do is I need to be able to rotate it so I need another function and I'll call it this dot turn now one thing about these functions javascript is a funny place with objectoriented programming and objects have this thing called a prototype so this isn't the best way and I've gotten comments about this to just put these functions in the constructor function itself some people like to put them but just for a sort of ease of use and readability right now I'm just putting the functions in here this dot turn equals function so I can say ah maybe this needs a an angle value that it turns by and I say heading plus equals angle so anytime I call this function this dot turn anytime I call this function ship turn it'll turn the ship so for example if in the draw loop draws it p5 has a draw loop that animates over and over again if I were just to say ship turn 0.1 we could see ah okay heading is not defined always forget this time so I think where did I forget that this dot heading plus equals angle there we go now I have my ship spinning yes okay but I don't want it to just spin randomly I want to spin if I am pressing the right arrow key so now I need to go back to my code and I need to add a key pressed function now p5 allows you to have these kind of global event handlers one of them is function key press so anytime I press a key this function will happen and what I want to do here is just check if the key code is right arrow ship dot turn by 0.1 else if the key code is left arrow ship turn negative zero point one okay that's pretty good right so now I'm going to turn off this turning that's happening in draw I'm hit refresh and now when I press the right key it turns when I press the left key this is kind of terrible I can't hold down the key to turn it I have to press it one at a time so we're gonna have to change how this works and actually there's a sort of a funny way I could do this I'm gonna I'm gonna make a global variable I could probably package us in the object a bit better and actually I'm going to I'm going to make a variable in the object called this dot rotation and set it equal to zero and this dot turn actually just always turns it by that rotation amount and then I'm gonna say this dot set rotation is a function that receives an angle and then this taut rotation equals that angle so now what I want to do is when I press the key I want to set the rotation when I release the key I wanna unset it because I I want to be able to just I want to handle the key pressed and released it differently so now I can say here set rotation 0.1 set rotation negative point 1 and if I add an event for key released now I can say ship dot set rotation 0 so now this should what didn't work so what did I miss I've got a bug here it was a nice idea right oh you know what I forgot to do I forgot to call ship turn so I always have to turn it I might be turning it by zero sometimes but the function turn is always calling it's always happening in the draw loop uh sketch 11 shiz which is ship ok so now there we go so now as I hold the key down it turns okay there we go it's turning as I hold it down now the next thing I need to do is is I need to be able to move it so when I press the up arrow I want to apply a force in the direction that it's pointing let's think about how I'm going to do this so in other words here's my ship let's say it's pointing in this particular direction so I have this particular angle as this variable heading so what I need to do is I want it to have a velocity that's moving in that direction so I need to add two concepts to the ship I need to add the concept of a velocity which changes its position but I also need to add this concept of an acceleration I don't actually the acceleration is the thing that changes the velocity so when I press up which is like a boost thrust or boost onto the ship it's like a force that pushes it and it starts to move so let's see how we can add that both of those things will also be vectors so if I go back to the code boy asteroids is much more complicated than I'd imagined still only on the ship this dot velocity equals create vector zero zero I want to add a function called update which is always updates whatever this object is doing and I'm going to say this dot position add this dot velocity so if I were to run this you can see oh wait first of all I've got I always make this always forget this I've got to actually call now shift update okay now if I hit refresh it's not doing anything but what if I give it a velocity create vector one comma zero so it's velocity is a vector pointing to the right 1 comma zero now if a it refresh there it is it's moving now it's not pointing in the direction then it's moving so many problems here but we're gonna fix all of those things the idea here is that the velocity just starts at zero but instead of assigning it a value I'm gonna push it so I need some sort of function that's like this dot boost and when I boost it what do I do I add something to the velocity so I need a vector that points in the direction that it's pointing and I know the direction based on an angle so I need to get a vector an X and a Y based on that angle fortunately for us p5 as a framework has a function to create a vector from an angle I could do it manually using sine and cosine and trigonometry I have other videos that show that but if I just come over here I can say var force equals p5 dot vector dot from angle heading so this will give me a vector that points in the direction of that heading and I can now say this dot velocity ad force so now I need to add else if keycode equals up arrow that'll be my key for boosting it ship dot boost so let's see how this goes now if I press the up key uh a heading is not defined I forgot that this ever have to like I should have to put a quarter in a jar every time I forget this been working in an object in JavaScript and then I would be I would be wealthy except for the fact that those would be my own quarters so it wouldn't really work but whatever I just said wealthy in this very like fancy way like I don't know anyway so now if I hit the up arrow uh heading is not to fine sketch that chest line 41 I die not hit save I must not have hit save there we go now you notice it's working but it's not pointing in the right direction so this is a silly problem because I drew a triangle kind of like pointing up but a rotation of zero is pointing to the right so I kind of just need to like adjust everything I probably could have been could have drawn the rectangle oriented to the right but I can just fix this in my code with a one little line that just says rotate heading plus pi divided by two that should rotate it always offset by 90 degrees and if I do this you can see I am now pushing it around like asteroids now you can't see what keys I'm pressing but left left left right right up up left down down now one thing I kind of want to do just for sort of ease is I want I don't know if this is really in asteroids but I want to add a little dampening okay want the okay I'm pausing I am getting um so this is going to get are there two point four now they're two thousand people watching this right now that's completely insane so this is gonna be an edit point when the challenge gets released because I'm getting a message that the whiteboard is hard to read yeah the focus looks off to me let me see what I can do about this I'm gonna zoom in on it yeah this is this is how I work I think it's also because I'm not using a black marker which would be better hopefully that helps a little bit all right it's all good okay so hopefully that helps a little bit if I'm looking in this the patron slack channel which is easier to follow than the the live stream the whiteboard is tilted I know it's tilted the camera tilted what maybe just too bright still it looks okay to me in my preview but oops let me darken it a little bit is that better I didn't maybe that makes it a little bit easier it looks fuzzy to me I think what I need I just need that black marker that I had hold on everyone I'm gonna I'll be I'm gonna look I'm walking around you can probably still hear me I'm looking to see if there's any other whiteboard markers anywhere can you still hear me oh well okay I just got to keep going I guess it's better okay it's better now okay people and people are don't like okay so here we go I'm gonna go back into the tutorial I forgot where I was uh I was talking about how I wanted to add a little bit of friction okay so this has gotta be an edit point but here we come back into the tutorial okay so one thing I want to add is a little bit of dampening or friction just to like make it a little easier for me to play right now and also it's an interesting thing to see in the update function what I'm gonna do is always say this dot velocity dot multiply by zero point nine five so I just want to reduce the velocity the magnitude of that vector by five percent every frame and you'll see what that does so as I accelerate it kind of slows down and stops now I'm doing it too much the other thing is I can't hold down the up key so I have to do the same exact thing that I did with turning I need to handle that in ship so what I'm gonna do is say ship dot boosting true I'm gonna change this I'm gonna say ship dot boosting false and I'm going to create a variable called this dot this dot is boosting equals false and then I'm gonna write the function this dot boosting which gets a boolean value as an argument and I'm going to say this dot is boosting equals B so I can and then in update I think I can just do this in update I'm just gonna say always say this dot boost so it's always oh no no no if it's boosting if this is boosting then updates already always being called so I basically want to turn boosting on and off boost is totally the wrong word I think the word is thrust but whatever it doesn't matter you get the idea okay so I think this is exciting I think this is gonna work let's see oh my god so now I could hold okay really fast so now I need to deal with the fact that because I can hold it down that force is much too strong so I'm going to say force dot multiplied by 0.5 so I'm gonna reduce its magnitude by half actually I'm introduced it by 90 percent just to sort of see so you can see I can now hold the mouse down and it still it has that and turn it around so it's essentially like drive it around the screen the friction is too much though I just wanted to have a little bit of dampening so I'm gonna say x 0.99 there we go so I've got asteroids here pretty much I've got the core mechanic now down of driving this triangle around the screen this is totally fun okay now what do I need to do boy there's a lot left to do I need to add actual asteroids I also need to deal with the fact that this should wrap around that's kind of an easy problem let's let's add that real quick so I should add a function called this edges equals function oh this is gonna be so tedious and I want to say if this dot pause dot X is greater than a width plus minus this dot R so I just want to kind of like if it's no plus R if it's like all the way off the screen then have it have its position equal negative R else if this dot Paz dot X is less than negative this dot R then have its position get reset to the other side of this screen right so this should do it for X whoops let's drive off this side oh I'm not I do this every time when you write a function you need to actually call it for anything to ever happen so in draw in draw now also want to say ship edges let's see if that works now whoops and drive off the screen and I got an error I forgot this dot where did I forget this dot in my edges function this dot R and this dot R I don't need this dot width right because with a refers to the width in this sort of global sense of the Candice but R as part of this ship object so now I can off the edge and here I come back so asteroids kind of like we would see it in both places and fancier ways and stuff now I just need to implement this for the top and the bottom height and Y and Y and Y and height so now I should have I can drive off the top the side and I can like turn around and slow myself down so I can drive around this is fun I really I did not get distracted to keep playing the game okay it's time let's add some asteroids now one thing I don't love here is that my code is getting to be a little bit unwieldy so I want to take this whole ship constructor function and I'm gonna add a new file and I'm gonna call it a ship KS and I'm gonna put the whole ship constructor function there I'm gonna make a new file called asteroid KS because I want all the code for astra asteroids things that are flying around I want to put there and then what I need to do is in my index dot HTML file I need to make sure that I am also referencing ship KS and asteroid KS so I haven't done anything that should change the way this program works I just moved reorganized my code a little bit I feel good about that how do you feel about that are you still watching maybe I feel like I been doing this for hours so probably hasn't been that long okay so now asteroid hmm so the first thing I need to deal with is the fact that unlike the ship where there's just one of them I'm gonna need many asteroids flying around the screen so I need to save our asteroids equals bracket bracket because I want it to be an array an array being a list of things as opposed to one thing and then what I want to do just to get started I want to say asteroids dot push new asteroid push being a function that adds something to an array and I forgot to parentheses there so we need to add an asteroid to that list and then in the draw loop is less than I want to loop now one of the other comments I get constantly on my channel is why don't you use a for each loop and maybe someday I will but I'm just kind of I'm like old and not very good at this that I'm sort of used to these kind of loops with iterating over an index so someday I'll add for each loop in JavaScript to some of these but right now I'm just gonna do this I'm gonna do asteroids index I render so notice this is a technique that I often employ I haven't actually written any of the code for the asteroid I'm just imagining what I need I need an array I need to make a new one and then I need to look through all of them and add and call render so now this gives me kind of a template for what I need to write in this asteroid is fun it a JavaScript file I need to write a constructor function called asteroid I also want the asteroid to have a position create vector and you know what the position for right now we'll just be a random spot random with random being a p5.js function that gives me a random number between 0 and some value like width or height and then I need a render function which is something that'll draw it now what I'm gonna do right now just for the I'm what I'm gonna do right now is I'm gonna call this I'm gonna say a translate this dot pause X this dot pause dot Y and I'm just gonna write I'm just gonna draw a circle 0 0 and you know what we need an R as well this dot R equals 50 and then I'm going to say this dot R times 2 because the the ellipse function wants and the lips function wants a diameter so to draw a circle so the radius times choose the diameter so let's see how this goes where's my asteroid there it is so you can see there's an asteroid okay I'm just checking to make sure oh I got a I I lost oh why did I lose my chat here sorry this is an edit point because I lost the chat where I keep an eye on just to see if there's any technical difficulties I don't know why I lost that sorry about this this is also a pause edit point for the actual video requests from hold I'm just replying to a message here about YouTube moderation okay okay here we go I am going to continue Wow okay so now here's thing there's one asteroid and it's a circle let me let me make this easier for editing here's one asteroid and it's a circle I can hit refresh and it should I must have something wrong with my random cuz right look it seems to be off the screen let's take a look at that random with random height hmm oh I know what the problem is I meant to talk about this but I forgot so here's the thing these translates build on each other so the ship is translating and rotating the triangle the asteroid is now translating the ellipse so that asteroid is actually being drawn relative to the ship's location and strand and it's but I can show you what I mean like this I got to get to appear look as I move now that's kind of interesting but it's not what we want so one thing I need to add is are these functions that are in p5 that are push the functions push and pop so push is going to save the current translation and rotation state and pop is going to restore it so if I put push and pop around it it makes all this translate rotate for the triangle not affect the other thing and you can see now and also actually if the styles so that you can see now the the asteroids being positioned you know randomly now let me go back to here the asteroid and I also need to add that to here because there's going to be a lot of asteroids and I want them to be independent from each other and I'm also gonna say stroke 255 no Phil ok so now what I want to do even though I could just keep going I think it would be really good for us to sort of procedurally generate random asteroids that have that jaggedy look from the original asteroids game I could make this game just with the circles but that I took in some ways that defeats the point of what I want to do so I know the whiteboards not the greatest today but I'm going to come over here and just briefly explain how I'm gonna do this so I used the function ellipse and I the cameras are about to shut off so this is gonna be a pause point it's gonna get edited doing this a lot today got a cycle the camera we lost thing okay so I'm drawing a circle with the function ellipse another way I could draw a circle is by setting all the points of a circle as vertices and then connecting them as one polygon and you can see this is like a bit less of a highresolution circle but if I move these points around a little bit then I can also make something that appears more in jaggedy so how do I get these points I need to do something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation and I have another video I think that goes through that in detail or if I don't I better make one and link to it from here but really what I just need to do is think of each one of these spots as an angle from the center and or distance from the center radius and then I need to convert that to an X Y with a little bit of trigonometry so time to review your trigonometry pause this video and go read about trigonometry if you're watching it okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna take out this ellipse and I'm going to write a for loop yet again I'm gonna say a equals zero actually don't say I equals zero I'm gonna use I equals zero I is less than I don't know let's just use ten points I plus plus I can use the p5 map function to get an angle so I want to take I which goes from zero to ten and I want to get a an angle that's between zero and two pi 2 pi being the equivalent of 360 degrees then I want to say VAR x equals this R times cosine of that angle this will give this is the polar to Cartesian coordinate the polar coordinate is R comma angle the Cartesian coordinate is X comma Y name for Rene Descartes the mathematician VAR y equals sine of the angle and then what I can do is I can set a vertex at that x and y position okay and now in addition to that what I'm gonna do is say begin shape so I want to create an arbitrary shape out of vertices this list of vertices all with their XY and shape and we're gonna see what this gives me so you can see it there it is it's kind of like a circle but it's a little more jaggedy and notice how it's not connected at the end so an easy way for it for me to do that in p5 is just to add this close function which will tell the shape to close itself at the end the other thing that I think would be interesting to do is have this BA be flexible so each time I do it I have a different number I have a sort of a different resolution so I'm gonna do a variable called total which is a random number between let's say it could be between five and fifteen points so this is going to say this total and this would now be this total so sometimes it will have a few vertices sometimes it'll have a lot so you can see I'm getting different ones and now you know what would be much better is if I stopped if I right now in the sketch what I should just do here is add a bunch of them so let's add ten of them at the beginning and now so I don't know if we can see there's a whole bunch of them all with the different amount of verses and the other thing I should do is make the the size of them variable so I'm also gonna say this dot R equals a random number I don't know between five and twenty five that didn't work this dot R oh that's in the ship I changed the ship size which is to be fixed and I want the asteroid itself to have a random value between 15 and 70 50 was it looks like a good sort of maximum size so now you can see and this is too many I want to start it with fewer just so let's just start it with five okay so we can see here is now a bunch of asteroids now here's the thing these don't look like the asteroids in asteroids so how do I going to make them jaggedy and more interesting looking what I believe I can do is I can actually let's see how am I going to do this in the asteroids what I can do is offset our each time by some random value hmm but I need it to be the same random values each time so there's a bunch of ways I could do this but I'm gonna make this I'm going to make this a an array and I need how many I need however many points I have I need that many offsets so this dot offset equals a random amount so when I create the object I make an array of offsets for each one of those vertices and let's say it's between like negative five and five I might want to make it bigger and then now the X and y is plus this dot offset index I and and you know let me let me make this a little simpler to read I'm gonna just make another variable the R is actually this dot R plus the offset for each one and now here's the polar to Cartesian oops coordinate transformation okay I hope this works oh boy I'm gonna be excited if it does if it looks like asteroids ah total is not defined this dot total where's total not defined this total oh I don't see any asteroids this dot offset index I I see in the chat somebody is ah yes I need an index I here I need to set each spot in the array oops there we go that's looking kind of better so you can see these look kind of more like asteroids we can make the offset much more extreme yeah this is better so now I've got something that looks much more like those procedurally generated asteroids alright somebody asks what prompts me to rig the bell I guess I'm doing that every time I have a bug and I fix it but alright I have a bug and I don't fix it okay I don't want to here we go I got to keep going ah so now these asteroids by the way I can still drive around right the whole point is to drive around and not hit the asteroids but a little bit big I don't know if I'm making this game too hard to play but the asteroids should move right I need the asteroids now to move around the screen so they need an update function and the same thing I could just say this stop position dot add this stop velocity only they don't have a velocity so let me give them a velocity this velocity equals and p5 has a function to create a random vector so a vector of length one pointing in a random direction so I can just say random 2d to give me a random vector if I go to sketch J s I can say that asteroids index i dot update and here we go there we go now the asteroids are moving around o the asteroids also need to do when they leave to come back so one thing I can probably do is just reuse this edges function you know I could do some kind of fancy objectoriented inherent inheritance thing but I'm just gonna take this exact function and yeah I could I could use the same function and assign it to both but I'm just gonna copy paste it right now then I'm gonna go to sketch J s and say asteroids dot edges okay there we go now I've got the asteroids moving around and now all I need to do boy I might not finished yet oh yeah I have no collision detection so I'm not I'm definitely not gonna add collision detection to this today because you know whatever asteroids they're they're in different Z space and they pass through each other and us or a magical sense and what happened to my ship there it is but I should add a feature where I can now fire little lasers at the asteroids and break them apart okay so let's see if we can manage to add that so I'm going to add a another JavaScript file call it laser jess and here what I want is once again I need a position and I need a velocity and I needed update function I need all the same sort of things which is this dot position dot add this stop velocity and so and then I need a render function and I'm just gonna draw it as a point this dot point this this dot X this dot Y and a stroke 255 I'm gonna say stroke wait for to make it a little bit thicker and so now if what I need also now just the same way I made the asteroids I need and you know what hmm I'm tempted to put these in the ship object like the ship keep tracks of its own lasers but just for simplicity sake I'm gonna make an array out here so I'm gonna make an array and I'm going to in draw just like with the asteroids I'm going to loop through all the lasers the laster's the lasers and I'm gonna render and update them it doesn't need an edges function and now when do I create them so I want let's say I want to create them when I hit the spacebar so I don't know what the key code is for the spacebar but I can also just say if key equals space so I can add to this key pressed function and I can say lasers dot push new laser now here's the thing where should the laser start well the laser laser should start wherever the ship is so I actually in this case want to pass something in to that laser constructor and I want to pass ship dot position so I want to say create a laser where the ship is so now if I go into that laser I can receive an argument like a ship pas ship I could just call this pup mount ship s pause for like ship position starting position and I can say create a vector s pause X s pause dot Y so I'm copy essentially by making a new vector with the same X&Y and so now if i refresh this and I hit space okay laser is not defined I'm not gonna ring the bells I now what I need to do is make sure I have a reference also to laser dodge ASI add a new JavaScript file in my in my index of html5 my brain is no thing I've been doing this for too long okay this is a long coding challenge okay here we go let's see spacebar oh look at that it changed the stroke weight of everything that was kind of exciting but but it did not I don't see any dots on the screen so let's let's have a look here let's look in the console for lasers I definitely added a bunch and their positions are on the screen why am I not seeing them so a couple things one is am i calling this dot render sketch j/s am i calling this dot render draw lasers and icon lasers not render I am lasers i dot render let's okay and oh you know what I did wrong this is like total nonsense this dot X and this dot y doesn't exist what does the laser have it has a position vector and a velocity vector so this is this dot paused on X and this dot pause that Y and by the way let's add the push and pop here so that stroke weight doesn't affect anything else oops and now I can it so you can see as I move it creates little dots where where the where the ship is now here's the thing I want those dots to move and I want them to point in the direction of the ship itself so in addition when I make one of these laser objects where did I do that right here and not only need to make it the laser with the ship's position but I should really pass in that heading as well right I want to give it the angle because the angle is gonna tell it which way should it be pointing when it creates a vector just moving so if I add ship dot heading to the constructor I can now say that's an angle that I'm getting in the laser I can say p5 dot vector from angle angle now did I call update in the main sketch I don't want to make the same mistake I did so now we should have yeah they're kind of slow but they do work look at that this is fun okay so first of all they're coming out of this Center which is a little bit weird should probably make them come out of the front but I could offset them I'm not gonna worry about that too much I am going to make them move much faster though because that's ridiculously slow so I'm gonna say this dot velocity dot multiply I'm gonna multiply it by like ten so they're ten times as fast that's really fast and you know I could do a little trick I bet you won't notice if with the ship if I actually set when I draw the ship instead of no fill if I said its fill to zero so I give it a black fill it's actually gonna cover over the lasers as long as in sketch J yes mimimimi wherever I'm need to make sure the ship is drawn after the lasers so that it covers them now we should see yeah that looks a little bit better so now all I need to do is figure out when the lasers hit those asteroids and when they hit the asteroids I need the asteroids to break apart ooh this is exciting okay here we go here we go so oh boy so many features I think this might be the last feature I'm gonna do so I need I do need some kind of collision detection here so how do I do that well here is a loop where I here's a loop where I am looping over all the asteroids here's a loop where I'm looping over all the lasers I need to check every single laser against every single asteroid right I need to do something like if lasers in I hits asteroids indexed J right for every laser I check every single asteroid hmm now here's the thing I need another loop so I need my asteroids loop inside inside the lasers loop oh and this should be J I can't use I for both loops otherwise my program will get wildly confused so now I'm saying now hits is not some automatic functions that just exist I almost want to just like run this code and it'll work I'm writing up the code again to tell me what I need to put into my objects if I was using some kind of game programming framework or library there's one for p5 called p5 play it might have collision detection built into it but I'm just going to do something simple here myself lasers index I hits asteroids index J so that means in the laser object I need a function called hits that expects an asteroid object so I go to laser and I say this this dot hits equals function asteroid and then now how do I determine if the two things are colliding well there's an actually easy way for me to do this because what I have is I have a like circular like thing and I have a dot so if this was a perfect circle I could just determine is the dot is the distance from the dot to the center less than the radius or greater than the radius if it's greater than the radius it's outside if it's less than the radius it's inside and you know it's gonna be a slightly off for some of these jaggedy edges but it all happen so fast that no one will notice you could do like complex elaborate polygons thing yourself if you want and write it in the comments and 7year corrections okay so now I want to say VAR d equals distance which is a p5 function between this dot Paz X this dot Paz dot y and the asteroid dot Paz dot X asteroid pause dot Y so I want the distance between the positions X Y and the asteroids that the laser is XY and the asteroids X Y if the distance less than.this dot r+ asteroid r this oh no no this this doesn't have an are just the asteroids are if the distance is less than the asteroids radius then then it's colliding hit so I'm just going to and I'm gonna just console.log hit for a second and see if this works come on hit no I not oh it's not working let's see if we can figure that out so one thing I might do here is just is this actually happening let's look at that distance value so I must have forgotten to call this sketch is if lasers index I hits asteroids index J no I am calling it let's see if this is happening about to test no oh well no no there's no lasers so it's if the lasers is zero there we go oh it is working I just forgot that I'm not gonna see any console dot log if there's no lasers because it's not at this part yet ooh okay here we go so now let me refresh this and let's look at these distance values well I must not be saving things properly or most things are caching a little bit okay so we can see these distance values kind of makes sense so why am I not seeing anything hit so oh okay well hold on hold on hold on let's make sure asteroid R is a value that makes sense and let's compare those this is hard to see because of my font size so I just have have I just not oh no this should be right if I just not hit one yet this looks pretty good to me I just that bad at doing this I hold on this might have to get edit some of this might have to get edited out of the final version of this this dot hits Oh Oh am i truly let's check here sketched out J s let me look at all my different somebody in the chat is probably gonna correct me here and we look over here lasers index eye hits asteroids index J right that's actually happening why is this never happening let's just is it actually working and I'm just losing my oh it is working I think it's been working all along I just like didn't actually hit any of them so you can see it's working sorry everybody so the whole point of what I wanted to do here I'm not sure some of that should have gotten edited out or not but it's working out it has been working I just didn't have the console log in the right place or something ooh so what I actually want to do if you look at my sketch j/s is that if the laser sit I visit an if statement so I want that to evaluate to true or false so what I want to do is return true if that's the case now there's another thing I could actually just return the result of D less than asteroid R but I like to be a noise and write extra code but I don't need to and also I just think for teaching purposes it's sort of something that makes it a little more readable to see the whole thing written out because what I'm doing is I'm returning true or false based on whether the distance is in that threshold or not so if it is within that threshold what do I need to do I need to do a couple things in sketch j/s I need to say asteroids index J like break up so what happens in the game asteroids when your laser hits the asteroid it like breaks into two smaller asteroids so how am I gonna do that oh this is a tricky tricky tricky boy this is not as easy as I thought okay so first of all one thing I need to do is I want to I think the way to do this is to remove better I have an array of asteroids so I want to remove the bigger asteroid from the array and add two smaller ones in the same spot so what I can do is I can maybe have this function break up new asteroids return two new asteroids that are smaller but look the same and then what I can do is I can say asteroids dot push new asteroids so it's gonna add and then what I want to do is say Astra asteroids dot splice I comma one so what I want to do is I want to I'm gonna pause for a second because it looks like the chat is going totally crazy and I'm gonna see if I can do something to fix it so this is gonna be have to be because I think there's a way that I might be able to add I'm sorry about this everybody the chat looks like it's completely unusable and I'm gonna see if I can slow it down I think there's a chat slow mode so I'm yeah the chat is going crazy let's see let's see I cannot believe there are close to 3,000 people watching this right now that is completely insane I where I'm I believe there is a setting for the chat first of all a setting enable slow mode limit chat posts to every 60 seconds per person automatically block spam messages hmm let's try both of those this should now my changes are being saved so hopefully this is going to fix it Wow I guess I should be so lucky to have this problem okay I'm gonna give it a second to see if that does the trick as always I always forget to dis stop yeah by the way everybody in the chat is pointing out how that I should be a gem so I enabled slow mode slow mode by the way gives me some options sit 1230 already I want at least get to one more coding challenge let me just look at the settings again for the chat slow mode has an option that says limit chat posts to every blank seconds per person is there a and in this place yes is there a number I should put in right now it's at 60 let me know in the chat if it should be something different while the chats now back back in control okay anybody anybody I'm gonna look at my slack chat all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna just keep going 120 seconds I'm definitely not gonna make it higher 20 seconds okay I'd say 10 okay I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna overshoot it here I'm going to do 10 seconds I you know I can always raise it changes are being saved okay so I made it 10 and that looks like things are now a bit more under control this is amazing but I never imagined this would be my life Here I am you know I'm like burn or something years old I'm very tired all the time my voice hurts I've throat issues I take care of small children all the time but here I am on YouTube with all these people watching from all over the world and it's really thrilling and really fun for me and I really thank you guys I am gonna change the J okay but I want that to be in the video so I'm gonna go yes I'm going to go back hopeful I'm gonna try it with ten seconds now and see how that does I'm gonna go back to my slack alright okay I need to kind of get myself got some energy here and now I am going to be back in the video oops so by the way I'm using the wrong index here I goes with lasers J goes with asteroids so this has to be J and this has to be J as well okay so above so now this should work there's some issues here first of all I have to write this function breakup that generates two new asteroids so this won't work let's do that first so I need to go to the asteroid object and I need to write a function called this dot breakup equals function and I'm gonna say var asks new a for new asteroids is an empty array so what I need to do is I basically need to create two new asteroids at this particular location so this is an issue like the asteroids constructor function Ken does not receive any arguments I wanted to if it doesn't receive an argument create an asteroid in a random location if it does receive an argument create an asteroid at a specific location so I'm gonna add an argument pause here and I'm gonna say this dot pause equals pause let's see hmm um I'm just gonna say right now if pause this dot pause equals pause there I could be more efficient about this with like a an or kind of in the statement but just so what I want to say is if this constructor received an argument set its position to that position otherwise make a random position here's the problem though I don't want to just set the vectors equal to each other because they're objects and they will both actually point to the same object and things won't move properly so I need to make sure I copy this vector when I bring it in so this will create the asteroids at that location no there's a bunch more thing I need to add here but let's just see how that does okay so and then so what I need to do here is say new a index 0 equals new asteroid at this one's position and then a second one also at this one's position and then return those two so this should now give me two new asteroids whenever I hit one of them okay cannot read property X of undefined lasered I bet you up missing on this or a pause laser day a slide 18 laser J s line 18 whoa X of undefined oh okay I know what the problem is guess what I have now it's funny that that didn't work but what I've actually oh and I'm gonna have a camera camera cycled off have I really been going for an hour here this is a really long coding challenge should probably do this in multiple parts but it's too late you can look at my age on Wikipedia I think but the way those in the chat are asking know why I'm like it 43 okay so I think you know the problem is I would you get this old you forget I don't remember well if after 40 I remember what birthday I've gone past okay yeah yes so there's a there's a big there's a there's a whole bunch of problems here I need to I'm out this is it I'm in an edit point right now so I need to not do anything till I get back in it okay there's a big problem here which is that I'm looping through the asteroids and adding new asteroids at the same time so that's really a big problem because I I'm gonna like I'm adding some asteroids then I'm gonna check those and I might add some more asteroids then and check those so I really need to loop through the array backwards so that when I add stuff I don't check them again so I'm gonna start the loop at asteroids dot length minus one go all the way to J is greater than or greater than or equal to zero and J minus okay so that should help um the other thing I'm gonna do is I'm actually not gonna add them right now cuz I won't just go say console dot log new Astra new asteroids I'm getting some nice messages of tips in my chat ok so so I just want to see ok it's gone and I got and I'm seeing two new in the console so that's a good sign so I'm seeing two new asteroids and so I should be able to add those now but there's a problem when I add them the laser is going to be right there and it's gonna be intersecting with those two new and then it's gonna add two more so I'm gonna get too stuck the reason why confident as I could see this like recursive loop happening where laser hits asteroid laser disaster a laser is festering and it's gonna go crazy so fortunately what I need to do here is also loop through the lasers backwards I and then I also need to say lasers dot splice I comma one right I want to remove that one laser so let's see if that works now oops okay cannot read property hits of undefined so I think this is not working properly oh I forgot to push them in no where did that happen oh so many bugs sketch line 26 so my asteroids are undefined for oh the lasers are undefined for whatever reason because I'm removing it and oh look at this you know what this is kind of unbelievable but there's a problem here where I need to just break out of this loop I'm done with that laser so I so I need to just hit a break because I think I'm going back and checking things that don't exist anymore let's try that yes there we go so now you can see the laser and the asteroid goes away and now I should be able to push okay so I thought of that in my head you might be wondering what did I just do the problem is I'm saying lasers index I and then I delete that laser immediately but I'm still in this loop because there's a bunch of asteroids that I'm checking for each laser so I need to make sure I like get out of that asteroids loop because I'm done immediately so break will do that for me I hope that makes sense so now I should be able to say asteroids push new asteroids and we should see uh asteroid stop Index Ida render is not a function okay so I removed the asteroids and and I was which loop and my breaking out of I'm breaking out of so let's look at the asteroids array and see what it looks like and I need to have a bit more room here okay oh look at this so it doesn't do what I thought it would do I just thought if I called push and gave it an array it would add both of them to the array but it doesn't actually do that it added a fourth element which is an array which is two so how do I add an array I thought push would do that but I guess it doesn't concatenate if there's like I concatenate two arrays together function right JavaScript concatenate two arrays I could also just write my own little loop concat method so can cat takes one array and can cat sit with the other one okay so what I want to do this should work that I should be able to say instead of push asteroids equals asteroids dot can cat the new asteroids so merge those two arrays together oops I'm in the wrong place here we go let's see how if I get this to work oh right now it's splitting apart now here's the thing in addition to having them split apart they should get smaller so what I want to do is in the asteroids I should also optionally receive an R value and I should say if R and let's just have it always be divided by two so times 0.5 whoops I lost what I had there so if it's not receiving an R value it's a random value if it is I get R times 0.5 so now they should be getting smaller each time oops that didn't look like that worked okay I can't tell but this is a big one if you know what it is here's the other thing oh the offsets the offsets are always between negative 15 and 15 they really should be a function of the R itself it should be between negative this R and and positive this dot R so like the offset maybe also times 0.5 so it can't so the offset should because as they get smaller the offset shouldn't be as much I should probably just use scale why are they not getting much smaller let's see oh that seemed to work what am I missing here okay oh I I forgot to add it so I didn't actually pass in the vert the value so when I make the tube at new asteroids not only do I need you can't just like put something there and then forget to call it as I seem to do a lot this dot R this dot R do this for the so I don't I don't vein what still watching this but this that are this stock R okay so now that should get me what I want which is there we go they're smaller look at that each time I hit them they're smaller now I could also copy the offsets so the shapes are exactly the same but this is sort of close enough for me the other thing is once they get to a certain size they should just be removed so another thing that I should do is in sketch j/s is I should have some sort of threshold and I should say as long as asteroids index J dot R is greater than what's a good R let's say ten as long as it's greater than ten then you can do all this breaking up stuff otherwise increases score you know otherwise do nothing increase the score so I'm still always gonna remove the asteroid and the laser but I only want to like double it if there are actually should always be increasing the score because so whatever so I only want to do that if the asteroids are up greater than 10 so now let's try to play this a little bit 10 is really small but you can see they're gone after a certain amount I getting distracted by playing this game okay this is totally fun okay I think basically I've done everything now except for one thing I should probably add something where you die maybe not die you just start over do something different if the ship hits the asteroid and this will be the last feature that I'm going to add in this coding challenge okay so now what I need is somewhere out here in the asteroids loop I could say if ship dot hits asteroids index I then uh I'm just gonna consult I look I'm just gonna add a console dot log because I'm feeling tired this will be an exercise console dot log oops so I need to now add a function in ship which says this dot hits equals a function which expects an asteroid and I can also calculate the distance again between this pause X this type of dot y asteroid pause X asteroid pause Y and now now if d is less than I'm like losing my mind here this dot R right plus asteroid are so I'll just add the two like sigh you one's a triangle once a strange polygon this isn't exactly right but it's pretty close I'm gonna say return true otherwise return false and now here we go let's just see we're gonna look in the in the console if I died let's see if I can win this game I should probably test it sooner than later but I haven't died yet uh okay I'm getting hit so you can see that I'm getting hit so I've got something close enough I could change I should actually probably like drop change its color or something so we could sort of see some visual feedback but this is the basic game mechanic so remember here there I didn't go to challenge programmed asteroids in JavaScript using the p5 GS framework in the browser I would love it if anybody takes this game the code for this will be on github and I hope I might cry make a code pen out of it as well so look in this video's description you can find the code play with it tweet me a revision add stuff for me like what I need to do now because this as I mentioned at the beginning of this video this asteroids game is part one of a collaboration with Suraj Suraj has a YouTube channel who and makes videos about machine learning and I'm gonna pass this game off to him and he's gonna train a bot to play it and get a super high score so the bots gonna learn how to turn the ship push it shoot you know destroy all the asteroids so I need to add really just like a score mechanism and a live lives of mechanism so if anybody wants to volunteer to do that you can you can fork its code on github make some variations on it and I'll pass that off to Suraj and I'll see you in another coding challenge oh don't go anywhere I forgot something in the patreon chat on slack somebody points out my lasers array is getting just bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger this is a definite problem so I do need to do something which also says this videos not over you thought it was over I really should add something that says if lasers index I offscreen then also laser splice I index 1 so I'm gonna do that I'm gonna do that yeah I think if I just do that here that should be okay but if I've already removed it here that's fine I'm just checking the next one that's fine I think we'll see so I'm gonna now now I need an add a function and it's actually very similar to the edges function so I'm gonna look for like one of the edges function in like ship and I'm gonna go into laser and I'm gonna say this offscreen equals function if pause dot X is great I don't need any of this this dot R stuff just if it's greater than with this is probably more trouble and it's worth less than zero if it's greater than height or less than zero if any of these are true and I could put these together in or which maybe I'll do here so or this return it true if it's either one of these this is a really ridiculous way of writing this then also return true otherwise statistic today return false so let's now look at what I want to do now just to see that this is working is I want a console.log Lazer's dot length to see if that array is growing or shrinking so and also I think I have some extra weird console.log somewhere but that's fine so we should see there's zero lasers right now and does it get back to zero yeah now it's back to zero so you can see this is working great so now that laser array oops uh off screen of undefined ah sketch digest line 39 so ah if it doesn't exist because it possibly could have been removed here this is this is uh oh you know what I can just do is here and then I can break so if it's offscreen no no that's go to the next one don't bother otherwise there's got to be a better way to write this this is like this is like an hour into this video ah nobody's watching this anyway anymore so I got to think of a better way to do this but my brain has melted but so what I'm doing is I'm saying if it's off the screen get rid of it otherwise you can start to check at it check check against all these asteroids and that should fix that problem I don't know why my eye tubes opened people are gonna start complaining now that I'm using a Mac I get back get back up late a lot so now I should be able to say you know the lasers are now the array is not I'm trying to win this game ok you don't need to watch me play this game anymore I'll play it on my own time thanks for watching this coding challenge go and watch as soon as it's available there'll be a link in this video's description to Suraj's video where he trains a bot to play this game I'm super excited to see how that works and what happens and I hope to see you back in another video sometime soon thanks again ha oh my goodness does anybody this live stream has been going on for an hour and 35 minutes does anybody have any guess as to how long this coding challenge is gonna be perhaps probably an hour right it's 1250 I want to do one more thing today besides asteroids you know this is the classic thing one always thinks that something is going to take a quarter of that a tenth of the time than it actually does an hour yes ok so so so now I forget I need to record an intro to this video so the intro to this video is I'm going to have the game here and I'm gonna mention Suraj's channel so let me pull that up again think it's the rod it's gonna ride cause his music video trailer Siraj ology sera geology how do you think do you think that's how you pronounce it tell me in the chat sir ah geology ah so I'm getting a great suggestion in the so what I think I'm gonna do is actually break that in this video into two parts because I think an hour is a particularly long amount of time for YouTube video so I'm gonna record two brief introductions now we've been doing like a time travel thing and so the first one will be the Aster the ship and the asteroids and the second one will be the lasers and it'll just get edited as two videos okay here we go uh well I'm sorry I'm reading the chat kind of fascinating thanks out so what do you guys think sir Suraj is his name sir ah geology Suraj ology no we'll see okay here we go so I need to do these video intros now so first what I'm going to do is just like this image so I'm just gonna leave this here I should do oh I need a tissue blow my nose maybe I should mute my microphone while I do that no I think I got them asteroids disappearing after getting to a small size didn't I get that so by the way some of the chat asked can you do some coding from start to end for beginners so I hate to keep doing this but I'm going to just show you guys if you have never done any programming before and you want to sign it learn and get started I highly recommend these playlists here I don't highly recommend anything whoa scratch that I just sort of like cautiously with great trepidation sort of recommend these playlists so this is my playlist foundations of programming in JavaScript from the beginning so that's the one that I would take a look at okay so wait I'm recording these intros now so I just need this open and this open and actually what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make this full screen and I'm gonna play I'm gonna play my game okay ready this this video is now gonna start oh hello I'm trying to play this game asteroids right now so I'm coming to you from the future I just did a coding challenge where I programmed this exact thing with the p5.js library without any preparation or a lot of bugs a lot of problems it's the game asteroids it's missing a bunch of features but this is um I gotta do this again too much too much babbling put kittens in the background okay I wonder if I should be streaming on Twitch by the way twitch is like the place to stream right I'm I'm old so I don't know what's what I should be doing with my life anymore okay sorry there's a I'm gonna try this again hello I just programmed I just did a coding challenge and made this game asteroids and I want to in a moment you're gonna watch me do it from scratch if you want to keep watching this video the reason why I this is very awkward I've never done this before I'm having trouble figuring this house you guys are really are being very kind to bear with me here I'm gonna try this one more time yeah there's a lot of cringe here I'm all about cringe I have a cringeworthy person okay hi everyone I just did a coding challenge where I programmed this game from scratch using the p5.js library in JavaScript and in a moment I'm going to travel back into time and you're gonna watch that coding challenge this is the end result I'm doing this after I actually did it recording this part the reason why I'm doing that is I want to mention something to you I want to tell you about Suraj's channel Sirah geology suraj makes video tutorials about machine learning and now that I've done this coding challenge I'm gonna pass this game off to Suraj and Suraj is gonna train a bot to play it and get a high score now the game doesn't actually have the score features yet I'm going to add that in later so check this video's description and you'll find you'll find a machine learning thing that bet that was pretty good stopped with the pewpew you guys don't like the pewpew okay uh I shouldn't be looking at the chat okay wait I'm gonna I'm not gonna start over from the beginning because it's torturing you guys too much so I'm just gonna this will just get cut edited so check this video's description for a link to Suraj's video where the bots plays asteroids and hopefully plays it much better than I ever could so now I'm gonna go back at the time it starts this coding challenge which will happen in two part the first part will just be programming the asteroids and the ship and the second part will be the lasers tip you nobody likes that I'm saying pew pew pew in the chat they're really upset which is only making me do it more which is kind of a problem enjoy the video enjoy the coding challenge see you at the end or in the next one bye it's not gonna do what you do that again I don't know I wanted to just be like 10 seconds I'm gonna do the part two now okay I'm gonna do part two welcome to part 2 of my asteroids coding challenge if you watch the previous one I have I had a ship and I had asteroids but no pewpewpew lasers so in this particular second part of the coding challenge I'm gonna add the lasers which hit the asteroids and break them up into small pieces and don't forget if you're interested in a machine learning after I finished this video which I've already finished it's I don't know I've got some timetravel thing going on you can go to the link in the description to Suraj's channel where he has will have at some point soon a video word that trains a bot to play my asteroids game okay so enjoy part 2 of this asteroids challenge okay there will be two main reasons for downvotes pew pew pew and did it it did it I totally agree Mattia let me know if you think that'll do or if I should I can always redo that stuff later but I'm not livestreaming but I can't do anything if I'm not livestreaming alright so I think I'm done with this yeah I should really do cutie pie PPP any pie yes it'll do fine I think it's a ringing endorsement okay I don't watch PewDiePie actually but I did notice that PewDiePie had got 50 million subscribers and I have a lot in my mind way more than I ever expected but not that I have no idea how many is watching right now okay game of life has been requested so let me see here it's one o'clock I do have another half an hour I'm trying to think of what I can reasonably do did I really lose 500 viewers just by going pew pew pew did that did the viewer there's a graph I can look at it's just okay those of you are in the slack Channel the patrons in the slack Channel you should post your messages in the live channel I mean I guess I could be in general but I wasn't watching the the the live chat there's a graph I can look at okay I better stop so I'm in the live channel I can't watch general and live so if you want Matt be to read messages post them in the live channel yeah making them a twoplayer game would be great every so many okay so let's see so I had intended to do two more coding challenges today one was one about latitude longitude mapping stuff and another with pixel sorting there's a lot of requests for game of life which is kind of interesting so I'm trying to decide if I can manage to have enough time here let me give you guys a musical interlude as always I always forget to dis stop this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista the somebody composed that song for me I had a different it's fine I'm gonna use this I had a better sunflower image I think so I need an image for pixel sorting I'm just gonna use this sunflower image actually what am I doing here I want to make sure whatever I'm using is a creative commonslicensed image heavy on 'this sunflower so I believe this image public domain so let me use this one and save it as sunflower and and I want let me look at the adjust size here oh here I'll put on some more music for you guys SoundCloud I haven't added this to my I'm gonna if Suzy who came late I have a new remix I love people and people make remixes of like topics and weird little things I second to music you don't have to have me in it at all but music that I can play in the background and stuff so this is a new record like rainbows lost GH bear and paddle puffs this is also I don't know how many people are watching right now but I expect to lose many hundreds is there yes kids thank you kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I guess is somewhere I'm really losing my mind okay too loud okay sorry everybody sorry everyone I didn't realize it was too loud sorry about that let me fix that uh let me not worry about that right now okay not loud enough to silent kittens and getting some kittens all right all right all right let's put on some is this too loud if I put on the Perlin noise this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers buh uh oh ah this camera died it's back there we go oh and the zoom is gone ah Wirecast alright it's fine is that music too loud okay I'm back sorry everybody audio/video messed up yeah no I know I have all sorts of audio/video problems okay it's 104 I'm gonna attempt to do one more coding challenge I don't really have enough time for this but it's like it's definitely not gonna be Tetris I'm looking at the chat I'm gonna see if I can do a quick pixel sorting boom did you guys hear that I'm gonna I'm gonna try to do pixel sorting or asking for the game of life pacman and I want to do this in problem so first of all um this is processing processing is a Java based environment go to processing org setup and draw are the sort of control structures of processing a Java program would typically need a main program one of the things the processing does it look kind of like wraps what you write inside of a main program it kind of runs it for you when you hit this play button I can do things like say size 800 400 and I can say background 0 and I can have I can hit run and I have this sketch that has a blank background so what I want to do is I'm going to save this and call it pixel sorting I'm going to put it on the desktop and I'm gonna go to the browser this might not this might not go so well and okay so let's see images so pixel sorting refers to a particular algorithm where you take all the pixels of an image and sort them in a particular order or maybe brightness maybe hue so what I need to do to make this happen is I need a sorting algorithm and I need the pixel array then I need to rewrite the pixels in a different order yeah why not right so and so yeah I do want to do a tutorial at some point to show people how to use processing in Eclipse because that's also been requested a lot pixel snorting yes I have a little bit of coal which works ok so let me see if I can manage to do that before I go today even though this has already been oh it hasn't been 2 hours yet so I feel like I have two and a half hours it's kind of my limit although I do have this idea of doing a much longer more like allday livestream at some point okay let's see uh I so what I need right now is I need to set up a data folder and I need to put I really this is one I really should have planned ahead for and practiced so we'll just see how this goes I need to put it in the data folder and okay and I need I don't want to just quickly fix something so sorry I'm over here but hopefully you can still hear me I just need to fix something with this shot because it is that let's see if I can shoot I want to make it a little bit more zoomed in so you can see it better hopefully that should be a little bit better okay all right hopefully that's a little bit better because I might need to use your right okay where am i hiding sorry everybody Here I am okay so mmm I think I'll try sorting by brightness and sorting by hue and I want to try sorting all at once and also animating the sort and then I'll give some ideas for some other things you could do with it maybe I'll do a followup part to video okay how does that sound everybody so here we go I'm gonna do another coding challenge maybe I better cycle the cameras I believe I just did that but just in case I don't want this to take more than half an hour I'm sure it will okay people are asking for the asteroid code I will try to get that uploaded to github as quickly as I can today tweet at me at Schiffman and because the video itself might not get published for a couple days but you can tweet at Schiffman and I'll tweet you back with a link to the asteroids video or whatever I'll follow my Twitter out once it gets up I will not the asteroids code that is and you know one thing that Suraj does on his channel which is great is he kind of like has like a weekly competition that competition is maybe the word that I don't want to use but like challenge so I guess what I would say those of you who wanted like remix or make the asteroids game if you make a new version of it send it to me and I'll show some of those next week when I do a live stream okay okay here we go hello and welcome to another coding challenge and in this coding challenge we start over I don't know if the Bell is probably a cringe thing that people don't like I kind of like it but I'll stop it at some point if I hear enough people complaining okay hello and welcome to another coding challenge this challenge I am going to attempt something called pixel sorting and pixel sorting is an algorithm that takes all the pixels of an image or a video or anything and reorganizes them in some order may be ordered by brightness or ordered by hue maybe they spiral out from the center are they kind of get ordered across or up and down and you can see if you google an image search with pixel sorting you'll see a lot of artists and people making art and crazy projects with a pixel sorting algorithm so I am now going to try to ascribe to make pixel sorting in processing which is a Java based programming environment it looks something like this you can go to processing org to download it yourself and the one thing that I've got going here is in this the code is in a PDE file called pixel sorting PDE check this video's description for a link to the code I also have an image a JPEG in the data folder so you can use any image I've just grabbed off of Wikipedia an image of a sunflower and that's what I'm going to pixel sort so if first thing I want to do is I want to create a P image variable and then I'm gonna say image load image and it's sunflower dot jpg and then I want to draw the image image zero zero so I want to see here might the canvas that I'm you're gonna see is eight hundred by four hundred what I want to do now is have the raw image on the left and the sort of image on the right okay so I've got part one now here's the thing what I want now is another image called sorted and I want to create a blank image equals create image and I want it to be the same width and height and I want it to be an RGB image as the image so this in processing is how I load an image from the file here's how I create a blank image so now and so and let's just do something really quickly now all images oh look at this there's a weird bar here I don't know that's a glitch with my camera I'm just gonna have to live with it but all images the pixels we think of them is organized on a grid like here's pixel like 0 1 2 comma 0 1 that's pixel 2 comma 1 the computer stores all the pixels in a linear list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so to the computer this is actually pixel index 7 which is actually the 8th pixel because I started counting from 0 so and in processing I can look at all of the pixels of an image that array by saying the image dot pixels itself so I'm gonna come over here I also need to do something like say sorted dot load pixels this is kind of like a little announcement like hey I'm gonna look at the pixels now and I'm gonna say 4 I'm gonna write a for loop I equals 0 I is less than sorted dot pixels dot length I plus plus and I'm gonna say sorted in dot pixels index I equals a color random 255 so processing has a function called color and if you give it a single it'll make a nice grayscale color and we'll put in that pixel in that image and then I could say sorta update pixels I'm not doing the sorting yet I'm just showing you how this works so now if I in the draw function I say I drop the image and I draw both the original image and this quoteunquote sorted image which is now just random colors I should see this so we can see I have an image just loaded from a file and an image with pixels that I made up so now what I need to do is take all of these pixels and put them in this one to sort it so actually something that I could do right here is I could say image dot pixels index I and I could say image dot load pixels so now this is being manually one at a time copying every pixel from image into sort've here we go there are two sunflowers I love sunflowers do you love sunflowers tell me about your favorite flower in the comment and then you can all of you could write all cringe cringe this seems to be the thing that people write whenever I talk about flowers or kittens or puppies or rainbows or whatever but you know these things are nice things can we have nice things please okay so now I need try by the way of avoiding I'm like stressed out here and procrastinating I got to get to the sorting so here's the thing most programming environments will come with some kind of function to sort an array and Java is no exception even processing is no exception it has a sort function but the thing is I need to do something kind of custom here because this array is like this crazy array of colors and I want to like organize it it's their arbitrary numbers of color is an R a G and a B value and an alpha value sometimes so how I'm gonna sort it I've got to write the sorting algorithm manually sorting algorithms are the domain of people's PhD dissertations and lifetimes of study there's something called a bubble sort there's something called a selection sort there's even something called a quicksort and I probably for what I'm going to do could make great use out of a super fancy efficient fast sorting algorithm there's a great writeup I believe by Mike Bostock or the creator of d3 about anime sorting algorithms is how they work I'll link to that in this video's description but for what I'm going to do right here just to make things simple I'm going to implement a selection sort and so I think the way that I can do this right I have two arrays who you can't see all that I'm cut off but that's fine this is my first array I'm gonna look through the entire array for the brightest pixel when I find the brightest pixel I am going to put that over here and what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna have to you know what I need to do I actually need to copy the whole image because I need to rearrange the pixels while I'm sorting but I don't want to mess with the original pixels of the image so I'm gonna copy the whole image and let's talk about the selection sort again I think I realized you do this in a different way than I previously imagined I'm going to look at all the pixels of the image find the brightest one let's say this is the brightest one I'm gonna take this and put it in the first spot and take that first spot and put it there that's called a swap then I can start from here and now look for the brightest one and take that one and put it in the second spot then I can start from here and look for the brace one so I'm kind of looping through the entire array to find the brightest one to put it in the first part then I'm starting at the second the third the fourth so I'm always getting a smaller section of the array because the beginning and that will grow is the sort of sorted part so let's see if I can do that and one thing I can do by so this this is a way that I copied all the pixels just in case you're wondering I could actually I could actually I believe say sorted equals image get so that's a get is a function of processing that just gets a copy of the image let's see if that works great so that's a little easier than copying the pixels manually just so you see that's there and now what I need to do is I need a selection sort so let's think about how I'm gonna do this again I'm gonna say four and I do need sorted out load pixels I'm gonna say for int I equals zero I is less than image sorted sorted dot pixels dot length I plus plus okay so this is looking at every single pixel but for every single pixel I need to look at all the pixels that come after it so I need to say four and JE starting at I J plus J is less than sorted pixels dot length J plus plus okay right because I want to start again if I come back to that diagram I want to start at zero and look through all the pixels then I want to go to one and look through all the pixels then I want to go to two and look through all the pixels okay so that's what this nested loop is doing so the first thing you do is let me sort by brightness so I'm gonna say B equals the brightness well let live its first let's get a color pix equals sorted index J know sort of dot pixels index J that is the color at that particular pixel the brightness of that color you know I could compute it but processing has these nice functions that'll just it's just the average of the RGB values so I'm gonna get that brightness now what do I need I need to find the record brightness of any pixel for each time I do this so I'm gonna create a variable called record under set it to negative one right cuz no pixel can have a brightness less than negative 1 less than 0 so I want to say and then I want to have I'm gonna say brightest in you know I'm gonna do because I might change the algorithm I'm gonna say selected pixel equals equals I because I can start by default I'm going to start with the first one selected pixel equals I so what I want to do now and say if brightness is greater than the record then that's the selected pixel is now J and the record is now that brightness so this is like looking at every pixel from J to the end and see if it's brightness beats whatever previous brightest one I found storing it as a selected and storing a record so now once I finish this luke now an I do is swap selected pixel with I so I need to take whatever was selected as the brightest and put it in the eye spot and then whatever is in the eye spot stick it back somewhere else so how do I do this basically what I want to say is so wordid dot pixels index selected pixel equals sordid dot pixels index I and then sordid dot pixels index I equals sordid dot in pixels index selectable so this is this won't work by the way this is a problem so but but this is like a nice idea right I want to take what's in I and put it in selected pixel and what's what and what's it what's in selected pixel and put it in I here's the problem though and I actually I prefer to write it I don't know this is like kind of nonsense but I need to I need to feel like okay about things in life generally summaries I need I to be first that's just how I am I want to take what's in selected pixel and put it in I and what's an i and put into selected pixel the problem is I just over wrote what was in I so I've lost it so what I actually need is something like a temporary variable to store what's in sorted pixels index I and so that I can put that in temp didn't make any sense let me say that again I need to save what's in I because I'm about to overwrite what's in I so that I can grab it again and put it in selected pixel this is an algorithm for swapping two spots in the array and then once I'm done I think this is everything this should actually work I have no idea how long this is gonna take this is not a particularly efficient algorithm and this is this you know there's this thing called Big O notation that people talk about in like computer science of like how fast is an algorithm this is like an N squared algorithm because for every pixel I need to check every pixel so if there were just ten pixels I have basically got like a hundred checks but there's a hundred pixels I've got one zero zero zero zero 10,000 checks so I hope I did that math right so this is kind of with with with a 400 by 400 image there's going to be a lot a lot of pixels to check so let's run this and see what happens did it it it it dude it oh my goodness did that oh boy I have to wait here I hope this is working and I don't have a bug in my code that's making it stuff this might have to get edited I think this will get edited out it'll be like a it's like those cooking shows where they have to like wait for the thing to cook for an hour how big was that image to do to do this so let's let's run some tests here let me let me copy this and do let me make an image called small JPEG so we need to test this with something small dot JPEG and how and I'm gonna make this adjust size I'm probably gonna I'm gonna make this like 50 by 50 that should be totally reasonable and then what I'm gonna do is just draw it with a bigger width and height what's the chance of finished by now still hasn't finished or I'm gonna have to stop this and I don't know if if I think this is still good I'm off out of this challenge down just figuring something out I'll come back to it let's see if there we go okay so that happened really fast sorted by brightness so you can see that work demeans a little bit weird to look I want to sort it by hue I think but that just took way too long with 400 by 400 pixels let's see if I can get it to work with 200 let's see if I can get it reasonably to work with a hundred I'm just gonna keep doubling it it'll be take four times as long I just sighs tools at just sighs so I did it at 50 and now let's try it at 100 that wasn't so terrible it did I is it really a hund let me see hold on a sec did I do that correctly know what small that JPEG is 100 by 100 okay okay that worked now let me change it to 200 I don't see if that works let me try it one more time a small it's almost 130 I'm gonna have to go soon just size 200 let's try that let's see how this does this should take a little while there we go yeah that's not so much so I think 200 by 200 is kind of what I need to do right now so this is this works it just takes a really long time I'm gonna animate it in a second which we can watch and then we can let it run for hours and watch it but this is that's pretty good so I'm gonna go back into the video now and I'm just going to today really just not was I impatient is it really should just take four times as much time each time if I double the size and that took how long did that take one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand five one thousand six one thousand seven one thousand eight 1,009 1,010 1,011 1,012 one thousand 31,000 41,000 so that took 14 seconds so it should take it's gonna take like a full minute if I make it 400 by 400 but I think 200 by 200 is pretty good I'm gonna just change the size of the actual window back to smaller just to like keep it so and I'm gonna I'm gonna change the name of this just for I want to keep that original image and I'm gonna say Sun flower that JPEG put this back ok I'm going back into the video this will get edited back yes okay I'm back that took a really long time because it takes a really long time there's 400 times 400 pixels there's a lot of pixels to sort so this I'm going to have to I sample the image down to a 200 by 200 image which I think it can sort it in Java in about 14 seconds so I'm gonna run that now and you can see the windows a little bit smaller but I'll zoom into it one one thousand two one thousand dicta to come on pixel sort come on to the pixel sort cringe that's what you do while you're watching you complain type in the comments there you go so you can see this now sorted every pixel horizontally by brightness let's see if we can sort it by hue which I think will be interesting to try okay so instead of looking at the brightness why don't I look at the hue so processing has a function called hue which will give me B hue value of a particular color so I can actually look at that and I believe this should take just about the same amount of time do the pixel sort by hue do the pixel sort thank you this could get edited out maybe someday too and it could just up here so you can see look at that this edited nicely by hue and so you can see I have all of these sort of like orangie colors at the bottom yellow colors were getting this nice sort of palette so this is pixel sorting now the thing is I'm just doing sort of like the raw basic algorithm you should take this code find willing to get up and be creative with it so first of all you should think about what's it different what's another way you could imagine sorting the pixels besides just brightness or hue here's another thing I'm just ordering them horizontally what if I order them vertically or what if I order them spiraling out from the center are coming in from the edges what types of other strange what if I only sort part of the image and you'll see lots of art if you GU again if you google image search pixel sorting art you'll find a lot of creative examples of this and I hope you make something and send it to me but before I go I want to add one more thing to this because it takes so long I think it would be interesting to watch it sort animate the sort so in other words the sorting happens right here this is the so I'm going to save this and I'm gonna save a new version called pixel sorting animation so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna the processing has a draw loop right it's actually drawing this stuff over and over again I did all of the sorting and setup and was finished but what I want to actually do is do the sorting in draw so everything single time through draw what I want to do is sort but instead of having a loop draw is already looping so I if something that can become a global variable I'm gonna call it index set it equal to zero I don't need this anymore I don't need that outer loop anymore it's gonna do one one pixel per frame of animation so the selected pixel is index J starts at index and then whoops and then I swap at index index and then what do I do I say index plus plus and I should also check if index is greater than or equal to sorted pixels dot length you know I don't want the I can't spell like how do you spell length oh my god if it's greater than length minus one I could if it's as long as it's less than length minus one I can increase it by one okay so now let's run this you can see like it's very very slowly you can see it kind of sorting up there right I'm zooming all the way and it's happening very very slowly sorting by hue now again this is such a tiny resolution image that we're barely seeing it now I can actually let me go with the larger image I'm gonna change this to 800 by 404 hundred a higherresolution sunflower and I'm going to I just need to change where I'm drawing it at 400 comma zero so now we can run this and I can sort of see here there it is you can see it sorting the pixels now here's the thing I'm doing one pixel at a time per frame I think it would be much nicer if I at least did a bunch so I'm gonna actually just write a little loop inside of draw to say hey whatever I was just doing do that like I don't know 100 times 100 times is not that many there's a lot of pixels so and so I'm gonna put that like so I'm only doing a hot now I'm doing a hundred pixels at a time and let's see what that looks like is it going any faster let's let's try let's try a thousand pixels at a time ooh that's so a thousand pixels is actually quite slow per frame so I think I've kind of lost one thing I want to look at is what the frame rate is so I want this to run I want to do the most amount as I can the most amount of pixels I can but still be running it like 30 frames per second which I'm clearly not so let's do it at 100 and we can see whoa why is this so slow you know what's the load oh you know it might be the problem no anyway I need to I'm gonna I'm gonna up update this it's very CPU heavy and it's just very slow I you know I think there could be some more creative ways I could think about animating this we could let this run for a little while and see how far it gets but for example all right so this is now animating at 30 frames per second which is quite nice and doing like 10 pixels at a time and you know it's doing 30 frames per second so that's 300 pixels per second still gonna take a very long time to finish the whole thing but there might be some other creative ways like this might actually look more interesting if I didn't draw the original image and you just saw the pixels getting filled in the one the ones that have actually been been swapped or I might like if I was doing it out from the center so I'm sure you will come up with some creative riffs off of this please share them with me in the comments share them between Twitter share them with me on Twitter at Schiffman I hope you enjoyed this coding challenge in processing about pixel sorting you could do this at very high resolutions it'll take a long time to render but then you can export it out as an image or something and make a big print and let me know if you make something and I'll see you again in a future video good bye okay so I'm gonna let this run for a little while longer just cuz I'm kind of curious but I think I am finished for today is 130 p.m. this livestream has gone out out for 2 hours and 20 minutes I can see maybe if I have time for a couple questions it's not actually sorting is it not sorting you know look at that it doesn't look like it's working what did I mess up it's doing something kind of interesting weird I might have to come back and do an addendum what did I mess up here does anybody see J equals I plus 1 where's that because if I put it in the index no cuz it'll start at the next one the next time around right what did I miss you're just swapping the pixels right but I should I should look through okay let's lift think about this I should look through the entire thing start at Jay get the hue if it's greater than the record that's selected and that's a new record I should do that oh the swap is in the wrong place I messed that up I got to come back for that video right the swap is totally in the wrong place which is also why it made it really really slow okay hmm I don't know if I should rerecord the whole thing I think I'll just come back as an addendum what I'm trying to think I think I'll I don't know how this can get edited back together as the coding challenge let me think why are people talking about dabbing the chat that's pretty funny all right I'm gonna make an addendum but it does give a kind of interesting result actually and it is running out 60 frames per second because it's getting closer to the end so it's like much much faster as it gets further along hey guess what everybody I'm back look at this that doesn't look right I'm getting this interesting strange smear but it's not actually sorting the reason why it's not actually sorting is I didn't notice when I move stuff around to animate it look where the swap is happening the swap is happening inside this J loop I want to look through all the pixels find the brightest or the ones with the highest hue and at the end of that swap it's oh I just had like a typo essentially where this closing bracket is in the wrong place I need to close that J loop here and now it should actually sort by hue okay so now we should see something more correct so I had that mistake and you can see now that this sorting is actually happening correctly now what I'm wondering is if having the swap inside was somehow making it also run slower and if I could actually manage to have it run faster yeah that's still pretty slow it will slowly gain speed over time because as it gets further along oh you can't actually see my framerate I just noticed as it gets further along mmm as it gets further along this is the framerate here as it gets further along it has fewer pixels to check because it's getting further and further into the image and you should see that framerate go up and up and up and up and up but you can see now that the sorting is actually now happening correctly and it actually is sorting by hue again I'm you know by hue is not necessarily the well so the most I there are lot so I think this is a challenge to you is like I just picked you and I just picked brightness as arbitrary numeric indicators of a pixels value as a single number but you might think about other ways of thinking about how could you order those pixels and so I'm gonna let this run for a while and hope you enjoy it and also you know you could pick a different image than the then the sunflower you can mess around with how you're sorting it I'm sure you'll come up with something creative and I'll see you in a future video I think this might really be the end goodbye okay so I'm gonna let this run I want to you can see all the green colors are at the top and hopefully it should get much faster eventually you know you could do this in like a shader or something they're probably much faster okay I adapt oh my goodness it's almost 2 o'clock about 2 o'clock I'm gonna be late for the next thing and I've got to upload these files and figure out where to go I'm just curious how many people are watching this right now oh my god there are still 1,800 people watching which is nuts so if any of you want to try to ask a couple questions in the chat I can see if I can answer just one or two questions before I go and I know this sort of impossible to do and I cuz I want to sort of let this run see it get to the end and I'm looking at the chat now and I'll answer a couple questions and then I'm gonna be gone so this look full live this full archive will be uploaded to will be available on YouTube soon you know later today or sometime tomorrow I also will release the individual video the asteroids coding challenge will get released as two separate videos edited and then also this pixel sorting video will get released as a video as well so there'll be standalone video tutorials that will get released sometime in the next week I will be back on next week for another livestream I don't know when yet oh and I'm doing something exciting let me mention this so I teach I had a program it's called ITP it is that New York University here is ITP website I can't see what I'm doing right now cuz I moves my preview here so come on ITP website I said I was gonna answer questions and I can't see them right now so ITP has a show events let me do ITP at NYU ITP at NYU dot edu slash show I believe this will get me there so this is the winter show these are the faces of many lovely ITP students look there's me with like I don't know I like left gray hair somehow even my picture was recent so the winners show is this Sunday and Monday December 18th and 19th in New York City it is open to the public if you live in the New York area and come by I'll be there say hi but what I'm hoping to do is make a video of projects on Monday edit it together and post it to the YouTube channel so if you're interested by what students are making with processing p5 Python openFrameworks C++ Arduino there binds you know the technology actually the thing I just did the remote the worst thing ever because the ITP show is not about what the technology the students are using it's about the people and the ideas so I'm hoping to make a video about different projects and I'll release that sometime next week so you can get a sense of things that are happening here in New York at ITP I'm gonna look I'm sorry I'm having trouble seeing the chat okay so people are writing nice things so will I do ray casting that sounds really hard I don't know will I go on a tour I if I could do that I definitely would what should we come on Sunday or Monday Sunday's typically a little bit less then Monday can I make a flight simulator that is an excellent idea how did I get into programming actually I was a student at ITP in 2001 is when I started and I kind of got into programming at ITP I didn't start working with processing until 2003 when JT nimoy introduced processing in a workshop at ITP and also I meet potaro taught a class at ITP and show the flower oh yeah show the flower yes yes those let's take a look at it we can't only this it's sorted it so you can see that's quite lovely actually it almost looks like a Rothko painting or like a landscape that's quite nice actually I'm new to this channel what is this channel all about so this channel is about coding it is about having fun with coding making creative ideas expressing yourself through coding I in my sort of small world I happen to work on open source projects called processing and p5.js so those are the platforms I typically use if coding is totally new to you and you want to learn more about it you can look for oh shoot when you go to the channels homepage you can look for this is the beginner playlist for starting learning JavaScript and p5 from scratch and this is the beginner playlist for learning processing from scratch so both environments are great for different reasons and a lot of these coding challenges or people have kind of glommed on to recently I'm getting a lot of views on them but these really expect they might be interesting to watch hopefully but I'm gonna assume a lot of knowledge in this so I have like 400 or 500 videos online I have some connect to toriel's other things too ah you said you'll show the astroid games and modifications but when and where do we submit them this is a great question I I'm not used to having this large of an audience I'm not saying that this is that large of an audience but for me it's it's like you know um 10 to 20 times larger than it usually is so typically what I ask people do is just tweet me a link to what you made add to at Schiffman on Twitter what I think I'm gonna do is I'm make the asteroids game its own github repository and that way if people want to fork it and create a version of it you can you can kind of you know again you have to Oh musically I if you don't know about get get up you can watch these videos but um that's one way you could share it with me I also have a slack channel for patrons I think I might see if I can do I don't know I need to think about this because I don't I don't love the idea of having like a closed thing but right now the way that I started trying to get a little funding for the channel and now I there is a you know with large amount of views it's a little you know I could be more flexible about this but but I have a slack channel where I also answer questions and discuss code with a group of people who answer questions in much better ways than I do and that you can join by going to a patreon.com slash coding rainbow again that's a oh that's the old name of the channel it's gonna change at some point soon and so here you can become a patreon and that by becoming a patron that gives you access to the slack channel but I'll think about if maybe it makes sense to to think about in a different way for people to submit and ask questions beyond that as well okay so it is 145 it's okay I'm looking at the chat to see if there's anything else that I can actually answer what is the difference between Java and JavaScript great question they sound like they might be the same not the same at all Java is a programming language an environment that was developed in the 80s Java it's like funny it's like two and a half hours into this I'm like Oh answer that question and then my brain is like melting and seeping out of my ear java wikipedia let's look at let's look at the job of wikipedia page this is like answer a question i will just reach i was curious when java was originally history initiated in 1991 so i don't know why i said the 80s so java as a project started many many years ago one of its innovations was being crossplatform so Java doesn't actually turn into like computer code directly you have to run something on your computer called a Java Virtual Machine and so you could write the same code that could run on Windows or Mac or Linux but so but in the context that I use it processing the environment that I did the pixel sorting is built on top of Java and so Java is great for like desktop application development and it runs very fast there's it's like tons of libraries for processing ways to extend it javascript is a much is is not is a more informal language and it's the it's it's it's kind of a ubiquitous language these days but the reason why I use it is it's also the language of a web browser for so for things I just want to run on my computer locally and maybe for an installation or a full screen application I'm generally using processing if I want to have something run in a web browser I'm gonna write that code in JavaScript because a browser can read and interpret JavaScript onthefly and animate and do stuff and so p5 is a JavaScript library so I write the code in JavaScript using the p5 library processing is a Java library I write the code in Java using the processing library processing is also a development environment p5 does have a development environment but I as you saw I'm just using like a regular old text editor now that's kind of inadequate answer to the question what was sort of the best I can do under after having like a coded live on the internet on YouTube for two and a half hours there was something else I wanted to say about JavaScript I think javascript by the way with called JavaScript because at the time Java was like a super cool language so that sounds a little bit like that a star would be a great yeah JavaScript can be used with no dot yes for a desktop or server side development and I use that in a lot of my challenges and tutorials Paperchase there's also a great framework for JavaScript people are asking about a twoplayer game I will at some point try to do Conway's Game of Life I do have a game of life video already I don't think I program it from scratch but I go through it and show the code so if you just search on youtube Schiffman game of life you'll probably find it and p5 is not that different than vanilla JavaScript it's got just a layer on it for doing the sort of canvas drawing in a simpler way that's similar to the processing syntax and API and then there's also a Dom library in a sound library by the way I should if you add sounds to that that anyway there's lots of stuff you could do I stream once a week I do plan on doing some machine learning tutorials Suraj is gonna and is gonna make a machine learning tutorial with the asteroids game on his channel okay so I've got to go now this has been 2 hours and 34 minutes thank you guys so much for watching I really appreciate it and I'm gonna just like turn some things off here I appreciate you appreciate the support I appreciate all the feedbacks the comments the good ones the bad ones the constructive ones all your comments are welcome and appreciated hope to see you next week in another livestream I hope to that we'll check out the editing videos that get published subscribe and like and all that stuff tweet at me if you have feedback or ideas I'm at Schiffman and I am going to go okay so here I am I have to turn this off I don't want to say goodbye this is a lot of fun for me and I hope you enjoyed I hope you learned something I hope maybe expanded your buying I hope it made you feel relaxed and happy but I also hope in addition to programming you go outside you enjoy people you do something nice for somebody and do something nice for the world and don't think about code it's just technology and writing code that you do by yourself think about is something that you make stuff for other people to help the world and do some good and share that with me and I'll be thrilled and excited and happy about it okay so ah so by the way if you want to get announcements about my livestream schedule I guess I will mention that so you are asking in the chat I do send out also email alerts you can sign up here and it's at some point I'll try to establish a regular schedule but for now it's it won't be next Monday or Tuesday to show so the next livestream will be Wednesday Thursday or Friday next week okay holidays at least here okay you good night good morning good afternoon wherever you are and I do tweet also always when I scream okay see you soon goodbye oh I'll play you out with the intro video yeah you want to I don't know if you want to I'll just say goodbye no I'll put you can turn it off okay I'm gonna play my intro video people yeah I'll answer one more question if you're looking for the processing where you find the processing functions and this is the pressing website and things like you are here in the reference so these were all like the color functions I was using are here on the reference in your crossing to org slash reference and for p5.js same thing under reference you can see there's a lot of the same functions hue there it is right so all these functions are listed in the reference okay see you soon show the flower the flower was done there it is up the songs over goodbye did you think that learning coding would be really rough throw your hands up in the air and say it nothing do you wasn't learn to code and make some awesome stuff whether you're a power this is already Burnie overarching as your guide make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect your face you can make it jump to Lightspeed into outer space you can generate a maze that can go on for days you can make your own terrain and some purple red you can make a retro game to see how it's done and then tweak some pieces to make it yours for everyone make some freshly trees or Twitter
