there we go aha okay I should be now live I didn't realize that that wasn't happening automatically um is this working can anyone hear me can you see me I think you can I see can see me now if you are on this page watching can you hear my voice speaking you could type in the chat I'm looking at the chat down here so far I have no independent confirmation that the audio is working but I do see some green bar moving up and down yes very clearly okay uh how uh so hi I am setting up a new video recording studio I look forward to announcing where I'm setting that up soon but I'm not sure yet if I'm ready to do that um as you all know I like to make video tutorials as you all know I don't know if you all know this but um as you might know my name is Dan uh I like to make video tutorials about programming uh I have a list of topics that I'm going to do but this is really just a test I'm seeing it here um there are 10 people watching this test so I you know while I'm here testing if anybody has has any questions about processing or p5js general questions about life the universe you can ask them now I'm probably going to turn this off in in a couple minutes and then I'm going to maybe wheel in a whiteboard here try to hook my laptop up and then actually do like a short video tutorial but I was just testing to see if this the internet connection is good enough here to live stream and uh if like the camera would work and all that in this different setup so I'm just looking at the chat here you probably I'm also want to see about how much the delay is so I'm going to um I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a very obvious gesture which I can then see myself do because I've got a a view of the YouTube stream and I can count about how long that tested so what I'm going to do is I'm going to put the my arms above my head like this now I'm going to count I'm 1,000 2 1,000 3 1,000 4 1,000 5 1,000 6 1,000 7 1,000 8 1,000 91,000 10 1,000 so it's about a 10c delay so you're seeing me about 10 seconds after live what is the keyboard shortcut to comment multiple lines in p5js well I assume you mean the p5js desktop editor um obviously you can program JavaScript using any number of environments you can just open up Sublime Text there's web editors you can use but if you're using the desktop editor I believe it is command slash uh okay someone asked about 3D models in processing how do you import a 3D model into processing I'm going to the processing website and I'm going to the you can't see this I'm about to hook up so you can see my laptop but I this was just a test of equipment uh I'm going to the libraries page see I have a laptop here you can see uh 3D uh geometry maybe um well there is actually the um you can use pshape um um the pshape object will load an obj but there is also there was an obj uh yeah obj obj there is a lot for processing that you could look into that was one question in the chat you need a library probably to do that okay where I'm looking here oops I have audio coming here uh just bought connect okay here's another question I'm answering just bought connect version two any suggestions about open CV and connect version 2 with CP C++ well I am not probably the right person to answer that question but I would certainly recommend looking into using open Frameworks uh so open Frameworks is a C++ framework for Creative coding um it's uh amazing for do it if you want to work in C++ and one of the great things about working in C++ it's kind of native immediate access to a lot of computer vision libraries that are written in C++ and so open CV and connect stuff you can kind of do it all with that so that's what I would recommend okay next question how do you feel about Jamie Allen getting a PhD well completely against phds as a philosophical stance um but Jamie Allen is a wonderful person and if he wants to get a PhD then I I I I will make an exception here and think that sounds like a wonderful idea uh recommended readings on genetic algorithms okay that's a good question um so uh I probably started um one of the first things first places I encountered genetic algorithms is in the book The computational Beauty of nature by flake is the last name of the author I Gary flake maybe William flake I think it's Gary flake um they're here because on the natureof code.com I believe I have a page page under uh SL book which is further reading and there uh uh evolutionary design by computers is a good reference uh Peter Bentley I'm sure I have computational beauty of nature here on this page um another uh something that I'm thinking of is the um yeah Carl Sims papers there's two sigraph papers artificial Evolution for computer graphics and evolving virtual creatures these are both great references to look at okay next question this is fun just like question and answer session um okay there's no more I answered all the questions I so so the next thing I'm going to do I'm here is I'm gonna um I'm probably going to turn this off in a minute I'm G to hook up my uh laptop to see if I can get my laptop feed going into the live stream might sort of move these lights around a little bit so it's less shadowy I might get a whiteboard Bo um but ultimately uh next week my plan is to start uh doing regularly scheduled live broadcasts Tuesdays and Fridays twice a week um I have a list of I'm gonna paste this into the chat uh I have a list of uh I have a markdown file here I'm pasting this in this is my list of sort of topics I'm looking to do one of the first things I want to do is a whole set of tutorials on just git and GitHub uh for the and really without source code or programming involved whatsoever so what does it mean to write a poem and then have that poem sort of exist in the world of git and GitHub so um that's one of the first things I want to do is a set of tutorials U I was just rambling to see if more people would ask questions but I don't think there are somehow there's 18 people watching this which is kind of amazing uh MIT uh somebody somebody else posts that another um genetic algorithms reference is an MIT tutorial um okay okay I got to get put a get a desk in here that's a little bit higher so I not like bending down to look at this laptop okay this was an 8 minute broadcast I of quite of enjoying this but I see no reason to continue unless somebody has an idea I know that you're 10 seconds behind me so I'm going to wait about 10 seconds to see if there's any more questions otherwise I'm going to turn this off and hope to be back um relatively soon with u maybe an actual lesson where I will then be able to switch from me talking to you seeing my laptop screen and we'll I'll do I'll pick some programming problem to do as kind of a test lesson okay um thanks everybody for watching from this secret location I'm in an underground bunker there's walls but uh I look forward to talking more about this location that I'm in and I'm very excited to spend some time at and um and making more video tutorials okay ah Zack liberman Hello nice to see you Christopher a ke can I tap dance I actually cannot tap dance I could try to tap dance but I'm not going to okay um all right so I'm I'm I don't I forget how to turn this off I have to figure out how to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna uh uh give you guys a little clue into what I'm doing here so right now uh I'm on the laptop here I've got a view into my um let me zoom into this maybe you can see it hello uh oh there we go I have a big red button here I don't know if you can see this when I click this red button it should turn off the stream but that took me a few more seconds I'll check to see if there's any more questions whoops uh where am I here looks pretty dark yes uh I am hoping to purchase or acquire some uh LED lighting that I'm going to use right now there's just some clip lights in the underground bunker so it is dark there's a shadow uh I also need to fiddle with the camera white balance aperture I don't know any of this stuff it's pathetic but I'm going to fiddle with it it's a camera it has dials and buttons I will press those and turn those to see if I can make it look better okay that's definitely the end I'm going to do my dramatic uh click of the button I'm going to click this button over here which will turn off the stream and I will be back uh tweet at me if you have any ideas for something I might answer or do later today okay goodbye
