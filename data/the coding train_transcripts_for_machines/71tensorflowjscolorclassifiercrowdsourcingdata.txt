all right welcome to a new session of intelligence and learning tutorial compilation thing so this session is going to be a series of videos and I'm going to build a classifier so what do I mean by build a classifier now I've done this before I have some video tutorials where I did a doodle classifier and this is somewhat similar and I'm also going to redo the doodle classifier with a convolutional neural network that's coming but here what I want to start with is a very baseline of just doing classification now in order for me to do a classification example the full story from training testing to deployment of a machine learning model to classify some data I need to first think about data now what I'm going to do in this series is use a trivial data set address a data set that really doesn't have much of a point of view that's not particularly meaningful I just want to show you the full story of how all the pieces work together when I kind of get to the end of this series I'll talk to you a bit more of what where you might find your own data sets how you might collect your own data and sort of think about where you might take this but you know I can't emphasize enough that the data the data that you're using in the data that you're not using is the primary most fundamental piece of all of this if you you know if you just want to try out the algorithm what I'm doing is just fine but if you actually want to build something that classify studying in the real world there are a lot of questions you should ask yourself starting from the very first one is should you be doing this in the first place like is what you're doing good or is it causing harm who's being left out of the data there's lots of really important critical questions you want to think about so putting that aside we'll come back to it at the end the data set that I'm going to use I'm just going to make a color data set so and I'm gonna crowdsource this from you the viewer by the time you're watching this I might have already finished all the crowdsourcing but there'll be links in this video's description it's where you can find the various elements so I'm going to create essentially a spreadsheet it's going to have four columns red green blue and then label so each record each req data point is going to have three values like 255 0 0 and if label is going to be something like you know red ish then I might have 0 255 0 and its label would be green ish so I'm again this is what I mean by totally trivial I am labeling colors into a certain number of buckets reddish greenish yellowish bluish purplish orangish grayish brownish something like that and and I'm gonna have this massive data set won't be that big but a big data set and it's going to learn from this labeled data how to take a new color right there are millions of possible colors 256 to the third power and automatically label it according to what human beings generally think of those colors in those certain categories so this is what I'm going to build so this first part of the video series is just about me figuring out how to collect this data and so the way that I'm gonna do it is I'm gonna make a p5 sketch that shows a random color and gives you a little dropdown menu or a multiplechoice thing so like pick which category and hit submit and it gets saved in a Google sheet and that Google sheet will be this spreadsheet that then I will then use later to load and feed into tensorflow js2 train a model to learn to classify RGB colors according to some set of labels now I would have mentioned that this this idea comes from some work that Hannah Davis is doing here researching at ITP around data and crowdsourcing data she is actually making data set around landscapes and tagging those landscapes with sort of what you might expect field ocean whatever tags you might expect anyway but also thinking about could you have emotional landscapes could you have a data set of landscapes these are landscapes that sort of that that embody the concept of fear or or joy so that might be something you start to think about what kind of creative labels could you apply fixed set of labels to colors there's interesting possibilities there so you might make your own creative version of this but I'm gonna start with something very trivial and exactly as sort of written out here okay so let's go back and I've got a p5 sketch here that I started with nothing in it and I want to add so the first thing I want to do is just pick a random color it's gonna be like the simplest thing ever so I'm going to and by the way I could use a Google Form I could use something a service that that I can pay people to label data like Mechanical Turk or CrowdFlower maybe I'll try to look at some of those in another video but right here I'm going to sort of custom build my own thing and so I am what do I need to do I'm gonna I'm gonna pick up a random a random red value between 0 and 255 then I am going to and I want to floor it because I kinda don't want to deal with floating point numbers there's not really a reason for me to do that and then I want to then I want to show it so I'm gonna say background are RGB and then I am going to what do I want to do now I'm gonna say dropdown equals create select and then I can add options to the dropdown like this let's just see if this works whoops blue fish red fish green ish okay so let's just see what this looks like so now if I go to the browser and look at this sketch and we can see here I've got my dropdown and every time i refresh the page I see a new color and then I can add also submit equals create button submit and submit dot mousepressed submit you know send data and then I can write a function called send data where I am going to send this data to something okay so this is the basic idea we don't need this to be so big there we go so this is what I want each time i refresh this page I'm going to pick a label and I'm going to hit submit and it'll hopefully do suss put that data somewhere where is it going to go I want it to go to this spreadsheet so I want to see the RGB and values and the label end up in this spreadsheet then I'm gonna turn it over to you all and I'm going to get lots of lots of lots of data that I can then use for training the model okay so I need to put this data somewhere I'm actually going to do that in the next part and do that in a separate part I am going to use a service called firebase which I have a whole set of tutorials about so if you want to learn a lot more about firebase I'll link to those tutorials in this video's description but I'm just gonna kind of jump right in and quickly like you know make a firebase project and send all my data there from this p5 sketch so but before I go a great great point was made in the chat that this is particularly oops where am i this is a particularly awkward interface especially if I only get to do one I probably should make this that I could like do like five colors all at once but let's say I only get to do one it can be really annoying to have to use this dropdown so one thing I could do is do create radio and then I'll just rename this and in p5 this is a p5 a Dom creation function that I believe should change this to this and you know again the layout here is a little bit awkward I will think about fixing that up but now we can see here the idea here I'm gonna pick blue and hit submit I'm gonna pick reddish bluish and hit submit okay so I just need to you know take this function send data and send the data to firebase and that's what I'm going to do in the next video okay so the next video I'm going to send the data to firebase I'm gonna then upload this somewhere and let those of you who are watching this live give me some data okay see you soon
