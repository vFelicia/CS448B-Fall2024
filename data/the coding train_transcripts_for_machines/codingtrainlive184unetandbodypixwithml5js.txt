I think you should hear me now have you don't see me but you hear me I have a new button that mutes and unmutes my microphone and in a moment I have a button it switches to the camera that I'm in and this song ends in about 14 seconds 1305 county waitress flows six five four three two and you're on do you see me do you hear me is it Monday no Tuesday I don't know what day it is I do it's Tuesday welcome to the coding train feel like it's speaking very loud and people in the hallway are going to listen and hear me and I feel embarrassed hmm so this is unusual that I'm here on a Tuesday I missed Friday I'm having a hard time if I'm being totally honest here's the good news I have I've setup I've worked very hard with a lot of people's help I can barely take any credit for this but I have a new studio that I am live broadcasting from and soon I'm hoping to make the studio available for other people in particular to the NYU community because this is a room that's at NYU where I broadcast my other separate thing independent take the coding trade it's very complicated so studio is going well I have new buttons I can mute my microphone watch this I can I have this button that makes my laptop disappear but look isn't that weird look at that that is crazy but so if I you need to like type in a secret password look at that okay and then I can make myself disappear there go now if I just need to show you the screen there we go I feel like the focus might be off a little bit I def I need I I'm gonna get I'm going to get someone to come help me with tuning the cameras a bit focus white balance that sort of thing I know also these lights reflecting in my glasses I turned them a little bit so maybe that's a little bit better I don't know I do but so things are good this is what I was saying things are good in that the studio seems to be working all that sort of stuff but I'm having trouble getting sort of regular schedule going so today was like a target of opportunity I have a round till 1130 a little bit past 1130 free so I thought I would try to do a live stream I missed last week so I'm gonna try to do two this week I my goal is once a week but one of the reasons why I've actually had a little bit of trouble livestreaming find a live stream and this this may fill you with joy or it might disappoint you I have no idea but I have a new video that hopefully will be out later this week that I that I should that I did a coding challenge in that was not from the studio and it's back from a different secret location then I will not say anything more about when the video comes out you will see this new secret location I don't have the capability of livestreaming from there so it was recorded and then edited but I hope to be doing these new this new style of video in addition to the live stream so not replacing but in addition and let's see how that goes so I look forward to when that comes out later this week I don't being very vague about it I look forward to hearing your feedback I will provide a sneak preview to this video in our coding train member and patron slack group so if you're thinking about wanting to join if you want to see a video like 24 hours earlier than somebody else I don't know why that's a thing now would be the time to do so I'm also planning to I'm looking a little on the bright side it says alka but i'm looking sharp thank you see the problem is when I look at the chat I lose my train of thought it's a sad life it's so sad ah I will have some new announcements about the rewards program for men coding training members so I'm revamping that I've got some new ideas that are kicking around some new stuff will be launching so hopefully you're hear about that later this week are next week and just on cue we have a new member Aaron B so welcome Aaron beam now oh no I haven't implemented this yet soon there there's some new some new tools in the YouTube membership thing I shouldn't go on too long about this because most of you are just you're watching and you don't want to hear me talk about the membership stuff but once you join there should be information about how to get your slack invite and all that sort of stuff it might not have shown up for you but we're fixing up that stuff and hopefully by the end of this week that we'll be in better shape okay so let me just first before I go off into my rambling nonsense my goal for today is to do two tutorials on two functions one tutorial on each function there's two functions one tutorial for each that makes two in the ml5 jazz library if you're not familiar with ml 5 Jas now is a good time for me to open up my web browser and tell you the ml 5 GS is a friendly machine learning library for the web it is a library that is built on top of tensorflow j/s it is one that I work on with a lot of different collaborators here at NYU and throughout the greater open source community and so I have a playlist going of video tutorials there's some really exciting what I find to be incredibly exciting new features that are in development in ml 5 they're not part of the release yet if I can get my act together later this week I'll do a second live stream with those new features but I wanted to fill in some gaps about a couple models that are here in ml 5 that I have not touched on in particular unit and body pics and both of those are examples of image segmentation so Ojai coding garden with CJ great I love this member think he's so happy I'm gonna get some lights that blink or something when somebody joins that'll be fun shurik Schaick thank you so much when you first join you get a little this dot iconic what is the world what is this world and my body is it okay that I'm buying into this that you'd like sign up and you for this membership thing and you get it emoji icon okay so the websites starting to look different already we're doing some new stuff with the website I'm super excited about it but so this is that's the goal that's really my only goal for today I want to show community contributions I want to do two tutorials I want to thank the sponsor of the coding tre watches I even have a button on my mouse buzzer oh god oh stream deck that will bring this cup up so thank you I have the this live stream is once again sponsored I took a break from that for a little bit while it's figuring things out but I think I'm settled so thank you to brilliant org if you're interested in finding out more about brilliant tonight hopefully I opened up the correct banner I can't remember me duh or just coding train hold on I might have to fix this this is welcome to my incompetence II hold on I know how to check this just talk amongst yourself for a second oh yeah new member mama who's supposed to be a coding livestream not just to thank the new members livestream oh where do I go well this is very hard to use this computer over here it's a PC can anybody see the description of this video I kiss oh wait I know where to look I have it definitely have it correct in the description that's right up to look I don't swap it out here's the live stream no it's me oh yeah that's a mistake let me fix that banner hold on live exciting oh I thought I was being so good and I was gonna have no issues I don't have it on worst all right well I will take a break I'll take a break and fix that later all right back to Java so if you're interested in learning more about brilliant go to brilliant org slash coding trained not Nova Nova I mean the that is part of the coding train but this particular URL is just slash coding tree want wompwompwomp okay let me okay I'm gonna next thing the next segment I want to do is show you community contributions but I have something else I have to show you first gonna have to send an email about the air I can feel myself palpitating new member again this is crazy hello Jonathan Barbra this is nuts and I've never had so many new members all at once so I'm about to change to a different camera view here we go I'm gonna press this button go over here now I it's this camera is set with a lot of automatic settings so I think it's gonna start to lighten up cause it's like auto white balancing and it also has auto focus hello but I am very excited to show you something this isn't it's a smart surface it's magnetic so I can hang things up here which I'm very excited about that should open up a lot of possibilities and this is a sheet of draw a dryerase sheet so I can now write here and once again I have my ability to diagram I don't know how visible that is for you and certainly as I come closer it's gonna go out of focus so I probably should focus the camera specific they just on the wall and tune the white balance and all that stuff but at least for now and have this green cloth at least for now I can use this as a whiteboard so that's what I'll be doing today you might remember last week it's over here you can't really see it I guess I could but this was my whiteboard from last week which still has all the stuff that I listed on it but it's just over here in the corner right now the thing that's great about this is it seemed a far as I can tell it's matte and it's not really reflecting the lights too too much so it should this should work better than what I had before alright so that's the other new thing and then I come over here and I press this button and then I am back over here okay people are asking when was the last time there was a livestream with Simon absent you would think something must be wrong if there's Simon's not here oh and I don't have the Select channel open let me get that open here we go oh my god too many things how do I do this there we go very faint all right so we'll see how this goes today each day I make each time my livestream I make a small incremental improvement I found this bug in the kitchen by the way and I loved it I think this is a Scrabble mug it's got an N with one and then all the other letter distributions back here okay now if you recall one of the things that happens on the coding train is I make a coding example like a coding challenge and last week previously previously on the coding train I programmed a ukulele tuner now I should mention and many of you rightly pointed this out and I don't know if any of you who are actually watching this live with the random people who showed up it's a one video that I made many rightly pointed out that this is not a particularly accurate or efficient way to make a ukulele tuner or to accurately estimate pitch based on audio input and they're certainly like highly specific mathematical ways of doing that related to a FFT algorithms and sound analysis more what I was attempting to demonstrate was a particular machine learning pitch detection model that happens to be in ml five so it was a nice opportunity to use it to create this tuner so if I click here on to the challenge we can see the videos here and I'm gonna just quickly run mine see if it still works it's not very promising oh I know what the issue is wow this is a weird this is ah you know what this is a good thing to bring up so why is this not working I asked you the viewing audience and then you will near this question about 30 seconds from now and I won't be able to wait till you try to suggest an answer so the reason why this is not working is Chrome for good reason I would say but I think this is a debatable point but will not begin any audio source any playing of audio or recording of audio and that's probably it even more important in terms of privacy without a user interaction first so in other words we want the Chrome I suppose the reasoning is to protect against a website that might syrup tisha sleet record your audio you can imagine how problematic that could be so I didn't so in this I prefer me to actually have programmed this ukulele tuner so that it would work we need a button like start listening or something which I didn't include because if I just go to the actual editor view there is a user interaction that happens on this page me pressing this Run button and now it works so while I'm in the editor view it happens to work but when I'm not it doesn't so I fibula tune ukulele okay so that was this was the project I made I would say the big issues with this the things that I don't like about it are mostly all have to do with user interaction and visual design and I would say these are not my strengths I don't know what my strengths are but they're certainly not that and so what I enjoy doing with these coding challenges is making the sort of like technical demonstration of the idea and asking the viewing audience to make their own version of it maybe with a creative twist or being more thoughtful about the interaction design lots of possibilities there so I'm gonna close my version out and I'm going to go now to this page I'm gonna show you oh wait so many of these came in okay well 3m Italy three of them are from Simon but there's a lot of these contributions so I would like to spend more time in my live streams sharing work that people are making from the audience and from elsewhere in the world you know I really want to feature a lot of different kinds of people who are doing stuff with code from different and so I'm gonna take a moment to do that right now so I'm just gonna click through these in order and we'll sort of see how they work and give my commentary on them what could go wrong what could possibly go wrong so let's try this one by Luciano tonay allow I don't need to translate the page okay so let's see here I think we so I think we're gonna run into this issue and we can look to see the audio so this is what I'm talking about user gesture needed to start audio context please click so I don't know how to force this to work like if I can click fast enough oh there we go so I got lucky so I just clicked a bunch of time so now let's try this so I like this I like so that one thing I like about this is it's closer to the what you might typically see with the tuner where there's kind of a dial and the dial is when it's centered is at the right frequency I might say that this is jumping around a lot a lot of that has to do with pitch detection model and the fact that I'm speaking and there's noise in this room but some type of interpolation some other visual indicator right now I think this is a problem with mine is just the like on or off quality of these is it tuned or not you want to be able see am I getting closer or further I think could help here but I like this idea of having it be more dial like okay let's try this one by mine bill I think I'm just gonna click into the editor I love this I'm like filling up a circle let's try changing the note and see what happens you can see how the circles getting smaller again we've got this a lot of noise and this sort of green or red and no interpolation there which I think could could potentially help I like that there's this option of changing it to a guitar that is cool so the notes are different what it's looking for basically on zits are sometimes CJ writes sometimes having the dev tools open before the page loads allows the mic to work without interaction oh and I see Simon Tiger is just typing so I think Simon has made it to the live stream everybody do not do not worry everything's okay in the world okay next we have the ukulele tuner with a pitch trail by original Aang let's try this one oh oh I love this it's almost like those you know guitar hero style games where the notes are coming at you and you have to time the interaction there's this and I love the idea that I could create a picture from playing music here in a way I wonder if there's something to this beyond tuning which is a way of visualizing music and sound wonderful idea here ukulele tuner same model new design by David Schneider whoa whoa now this is great embedding the tone generator is a very smart idea and then here we've really got a nice dial going let's play so let's move this around so something seems a little off with the position of the dial again this is not the perfect the perfect way of doing pitch detection but I this now we're really starting to see something that has a very you know traditional dial like design I like that there's a little indicator of what the mic is doing somehow this worked right out of the box I wonder if if you know why if there is some kind of like user interaction embedded that I don't realize that I've done here but this is great to see what if I play different note it's Auto detecting their note it's great great job thank you David and now whoops we have three submissions from Simon let's look at them tuning all strings at once what is that even pause that possible let's see if the tip yeah so you'd think the dev tools opening would help but I'm just going to go to here and I'm going to do this like this so let's strike to you a little bit I like the yellow and I like the sort of like yellow color as a kind of warning sign I'm almost there another thing works pretty well having trouble getting my ear isn't so great I'm wonderful I love I like this of having all of them on one page here that's a nice design idea click to tune the next string so I think this are like different interaction design ideas right where one mine is just autodetects which string another possibility is showing all of the strings and here's one where it's actually giving me instructions so this is nice it's like a tutorial walkthrough which i think is always helpful to the user so G is this one I suppose if I click it saw me to do so I like this as a design idea as well and then random number generator mmm this I don't know what this is let's see alright I'm fascinated by this what is going on here Simon temp error pitch pitch is it generating a random number based on the audio that's coming in well there's four submissions yeah violet writes I feel like this kind of project would be much easier in max/msp yes so p5.js the browser is not necessarily the optimal context for doing you know for creating this kind of sound processing application certainly other programming environments are you know geared and geared entirely around working with audio so I think that's a good point okay so I don't know Simon I'd love to hear more about this random number generator one two three I only see three according to Simon therefore oh wait original ukulele tuner I somehow missed that one okay so this is just a version of it that's much like mine with a slightly different interface okay great so thank you everyone for your ukulele tuner submissions I really enjoyed those next segment I'm gonna look at some more community contributions so let me go to you know me and I'm obsessed with this idea of spinning a wheel so let me go to github.com slash coding train slash website and we'll see david viewer david has created a wheel that actually will randomly pick a viewer contribution to feature so let's this is a little trial run here of this idea maybe we're going to work on this more so I think this is I actually don't know I think this is pulling from a spreadsheet of a user I don't like the word user you know what the word is and this is not my idea I'm sort of pulling this from a talk or a presentation that Dan Pfeiffer who is a wonderful programmer and activist and person on the Internet people there people the people not users they're not users to manipulate and have make them use your stuff they're just people so this is the wheel that it's it's numbers so I've reduced people to numbers which is maybe a little bit reductive that's the word but these are all tied to a particular person viewer contribution and each time it's going to pick ten random ones and once it picks ten random ones I can now spin the wheel and it might be nice to see what the people's names are I can also do my little drum roll here I don't know what this one is number four who is number four passengers Thank You CJ passengers on the train you know the Train thing was just like I needed a name for this channel within like 24 hours it's like somebody's like I like that but I don't know that the idea of the Train theme has really come all from you know for me really this is really a channel about coding and and rainbows if I'm being perfectly honest I just want to put that out there just for a minute wouldn't put that out there okay back to this so I believe if I mug is blocking this but I believe now if I click this button remove and view selected it's going to take me to this so we picked ah here we go he picked item number for this the challenge this one is based on is Perlin noise Luke's and this was contributed by Maxime anakov alright overuse this now HBU it here you can open a new window Wow so I believe this challenge if I remember correctly was showing how to close a loop all the way around a circular path with the kind of the radius than any given angle being tied to Perlin noise and what's a nice application of that it looks like making like wobbly little Wiggly asteroids thingies in an asteroids game this is really good look out look how it labyrinth us is so I want to make this easy I'm gonna give myself three lives and I'm gonna start the more difficult than level the smaller number of lives the more points you get controlled by arrows press escape to return to the menu here we go wow this is great sorry I have to end my livestream now and spend the rest of the day playing this wouldn't it be fun to work on a bot an AI a little evolutionary algorithm to evolve a strategy for playing this game wonderful wonderful job thank you I already forgot who this was Maxum man akov for this variation on parole annoys lips let's look at one more let's look at one more just I want to be conscientious about the time I do have some tutorials I want to do today so let's look at one more it's been the wheel number three this original challenge is blobby wow there's gonna feel life do you have a lot of challenges based on blob like shapes and it's created by Grilli 86 let's take a look and see oh there we go so this is nice ah so this looks like a pretty exact replica of my challenge if I remember it correctly I don't think I had this sort of changing color so it looks like what's been added here is that the color is changing according to maybe a noise algorithm but also it looks like if Ohno there's you know what's nice about this is seeing it on code pen and actually looking at the code looks like there's a bunch of other parameters that are changing and happening there's like lots more going on so this is really nice I mean this is actually oddly one of my favorite things to visualize it's just a kind of undulating gelatinous like shape things that are spongy that are soft or quite hard to do with code and very satisfying I think to play around with and and use okay great job that ends that segment you have segments now how's it going it's going very well thank you alright I'm gonna close these windows out I am I am a smart surface I am a smart surface people like me just you know daily affirmation nothing's wrong with little daily affirmation all right back over here so if you're wondering how to submit your own coding trained community version viewer person submitted passenger variant on a challenge go to the website and this is a link to add your own version and it's a little bit tricky you have to use the github website you have to you do something called a pull request but we are here we the coding trade community are here to be friendly and welcoming and help you through that process you can't do it wrong you can't break anything and even if you did break something that would be awesome if you can figure out how to break the website that would be fun and a learning experience for all of us so don't be shy if you think that your contribution isn't valuable you're wrong it is valuable please submit it and I even have a video I think that goes through this like community contribution coding train I just google that there we go how to add your contribution to the coding train website so this video hopefully give you a little more context all right did I plug my cat Instagram yet today all right so here's what here's what we got I've got a little over an hour and I'm a three more things I am going to do a quick tutorial on oh I'm gonna do I'm gonna look at the you net model in ml five let's do a daily challenge on brilliant org and then I'm gonna look at body pics in ml five that's what's happening for the rest of this livestream today so give me a second here to get set up for the next bit alright by the way I've been seeing this warning / error a lot recently and I don't know what it is a cookie associated with a crosssite resource at cloud fair comm was set without the same site attribute why is this appearing cuz I have something to do with loading the P 5 library from the CDN oh it's Klis must be right because that's cloud fair no more warning huh so is this what is this I don't want to get offtrack here but I'm wondering is this an issue with cloud fair with the p5 web editor who knows right somebody can write to me or I probably might not see it in the chat right now but we movie can somebody can help me with this in slack I see Alka is typing and I'm almost certainly certain the answer is about to come but this is not an error that I'm super familiar with so I want to do this tutorial not in the p5 web editor because I'm not super familiar I haven't actually this is a thing that I do which is I make tutorials and stuff I haven't used just right off the cuff why not but I'm not super familiar I haven't really done a lot of work with this unit function so I I think debugging it or figuring out what's going on might be a little easier in the browser you can close the what's new a part of the console I did that I'm not so sure about the cookie area yeah okay all right so one thing I can do it at a minimum is I can tell it to not show my warnings so I'm going to just take this off and then we won't see the warnings all right so what do I need I want a couple things before I start this tutorial I want the ml5 website closed the web editor I want to reference so I'm going to spell this wrong but I'm hoping Google will help me is Syed's github and Twitter and website Alley FBI maybe somebody could help me who's watching I should have asked Sayid this am i pronouncing this within the realm of reasonableness for a silly American and I am xayide of up alley Fi Syed Ali fi and somebody help me with this so um while I'm waiting for maybe the chat to help me with pronunciation Adam asked unit are you going to do some segmentation yes so I am here to demonstrate how to use a pre trained image segmentation model which has the unit architecture in the ml5 genis library so this is not a tutorial on the unit architecture coding it from scratch with you know tensorflow and c++ I'm really just using a very high level tool to have a pre trained model and sort of look at image segmentation in in ml 5 GS okay okay let me see if I can well thank you I got some sort of super Chad thing from Christopher Jessa thank you make me feel very odd we're not comfortable but I get slave I appreciate it Oh bro train whistle oh that's very kind of you it very much appreciated it's more like zayeed so did I get that right armor xayide yes I people area what all right do coding challenges holy Jessup I'm reading the chat I was looking for something here I was gonna make some people moderators but okay I did notice it's just that it takes me it take some time right you what you don't understand I mean sometimes I don't notice but you just really have to be aware there's quite a significant delay in what you're seeing me versus the real time of the chat so well anything that I respond to in the chat HAP you won't see it for at least 30 seconds all right okay xayide okay okay here we go and like join you just cycle the cameras are they gonna shut off it's 1030 I've got an hour here so I think we're in good shape and here all right hello and welcome to another tutorial part of the beginner's guide to machine learning in JavaScript with ml 5 GS so in today's tutorial I want to talk about a particular I think you can hear that yes you can hear that yes I'll just start over but I almost feel like I want to keep that kind of sort of funny hello and welcome to another video as part of the beginner's guide to machine learning in JavaScript with ml v GS so in today's in this particular video I want to look at something called image segmentation I have a whiteboard I'm just looking at how well you can see that so what do I mean by image segmentation so right now you're looking at an image of me and there are different parts of the image that we as human beings could dissect or deconstruct so let me try to do a very poor job of drawing a version of this myself and maybe there's also sort of this so I could think of this image as having different segments different parts there's my head there's my body there is the background which is maybe a wall and then there's actually a sort of secondary wall over here that's the wall to my right and this is the wall to my left I could even think of that as another segment so in this case I have full I'm just decided this video has four segments a B C and D and in a way this is ultimately a classification problem what I'm doing is I'm looking at every single one of these pixels in this image and trying to classify it as one of four possible labels and you could imagine how this could be useful maybe you want a computer vision Pete software to be able to find all the pixels that are cars on the road that are flowers in a garden there's so many possibilities here and so this is there there are so many possibilities here and there are a couple function there what am I trying to say here looks like there's a third segment I don't know what's going on there are a lot of possible applications of this so the there's a much longer story to how you might collect a data set that is labeled and segmented train a model to recognize image segmentation and maybe this is something that I can do a deeper dive into in future videos but in this video I want to start with a particular segmentation model that is trained on faces what it is yeah I think its face and really just dip that's trained on faces and really just differentiates the image into one of two categories it's the foreground or in the background it's the human face or it's not part of the human face and this is a quick way to do masking or other types of things that you might want to do in an interactive media application the architecture of this particular model is something called u net and u net I will include a link to I will include links to more resources about what the unit architecture is if you want to get lower level with this but this is a particularly Sheen learning architecture that was designed and invented for medical imaging so you could imagine how image segmentation could be useful with medical images if you're trying to pull out different parts of the anatomy or recognize certain aspects of the human body what else do I want to say about this wait there's another super chat this is crazy Christopher Jessup oh it just says it twice hopefully that's not a mistake turning like bright red here alright okay if you're looking for data sets that are available to the public with training data for image segmentation a very wellknown one is called cocoa or common objects in context what's the how does that make cocoa common objects in context wouldn't that be C oh I see timewise where are we okay common objects in context Oh context is C oh I got it figured it out the cocoa data set are common objects in context can you see this it gets really bright as I get closer here the white balance is a problem oh well so in the next video I'm actually going to look at a particular image segmentation model called body pics which you can start to think about is how that must have some similarity with this face unit model and this particular model was trained off of the cocoa dataset but let me talk to you about the unit model that's in ml 5 the one pretrained model that's there and how it was trained and who trained it and who contributed this to ml 5 okay Christopher says it's not a mistake yeah thank you but and I I appreciate that it's the last one for today okay all right so hold on I just want to Sayyid the pretrained model the pretrained unit model that's in ml5 for you to use was trained by a researcher named Syed out of all efi let me say that one more time because i feel very awkward about it the pretrained model that's available for you to use in ml5 was trained by a researcher names ie Syed Ali Fi and you can find out more about Saeed Saeed the restraint the the pre trained model that's in ml5 that you can experiment with was trained by researchers ie alia fine and and Zayed you can find out more about him from Twitter page github and also a website and include links to all those in the video's description I do want to point out here that this particular model was trained from this data set and I haven't done I haven't looked in depth at this particular data set it is a face head segmentation data set but if you look at these images you might notice something sort of strange about them I believe that this is a data set that was created through 3d simulation and I you know maybe some of you enterprising viewers could look into this more and and provide some commentary in the comments I mean I can come back in a future video and look at this data set a bit more but there's always a lot of complicated issues around collecting data of people's faces and making sure that you have a representative sample are you collecting those faces with people's permission in general I might say if you're collecting people's faces maybe you just shouldn't be doing that but this is one approach to doing so by I'm looking at the chat and the super chat is going off the rails but hearing but this is this is one technique of doing it because also even if you get real images you're going to have to hand label them somehow but if you're simulating the faces and then creating the segmentation maps this is the training data so this was the training data that zayeed used to train that model with the u net Oh texture let me let me offer a quick few thankyous here oh those were all Christopher chips okay thank you thank you thank you I'm your train whistle blowing person here and then also thank you to Andrey Kay Lopez wah thank you so much very kind of you this really allows me the the support really allows me to have allocate more time to doing this to bring more people into the community and I hope that I'm doing everything in the best way that I can all right now let's look at the reference for this unit model in ml 5 and try to build a quick example that does the actual image segmentation remember we're not training the model we're not creating our own image segmentation model which is making use of one that somebody else trained and applying it in the browser with the ML 5gs library so first the first thing I'll do is I'll go here on to reference and I'm going to look for yo sorry I'm going to look for a unit right here and whoa amazing so first of all a website is totally like an active process of changing and being updated oh wait where am I even am I even on the website cuz I went to here reference oh yeah it's taking me to kid up dot I hope this is crazy like I think Joey Lee who's one of the leaners of ml5 Jas it's been working on the website quite a bit it looks completely different than what I've used to which I think it's fine this is making it fun so here I'm on the website I'm going to go down to you net looks like there's a placeholder image right now let's quickly go to acknowledgments it's kind of look can I get to the old website just for the purpose of this video let's just see for a second I think what if I change this to ml 5 j s dot work force it to do that nope no no that's PR g yeah all right I'm just gonna I'm gonna live with this right now and the construction noise always the construction noise how am i doing timewise okay not so bad could be worse okay thank you too rough sue Betar as well Wow all right usage so I'm not gonna worry about going into the reference in detail I'm just going to we'll cut to this when we make the tutorial please do a video about I don't know what that is I'm gonna have to look up what that is all right let me just let me take a picture support opensource software development there's lots of wonderful projects out there that could use your support as well as me thank you first thing I want to do is navigate over to the ml 5gs web page the reference page for the U net model now the you know I should be clear her unit is unit is a machine learning architecture there's no I should be first thing I want to do is Maz is navigate over to the ml 5 jazz website and look for the unit reference page so on the reference page also find some information about the about the background behind this functionality in ml 5 as well as sort of like a QuickStart guide for what the basics of code works at code how the code works and any more stuff so what will be clear here is that you net is the machine is them is the model architecture so on its own it isn't anything but zayeed trained a model based on phases so in ml 5 to access that pretrained modeling it's the only one right now in the future there might be more that you could put in here you'll say ml 5 dot unit face so let's actually start putting that into our code so um this is what I have so far I have a p5 sketch that loads the video from the webcam you can see the green screen here and it's displaying it here and then I'm redrawing into the canvas so what I also want to do is draw the segmentation here and see and see the original video here so I'll go back to the code a couple things to mention is um got to make sure you have in addition to importing the p5 library you have the ml 5 library important as well and now I can go over and start to edit sketch da yes so back to the reference page I want to say this and most likely let's just see if this works I think I want to try to load the model with preload let's see if that works and then let's just try and set up let's try console logging of the model to see if it's been loaded great so this looks promising model ready is true so again you can load the model asynchronously with a callback and there's a variety of different ways of doing it but a quick way to get started in p5 s use the preload function to make sure the model is loaded before it starts so that's awesome the next thing that I want to do probably is call I'm guessing call a function like segment I want to say hey I'm a machine learning model the input is an image the output is the segmented version of the image right here this video of me is the input I'm gonna feed that into the model the output is some kind of image map of colors it's very hard to do these tutorials and handle the super chat at the same time but I'm so appreciative david schneider writes the tuner contribution worked out of the box because i put some extra code to make sure it would aha so there is so I'll be curious take a look at it some extra code to make sure that the audio starts I know I don't have to super chat but I wanted to thank you all right yes Simon I did see your message on the random number generator thank you I and also if I miss the messages I always go back and look at them later especially in the slack so don't worry too much okay hard for me to catch everything while I'm livestreaming go back to the reference we can see ah there is a function just like I thought called segment I'm going to give it the input the video and then there's going to be a callback when it's done processing that's going to be in the result so I'm going to lazily just copy all of this and I'm going to put it here and set up actually mmm now let's try this let's see what happens I'm gonna put the didn't set up I'm gonna take this got result function and put it up here I'm gonna add the semicolons because I cannot live without semicolons and let's just see if I get either an error or a result all right let's see what happens this is promising looks like I got something I got a blob with this size that's of type image I also got an image and I also got a raw and I got a tensor so this is what ml 5 does ml 5 anytime you anytime you process data through one of its machine learning models it's going to give you all of the results back in a variety of different formats depending on what it is you might try to do so here a clue to what I wanted to is the fact that one of these is a p5 dot image so for me I just want to like look at the image I just want to draw it just want to see it but there's also a blob which is a sort of native JavaScript data for the image there's also this raw which is probably just the raw numbers an array of all the numbers that define that all the pixels that map of the segments and then a tensor which is even lower level again ml 5 is built on top of tensor flow and a tensor is a basically collection of numbers that tensorflow j s is managing to throw out the machine learning process so I think if I just here say image result dot image this is going to draw it into the window I'm gonna comment out the draw loop because I don't want to see that right now and I'm going to hit refresh so I should have seen the video down here oh whoops I have an error image was expecting three arguments I need to say where to draw the image so let's just put it at 0 0 try again I don't see anything so why don't I see anything I have a feeling that first of all I only asked the segment at once and I asked it immediately at the start of the program I know the model was loaded but was the video ready so most likely I think something that's going to be better here is for me to actually use a callback right now with the video I'm gonna say video ready I'm gonna add a function called video ready and then there that's when I will call segment so let's see if that gives me something more useful some waiting videos ready well it definitely got the results so here's my suspicion now the video is ready but the very first frame of the video doesn't really have anything in it because it takes a like a bit for it to like warm up I really have no idea I think what could be more effective here is for me to continuously call segments right every time I get maybe what I should have done to demonstrate this was use a static image not just start with the webcam feed but that's what I'm doing here it's also I realized this web this is an interesting webcam feed because you have to remember here this is not a typical image right what was it trained on it was trained on for saw simulated images of people wandering through a 3d world and I don't think they were all standing in front of a green screen so will this even work with me dimpling you would think like segmenting in front of a green screen is the easiest thing you don't need was she learning for that cuz you could just look at pixel colors that's what's happening right now that's I'm making this video so much to think about here all right I think what I can add here is that once I've got the result I'm draw the image let me ask the segment again so I'm just going to copy paste this right here and this should in essence loop it over and over again segment the image get the result segmented again get the results segmented again Wow what have I done wrong let's look at the example whoops let's look at the example see if this works oh oh it's nice that there's a link here but it doesn't actually go there lets me try to find the example in the web editor does anybody see you net in here pose net Yolo all right let's take more drastic measures oh here we go oh no interesting all right let's just for a quick second here let's just replace the code with the example yeah okay so it does work that's a good sign what did I do wrong oh I didn't know I did this looks very similar I mean I'm just drawing in a different place but what it's a video input the right no so um this is a great question TMC is asking is the video input the right size and nl5 I should address this but ml5 is handling that segmented image let me just try doing this in draw I mean oh maybe what comes out is no what did I do wrong I'm just like looking at this example right create capture size high that doesn't matter I mean there's this but this really shouldn't matter like I don't need to store it oh no I need to copy it it shouldn't matter like this is exactly what I'm doing it's just drawing it in a different place all right let's well I'm running out of time here all right I'm gonna I don't see how this matters but let's oh wait nobody took that out yeah is there some kind of weird like order of operations that like drawing inside of this got result is such a problem Oh weird huh so why why does drawing it's actually not ready weird new member Eckert hello but I don't have draw so I can't be drawing over it why yeah I mean I could do I can draw in here right like what if I say background this is gonna flicker I'll just do Freight I won't frame count modulus 255 Oh No oh but there's no frame count but like I can draw in there weird I honestly don't understand but interestingly enough it's like the image isn't ready or something draw and draw and draw I mean drawing and draw is a better better practice anyway so I think I'm just gonna have to cop to that let me go back to me not having it working all right this is where it wasn't working oh whoa oh because I have this all right I'm just gonna go back to here this is a bit odd to me but it seems like I think what's going on here is drawing inside of this got result function is problematic ultimately if I want to draw into the canvas in an animation using p5 s draw loop is the place to do it I should be able to do it here I mean there's something with the image isn't ready to be drawn I really don't know what's going on if I'm being perfectly honest maybe somebody will reveal it in the comments but looking at the the way the actual ml5 example is written yeah I think a more thoughtful way if I create a separate variable that's like a segmented image and I just start at the beginning as a blank image so let me just make a blank image that's the same size of the window and then what I can do here instead of trying to draw the image here I can just set that particular variable segmented image equal to result on image and then what I can do is I can add the draw function and in draw just draw that segmented image at 0 0 I mean it should already be the correct size of the canvas so let's see what happens now I'm gonna hit refresh there we go ah interesting so look so it's there it looks different though right it's a different size than the original image so first of all a machine learning model has to have a fixed size set of inputs and a fixed size set of outputs not I mean there's exceptions to this but certainly in the case of a kind of traditional model that's expecting images it's expecting images of a certain resolution which is probably not 320 by 240 so ml5 is adjusting the resolution of the image before it feeds it into this unit face model and then when it comes out though it comes out in the sort of default resolution but I can just if I want it to match up visually I can just rescale it when I draw it like this and now we're seeing that I have the original video here and then the segmented image here so this doesn't look too thrilling because I have a green screen behind me but let's see if I can move the webcam to somewhere else in this room and see what happens all right you can see actually actually I don't know if I want to you can see this is my like streaming wherever there now it's starting to like lose track of what's going on but here it's still working now as I get over here it thinks that's part of my face so again what was the training data what what kind of environments was it was it trained in how well is it doing that segmentation but here you can do some basic background removal let's just see let's just very quickly see if I can replace replace my background using a unit model as a starting point so how would I do that like for example if I say this the the pixels are actually black and so how do I make that an alpha Channel I could process the image right it's probably in the raw data there's a what did we say was in the this thing there's the blob there's the image there's the raw which is all the pixel information so I could probably write ah so I could see I mean that's wherever there's black I could replace I can make that the Alpha so one way of doing that would be to make the Alpha Channel of the image but they're like I'm there's a mask function in p5 I'll just just bear with me for a second can i well maybe I don't want to go down this road additive blending would ignore black yeah I think I'm I think I'm kind of brown a time here I want to do body pics and I want to do the brilliant challenge I do have I'm just trying to think I know I'm trying to think there's a smarter way to do this and let's look at the let's look at them reference there's a mask function I thought yeah a photo mask mask image so I should be able to use it as a mask I'm just curious like what if I create just give me a second here let's draw just can't cure us in here so that's good and then wait I will explain what I'm doing in a second okay that's a good sign oh no it's not a good sign photo mask source image last party mission is playing by loading in late Oh it uses the Alpha channel as an alpha channel for this image okay I'm gonna have to process I'm gonna have to process the pixels I'm gonna have to process the pixels I mean I think maybe I don't want to get into this right now because I'm gonna move on but I think what I could do here is I could I maybe I'll come back in a separate video and do something about that or think about how that would be useful it really should that really should be I think it should probably give you the image not with I think ml 5 should practically probably change this it should probably put set the Alpha value to zero so Leben I'm actually gonna do this let me do this real quick so let me show you what I mean let me just go back to what I had before and then get rid of this other stuff one of the things you first might want to do with this I think I just said this where one of the things you first might want to do with this is then actually like replace the background behind you so for example I could load a nice beach scene or something but just to simulate that let me put blue behind me so in other words if I said background 0 0 0 255 I should see myself right now in front of this blue background but I don't so what ml5 has actually returned to me is an image segmented but each the the background pixels are colored black rather than having their transparency for example set to zero so I'm not sure maybe this should be something that ml 5 actually offers and maybe by the time you watch this this will have changed but for right now I could at least iterate over the pixels and anytime there's a pixel that with color 0 0 0 I could set its alpha down to 0 and there might be some fancier way to do this with like a blend mode or something but let me just see if I can process the pixels this way I'm gonna do this quickly right here what I'm going to do I'm gonna look right here where I am receiving that segmented image I am going to loop over and I'm gonna do a nested loop I think actually no I don't need to all right I'm gonna look right here where I'm receiving that segmented image and I'm going to iterate all over all the pixels so I'm gonna use a for loop to go over segmented image pixels length I plus plus oh I'm gonna say I plus equals four because in p5.js the array of pixels there are four spots in the array for every single pixel are G B a so I can say the rvalue is segmented image pixels index I I'm gonna use a plus a zero here you'll see why in a second that's the red value that's the G the G value is plus one the B value is +2 they're all right next to each other RGB then the alpha value is what I want to set so I'm gonna say if R equals zero and G equals zero can I do this and B equals zero so this is gonna let me do that then I want to say images pixels I plus three I'm just gonna set the Alpha down to zero and I should probably say segmented image load pixels seg minted image update pixels and let's see what happens I'm gonna hit refresh I have the blue background I'm gonna see myself oh no J pixels this is gonna make the console go crazy just one whoops that's weird Oh Oh not I yeah no I let me get rid of this console.log it's only getting that for the zero pixel all the other pixels are and this is an awful thing I'm about to do because it's gonna spit out a zillion things but let's just see what happens it's only oh look at this this is like a bug I'm like discovering a really weird bug in ml5 or something which is that the image is not available yet it doesn't have any pixels like that's why I couldn't draw it here it's like not actually ready this is so weird this is what happens on the coding train I think I'm gonna do this like very simple tutorial and it all goes wrong but watch this I have a feeling now I might have to come back and I'll redo this or like fill in the gap on Thursday this week if I do it like I've been feeling if I do it here in draw boy see there we go now I've already done a horrible thing I've killed he'll stop go away browser I did what I didn't want to do which is I put a for loop in the I put a console lock inside my pixel for loop which is like the worst thing ever just please stop get to the end get to the end clothes clothes can I oh there's like a task manager right task manager can I get which tab is this it's got to be this one end process there we go no it's still printing oh I didn't commented out task manager there we go and friends don't let friends put a console.log in a forloop of pixels there we go weird so unbelievably weird okay I might have to like figure out why this is happening but wor this tutorial is just gonna be you know what I'm gonna do I'm just gonna do this again but I'll just do it in draw and I will ignore I'm gonna do this little little bit again everybody please bear with me as you always do one of the first things you're probably thinking of to do is oh I could now replace the background to something else I could put myself in a lovely beach scene over the garden of flowers behind me instead of just this green wall or whatever happens to be the actual background so the to do that you might think okay let me let me just let me just replace it with blue just as a test I'm gonna say background 0 0 255 I'm gonna hit refresh this looks good I've got blue I've got the image and now up it's still black pixels not blue so the kind of image that's actually being returned into that segmented image doesn't have any transparency to it the pixels that are part of the background are classified as background as essentially and then given the color of RGB 0 0 0 so maybe there's a different way that ml5 maybe there's a way I could use it as an alpha mask or some kind of blend mode I leave that to the comments to give me some excellent suggestions about it think of it this is a better way but what I'm gonna do right now is just manually process the pixels so for example here and draw I can just say segmented image load pixels then I'm gonna also say segmented image update pixels and what I'll do is I'm going to do a for loop I'm gonna start at 0 I'm gonna go all the way to a segmented image pixels dot length and then what do I want to do I'm gonna look at the red value which is segmented pixels index I uh wait so one thing I forgot is in P 5gs or in JavaScript if you're looking at an image the pixel array has four spots for every pixel red green blue alpha in that order so red is pixels plus zero and this should actually go up by four for every pixel gee red green blue plus one for green plus two for blue and then when I want to set the alpha I can say if R equals zero and G is zero and B is zero this is probably a more elegant way of doing that I can say I can set the Alpha value to zero so let's see what happens now if I hit refresh I have the blue background I have the segmented image and I have there we go me in front of a blue background you know I could do some other things here like for example if I wanted to just make this more of a silhouette now I have the opportunity of saying something like I could actually replace all of these do this quickly something like this and now I'm going to see myself here and just kind of a silhouette version of myself up here and there's some flickering going on again I I think I've got more to think about this maybe I need to come back with a followup video there's some weirdness going on with the fact that I'm getting the segmented image in this got result callback and then manipulating it and drawing it in the draw loop and the order of how those things happen could call it appears to be maybe causing some issues here so thank you for watching this gif give Z you net a pretrained face model a try make something with it and be on the lookout for app in the comment or a followup video that maybe irons out some of these like little issues with cleaning up this order of operations in this program okay thanks for watching and I'll see you soon good bye yes so copper Francis asking does this work without a green background this is pretty unfortunate that I have doing this with a green background because it gives the illusion of doing some kind of chroma keying effect which I could easily do just with pixel manipulation but yeah alright so choo choo to the chat I'm gonna close some stuff out here and I want to say thank you to the coding trains livestream sponsor brilliant org I this unfortunately it's like fired here instantly but I'll put this in the chat you should go to brilliant dot board slash coding train no the okay so I'm gonna take that off the screen since it's incorrect and I am going to go talk to you about brilliant org so I mentioned earlier that one of the things that I'm doing now is I'm doing coding challenges from a new secret location soon to be launched on the coding train Oh video coming out hopefully later this week preview to members and I one of the ways that I come up with ideas and keep my mind fresh and continue learning for new coding challenges that I want to work on or things that I want to teach in my classes is by the internet and I read lots of different articles and books and things but one of the websites that I've been using recently is brilliant org thanks to their sponsorship of the coding train and brilliant org is a lifelong learning website where you can find daily challenges you can find full courses which are pretty cool I've done some segments where I looked at some of these courses I want to do a deeper dive into maybe the artificial neural networks course which has a lot of content aligned with things that I'm doing here on this channel but you can get started for free just by going to brilliant org slash coding train you can also unlock all the features of brilliant org all of the different courses and things through a premium subscription and the first 200 people to sign up get a 20 percent discount again that's bleeped org slash coding train no though maybe this also works I'm sure they can fix that but it's without the vine I will fix that the next time I put this banner up so let's go do what I actually looked earlier this morning I didn't quickly and I noticed this arithmetic with waves and I thought this could be a fun challenge for us to do together here and me I am so me as is giving me a message in the chat about this were like load pixels behavior I'm gonna come back and look at that in a second so um this arithmetic with waves is it looks like a fun one to try so let's look at this so here's the question so first of all I have if you want to know more about wave patterns and oscillation with code you could go to my nature of code book if I go here under oscillation and search for wave you can see that I already have some code examples that create patterns like this so this probably looks very similar to what you're seeing right here undulating sine wave and one of the things I also demonstrate in the book and I could come back and I think I've done videos on this is what happens when you add waves together and if I keep going down there we go so more complex waves can be produced by the values of multiple waves together so this is just summing different waveforms to get this pattern that has a more chaotic or random feel to it it's not at all it's a periodic repeating pattern but by summing the different ways you can get something that as a this kind of quality to it so if we look here let's see if we can if we can figure this out so this is the pattern which pair of wave functions can be added to get the graph above and B a and C or B and C I would suspect not a and B right this definitely looks to me like there e are two like the actually the these a and B have the same period right period our frequency is the number of time period being the amount of time for one full cycle frequency being the amount of cycles per unit of time amplitude it looks like they all have the same amplitude being the height of the wave so oh and Simon's telling me there's a second course on neural networks coming soon on brilliant Simon who I know it's been should really be here talking about brilliant cuz I know the Simon makes a lot of excellent use of the brilliant website alright so looking at these two I wonder if I could quickly modify my nature of code example try that I just wanted to see if we can get it intuitive sense you know what I have an idea I have an idea here which is that this does cross zero so if I'm adding waves together and and the waves added together get a zero the sum is a zero I either have to have that part of the wave be above and below the line at the same height right I have to add a plus two and a negative 2 to get well not with a sine 0.5 and a negative 0.5 or both waves have to be zero so if this is kind of where the zero is like anywhere if I pick here and I go down so this a is not zero there Oh be a zero there Oh see okay it's got to be B and C I think that's like wick way of doing it it's got to be B and C so let me just give it a minute if anybody easy just look at the center point that's another good way of doing it the center point is kind of like halfway to the amplitude that the bottom limit so a is 0 B is at the bottom and C is there so it could be it could be a and B that tells us it could be a and B or B and C that doesn't give us the answer but I believe it has to be B and C let's just see if I'm right any other suggestions from the chat everybody's saying B and C everybody in the chat this is like a phone a friend this is a nice by the way here's another way you can do your challenges on brilliant down org just live stream and have people watching it let me click B and C let me hit submit and correct I got a one day streak really do these every day not just a day that I'm live streaming somebody tweeted me tomorrow or write a youtube comment or something I'm Way behind on reviewing YouTube comments one of the things actually that YouTube has now is you can filter the comments by members so I can see any members that commented so that I look at it that way but also by subscribers so I can see who's subscribed so if you want me to look at you I don't want to be pitching for me to subscribe if you like the content and want to get notifications or don't subscribe it's totally fine I will I actually look at all the comments of the best that I can never mind scratch all that alright let's see let me see if I can get a nice simulation of this I think if I go to editor p5 just saw toward nature of code sketches am I gonna be able let's look for a wave wave ABC additive wave so this is additive way this so this is the example let's say what I don't let's let's like cancel the cancel the increment incrementation of the wave there we go but it's doing it randomly so but anyway you get the idea oh how can I make a slack why should I be using discord instead of slack what let's discuss this at some point it's 1130 I'm not gonna get to body picks today it doesn't seem and if I could do that really quickly with all that I'm sure gonna stuff I did with you net might allow me to just quickly in like 15 minutes make a body picks tutorial s repudiation rights I'm I'll be applying to NYU this application season I was going to study straight math but your course of inspire me to branch out find practical ways to express my mathematics that's lovely yeah so I encourage somebody wants to try to make a version of this I Kurt so this way I'm gonna take a short break I'm gonna try to do it look at body pics at least really quickly I'm gonna take a short break I'm gonna encourage you all to go sign up if you haven't already at brilliant org slash coding train no the and and while you do that um see if you can get my additive wave code or see if you can write a quick p5 sketch to to to create these waves and add them together and see if you can like prove this result oh let's see staff right okay so this looks like is where the graphs have 0 oh yes actually you could look at the center because yeah oh and look at it here yeah so this looks like it's the same solution that I did and then oh this is nice this is what I wanted to create in p5.js oh you could create that yeah so this is Alka what you're saying to me is like music to my ears Bing Bing Bing Bing if YouTube membership and discord integrate I should really move from slack I think but let's go back to that and it's just there's lots of excellence Jeff so you you you write a comment here with you you got got five minutes to do this I'm gonna go to the wallpaper actually I'm just gonna actually no I'm gonna leave this here I'm going to leave this here I'm going to remove myself how do I do this me I'm no longer there I'm gonna mute my microphone I'm gonna play you some music this song is about five minutes long I'll be back in five minutes if you can create a p5 sketch that that solves this our processing sketch share it in the YouTube chat or share it on brilliant and I will I will take a look at it I always forget the hi everybody I'm not back yet but if you give me like an extra two or three minutes then I think I can try to do the body pics thing it's still gonna be longer than five minutes but I'll be back in just a few minutes okay this this dog this dog this start song never forget the Vista there's somebody composed that song for me say once again and autotune and the internet will fix that all right I am back I don't have a lot of time a little overtime but I saw that there were some nice comments about this particular brilliant daily challenge where I believe this is I have to scroll back during the chat but someone I'm gonna try to get the right credit here there's so many chat messages oh my goodness too many chat messages I can't find it someone will help me with this but this figured out that this looks like sine of 2x and this is a negative cosine of X so if you by knowing what the actual functions are that are drawing these graphs you could then visualize those add those two things together actually we could make this happen super fast I know I said I was gonna do body pics but I just got a let me let me know come back come come back to me here okay yes leave this page leave this page wave I just want to look at the simple wave exercise graph wave and wave this one right this is okay okay stop stop stop so let's let me I think this is something I can adjust so let's look at this start angle forget about the start angle angle is just always going to be zero and I want to draw map sine of the angle angle velocity oh I've done some ridiculous thing I'm going to simplify this angle is just going to be angle equals map X which goes between zero and width to between zero and 2pi times four so I want to get four cycles through the wave um and that's I'm gonna need something wider can I get some more space here let's make this let's give me let's give me some more space here why is this actually oh I can I know I'm standing in front of the code let me just remove myself for a second that's good let's make it much less high let's say and let's actually have this go between 50 and 150 there we go that looks more like what we're looking for and let's say begin shape and I can now I can bring myself back into this picture begin shape and shape stroke 255 no fill we can say sign of what am I looking to do right vertex get rid of this stroke there we go all right so there and let's give ourselves a lot more points to work with there we go so this is sine of X basically sine of X so if I were to do this here's sine of X when we said cosine of X then sine of two times angle so these are both of the graph those are both and then let's do one that's those two things added together and cosine and again this is like a sort of awful way that I'm doing this but I think it's going to demonstrate the idea let's run this and let's comment out the first two see does that look like the picture that is in the brilliant challenge it does it kind of looks like it's in Reverse right no I'm just yeah I wonder if oh because it's because the yaxis is flipped in a computer graphics system so I should really make all of these I should really just make this one two negative one to invert that and there we go so we have solved this particular brilliant challenge I am going to save this I like to go here I don't know if anybody posted an answer let's let's right here is p5.js code to demonstrate demonstrate adding two waves together let's put in a link source code let's do this let's do a quick take a screenshot of this and added it this is fun okay here we go come on drag and drop people oh oh yeah that's what I'm doing oops there we go alright so if you've made something please you comment here or all that stuff and thank you so much again to brilliant artwork for the sponsorship of the coding trade now very little time left but with the little time I have left I am going to go to reference body pics oh my goodness oh look at this there's a lot more to body pics you know I'm gonna come back and do a video on body pics next time let's just test out the idea I'm just gonna do this with you in the live context and not worry about the sort of like published tutorial because I do want to spend some more time talking about body pics and I think if I look up we're gonna see this is an excellent poster reference by dano vet who is a graduate student researcher at ITP and there are other other people credited here who have helped with this particular post but this is a post that describes the body pics model which does something quite similar to what the unit face model does but gives you a map of the body with colors assigned to different parts of the body so let's just see if I could get this to work if i duplicate my unit and all kind of like this is gonna just be practice maybe I will later this week pick back up with this I definitely I have to you know I said 1130 because I knew I had to leave by 1200 so let's see what I get here let's see here if I can let's load up this so this is a unit I'm just curious what happens if I literally allout I do is just change this to ml5 body pics I think I there's a bug where body pics doesn't work with preload but let's confirm that so body pics model ready so in theory I should be able to just do body pics here and everything should be the same right it's the same exact algorithm for segmenting images I'm going to take out this pixel processing thing and otherwise everything should be the same that's body pics body pics let's just see body pics that segment is not a function ml5 body pixel I think it doesn't work with preload let's comment it out this really shouldn't be up here I mean the order doesn't actually matter for how it works but this is very confusing to me so let's say body pics equals ml v body pics and then I'm going to have model ready and function model when the model has loaded let's try calling segment here and let's say the model is ready let's see what happens here if you want to classify a video past the video element into the constructor let's try sequencing this when the video is ready let's load the model and then when the model is ready let's call segment let's look at them I'm glad I'm looking at this now so I see it wants me this is very this is revealing a problem which is that we're inconsistent it seems this wants me to look to actually include the video to sort of assign body pics to that video which probably has some advantages but shouldn't be required but that's probably it's probably only going to work that way then I would do this without passing it the video specifically whoops okay image was expecting p5 image what failed let's look at the results it's not even draw anything so this isn't round we're two sort of debugging this is good for me okay ah so this is getting more stuff I'm getting masked background mask person oh there is so the properties that come back actually have different names which is fine mask background mask person so this actually makes more sense you know in some ways in that there are these masks that are coming back so let's take a look at what these look like what was one mask background mask background let's try that interesting so you can see it's giving me a solid color background remember blue is what I'm drawing behind so there's an alpha mask where it detects me as the person and it's it's all it's giving it all as one color so if I change masks this to mask person I miss I missus I was expecting different colors did I not hit save hmm so how does this particular example how do I get this is what I want do I have to give it the palette like if I don't give it the palette so I'm gonna investigate this further I'm hoping to come back Thursday morning this week Friday unfortunately does it seem like it's a good day for me this semester but I'll come back Thursday or Friday to continue this but let me let's just try to get a little bit further just to see and maybe those of you watching can investigate this and file some issues on ml5 so that we can kind of work on this so where do I create them all we've do this so I'm just gonna copy all of these options over when I say let options equal and then I'm gonna put in the options here let's see what happens ask background that's mask person is it only in the raw data is that where the I have to like get all the colors from the raw edge something is definitely I'm either missing something or mask background let's try that again these also seem like the same thing right there's no difference here oh no that's inverted huh let's look at ml5 examples and see if oh sorry ml five medical examination is not what I want let's go here p5.js body pics do we see it body pics image what Oh body pics parts that's what I was missing yeah look something is different in them version this is the this is the develop this is the release branch yeah that's the release branch Oh what am I doing wrong the stuff just worked like I'm like writing the examples in a outputs tried segmentation threshold body pics video create HSB palette okay that's a function video segmentation image so there's a segment with parts function so that's my problem and then this is like making a palette but I don't that I can just use the default palette or set the colors so let me go back oh my god we go back to my example I didn't realize it was a separate I'm you know read the read the manual I think is probably a video model segment segment with parts yes yes segments with parts I'm tired it's been two hours let me run this now and now you see this this is this was my version of it and now there's actually an image so this is image is what comes through here Wow mask back we got a we definitely I definitely want to make the AP is with you net and body pics more consistent so I don't want to open again of issue to discuss the naming and sort of style inconsistencies between these two models that would be super helpful and now I can say result image because I from you net I think you want the mask right and and what just happened here cannot read with a property undefined so okay let me get rid of these options for a second just use the defaults so I create the video when the video is ready I create the body pics model I load the body pics model tie it to the video and the model is ready I call segment with parts should then I get the results I set that to a variable call it again and then draw that segmented image and it would be actually interesting to draw it on top of the video just sort of curious what happens there and let's see what happens there we go and now if what if I wanted to what I could do is I could also get the mask could do some kind of masking but maybe if I just actually give it a little alpha right now I can sort of see ooh I need to say no tint here this is what I'm going for I can kind of see and I want to make it much more clear there so now we can sort of see what body picks is doing and in theory if I could get myself further from the camera you could see maybe more body parts great all right so hopefully this was helpful to you this is me sort of like figuring this out I'm gonna come back on Thursday and maybe do any addendums to the content the video tutorial that I hope to have edited together about the unit model as well as cover this body pics model a bit more so thank you everybody for watching I hope you enjoyed this livestream I sort of hit a wall like about five minutes ago I feel like maybe looks like a blood sugar thing going on I need to go eat some so like I think I got something in my eye but I'm gonna go I'm gonna take a break I've got a lot to to do for the rest of the day and tomorrow and I will hopefully be back in McKenney a hundred percent promises but I'm hoping to be back either Thursday or Friday this week if not next week and be on the lookout I know I keep teasing this maybe nobody's gonna like it I have no idea but I recorded a video from a different location not in this room and we I'm not gonna say anything more about it I look forward to seeing you next time on the coding train let's see if I can answer a couple questions why not make a logarithmic frequency analyzer on p5.js asks Andre yes great question that I would encourage you to do so that would probably that might be a more accurate and effective way of actually making a tuner I was just kind of curious to go through the different pre train models that are in ml5 library the live stream it's always at this time asks Felipe I wish so there was a brief moment in time last year where I had a consistent every Wednesday at 1000 a.m. live stream 1000 a.m. Eastern I'm in the Eastern time zone I'm in New York City I'm in Brooklyn actually Brooklyn New York but I haven't figured that out yet for this year so soon I hope to establish that but at the moment your best way to find out when the next live stream is or fortunately subscribe to the channel and and click the notification bell thing because when I schedule it you'll get a notification but I do expect I can tell you this week that if there is another live stream this week the only two times I'm available to do so right now are Thursday morning around 900 1000 a.m. Eastern or Friday morning around 900 or 1000 a.m. Eastern so one might be scheduled for those two times I would probably like add it the night before or the morning of what's the fastest JavaScript engine on the Mac no idea there's somebody else left answer make a tutorial how to make a bar graph spectrum with logarithmic frequency scaling p5 sound I'm pretty sure I have that p5 sound FFT I'm this video right here on the coding train 1711 I'm pretty sure somewhere in this video I do something like that here yeah there you go so I think if you check out this video where I am very red or am I just very pale here I'm not sure you'll find that rendering 3d ray marching yeah I have I have a lot of coding challenges that I want to have a long list marching squares is kind of on the top of that list ah oh this is so important that you're asking so remember I spun the wheel I'm not spinning the wheel that still got to work out this wheel system nekima asked will you do the coal Lots conjecture coding challenge like the wheel said last Friday here's the thing I already did it this other video series so it's gonna come out soon the first one this week is not the Collatz conjecture I don't want to spoil too much but I did it it will be coming out if I had to guess right now that's one's probably gonna be next week so I'm hoping to have a coding challenge once a week or once every two weeks with a slightly different format we've ever have Joshua Davis as a guest great idea for a guest right now I'm not up and running to have guests when I can get back up and running to have guests Joshua Davis would be a great guest heartbeats and sound get octave bands and log averages yeah those are all great ideas limited time in the world oh wait alka made a brilliant thing let's go code dot code code pen dot io / alka am I gonna find it here like recent showcase all right I'll just gonna lazily type in pen /qb be easy RW everyone should check out coding trained viewer alkis code pen there's lots of great examples there qbb capital e there we go oh this is much nicer much better thank you thank you for doing that oh I I'm no longer in my goodbye rainbow song we'll just speed over to the end here so thank you everybody I will leave the wallpaper slide up for a few minutes so the chat can keep going but I'm going to say goodbye now I'm gonna thank you especially to thank you to everyone who supports me or even just watches or like to the person who said hello to me on 4th Avenue in Brooklyn yesterday I doubt you're watching but somebody came up to me and say hey coding trained and I said that's me and that was like a wonderful part of my day so Christopher Jessup for your super chats all the other super chats the members the viewers the people the people who help operate the New York City Transit System that got me here this morning I want to thank everyone goodbye
