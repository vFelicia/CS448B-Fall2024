hello I'm here again two days in a row boo oh I forgot to put my cloaking device here which I will do on my extra laptop which now has my all my ukulele chords on it I don't see anyone actually saying anything to me in a chat I'm not sure if I've actually started or if I'm just imagining it I'm going to check the patron group here looking up people are saying hello to me okay so good morning it's not really the morning anymore it's almost noon I've got a couple hours here and the project for today is a tensorflow J s classification project so just a recap I was here yesterday and I did a couple coding challenges if I recall correctly there was that let's open them up I haven't uploaded the code yet actually but let's just rip they were so nice I really liked them so take a minute to review them I definitely want to spend the entire two hours cleaning data if that had thought what happens that's gonna be worth it cuz that's kind of I was gonna say half the battle but I think it's all over the battle in machine learning is really thinking about your data open recent oh you know I moved everything I don't know why I'm looking for this I just want to run I want to run these I enjoyed them so much yesterday and I'm gonna go here I think I put them in here but what were they sand piles what was the other one remembers and piles what was it who's gonna tell me before I remember before I forget before I forget oh boy I think my brain is turned off today this is bad Oh Barnsley fern that's right sand piles where the sand piles go let's go all right here we go sand piles let's let's reduce the size here beautiful sand piles oh let's do this now while people are taking their time joining here gotta make that bonsly's for herd size Rufus all right let's see yeah somebody sent me K week Mon sent me some cords for somewhere over the rainbow ah oh I have to I have to provide my email to get a free trial if i refresh this page what's the minor this ooh okay all right so I'm just getting myself kind of mentally into shape we've got our sand piles I meant to zoom in on these and good morning hello good day good day I wish you good day for this all right so let's let's check out where we are I got a let's get ourselves centered and figure it and figure out what we're going to work on so I'm going to go to github.com slash coding train I am going to go to this crowdsource color data repository oh they're simple requests and all right so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go to this page so this is where we were yesterday oh and many people from the community made some poor requests and change the design I think that's brown I think that's like greenish greenish greenish pinkish alright so this is my crowdsource color data example what's going on here I need some tape and so this is what I need now I also need to go to so the next video in this sequence tutorial sequence I am going to talk about cleaning the data and so what I'm going to do is actually I think I'm gonna write I was going to just download it directly from firebase database so the so I need to talk about the rules that were updated and I think what I'm gonna also do is I'm going to turn off writing so okay how can I put a comment in here no is there any way to put a comment in I wonder if this will work if I change this to false and then temp like for writing publish like well let me air saving rules oh so it needs expect line 8 expected curly bracket mmm I guess I just need to take this out just do false and how do you know all this me I am so me how do you know all this okay so let's go back to write false and so now I change the rules of the database if I go here hit refresh and try to click greenish great permission denied alright so I just wanted to shut off writing to the database temporarily I guess mmm why not just leave it on let's leave it on it son so unlike me let's make sure it's back that looks bluish to me great alright so I need to talk about the data the data the data the data so what I'm going to do in this video and let me get a sketch going that read the data so if p5 tensorflow crowdsource color let's see clean data let's open up terminal did not sleep well last night no no no did not sleep well last night this evening I will be attending Harry Potter and the cursed child on Broadway very excited about that no spoilers although I kind of know what's gonna happen anyway since I have read before what am i doing ok desktop p5 tensorflow no oh I want to be in desktop this is not boding well yeah fine there we go alright let's go to here so I've got firebase I've got this I want to go to here closed I don't want to reference this one ok and of course the camera goes off right now I don't know why I don't see the YouTube chat there we go so Adam and 1/2 in the chat asks can we contribute to the crowdsourcing so yes I would say like hold off right now as I'm go what I'm going to use what is currently there for the purpose of today's livestream but of course I'm glad for it to continue to be improved and then I will come back in future live streams potentially in reference it is this sound ok today I just wanna make sure the microphones not peeking I suppose I could listen to my own sound I could listen to my own voice just to find out test one two test test test one two I think it sounds fine okay okay and so so then what I need to do is I want to go to clean data here and open up the Adam editor I got to have a work flow day a day just to like redo all my workflow stuff clean data I'm gonna get to some actual content in a moment okay firebase let's go Schiffman net a to Z firebase so I think I have all the URLs I need and then retrieve data push call back I'm just looking for retrieving data if only somebody would make a tutorial on retrieving data for firebase then I would know how to do it hello Meier Thank You sponser Meijer in the chat oh I think coding garden with CJ is happening right now oh no in 30 minutes that'll be done by then I'll be done by then right reference on got data err data alright this is gonna do okay I think I want once all right I just want to use the once function what did what did Panzer on github use to retrieve the data load data then show loading where's the load data function return' database once that's what I want once I don't know why I have this on I want I want once okay close enough okay okay whoops I've totally lost the chat and everything here alright once value callback is good yeah you know um so me I am so me is asking not just gonna export it from the console so that was my original plan was that exported from the console and then like bring it into a Google Doc spreadsheet and then like you know clean it there but then I realized I think I might actually be better at cleaning it from JavaScript itself because what I could quickly do is just like do like a count I could I could visualize it so I think I want to do just the first so in this series which is just to kind of remind myself where I am if I go to the coding train and I go to neural networks in machine learning I think I am at this point in session 7 which is building a classifier with building a classifier with tensorflow j/s and so so far what I have done is I just did I think one or two kind of shoot short tutorials about crowdsourcing the data and I also wanted to reference somebody maybe this lack channel can help me out with this someone in the sent me a message I believe in the patron slack channel yesterday referencing a video about research into human perception and color that seemed kind of relevant so because sure that with me again that would be helpful okay so I think other than that I am ready to begin I don't wait on this I want this to be empty and so I'm starting with here I'm moving to here and then I'm starting with here I'm moving to here then to here then I'm gonna go then to here here and then on this is a reference okay I think I am ready to begin nobody remembers this research that was somebody I guess I could try to find it myself oh the World Cup started I made my picks want to hear my picks I don't want embarrass myself and I don't what I don't want to cause a chat to go off the rails won't give you my six picks I pick I mean the like what do you call those things a pool friendly five dollars so I don't think you know I don't think I'm gonna break the bank here winning or losing but I am kind of excited about the World Cup okay it was from was from Bruno Oh first of all I've got to show this to everybody bear please please humor me for just one moment I'm gonna go to Twitter what am i logged in its coding train notifications let's find mentions well here it is already this is like my favorite alright so if you watch the stream yesterday oops okay hold on now I need to I need so first of all it's weirdest out of here in front of it I need to give you the sound from the laptop which is not gonna come through unless I change oh what a silly world we live in if I do multi output device now you will get it okay ready I'm gonna mute my microphone so I don't talk over this oops oops color data should actually be colors let me color data based on the way with the code thank you thank you thank you okay so thank you for indulging Kate I've really appreciated that it's that Bruno took the time to remix all that insane footage from yesterday I was doing something more important though and I am going to go back here and just put the sound back here then yes the surprising pattern behind color names around the world so let me find that this the the surprising pattern behind color names around the world okay all right so coming back to the chat okay okay so all right okay I wore the same buddy yesterday have you not noticed that I just wear the same hoodie every day I do have two of these though one says 2017 and what this one says 2018 because this is the current IDP camp lady and I was wearing this one yesterday I also have some emergency hoodies here ah like a unicorn one this is the old coding train branded hoodie there's a new one that's in the store now anyway I don't know let's get let's get started here let's cycle these cameras definitely gonna need to do some whiteboard erasing and using alright hello I'm back again in my third I can't keep track of this stuff video building a classification example using a neural network and tensorflow dot j s so where i last left off which was actually in real time yesterday you know you might be watching these in sequence I built this a simple web app to crowdsource color classification and the wonderful Internet pull requested a bunch of nice features and so you can see this right here I'm just gonna say this one looks greenish and oh look at this I'm just gonna be grayish reddish so I'm adding some data purplish so thank you to all the people who you could check the github repository in the commit history to see everyone who submitted a bunch of these changes to improve the visual design now unfortunately I made a little bit of a mistake which is that mistake but I left the database the firebase database completely open and I thought why not that's gonna be easiest I trust you the viewing audience to not mess with the database too much but it didn't it went off the rails a little bit and so I want to thank I'm totally going in the wrong order here let me start over ah but maybe it doesn't really matter I also didn't like that a sort of like color that I couldn't see came up so let me just start up for choose one it's not super important in the end I don't know oh you are you all talking about Adam you know here's the thing the more but when people tell me to switch to a different editor because it's better or cooler or more current that usually has the reverse effect on me no no my editor because the point is it doesn't really matter so much it kind of doesn't matter but I don't let's not let's not discuss all right hello welcome to the third video in my build a classifier with p5.js and tension flores and there's a neural network in there so I'm really exploring this machine learning library tensorflow yes I wanted to come up with a creative example that shows the full classification process from collecting data training and then deploying a machine learning model and so the example that I'm working with is this idea of color classification so I'm crowdsourcing this data from you the viewing audience and if I look at this I so you might remember I built this little web app in the previous video I think that was yesterday and then now it's today 24 hours later it's been improved thank you to the internet the wonderful people who have pull requested various design fixes and updates you can check all that out on github to see who the contributors were now let me let me add a few things here Brown its kind of brown that's purplish that's blueish now one thing I will mention thank you Bruno who brought this up in the patron slack Channel I sort of said yesterday you know I just want to pick a trivial data set I want to make something that's not that has very little sort of like meaningfulness to it just to sort of demonstrate the whole process but there is something kind of interesting going on here in theory which is that we're looking at human perception and and I'm not I'm not mathematically calculate like labeling a color according to the RGB values I'm asking you the viewers to tell me what you think a color is and so there is a lot of interesting scientific research in this area and I'll reference this video but that talks about Berkeley researchers and other research around the surprising pattern behind color names around the world so there's a lot there that you could dig into so maybe there's more here than I might originally have thought the problem with what I built over here is that you know you're wonderful I love all of you who actually use videos and believe me nice feedback will leave me critical feedback and all that sort of stuff but yeah the database a little bit a little bit off the rails because I just left the rules wide open anybody can write and anybody can read to the database and so thankfully pans are on github left a pull request analyzing the data and looking at kind of like ok well there's a lot of stuff here that looks wrong maybe there were some bots that started classifying colors and so all these functions to analyze and filter the data so I encourage you to check out this wonderful pull request I pull request is now part of the repository however it took a slightly different approach which is and thanks to me I am so me who helped me with this which is that I changed the rules so the rules yesterday were just basically read true write true these are the firebase rules and me I am Sammy helped me look into how you could customize the rules and the things that have been added to the rules now are we have some things to validate to make sure the RGB value is being put in the database are actually numbers so you can see how this looks here new data is a number and it's between 0 and 255 we have something to validate that the label you know one of the things that people put other words that weren't part of my set of classification labels into the database so I have to check that it's a string and that the actual data's value matches this regular expression so if you've never seen regular expressions before I do happen to have a video series about that that you could go watch but this you can see that it matches any of these it's so that's protecting and then I was turned on so what you don't see is that it's anonymous authentication but you can only write if you've been on fanta gated this way it's anonymous I can track every person or every entry and it's not necessarily a person but every entry from a particular IP address into the database with a unique ID so if I can see that there's a bot that's just flooding the database I could either block it or just like clean that data out of it so that's what I'm going to do in this video I'm gonna use a similar approach to this pull request I'm going to actually read the data from the database and then I'm gonna like analyze it and delete stuff if it's it seems like it's no good and then download a JSON file that I'll then use in the 10th floor KS example that I'm going to build did I just spend the whole video introducing this topic I think I might have but I'm gonna move on and keep going anyway pause all right please please be nice to each other and don't argue about ID ease of the chat just just for once what one day could you just say like your IDE is great and so is mine isn't it nice how we use two different ones and maybe we can learn from each other that could be a thing right and of course I forgot to reference this which I wanted to do but that's okay I will come back to that so the next thing I need to do is the next thing I need to do is actually start writing the code to look at the data I should probably turn off now I should set the thing to false because I just don't want it to I think I'm gonna set it to false right now just so I'm just setting it to false so if you're watching this live you currently can't submit any more entries I just want to have it be fixed while I'm doing this and then this I can close this oh I should leave firebase open it's fine and then this I want this to say clean data wow the chat is so quiet today in this Thank You Fuji for repeating my words exactly alright so I think I'm ready to do this now shoot oh my goodness there we go before I dig into the code let me just reference one more webpage to you I want to show you this is a project that's at the time of this recording it hasn't technically been released yet well you can find it at ml5 jazz organ it probably is released now that you're watching this video but ml5 is a machine learning library built on top of tensorflow das that i and other folks at ITP have been working on and I just want a reference on Hannah Davis who's an artist and researchers contributor ml5 wrote this wonderful tutorial about making your own datasets and thinking about questions to ask in particular about responsible data collection and tagging and crowdsourcing so hopefully it'll come back to this topic again and again in my video tutorials but I would encourage you to check this out and really think about it one thing we could think about here is number one I'm building an example that requires people to see the colors so what about people who are colorblind low vision or blind eye should that's something I really should be thoughtful about in this example how can I approach that and then you know who's really able to participate in tagging and submitting data who's being left out so I think the good news for me is this is meant to be somewhat of a generic tutorial and the data Wow does it matter so much if it's perfect because I just want to show that whole process but you then actually being a person who might work with machine learning out in the real world you really want to be thoughtful about about that data and I hope that I can link to more resources about that and cover that more on this channel as well so all that aside now I'm ready to dig in and look at the data and do the thing that's probably gonna take me the next 24 hours or three days or three weeks try to clean the data and make it usable for me so yeah that's what I'm gonna do okay so I have I have a client I mean I could do this I could download the data directly from firebase and just put it in like a Google sheet to look at it that might be useful i but what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna actually write a p5 sketch or just a JavaScript program to look at the data first so I have I have this sketch all that's in it so far is just that connect to firebase and authenticate so what I want to do is to retrieve I think I say something like database once value and then I have a call back like got data I don't know if this is right and by the way I've learned that the JavaScript recently the JavaScript convention which is not very P which is not how p5 necessary works is often the error is first as the callback arguments and then the results is second I don't know I'm just speculating what the firebase API might be like let's see what happens database once is not a function I probably need dot ref and then I probably need like colors or something right probably something like this I could just go and look on the documentation I also have this firebase tutorial oh yeah I need the database reference and then uh I'd like to toriel I say dot on but really an i/o got one and got error data so maybe there's two callbacks who knows who knows let's say let's do this let ref equal database ref colors and then let's say ref once value got data and let's look at see what comes back let's go back to here alright something came back no nothing came out nineteen Oh No eighteen this is no time to take a break for a second I like now that I have video consistent video editing I really I really have a very different world which is like I need to take a break and I also couldn't take breaks not that I'm digging your brain either like a mental break alright what's going on here I maybe I should go back and look at my actual example got one error data so let's oh that's a pointer to the data right so actually the data so so so it actually is a separate callback for error looks like so I'm gonna like not worry about the error callback right now I'm gonna use it's got data and then let's look at the results and so yeah this looks weird like how could I possibly use this so what you're actually getting back is like this pointer to the data you've got to call functions on it to actually look at what's there so presumably something like results dot value is probably what the API is yo is not a function so I have to go back and look at my tutorials dot Val let's try that let's try it Val and there we go look at this oh it's a lot of data boy that console is not able to render this so now is this actually an array ah it's just actually an object with all the data in it so I need to turn that into an array what's because I kind of want to loop through it wonder what's the oh you know what I'll do this is what I'm gonna do I am going to so now I'm going to process the data so first let me just get all the keys so I can say objects got keys so let me just say let data equal results dot Val let's not console.log that object keys data and then console dot log keys dot length and I don't need this page anymore and I'm going back to here clean data so there's five thousand nine hundred and two entries into the database this is never going to change cuz just while I'm recording this video I shut off the ability to write to the database okay so what we can actually start to do now is I could say for let key of keys and I could say let record equals data key + i could say console log record so this is going to log all 5,000 of those one at a time I think so I could see these are all it's just logging every single data point and we can see that there for every single one there's an R a G and a B the label and then this user ID so now I think there was I have watching the database this morning I think there was a bot that was posting to it so now it's possible it could be that there's just one person who actually clicked a lot of times but so what I'm gonna do right now to just examine the data a little bit is I am going to look at the user by user ID and count up how many entries for each user ID so I basically need to do something like a concordant so if I say UID if I look at that we can see there's all the user IDs and what I want to do now is just associate so I'm gonna just say user ID by count and I'm going to say is an object I'm sure there's all these higherorder oh sorry I've seen looking at the chat pause for a sec oh I could have just done let record of data yeah that would the of works for an object not just an array okay interesting interesting Oh pause for a second actually the chat just gave me some good feedback which you know I they actually I guess the four of loop will work with an object and not just an array so I can actually just say let record of data and let me just do this no that didn't work data is not iterable let record in data hmm all right edit that out the object ID values yeah it's fine I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it my way gonna keep going alright me I am sue me you've saved me so many times that you could do no wrong alright data record okay oh right I could anyway I'm gonna do it my way you the this is all about learning how do it my wage or do it your way we learn from each other Oh so what I want to do is I want to say if user ID by count of that okay so I need the ID which is this if user ID by count ID it does not exist then I want to set it to 1 otherwise I want to increase it and then I want to console.log that so let's look at this should give me all the user IDs by how many people by how many entries they have so we can look 35 33 78 147 208 189 what's the record here to a 1 there was something I've already forgot 236 so what's is there anything suspicious here that's the question let me think about this I well do you remember the user ID of the thick that we detected was probably a bot I should sort these there's the promise it's in an object not an array I'll be really easy to sort them if I made it into an array I guess I could have the keys I should sort them let me sort them all right it's probably worth me sorting this this is why sure just put everything into a spreadsheet it's gonna sort it myself so in order to sort it I want users I'm also gonna have an array that I'm gonna sort and so if I find a new ID I'll put that in the array and then I want to say users dot sort and now I need a comparing function to compare two of them a B and I'm just gonna say return user ID by count a minus user ID by count B so that'll sort the array and a sorting probably makes a new array I think the can't remember does it change the array or make a new array so right I want to sort the users array and then I'm just going to do let ID of users I'm just going to iterate over the array and console.log user ID plus user ID by count for that one so I know I'm kind of like whoops this would be a good time for me to use those new string literals someday I'll get to that so let's take a look at this what did I get wrong looks like I did that worked amazingly that worked so we can see somebody just did one thank you thank you no let me get oh I who did one and then we can see here 236 entries from this particular user sort is in place okay so which one is the bot fpq this one interesting interesting okay want template strings not template literals alright these by the way are cut a template literals is what I meant by the way since I mentioned it let's actually use it this is a new feature of es6 I'm here why not where if I use backtick I can create a string that's just with variables with this syntax I believe does this go out here yes that goes there so what this does is in other words I could say user submitted so I can just write a full string and then basically anything that's in between these dollar sign and curly brackets is rendered as a variable value so now if I run this again hmm I don't know why that didn't yes you can see now it has that full and I kind of don't want all this extra stuff I was just showing you that you can put together a string and so okay so I happen to know based on earlier research of the day and watching that this particular user is a bot but I am getting the suggestion from the chat to just discard anything that's over 100 so it looks like this so that's so those are some some those are ways that I could do this but I'm just like stopping and starting like a crazy I'm very sorry I'm ATS yeah it's 1230 I'm just thinking about the time today and what to do next I feel like to visualize this data was I think that would be interesting yeah both changes the array and returns me one okay another correction I just got is that I believe users dot sort actually changes the array and you know since I've started using arrow syntax I could write it this way which is perhaps a bit more readable but who knows okay so here's the question what do I do to clean this data well one thing I could do first is actually analyze it so oh stop I'm gonna do I'm gonna go into an ood so faulty today I'm gonna I'm gonna go to the to the next this was long enough so I'm gonna do another part alright so the question here really is what to do next I know that this from my analysis earlier looking at this the things being added to the database that this appeared to be a bot I also could the chat suggested I could just remove everything that's 100 or more I'm actually gonna stop this tutorial this was sort of like getting to actually be in a look at the data and I'm gonna do a whole next video because what I think might be useful is actually just look at the data cuz I can this is this is information I can visualize like I could say show me everything that's pinkish show me everything that's blueish and I could also say like ignore this I could see I could see by user what they I could actually look at what they science could try to see is something really just way out there that maybe I shouldn't include okay so that's what I'm doing in the next video I'm going to add some tools to visualize the data and just while I'm in case it was mentioned if you I apologize that uh the read reading of the database is open so why you can't write to it right now you can read from it and so if you want to use this code this code is also on that github repo if anybody wants to try like messing with it themselves they can okay okay all right cleaning my data part two that's where we are where I last left off geniusly your data whoa the suspense was killing you I know I had just retrieved all the data from firebase and I looked at it by anonymous user ID how many entries had been submitted by each user and I have a suspicion that some of these that submitted a lot of entries maybe wasn't actually a person doing it manually but and and maybe like a bot or something flooding the database so let's try to investigate that and see what we can figure out so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna visualize the data I could visualize it by user ID there's so many things I could do but let's think about it so there were there are how many labels so let me think about this okay this is my sketch I know what the labels are so let me just I'm gonna need let me just set up a variable called data data by you know color by label and this will be an object and the object will have empty arrays for each one of the labels so there was blue ish I should have a list of this somewhere greenish doing this manually I could have actually pulled the labels from the database but this will be simpler a greenish pink ish I'm not doing this in any particular order greyish red ish what am I missing purple ish there was a brown ish if I go to my crowdsource color reddish greenish bluish oranges I do orange I don't think I did orange orange orange ish purplish greyish brownish one two three four five six seven eight nine I'm missing one blue green pink great this is not a very systematic way to tick red green blue orange purple but yellowish I didn't do yellowish okay yellow now while I am looping through the data which I did in the previous video and I'm gonna not worry about this users by count thing right now I'll come back to that I'm going to not worry about this users by counting right now I will come back to that later what I want to do is oh sorry I do need I do want this so I want to look at each data point and I want to look at the RG so I want to look at the label and I want to say color by label and then I want a record dot label push and so I'm gonna create a color let color equal I'll use the p5 color function to say record our record G record B color by label push color and now what I should have and I'm really risking breaking the console here is I should have all the RGB values listed by the label so let's look at that oops I'm in the wrong sketch right so we can see there's a thousand blues 16 there's only two 35 Gray's so one thing that's also important about what I've done with my data set here is I don't have a uniform amount of data points by label I have many more green ones and actually a Eric in the patron group made a point that the way that colors are picked the way my random number generator works or you're gonna be more greenish looking colors which is sort of interesting to think about but at the very least what I can do now is I could just draw all of the colors so I'm trying to think of what I probably want to do like little rectangles and a p5 canvas maybe so let me add create canvas and let's make it 400 by 400 and let me let's do just one let's just start with a bluish and I'm going to say a four let I equals zero I is less than so let's see let me say let blues' equal color by label blue ish and I'm gonna look at all those and let's start with an X let's start with a y let's say fill blues index I and then let's draw a rectangle at XY that's 10 comma 10 will increase X by 10 and if Y is greater than or equal to width then we will a reset X back to 0 and increase Y by 10 now this is in very again I'm not being that thoughtful about this but in theory I should see now when I run this all the lose now why did it not wrap around oh if X is greater than width and I want to say no stroke and I could sort I probably would want to sort these two I could sort them by like brightness so we can see here ah look at this these are all the Blues that were submitted to the database so you know I kind of don't mind that the data has some noise in it I mean big deal the point of this is to crowdsource it and maybe training the model if there's enough data it will sort of filter out the noise but you know I and the question is why is this here why is this here what should I do about that let's just look at some other ones let's look at red you can see okay what's interesting is I think these are in the in the order by which they were submitted so there probably was a time period here where where there probably was a time period here where some like bad data was entered let's look let's look at green cuz Green has the most right that's pretty good so what do I do oh boy what do I do about this thinking pause for a second oh that's such a good idea I mean I am some he has a great idea in the chat right oh that's a great point Luke makes a great point all right so great great points just came up in the chat right now one is Luke B writes pretty good to have the outliers to encourage prevention of overfitting the neural network so this is actually true in you know one thing you have to watch out for is that your your model the model that I'm going to train to do this color classification what if it it just works so well with the training data that it doesn't work so well with new data and having a bit of noise in the training data can actually help with that another me I am swimmy rights make it so clicking on a pixel prince who did it the user ID that is and also maybe highlights all the other ones with the same user ID that I love so let's add that that's gonna be that's not gonna be the easiest thing but it's worth doing let me see if I can add that so okay so if I click the mouse mouse pressed I can I can like it's sort of like I would be in theory Mouse X divided by 10 and J would be right this is where I'm clicking I'm looking for the I and J not the X&Y like sort of like the I and J of what I'm clicking on Mouse Y divided by 10 and then I should be able to get the index then by saying I plus J times and then the width divided by 10 again I really really really should be using variables for these numbers like 10 and putting putting in like an of Erebus for like columns and rows but let's just try this right now let's try then saying console.log and so let's let me make a I'm gonna call this color I'm gonna call this like label I'm just gonna call this label and I'm just let's let's go with a bluish to start again so I'm gonna use here color by label label and let's make color by label colored by label already is a global variable so I'm going to say console dot log okay so let data equal color by label that label and then I should go to a console log D data index think this will be right and like make some mistakes here let's see what happens alright let me click here alright so I got something oh yeah so one thing that's like kind of unfortunate is oh I don't have the user ID I don't have to use it so I got the color but I'm not actually storing the full data thing oh yeah so color by label this is what I need to do I want color by label actually to store the whole record we don't actually want to store the color let's store the whole record then when I visualize it I can just ask for the RGB values right because then when I click on something this is now that entry so I can see like right if I click on this we can see I look at this this user right I'm clicking on these they're all the same user this user Y gdq seems to have some faulty data so i could filter out this user i could do something nice where like as I'm hovering I highlight everything but I think I'm not gonna go that far I'll let anybody who wants to contribute to to I'll let you try that on your own maybe but so let me make a list here of users that I might want to filter out whether I'm happy to have the noise or not that's a question but let's let's let me just make this a little smaller it's a little harder for you to see it but I think it's gonna be easier in terms of space so okay so let's look at a few more that are maybe like clearly not good same user it's all that same user I haven't found them that let's look up here ah different user so this user also looks like it maybe has some bad data oops let's look at a different color let's look at let's look at what was like there is very little of greyish that's we couldn't this user is now suspect you know the thing is a user might have miss clicked so unless I see it consistently yeah I'm not gonna the user could have missed clicked all right so you get the idea okay so you get the idea now there's so many ways that I could be more thoughtful about this and add more features to work on cleaning the data but let's just say for right now and and people are suggesting like I could algorithmically like I could actually evaluate the numbers and see like compute the hue and see if the hue match is labeled but I don't I specifically do not want to do that because what I specifically want from this is this idea of human perception of color and I don't want to use math because I could create my own data at data set with math of like putting colors into certain buckets and in a way I don't even want to do what I just did right here which is eliminate certain users and I and I probably should just visualize what I should do with these users now is actually actually let me do this do what these users now is I'm actually just going to look at all of their entries and see so let's let's add that as one more thing you can stop watching this video go on because I'm gonna build a machine learning model in the future videos but if you want to keep watching I'm gonna do let's do one more thing like let's take this user and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to comment out this this drawing thing that I'm doing and I want to create a I want to say color data by user and I'm going to make that an array and I just want to say if record user ID equals a particular user then I want to say a user user data and I could build an interface to do all this would be so much better but I don't really have time to do all that this particular series so that might be something exercise you do for yourself user data dot push the record and then down here I could use this exact same algorithm oh but you know what I don't want to do it that's what I want to do I'm gonna use Dom elements now I think I'm gonna say for let color for let entry it's an entry like of user data I'm gonna say create a div I'm going to just make a div and then I'm gonna say div and actually let me let me create a div with entry dot label in it so let's just try this whoops not the string and let me get rid of the canvas so these are all these are all of this particular users entries I maybe I should sort them by let's sort them by the label so let's so let's say user data sort a comma b return a dot label greater than B dot label so this is whoops oh and I don't need to say return if I use the arrow syntax I'm really just off the deep end here in this video I'm gonna I think this is right that should sort it yes there we go so we can see now it's uh that's weird just pausing for a second there's a great comment in the chat from Sam D could we separate out the different things into functions by color by user by whatever classifier rather than commenting out lots of stuff yes this would be an absolutely great thing to do so I'm gonna publish this and I would love to to get user comments and user submissions of like making a nice interface for this I'm but I'm trying to figure out why I didn't sort this right now let's see I thought sort oh oh I have to return zero I can't return true or false compare okay okay these are strings yes okay these are strings so this is going to give me a true or false but the sort function wants like a negative or positive number so I'm actually just going to break this out I know I could do this with those ternary operators but I'm just gonna say if return 1 else return negative 1 and this should this should do the trick right so let's take a look at this now there we go bluish greenish reddish so we could see this is now sorted by that particular user and then all I need to do is add oh I need to make something that color box I guess I couldn't make that a div that lives inside a color box size 10 comma 10 and then color box style and these are all p5 Dom functions background color are oh now this would be a great time to use those template literals because what I want to do is say RGB entry entry our entry G and what happened it's entry dot B right this is CSS for making an RGB color I believe let's see how this works what's the chance this works yeah okay oh but now what I want to do is say color box parent and I want it to be in line so how do I do that color box style displayinline so what it is no who well you get the idea there's somebody is you because you can see is pretty inconsistent there's just the colors are just so wildly different that I think we can kind of say that this user we can filter out and I could look at some of these other users now like let's look at this user where did I let's look at this user everything seems to be a bluish that doesn't look like great data and let me look at this user and again doing I'm doing this so manually in my code could easily build an interface to look at all this grayish grayish greenish greenish brownish bluish blues yeah this looks too inconsistent so you know it's fine to have some way so I think we're done here you get the point that we're not completely done because I need to I want to just like create a JSON file of all of the data but and I'll do that in the next video anybody's still watching this right now so where I could add some background to the text and some padding that's a greater there's also the way I could visualize this with if I had any sort of talent or knowledge about CSS and design but you the viewer will hopefully improve this but you can sort of see the process of looking at the data visualizing it and getting a sense of it and now what I might want to do is actually like filter and save the data I will do that in the next video which will be a very short one I think oh I forgot to check the bots let me check the bots how come I don't have the bots here let's do this real quick which one was the bot again this one what would a mess what a mess I'm making of all this the bots not so bad the bots actually has the thing that those the bot has good data that's really interesting the thing we thought was the bot seems to have good data my apologies to the bots oh the thing I thought was a bot I mean you know you could you could make the argument that some of these might not be exactly right and it's actually only doing oh it's only doing no it's got pink and orange and purple in there huh that's not a bot so I was wrong I I thought so the reason why I thought it was a bot was because the moment I wiped the database I wiped the database at one point then I just saw consistently at like very very distinct intervals entering stuff in really really fast it could have been a person I know I'm not sure it's a bot and it looks like it was it looks like it's entering generating the data with a hue so maybe this data is too good anyway I'm not going to worry about this too much I got to move on also it's one o'clock so I only have about 45 minutes yeah some of those are you could say you could say are greenish oh and I'm out of my caffeinated beverage which is really bad okay all right so I'm gonna I'm gonna let this be I'm going to let this be and now I'm going I want to make a new whoops no I'm just like a new sketch call download data and download data so what do we think should I keep this one or sort the entries by their key oh that's interesting that's that would be an interesting to do so I am now going to go to download data and I'm gonna get rid of all this stuff so I just have stuff I had from before this should actually be an object okay so my question is should I filter all four of these or should I should I leave that bot one that one we think is a bot are you out there are you out there person who wrote the bot or human being who wasn't a bot but actually was clicking still Ian writes is Dan actually reading these comments every once in a while I am yes so let's just say we want to filter these out that's interesting Simon has an interesting suggestion to say to filter the noise out you can calculate the average for each color and if the distance in between each color and the average color is greater than some threshold you can filter it out yeah so I'm gonna that's that's the pot is good keep the bot alright people are saying it doesn't really matter I'm in the in the end the point is for this tutorial series for me is to just show the process and I've said like to do the process in a reasonable manner but if I can't I can okay alright so now here we go okay okay looks where's the bot I felt like I needed to do is dedicate a song to the bot fpq sd6 cvn f qm r p j DD IQ j + 3 Thank You bot no the ukulele is a bad idea alright let's move on I'm gonna cycle those cameras will I get to tensorflow yes today seems unlikely seems unlikely but not impossible not impossible oh hello part three of pleating the data supposedly poof it's a lot of work just dealing with data is a whole project unto itself it's I've been here for like 72 hours straight I haven't even looked at tension flow yet I'm just looking at my data and all I'm doing is color classification all right I can't I can't a little bit but it's true it's true so this is the third video what I if you watch the previous two I started trying to visualize what the data looked like and kind of examine are there certain users that I should filter out that's bad data maybe I should just leave it all in there anyway I'm trying to build a model that looks at the color and classifies it into one of these buckets and this is my crowdsourced system that allows people to look at colors and click on one of these buckets so it's a little bit about like human perception what does the I sort of see in terms of RGB color all right so um the code base I'm starting with is from the previous video I'm just connecting to the firebase database and I am looping through and looking at each record one at a time each record has a user ID which is anonymous it has an R a G a B and a label so I determined you know not somewhat loosely I didn't you know I really need to spend more time more thoughtful about this there's an extra comma here that these are the three users that I would like to filter out so what I want to do in this video by the end of it let's have a JSON file that I can print if I wanted to I'm not going to print it hold in my virtual hands these are my real hands and use that to actually build a machine learning model from so all I need to do if I want to filter these out just what I did is I made an object that just has those three user IDs as keys arbitrarily with a value of true and then what I can do is I could say if if if filter if filter does not include this records user ID and so let's just say let ID equal record user ID if it's not in the filter let's make a let's say all data is a big array and actually what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make it an object you'll see why in a second that has a I'm just gonna call it like entries which is an array then I'm going to say all data dot entries dot push that record so what I want to do is I want to look at every single data point shine begin there's some nice high order function I could do this in one line of code but I'm doing this very manually I'm gonna look at every record I'm gonna check the user ID if as long as that isn't one of my user IDs that I'm filtering out I'm gonna put it in my all data entries array and then I'm going to say save JSON color data JSON all data now this is a p5 function that will then put this JSON file into my downloads directory and I could be doing this a node and server side there's no reason we have clientside code doing this but that's what I'm doing right now so let's run this and see what happens this is my download data script okay a index of is not a function firebase I don't know save JSON okay so this may be let's look at maybe it's actually goes like this the data and then the file name I think that's what yes there we go so we can see right here this downloaded now I can take a look at this file I can open that file up and we can see there we go here is my data set hi this was the surest video ever so now I have this data set do I want to sew things that I need to do is I need to normalize the data set and I need to assign the labels numeric values because I'm going to need that for what I want to do with tensorflow j/s mmm so I'm gonna I think I'm gonna have I'm gonna need to reshape the data and turn it into tensors I'll do that in the next video just keep sequencing this so you know maybe you could be more thoughtful about I don't know what I'm trying to give you an exercise to do at the end of this video I got nothing for you but you can build an interface for this where you could maybe you could port this to like a serverside script maybe you could save it to a CSV file those are some things you could try but in the next video we're gonna do I mean I actually start working with tensorflow gjs I need to turn all of these things into tensors because tensors are the thing that I need to to create to train my machine learning model goodbye oh wait a second no did I get the removed ones by accident no I don't think so no no these are the not removed ones I did something in Reverse here all right let's see did I I think if it's not there at it I think I'm okay let's uh let me not save the JSON file again yeah five six four three I think I'm good oh the bots yes the bots is in there yeah I got it I got it correct all right I'm probably gonna be coming back on Monday to finish this go watch boarding team with CJ that's on YouTube right now I'm getting a notification 112 I'm running out of steam here boy this is a lot of work okay so now now what I need to do desktop what am I looking for p5 tension floppy color classifier so this is now oh I need to now I need to get myself a reference to tensor flow Jas no more fire base color classifier and and I need the JSON file and let me rename this to one because I might kind of save it the source code with each one okay okay don't over charge my laptop okay so what's next here let me erase the whiteboard so many things to discuss I've got to talk about softmax crossentropy these are new concepts that I haven't used in any video before a one hot encoding just something that I'm going to want to discuss by the way the plan my plan in my head is now that I is to make a ml5 version of this in which Kate in which you don't have to architect the model and you also don't have to worry about like the one hot encoding okay I realize most of you watching this probably don't know it is no it's still very recently and I'm not even sure I know what it is but I think any what it is so but so I just wanna flicked about how I'm doing this because I'm all in like a sort of strange order but it is what it is okay well I definitely want to do some work to vex stuff yes Matthew code in the chat requests suggests okay okay alright this this video merits a train whistle I am in my series I'm on video 731 or something like that about building a color classifier I'm trying to look at the overall concept of machine learning and building a color classifier so what oh where am I I spent a bunch of videos and crowd sourcing and cleaning data and where I left off I have this JSON file that has a whole bunch of data points in it each entry has an RGB value and a label so there are nine labels and there are obviously millions of possibilities for the RGB values so the so what's the next step here also many things to think about let's go back to this tutorial that I referenced as part of the ml 5 project called making your own data sets this is by artist and researcher Hannah Davis and other contributors who may have also edited this page but it started with Hannah Davis linked to information about her in this video in the in this page in the video's description now one thing you want to look here that I think is important is preparing your data set for machine learning trading testing and validation so I forget the first thing let me let me do something first here let me actually write some code strangely enough and I've got p5 loaded up here as kind of like a base JavaScript library that I use and I'm gonna add the preload function and I'm going to say let data and I'm gonna say data equals load JSON and it's called color data JSON so I just want to load that file and then I'm gonna say console dot log data entry is dot length so let's just see how many data points do I have let me make sure I can indeed load that file into my code and look at how many data points I have so here we go oh I'm in the wrong sketch I changed it to here 5643 I can read numbers is that number perhaps perhaps that number could be found somewhere in my random number but that's a that's a I'll look for it later so okay why did I why did I say that so if we come over back to this page that I was referencing and I mean we need to if I'm going to build a classifier the way I'm going to do this is by having training data and testing data now there is also something called validation data and let's go look back at this webpage training data set is used to train the model validation data sets are used to change the parameters of the model so I'm going to for the purpose of this video kind of simplify by not worrying about validation data and I am just going to use training data and testing data and the idea here is that what I want to do is train the model with my training data but then I want to feed it the testing data and see if the labels that it returns oh it thinks this color is bluish is that actually what it is labeled with and I'll get some type of accuracy score from that and I'll know more about you don't want to test it with stuff that I've trained it with because of course it's going to ultimately get that right machine learning models are very good at returning the result that you tell them about and we need to see does it also return the result of new data that it hasn't been trained with if it works really well with the training data but not with the testing data this can be known as overfitting meaning the model is just incredibly good it's it's so exact that it doesn't really know what to do except for like the exact data that it was trained with so we want to watch out for and a kind of convention let's say I have you know five thousand data points a convention might be to us use eighty percent of those so 10 percent is 500 so like four thousand four thousand eighty percent of five thousand I think as my training data and then save a thousand or twenty percent 1/5 as my testing data alright so I need to at least at the beginning right now divide it and I might just sort of pick randomly to divide it up okay what I like is that when I switch cameras I can easily have like a little break for a second not easily but I can I'm gonna cycle these because I don't know when I last cycled them what time is it 120 okay we're okay I'm gonna be here another another half an hour and then I've gotta go I think so the question though is the thing that I need to figure out is should I split up the data before I convert it to tensors or should I converted to tensors and then split it up anybody have an opinion of what's gonna make the most sense I really could use some water maybe I'll just split it up I'm gonna split it up because it's gonna be so easy to do yeah that's what I was just talking about you let you the chat is so far behind like 30 seconds behind realtime convert then split no pillars cut that was the first comment that came convergence would I was which was different than where I arrived to in my head clean the data first then split it first make the sense tensor then split Alexa flip a coin yeah is there a convention what would be the convention okay convert first so you can use the GPU optimally yeah because the tensor tensors have functionality probably to split right I assume I I assume that right like scalar buffer clone same values fill its one hot I definitely gonna need to do truncated variable zeros it's not nice college one do you see to flow to into all reshaped safe as expand squeeze clone huh don't normalize the data altogether separate training and testing first that sounds like very very uh that sounds like that was written with conviction it made an impact on me I feel like just narrative wise with the flow that I'm doing I'm actually gonna split it and then I'll write a function that makes a tenser from yeah I don't know and I never know what to do here there is a TS split function how come I don't how come I couldn't didn't see that all right look at this whoa number or size of splits the dimension along which to split well this seems confusing to me either an integer indicating the number of splits along the axis or an array of integers containing the sizes of each output tensor along the axis so I definitely can use that it's just hurts my brain to think about how to do it exactly like if this is a 2d tensor and then it's splits I want to see what this does let's let me try to understand what this does so let me think about what I'm gonna have I'm gonna have a tensor for the RGB values that looks like this like 1 1 let's say 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 right this is what I'm gonna have let me just work this out right now so that's what I'm gonna have them have like multiple RGB values so if I want to say split it into train and test I would say TF split X I've lost here we'll read the documentation again number or size of splits the number of splits along the axis I just want to split once and then I guess I'm gonna give it like let's say if I give it 1 comma 2 shouldn't I get and then I say train dot print and test dot print I'll hold on let me comment this stuff out here all values in axis per a must be enraged negative 2 to 2 but got access to oh no must evenly divided the axis it has to do it in half hold on what if I just give it to argue ah well I lost my console Oh p5 don't don't don't tell me about this cannot read property print of undefined at sketch dot 9 let's see is anybody in the chat helping me ideally you'd have the same proportion of each label in the test set in the training set yes that's very important so I mean if I had like a huge data set and I just split it up randomly that would sort of probably stay somewhat uniform clearly don't understand how TF split works I just zoom Sofia the chat would give me the answer I stopped my brain just stopped thinking I guess I have to figure this out myself size of each oh oh oh so couldn't I do this like two comma one right and that would give me yes that's what I want so like it's splitting it up so if I want it if I had five thousand then I I wish I could do this by percentage like I could just say like 80% 20% but but no okay so I'm gonna I'm gonna convert all of it and then I'm going to shuffle it and then split it okay boy I didn't really don't remember where I was in this whole thing all right so the next step that I'm doing here all right listen I think I should I said that okay so conceivably what I want to do now is look at this data dot entries and divide it into two different arrays training and testing but here's the thing what I want I I'm kind of talking about by talking myself in circles here but I don't want to split it just yet even though that was an important point for me to make the I'm using tension flow KS here and tension low digest actually has a function called split that will let me take a long list of data points and split them into two different lists of data points so what I actually want to do first is get the data into tensors the tensor flow tjs thing that I need to use it and then I'll call TF dot split to do the 80/20 split so whatta hell am I gonna do this how am I gonna convert into tensors now first of all if you have never looked attentively at Jess before I might encourage you to go watch my tension flow GS tutorial series and it looks at what is a tensor and what are the possibilities there but just thinking about it the the thing that I need to do also is think about I have the the inputs which are the RGB values and then I have the target outputs the target outputs which are the labels and so when I create my tensors I'm actually gonna do this somewhat separately so let's just worry only about the inputs this is going to be the easier part first so the inputs basically the tensor shape that I want is a 2d tensor right because each input has three values maybe you know RG and a B value and then I have a lot of those so a one D tensor like a one dimensional array just has a single set of RGB values but I have a 2d tensor with because my data set there's a whole bunch of those data points okay so let me first just create a tensor 2d out of all of the RGB values oh oh so by the way I'm in addition to when I get to fit there's a fit actually we'll split the data up for me now I can't remember let me just go quickly look at let me look at my XOR code I just want to see something in there really quickly that's you this is not was this doesn't need to be part of the actual tutorial I just want to check something I can't remember yeah yeah I separate it into the X's and Y's yeah that's what I was looking for where am I here and by the way if you watched my ex or coding challenge where I did kind of a basic where I train a neural network just solve exclusive or I also was calling these X's can you see that barely and the outputs being the Y's so that's the other the X's are like the inputs to the machine learning model the Y's are the output so I might use that that variable naming as well okay now I'm really going back to the computer and I'm going to say so first ah so let me first to make a tensor I need to normalize the data and put it into arrays woof so let me go here and say first I'm going to say let the colors be an array then I'm going to go through let every record in data let record of data entries I'm gonna say colors and then I'm gonna say I'm gonna have a specific color I'm not gonna use the word color just as they Co L is a is record are divided by 255 record G divided by 255 and I'm dividing by 255 because I want to normalize it's gonna my machine and generally speaking for like inputs to a machine learning model I want to normalize to some strict range between 0 and 1 is a pretty good one to do and then I'm gonna say record B divided by 255 and then when I say colors dot push call and then just gonna look at this color so let's just look at this so this is not a tensor yet this is just 5,000 and probably one thing I should do while I'm working this out was I should work with like a smaller data set but 5,000 is so small anyway but if I were doing this with like a big data set that had like 5,000 records in it I'm like sort of figuring out and one would want to do it for just like a hundred first and then I could use the large data set okay so we can see here this is a big array and each element of that array is another array with the normalized color values in it so this now I should be able to say now let X is equal TF tensor 2d colors so this is me turning those values and I I just want to say like console dot log X's shape let's look at the shape of the X's just to sort of see yes right there's five thousand six hundred forty three entries each with three values so I think things are going right here I turned that into a tensor and then ah whoa boy hey this wasn't so hard we're in good shape here I haven't done the training or testing now I need to do the wise the wise involve a concept known as one hot encoding I think one hot vector so you know what I'm gonna pause here I finished this thing I'm really dividing this series until like little chunks here in the next video I'm gonna look at how to make the Y's and I'm gonna cover a concept known as one hunt one hot what's the twist the term that I'm looking for one is it one hot encoding one hot encoding yes so so I'll cover that in the next video when I make the wise thanks okay yeah I'm gonna need two one hot encode the labels okay actually don't know how to do this with tensorflow yes but I think there's a one hot function let me just look tf1 hot so you give it let me let me try to understand this okay one hot one D this weird oh oh so if I were to do that if I have a tensor that's like this this is what I have I have like I have nine possibilities right so let's say I have I make an array that's all of the index values for the labels so if I say this is these are like the labels right and then I could say the the Y's would be tf1 hot the labels comma nine right yep cool okay I know how to do this now excellent whoo this is fun I think this might be where I stopped today alright what happened but if I I must I'm gonna kill the kill the console if I do this right no oh it's smart it's smarter than me I love how it's smart okay great okay oh this is good this is good stuff there are nine labels and a data point it's categorized as label free then the one hot encoding would be one no no three if they're nine three so it's the third so it really be index yeah because are the index no the entities would be a zero through eight right zero through eight zeros so the label is three it's really the fourth index three index three there's nine zero zeroone zero zero zero zero zero okay yeah this is gonna be much easier than I thought Thank You tensorflow dodge yes okay we're still working with our data at some point we're gonna start training a model what have I done so far okay so just to recap for a second I've got this whole database of crowdsourced colors with a label and now I've converted all that stuff to tensors so and I'm just looking at the inputs now the inputs that I want to use for my machine learning model so I 5643 RGB values so the shape of the tensor is 5060 or 43 comma 3 and I can look at it here I have all the RGB values normalized to zero between 0 and 1 now I need to do the Y's I need to figure out what are the target outputs associated with each RGB value and this is exciting because we are going to cover we being me and you being the person watching I am going to cover a concept known as one hot encoding so we have to understand why we're going to do one hot encoding I need to jump all the way to what would essentially be like the very end of this video series what am I asking the neural network that I'm gonna build right the neural network that I've been in build is gonna have three inputs are GB it's gonna have some architecture some configuration of all the stuff in the middle and then the idea of getting a phone call really and my volume is on and my watch is giving me a notification by the way it's saying it says I wish you could see this it's that scam likely that's the decline turn off the volume off the notifications I'm so thrilled about this video topic I'm gonna leave that in there I don't care the inputs being RGB what do I want the outputs to be the output should be a label right I want to say is it reddish is it blue ish but this is just the label that we I've used as a human being to say what I think it is like if I was doing image classification the label would be cat or dog or rainbow or unicorn but those strings are not going to be meaningful in the sort of numbers based neural network system that I'm building I need this to return a number so we could think if there are nine possible labels I could return the number zero one two three four five six seven or eight now while I could try to do something where I just have one output and that's a floatingpoint number that kind of I round to the nearest integer that indicates the label that's not gonna work so well what I actually really want is I want a probability value I want a probability value for each one of these labels so we could imagine if there are nine labels why don't nine is such I should have made it ten if I could go back double back in time start this whole series over I would have made 10 labels because all this would be so much easier to work out but imagine there are nine labels I don't know why I'm drawing it like this but one two three four five six seven eight nine and what if I had a probability like oh there's a 10% chance it's the first label and there's a 20% chance it's the second label in the zero zero zero zero and then a 70% chance zero zero right all of these values might add up to 100% and we could say ah it's most likely this one which is index 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 which maps to you know purplish so I'm trying to create the target outputs if I know that this particular color should be purplish this target output that I want is actually zero zero zero zero zero zero one zero zero zero one two three four five six seven eight nine labels zero through eight indices this is one hot encoding I am taking the eye dia of index six and making a vector a 1 dimensional vector full of zeros with a 1 in the spot that matches the label a 100% chance because if the neural network was working perfectly this is the output that I would get so one hot encoding is the idea of creating your vector having all zeros and sort of flipping a bit on in a way and just one of them a switch goes on and that's assigned one now I could come up with an algorithm pretty easily probably not easily I could work hard on it and try it would be hard and I could say take all of my labels and I could convert every single label into an array with a one in the right spot luckily for us we're using tensor flow TAS and it has a function called tf1 hot so I'm gonna create the wise for this system using the TF dot one hot function and that's what I'm gonna go do next hold on SEC everybody yeah default ringtone you know I don't usually embarrassing I don't even have the chat open yet oh I'm looking at my email ok ok ok alright so let's go look at the code and now what I need to do I made this colors array now let me make this labels array and if I say labels dot push now here's the thing what I want is for this I mean I could just push the label in it so let's just do that a record label let's just look at this real quick and I'm going to comment out the console logging and I'm gonna say console dot log labels so let's just see this should be right this is all the labels the strings of the labels so the first thing I need to do is convert each one of these into an index value so I need a mapping for that and I really wish I have this somewhere but I'm just gonna I'm gonna just create something called labels index really quick and I did this in a previous where did I do this didn't I do this in some other one of my other examples I have like an array of all the labels oh here we go so here okay one of my examples I had all the labels I lost where I was I'm gonna paste this in here I'm gonna search buttons dot push create button I'm just gonna eliminate this replace all I don't need that and then oh I want the I want the apostrophe I'm gonna put that back in I couldn't use like a expression but I know sorry I can't believe you're watching a video where I am clumsily trying okay let's see if it just comes back okay I think I'm just back I think it just comes back now that I'm doing this event thing so if you could tell me in the chat that I'm back okay its back great sorry about that so I did I don't know the computer froze I restarted I don't have the YouTube chat up and I think hopefully the sound um so let me grab that real quick history oops and the cameras are all shutting off which is fine let me just get the YouTube chat back up here so I can see it okay so I don't know what YouTube is gonna have in the end Oh was I and was I did I write something way out of bounds o TF dot one hot that's fine that's fine alright so I was let me go back I was about to do this which now I feel like it's silly like shouldn't I just make an array shouldn't I just make an array of thus labels and then can I could get the index right when it isn't there must be a way like right whoa whoa what just what happened to the chrome chrome died I don't need this what why do I have this like debugger thing on where did that come from why how did I get this what does this thing go away what does this tab here I've never seen that tab oh hi could ever go okay one single array of strings right right like what if I do right then I can say index of B right yeah okay so that's what I'm gonna do I don't know why I didn't think of that before okay so let me go back matchy I'm gonna go back to where I was looking for the list of labels so I need to find that list of labels which I believe I had in the original crowdsource color thing no no wait hold on we're actually what's that oh yeah here it is okay okay sorry download data sketch other classifier where am i okay hopefully this will edit together fine oh I'm gonna just yeah all right so I need to find my list of labels I could just type them out labels oh no but uh all labels equals uh I could say I could say label lists let me call it like the list and a grayish blueish but I have that right here right in crowdsource color when I made those buttons these are all the labels one two three four five six seven eight nine so if I come back to what I'm doing here and just put this here and then let me just do a find replace whoops let me do a find replace for just this I just need to get rid of this yes you're watching me like failing at doing fine replace and then let me look for ish and replace that with ish comma there we go now I have my array my label list array so now what I want to put in in the labels array is not the actual string of the label but label list index of that label so the index of function I need another parenthesis there the index of function will say look for this particular element in the array and giving back its index so let's look at that now let me run this again and we can see there we go now I have 5643 index values and guess what this is when I now want to go and I apologize and I wrote TF dot one hot up there you can't see it so let me just write that again TF one hot is the name of the function let's go to the tensorflow j/s documentation page right over here and oh look I already have it open to one hot how convenient and basically this documentation let's see if we can understand this I need to give it all the indices that's what I already have I mean oh but you know what these have to be a tensor already so first I need to make a tensor of all those indices let's do that so I want to say let label tensor tensor tensor labels tensor let's call it equal TF tensor 1d labels and let's say let's just look at that label tensor labels tensor dot print let's just make sure that's kind of right we can see that's a big long tensor of all of the labels and then now the wise is TF dot one hot so if I go back and look at this one hot needs the list of all of those index values which are zero through eight and the depth the depth means how many possibilities are there and there are nine possibilities a non value will default to 1 and the off value defaults to zero but if I presume reason I wanted to one Haughton code with 3 the number 3 for every spot in the number of point 1 for every non spot I could change those values but all I need to do then is say one hot labels tensor and um 9 and then I could say wise dot print so X's dot print and wise dot print so now I have my X's and Y's I remember the previous video I did this I looked at all the RGB values I divided by 255 and then I sorry I lost my train of thought here and then I made those into a 2d tensor and now I've made the Y's and I what I do want to see is console.log let's look at X's dot shape and console.log wise dot shape also okay right let's look and see if everything seems right ah indices must be of data type int 32 Oh interesting so when I made this tensor my labels if we look at them are actually like if I go back and console.log the labels those are floatingpoint numbers because I wasn't really worrying about it when I was just working with regular JavaScript arrays but I need to very specifically make sure that I set the datatype index values for a1 hot vector cannot be floating point values so I think if I do this we can see that fixed it right so now I have the shape right this makes sense there's five thousand six hundred forty three data points this each data point for the inputs for the X's has an RGB that's three and there are nine possible labels so I have the shape as 5643 nine possibilities and each one of those just is one hot encoded so this means blueish and this means purplish or whatever the mapping is I don't remember the second one is greenish and zero one two three four five the six one is 0 1 2 3 4 5 is pinkish that's the sixth one yes whatever so I this is gonna be really important which labels actually go with with index values is something that I'm going to have to save for the duration of this project because when I show the results to the user I want to actually show the strings not the number value okay so I am now ready to try to fit four sides up so what's next I need to architect the model right I got all of the input data and I got all of the output data I need to divide into training and testing Architect the model fit the model and then I'm sort of done maybe so that's gonna be like many more videos into the future so I got at least three or four little more steps to build here until I have this like final version of this color classifier built with tension flow jazo dispose wait wait don't leave just wait don't leave just yet I do want to think about memory management and I'm maybe I'm gonna think about memory management later but and the X's and Y's I'm going to want to use in the next video but I probably should after I make the one hot vector I don't need when I'm working with lowerlevel tend to float yes I've got to clean up stuff I'm not gonna use anymore and I don't need these labels anymore so I can dispose that one so that was just the last little tidbit here and then I'll move on in the next video I'm going to start creating the architecture of the neural network model itself and oh I'm gonna introduce some new concepts soft backs and crossentropy isn't that exciting okay all right all right everyone it's two o'clock I didn't get through this whole thing I have to stop so the rest I think I'm gonna be back on Monday and let's see if I can finish this on Monday but stay tuned and I'll be back on Monday I don't know what else to say any questions really attitude I can you make music tutorials no definitely not Alka how could just maybe just woke up and just now watch it says Alka is typing alright so let me just mention a couple things I hope to be back on Monday I will not be here definitely any day next week Tuesdays through Friday because I am traveling less I do some kind of crazy livestream for my television phone but I will be traveling the rest of the next week I'm also moving to a new apartment so far we've got a lot of stuff to do Oh could you go on green screen and come in saying wait wait wait I have an idea yes I can should I be singing playing the ukulele or no ukulele will definitely indulge Alka in this do you really know how to play guitar no no I mean that's not that's am ukulele which I bought two weeks ago try to teach myself some chords so it's about as far as I am all right green only okay wait wait wait wait a sec wait yes no I'll always stay for wasting time I just can't do any more coding my brain is fried wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait please wait for me oh wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait that's got to be good enough for whatever you're cooking up hello Simon Wright's great timing I'm entering the tunnel now so we'll probably lose the for it you've been watching this while driving or on a train that's amazing can you reopen entries on the color classification database just for fun yeah why not why not how do you manage time with a uni and a youtube channel rights art it's you know I think that I need to manage my time better and I need to the other thing is I have I have a project that I really want to do this summer which is an updated version the nature of code book and I think that I need to take a break from live streaming or like slow that down a little bit to give myself more time to work on that but now that I have the patreon and the sponsors and sort of not sure how to do that because I want to keep the content going so but let me turn the let me go me let me turn the writing to the database back on I guess so rules and write is true okay you can write to the database again Ricardo asks are you a uni professor um so I teach at New York University a part of a program called ITP which is part of Tisch School of the Arts and you can find out more information on the website and this fall we're starting a new undergrad program so whoohoo no remove the false and yes oh that's yes ah shoot shoot shoot no no I didn't that didn't just happen quick I totally did the wrong thing totally did the wrong thing rules quick let me put this false alright so there was a brief moment in time where the whole thing was open to writing anything but now this is what I want to remove thank you very much okay everything should be okay now all right Belisarius asked Dan could you please explain how to get the slack invitation so unfortunately for better or worse these slack invitation is only open to either sponsors of the YouTube channel or patreon is via patrons via patreon and you can find more information about about that a patreon slash coding trainer there's like a sponsor button already as part of the YouTube channel I don't love the idea of having a closed community that requires people to pay but it is at the moment or the benefits that I get out of it is it's a smaller group of people who are sort of dedicated to participating in the community of the channel and it helps me I help to be do make these videos having the the funding frankly it gives me it allows me to have more time to do it and it makes me feel like it's an obligation in a good way I think so that's that at the moment the system I have I am very happy for people to selforganize into their own free and open community is I want to do more to be able to have the audience of this channel be more inclusive and I'm always open to anyone who has any thoughts or ideas that can help and ways them for me to think about doing a better job with that time management I got nothing for you oh and so but if you do sponsor the channel i if you do sponsor the channel i don't and also sign up via patron I don't have a good system of there's no automatic system I have to add just slack manually so you can best way it would be to like tweet me at Schiffman but if you're a sponsor on youtube if you go to the community tab there's a post there that has the link to a Google forum that's only for sponsors and patreon I get your email and I send an invite but sometimes it has a bit a spam folder and sometimes I forget link to the site with colors the site with colors is github.com crowd sort and i also should say one of the things that i'm not able to do effectively is manage all the pull requests and issues on these github repos i would love do consider that a possibility of that could actually be like a paid position if somebody who's a community manager for all the github repos but I haven't figured out a if I have the budget to do that and who the who the right person would be for that at the moment there are a lot of wonderful volunteers who help who are members of the coding train github organization and help kind of like manage and pull requests and write to issues here and there as as they have time Oh Oliver posted in the in the in the YouTube channel ok and so here it is right here this is at present let's just make sure this is working again yep so now this is a once again accepting new data points for the color classifier ok oh yes in Medan oh thank you and so many wonderful members of the community that I can't seem to remember to mention I am in New York City I'm not in Hong Kong Ricardo asks are you familiar with functional programming at Jas a de asked almost a half a million subs how do you feel about that I'm very excited I feel very honored or humbled those kind of words I feel a little bit surprised like I did not this was not my expectation for the channel I feel like I need to do better I'm always trying to improve what I'm doing and yeah it's exciting I would like to do something to celebrate 500,000 subscribers I should probably do I was saying that I should just whatever is the suggestion number 500 in here which is make an AI that solves the 15 tile sliding puzzle so I might try to do that at some point if anybody has any other ideas for celebrating 500,000 subscribers assuming not everybody has it just unsubscribe right now which which would be fine also yeah this has been a really great stream right skate we've mined like a microcosm of the entire data science pipelines ha it's really nice to hear because this is the new you know I don't know what my expertise is exactly but certainly data science and working with machine learning it is not something that I spent years and years studying and thinking about it's something I've come to as a person who worked on kind of open source creative coding platforms for many years alright I'm now going to leave the station thank you for tuning in I hope to come back and finish this color classifier on Monday next week is a really hard week for me so it's not confirmed that I'm doing that till you see it scheduled on YouTube itself you know if you're wondering how to get a notification you hit the subscribe button the alarm bell all that sort of stuff alright so I'm gonna hit stop streaming and I'll see you maybe on Monday if not whenever I at some point at the end of June again remember I'm gonna be away for half of July so this would be a little bit lighter over the summer during July in August but also I might when I'm here I might do to live streams in a week like I did this week does YouTube Oh Engram ste asks does YouTube have an API that you could use for some cool data visualizations for 500k subscribers word cloud of comments or maybe I could visualize like all the locations all over the world where people are I don't know if I have access to that data so yeah I would consider that that's kind of like a fun idea so let's discuss that in the slack Channel I would love to hear more suggestions okay goodbye everybody see the next week hopefully if not the week after hopefully if not definitely sometime in July stay tuned I'll be posting on Twitter if I remember when I'm livestreaming actually the at the coding train Auto tweets at Schiffman if I remember and then what was I gonna say and then also I schedule it on YouTube now okay goodbye oh no I don't hit stop streaming there I have to do it here stop streaming there we go
