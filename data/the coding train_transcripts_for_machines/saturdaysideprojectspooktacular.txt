it is time for my spooky sound check can you hear me is my microphone working help help i'm trapped in the attic i don't know what to do help me help me i'm trapped i've got a green screen behind me it's terrifying in here i'm i'm covered in random numbers and i don't know what to code whatever shall i do it's spooky up here spooky spooky that's an attic look it's an attic where i am trapped and i have lights and scream and the random numbers they are taking over everything i don't know how to count them what what what shall i do i don't know i didn't plan this very well i need a script okay hello it is me count random number appearing live on the coding train there was a train whistle that i usually have ah i have found it i will blow it i will now read the random numbers to you thirtytwo thousand and fifteen sixty thousand five hundred and seventyseven oh uh uh 85 846 38 one hundred and four 78 300 and 91. i must go i must go and collect the rest of the random numbers they're all falling off my costume which makes it easier to read 30 479 man fan asks is this live no this is not live i recorded this and then watched it back and decided to broadcast it no it's definitely live because if it wasn't live i'd have canceled this idea a very long time ago good morning everyone i think maybe i can um move on from my schtick here which really i want to thank violet by the way who had the idea for the random number costume this was thrown together by the way in the last 15 minutes i asked all of my children all of my children all two of them two and one was very busy playing a a baseball in roblox so i got the of just a few random numbers but um to make a lot of random numbers on pieces of paper and stick them all over me i found this old vampire robe or dracula robe that my son had used as a costume from years ago and so here we are um on a saturday okay okay simon is telling me the joke took way too long well i got news for you it's not going away anytime soon well how's everybody doing today it's halloween i know there's a lot of really complicated and difficult stuff going on around in the world i hope if you are able to vote here in the united states um that you i early voted yesterday i should put my early vote sticker on me but please vote um i encourage you to vote um early voting was a wonderful experience to feel like i had the time and space and i got it done and and everything uh it was a thank you to the new york city voting organization i forget what it's called new york city votes it was actually a very smooth experience i was offered empanadas and pizza while i was waiting in line and only had to wait about 30 to 45 minutes okay um now uh dr paroul jane is telling me to please start i haven't uh just just in case anybody's wondering these saturday live streams they tend to be a little um longwinded if you will and i get much less done than i might in a sort of shorter form actual coding tutorial so if you're looking for a socalled proper educational experience you know you can come back later one thing that i do and thank you to marcos um who's been helping me with this is the um youtube has a feature now if i put time codes in the description it will chapterize if that's a word uh chapterize the video and so you can come back and watch it later and find the sections that actually have some coding stuff because that's what you're more interested in um alright so what is the game called road blocks did i say roadblocks roblox excuse me um all right so um what am i going to do today i have an idea and one of the things i'm super excited about and you saw it here and let me try to get this back um thanks to the stream professor i don't know if any of you watch the stream professor's youtube channel actually forgot what the actual name of it is i watch it all the time um that there is uh i learned about how and i'm gonna just switch over to here um i can use my phone i should probably just like have both of these going let's see hold if you'll if you'll bear with me for a moment if i go back to here or maybe if i go to here um no no here no oh let me just add it real quick oh it's fine i'll just go back to here so i have a thing where i can uh connect my phone this i can't show it to you i want to turn my other camera on alright i have an idea just bear with me for a second um we're gonna go back to i'm gonna uh this is me producing the show during the show that's a thing that i also do quite often i'm gonna go back to this view i'm gonna go into my open broadcast studio i'm gonna add another capture device i'm going to add the epoch cam oh my god i'm going to shrink it and then i'm going to rotate it transform rotate 90 degrees clockwise and there we go so now i should be able to show you that what i am doing is i have my fancy ios device here which is there's no cables it is wirelessly connected to the pc running my streaming computer that's amazing um and so i can do things like uh my random numbers are falling off and you're seeing also the mess like this is the messiest room in our house i don't know if you can call it a room it's an attic um i don't i really want to like try not to show too much it's like barbie dolls all over the floor and like giant bins of legos and all sorts of stuff uh just arts and crafts supplies everywhere um let me switch for a second ah so i have uh this uh book here and if i do this and switch here i should be now showing you um this pumpkin carving kit so this was uh the activity that's planned in my household for this afternoon and i noticed that um over in the book it has these designs for uh carving a pumpkin and uh my daughter in particular really wants to do this one the sideeyed owl um and you can see how it works you tape over the pattern you carve and then you display and i was thinking couldn't we and maybe i should turn this off now uh um what if i were to make what if i were to make an algorithmic generative pumpkin clothing design uh that's what i was thinking of doing uh uh yeah and cake uh castian vekman is pointing out that i only i said i only had to wait 30 to 45 minutes um in denmark uh that is a very very long time from what i've been told um i've checked the line a few times i live in brooklyn um i heard that paul rudd by the way was handing out cookies to people online in brooklyn but i think that was at the barclays center which is not my location um i heard people waiting for hours so okay so what's happening here so i wanted to do some halloween themed fun things uh mostly because i have no idea what else to do but first let me offer up some coding train news so um i have this youtube channel it's called the coding train i'm gonna go to it right now uh if you didn't see um already this uh video that i released yesterday it's coding challenge number 157 uh oh you don't see this at all apologies oh and my what is going on here the cam the epocam is on this screen all right um this here was the uh video that i released um uh two days ago um called zoom annotations with machine learning and p5.js so um i don't know how easy it is for somebody to follow it i guess i just have to give up i have more tape here let's let's take some extreme measures because i know everybody is just gifting and snapshotting this live stream and sharing it all over social media and i really want um a uh i really want um this random number to appear wait i'm being told i got a direct message that i now don't see it popped up for a second so if you have something to tell me about the stream ah there it is stream deck volume is low i have no idea what that means do you mean my mic my mic is low like i'm quiet because i don't know what stream deck is i don't use stream deck whatever that is i have lots of different audio feeds i have music i have my mic uh here this isn't going anywhere now this is great okay what was i talking about ah i was wondering if this is actually something that people could follow and really implement or is it just like a cool demo that i did in a video and people aren't really gonna be able to do stuff with it so um if you if you um your sounds all of my sounds i need more specificity in my life it's that's much too general i can't do anything with that everything is good people are telling me i'm i'm gonna assume uh all of my audio levels are actually like my mic is in the red it's showing me which is not good when i speak very loud and the laptop sounds um are at a sort of medium volume which i guess i could turn up a little bit um yeah so the music the sound effects were very low got it the music was so quiet all that time but it was so good all of my uh halloween music that i spent so long curating uh this morning okay so this particular zoom annotations video if you happen to make something a version of it if you will i would love for you to share it with me i don't know if this is a thing that people could really actually do and i think actually one of the things that i wanted to emphasize with this video which i'm not sure that i did a particularly great job of is that um and i should check the page let's check the page i don't know why i went to the channel when i should be going to the website um whoops that's also the channel again let me go to the website and go to the challenge here this is ah it looks like it seems like there haven't been made any variations based on this coding challenge by the community yet be the first and add your own if you don't know how take a look at this spooky guide oh we should make a chrome extension that just inserts the word spooky into websites everywhere that's what i should make today on the coding train um so uh nobody's you could be the first you could be the first person this is a little tricky because i'm not actually asking you to share your code necessarily what i would love for you to do is create maybe a gif or a short video that just screen records you in a zoom meeting again don't record other people in a zoom meeting unless you have their permission um so just do a test meeting with just yourself or just cut out the part that you're in it and show how you're interacting with people in your zoom meeting through this methodology that's in the video but what i wanted to mention is even though the demonstration is all about overlays to your actual video what i'm really showing you is that anything you can make on your computer um that you can uh and any layout that you can create in open broadcast studio you can um you can pipe that into your zoom call so it doesn't actually have to be traditional video it could just be like like text like i actually was in a zoom meeting the other day that had the community agreement um which was just a a document that was sort of laid out on one page as the video feed of one of the um participants in the meeting so but something more creative and abstract you could do crabby asks oh wait is it halloween right now in case you were wondering it is indeed and by the way i saw i i have um an account with one of these like uh royaltyfree um audio services um where i get music and stuff from i just downloaded epidemic by the way um and i just download i should also mention by the way i sort of i'm a little late in doing this right now but this uh this uh live stream is sponsored by brilliant brilliant um i will in a little while go and do one of the daily challenges from brilliant if you're not familiar with brilliant go to brilliant.org codingtrain and sign up for free and if you're interested in math and science and learning and interactive exercises and computer programming there's tons of puzzles and courses and things there it's all interactive so unlike video tutorials which is what i do on youtube it's really a place that you can do on your own time through reading and interactivity i really love the site so you can sign up for free you can get a premium subscription to unlock everything and through that link you uh the first 200 people get a 20 off coupon all right so back to uh regularly scheduled programming which is me uh ah and power he likes everybody's asking me about the wallpaper so um i do make these available let's uh let's go i i forget where this is like the actual place this is um but i'm gonna go to the github repo for the website i don't know why i'm not signed in here and i'm gonna search i'm so lost on github so i'm search under issues this is so weird that why am i not signed in i want to be signed in because my search bar is gone wall paper let's hold on let's just see wallpaper coding train there we go so in this particular issue and i believe this might have got resolved further along then oh yeah there's an faq on the site somewhere oh you don't even see what i'm showing you i'm the worst uh on this faq uh site uh i don't know where that is okay there's this link here on this page issue number 404 which goes to this google drive folder and under here under wallpaper um the halloween one is right here catch a ride halloween i also would encourage you to check out this very new catch a mask and i like this one that uh that was jason put together to put masks on the characters and yeah so you can grab those um i think that i have some information somewhere oh license what does this say uh the coding drain characters were created by uh jason heglund and they're available for use under a creative commons attribution noncommercial share alike 4.0 international license so certainly um if you're just using it for your own personal use uh that is great if you are using them and in something that you are publishing um then you should probably provide attribution and make sure you're not like selling them on tshirts and that kind of thing whatever's in that license just to mention okay and i don't know how to do this stuff the correct way i'm trying to wave my way through having a very open working process um but also keeping things protected and ethical and so i'm definitely your feedback is well appreciated for how i can make the code and the content of the coding train more accessible for you in ways um that works does brilliant have the new design today so i know i was told by brilliant that their website is being redesigned for november and it's in the materials that i'm that i'm telling you about but maybe the site has the new design today because it is october 31st all right where was i i think we need to start off especially since today i am your friendly count random number count random number we should do some random number reading so how do i get to the random number reading the first thing that i do it's already 10.25 time flies when you're wasting time live streaming to an international audience of hundreds i suppose is the correct term by the way i'm told there is another live stream somebody could there's like a math or math magic live stream going on today that's 24 hours that's probably what you should be watching right now if somebody could uh just post a link to that in the chat send people away to there it's gonna be a much more productive use of your time i almost certain all right i'm trying to do something very important um which is uh no uh get to the coding train discord get to the lynx channel uh and in a moment i'm gonna show you ah i cannot you operate a computer it's very did it's so scary there we go okay so what this is really bothering me this epoch cam thing let me just click that all right um so this is the coding train discord in other breaking news i won't play the sound effect again three intro to discord bot tutorials are coming to you on the coding train uh next week they are basically almost finished i also recorded a new tutorial on using a convolutional neural network in ml5.js that is coming to you soon so four videos are on the way tutorial videos coming your way but i encourage you to join the coding train discord v new very new is if you uh i just posted the invite into the chat but brand new is thecodingtrain.com discord so if you go to thecodingtrain.com discord that will take you automatically uh redirect you to the invite page so i encourage you to just find it that way i should update my link um and can somebody post the link to the somebody who's in has admin privileges can you post a link to the wallpapers in the youtube chat but again you'll find it if you go to uh the couldn't train website github repo issue number four four seven you gotta do it's coming you gotta gotta work a little bit here you don't just get the link you gotta go on a adventure a spooky a spooky adventure navigate your way to issue number four okay um and um uh i'm looking at the chat too much going on um all right so speaking of the reason why i came over here to the discord is this is where i am i am all i am i have a very important project that i'm doing which is i am attempting to read this entire book a million random digits um and it is by the rand corporation also included as a bonus a hundred thousand normal deviants and as of last live stream i was on row 10. i'm not still on the first page this is going to take this is going to take i don't know i gotta uh it's going to take a long time i don't think that i will finish it in my lifetime if i'm being honest i mean how much longer am i really going to be doing this live streaming nonsense i don't know this might be my last one everybody it's over after this there's a link in the faq violent where's the faq i don't know where even where the fhq is i know we worked on it and anyway i'm going to page one i'm going to page one of a million random digits i'm going to row 10 and the next random number i remember this now the next random number is uh column two and so i can actually show this to you if i bring up my epoch cam again let's see if i can make this work um it's going to take a minute to connect all right here we go so i am on row 10 column zero one two so this is the first random number that i need to read let's try actually um no as i say so this is it fourteen thousand nine hundred five that's where i need to read i'm gonna go back to this view here and count random number we'll now read from the book a million random digits what's the best way what's the best look here for me is it this so you could see the cover uh and then i need some uh music here fourteen thousand nine hundred and five ha ha ha ha no i don't like this one that's pretty good let's go with this one sixty eight thousand six hundred and seven twenty two thousand one hundred and nine forty thousand five hundred and fifty eight 60 970 93 4433 481 i went to the wrong row again no 11805 5431 39808 27 732 fifty thousand seven hundred and twentyfive sixtyeight thousand two hundred and fiftyeight twentynine thousand four hundred and five 851 three thousand four hundred and fifty two ninety nine thousand six hundred and thirty four six thousand two hundred and eighty feet six okay so i have finished up on row 12 column zero one two three four five twelve and five twelve and five all right i will post the link to the wallpaper i see that people are really interested in that 12 row 12 column 5 is that what i said row 12 no row 12 and column 5. so here we are next random number row 12 column five so that is there in discord and then let me grab that wallpaper link for folks so where is the faq first link under the more drop down so if we go to hear more under frequently asked questions ah okay look at this it's the coding train frequently asked questions all right i should know that that's there okay look at all these answers to these commonly asked questions ah here we go where can i download the coding train wallpapers um and so the link right here shared google drive with and there's a lot more than just the wallpaper i don't think everything is here um because there's a lot of new stuff being generated all the time and i would like to highlight something for you that's super fun that i'm working on um let me just pull it up and that's why i'm moving my screen away for a second if i go into rewards and here um i'm going to open this image and bring it back to you now this is something i'm working on which is a laser etched uh coating train train whistle and this is one of the rewards for people who join as a member i know you can't see me um so i you know this has taken almost over it might be even more than a year now that i sort of like said that i would be sending these to people so apologies for that delay progress is being made and the thing that i'm looking to do is so it will have the coding train train on it and then if you're a member you get your own personalized random number i need a system for tracking those that's a definitely a project that i should build uh oh my numbers are falling all off of me um numbers um and um my idea is that on one of the other sides you would have your random number laser etched on it and then a design that probably a random walk is what i'm thinking right now where the seed for that that design was generated with your random number so you might have noticed i'm a little bit insane here in my obsession with randomness and random numbers but that to me now i feel like is the essence of the coding train itself sure there's the train theme there's p5gs there's me there's coding characters but ultimately the theme the real essence is random numbers where do they come from what comes next after one random number but everything i do is full of chaos and randomness with no plan random the random function is probably the most function that i use in my programming uh examples and tutorials it's everywhere and it's just like your starting point i think for this idea of creativity expression with code like there's so much more than you can do than randomness but it's kind of like this is where we all get started i learned how to make a shape i learned how to make a color let's try making a random one and so that to me i feel like it's all coming together it all makes sense to me now here on the coding train uh but let's i gotta work on something today because it is halloween and i want to make a halloween project so my idea was um a uh oh and frank in the chat is saying that they did their senior paper on random numbers in college i would love to read that uh i don't you know i'm curious join the discord and please share frank that sounds really awesome and i know that many of you are students right now i hope you're doing okay school wise um and that the coding train is helping you out in your educational journey if there are things that i can do to be more helpful please let me know all right so um just give me a second here to get back to something let's go to the p5 web editor i guess um and go i just want to open up the discord um and go back to where am i looking i want to go to the links channel there it is okay wow usually when i'm live streaming and i post something here it's just filled with emojis and yet somehow today i only got two thumbs up with all the emo and come on people i'm i'm i've got the power no not all you know let's be nice let's un remove all reactions reactions all add i have to remove them all or this what will this do yes see you ruined it for everybody else [Laughter] okay um now uh here we are in the web editor let's log in so once again my idea pumpkin carving designs so what can i add to what already by the way is this why is this being chroma keyed look at that it's like chroma keying out this book that is wacky um so um um let me see here sorry sorry sorry everybody so what can i add to the discourse on jacko'lantern designs um one idea that somebody had was um and krabby says there's lots of new reactions oh amazing beautiful krabby i love that thank you um i love your username by the way crabby where does it come from okay um one of the things that um i'm thinking about here is and a lot of people is what kind of designs that i've done either in um any of my coding challenges or in um any of the coding in the cabana videos could work for a jackolantern design so on the one hand is the idea that like somebody out there like the nerdiest of the jackolantern carvers just wants to put the hilbert curve so in the one sense like what am i adding here because it's just a matter of like um opening this sketch like making it black and white and screenshotting it and printing it that's basically all you need to do but is there something that i could possibly um um is there something that i could possibly do that's new um but also isn't just what you would sort of ordinarily do and allow people to customize it in some way so what's up so i need your help here and i'm looking at the youtube space filling pumpkin that's right space filling pumpkin that's hilbert curve as a space filling curve so i'm looking for ideas for things and while i'm getting started while you're thinking of those things and if folks in the uh discord chat the the members uh live chat if you could pull any ideas that you see in the youtube chat um and bring them into there let's let's accumulate them there and it's one of these days thank you to this stream chat i will i like to plug uh dis stream chat is this gonna like come up is it just just streamchat.com it is um which is uh the chat manager and discord bot uh for the coding train um it mostly works with twitch when i'm on youtube um but uh the reason i was gonna say this is that they're they're working on a new feature which will allow me to collect some comments and like feature them on the screen um but i don't have that ready yet but that would be that would be great for this but for now the butterfly wing generator that's a that's an interesting one how can we make that halloween themed it doesn't need to be i saw some pretty great um i mean here where i live in brooklyn everybody's got like super creative uh pumpkins i'm trying to think i saw it among us character um there was there was something that was i mean maybe just one with like random numbers on it dripping random numbers dripping blood oh that's kind of oh what if we did like a dripping blood effect on a random number so it'd be like spooky random numbers um how would i even do that um like i know that i could say something like you know let's pick what's the random number that's on my hat oh i really don't want to show my terrible hat here 30479 uh 30479 and i could say put it in the middle and i could say a text align center and i haven't shared any community contributions which i should do today if i can fill let's make it just red right now and text size 64. what do i get oh that's not red that's green so i could do something where i think it could be twice the size where i take this number and i blobby pumpkins that's an interesting idea a spooky impossible maze oh that's a fun idea also uh i should i really should get that live poll thing going and then people could vote on the things but i haven't merged any of the recent pull requests and gone through it so i don't have enough time i probably need to be doing this full time frankly which i know it's not going to happen anytime soon i can live stream every day i get a lot of lots of done make it drip blood right so this is what i'm thinking um so you could get a random number in it uh it could i could do like a random walk design without random numbers that i could do what i'm saying basically what if we made a spooky random number design that does something generative that's seeded with that random number jumpscare maze uh and um yeah obviously i'm gonna at some point people are suggesting i'm gonna make this an actual random number but right now i'm just hardcoding in a number so what was i saying here text plotting dots with small pumpkins um very interesting so let's um spooky number is 404 let's see if we can do some image processing to this because i think that'll be fun this is in some ways this might be more appropriate for processing um but i wanted to have this as a web application that people could run so i guess i'll because i i like doing the pixel processing stuff more processing but let's let's do what i'm thinking okay so i'm going to show you something if you're not aware okay let's give up hold on it's time for extreme measures here i really got to go at like a little afternoon today because there's a lot of exciting fun halloween stuff happening in my household um this is definitely how i should yeah right create the numbers from a bunch of particles so not applicable this is exactly what i'm thinking of thank you for this so this is what i'm going to we're going to try to make spooky random numbers and that's the thing you can carve into your pumpkin and i don't know if it's actually going to get carved into my kids have very specific ideas about what they want to carve so what i what i want to show you here is that um what i need to do is create a separate canvas a graphics object so i'm going to just call this numbers and i'm going to say numbers equals create graphics 400 400 and then i'm going to do all of this stuff on this graphics object so create graphics is a really excellent trick in p5 for doing all sorts of things with layering with backgrounds with mixing with image processing i can basically create a entirely separate graphics context which i draw onto in any way that i want so if i do this and then run this code let me see how much room do i really have here for you to see the code and the output so i don't see anything right now and i can i make the font a little bit smaller it looks like i can is this like zoomed in oh it's zoomed in no wonder it looked like crazy to me um all right this is how i prefer to do it uh 36 is good there there we go all right so i don't see anything so why do i not um see anything the reason why i don't see anything is i drew all this stuff to a separate graphics context that's just in memory now i could um i could draw that now so now it looks like a regular old p5 sketch and i just please uh i something's very spooky is happening my nose it feels like it's running in the middle of a live stream i will be right back boy enjoy no matter what i do this random number it's cursed it's cursed i put so much tape on it it won't stay on my head but i have kleenex i will mute myself all right so um well this is really playing for a long time um one idea that i have is to go to the uh is it called fractal flame no no that's something else that's something that i'm working on that i let totally drop the ball on uh flames coding challenge coding train one possibility would actually be to use oh the fire effect use this do i have a p5 version of it so this is a coding challenge i did from years ago years ago no not too long ago which creates this kind of effect and so and it's being seeded by this noise field and i if i recall correctly i could use sort of the text numbers in this field and then i would sort of see like those uh those numbers like on fire so that's one way that i could approach this if anybody wants to like work on that right now behind the scenes uh share it back with me i could use that but i think i want to just go with a more traditional approach that i that with particles the particle system but this would be a nice one to do um you know i could then marching squares this to make it like sort of contour more contourish but i also really like the idea of carving my face not my face but your face into a pumpkin so that i that i have an idea for how i could also show today if i can do that but let's keep going with this so the idea now is instead of just drawing those numbers and let's make this a little bit wider um and let's put i don't think that that's really matters so much i want the numbers to actually just be um color i'm going to be able to set in my own way so and i want them to be why did they oh yeah oh the graphics object needs to be no sorry uh bigger okay and then i want them to sit at the bottom of the window so i think maybe that means i want to do this so i have this idea oh no they're dripping so they should be at the top so the top and then i guess if the font size is 128 that means i just want to put them there i guess there's a little bit of like you know i could figure this out more exactly but this is how i like to code let's be a little bit more extreme here all right perfect so i want to make those drip so the way the idea that i have for the way to do that is not to actually display them but first let me just loop through all of the pixels of that image so if i start with x to the numbers with and i i the the width of the image and the width of the canvas is always going to be the same i think i'm going to skip every 10 pixels for now just to make this demonstration work tell me if i'm like blocking the code too much like do i need to move this i probably should move this over a tiny bit yeah then i need to do y then i need to find the index for each pixel and in p5 the formula for that is x plus y times width times four so this is the for every pixel in the pixel array there's rgb alpha so there's width times height times 4 pixels and then i can just say the red value is numbers pixels index and i'm going to say if r is greater than uh than zero because i know the exact pixel values they're black and white so if the red value is greater than zero i just want to draw a circle right at that x and y location and let's make it red eventually i'm going to make this a particle maybe i'll texture it but let's just see if this draws the number oh and i probably have to say numbers load pixels um so crabby posted something from reddit but there's no way i can read that right now so i might need the uh the summary of what that is so let's say load pixels there we go oh so already this is looking pretty good so you can see that i'm able to draw the numbers to an image and i feel like i need more pixel space now certainly i could uh so let's let's have us a step size a step i'm going to say that's 10. and for right now just to sort of understand um how this is this looks let's say no stroke i feel like i want to have a larger area to work with but i have limited screen space right now just in terms of um and let's just make this do my 51 background so i can see it whoa what just happened there oh the background is 51. oh that has to be trans ah so then i would have to say greater than it's no yeah no no the background oh i need to do a background here this is what i meant to do i also need a background for the actual uh canvas i just want to be able to see the size of the canvas there we go so i think with i i guess maybe what i want actually is the opposite i want to have more room for the blood to drip whoa this is going crazy now and they don't match there we go so that's going to be my starting point and i need more room for the code so this can go over here and then i'm just curious to try like a step size of four and if we zoom in and look at this yeah i think that's going to kind of get me what i want okay so now instead of these being just dots i want to create particles that are sort of like falling but with a lot of like friction like dripping uh somehow dripping so i don't actually have any idea how i'm gonna make this work but i think i probably rather than code all this from scratch right now i should go to like one of my nature of code particle system examples so where's the best place for me to do that i guess if i go to github.com nature of code and i go to examples p5.js and i go under oops not oscillation under systems and i um and i don't know what's the single particle versus i think this is kind of what i'm looking for i mean in a way i don't think i need to over complicate this and i just need the particle class so let me grab this code this is very very little code actually um and that's oh this i'm going to stop this one i this would actually be really cool to try i shouldn't if i have time i want to come back to this one um and then uh i'm going to go here um and i need to add a particle particle.js file whoops no no did you not add a file create file particle.js and i'm going to paste that in here and then i need to reference it now is where i can move this over because okay so here we go now in the sketch i'm now going to have particles an array uh um this doesn't need to be drawn every time right this is just being rendered once at the beginning honestly i should just like load an image but it's nice that the code is doing it because it could be a different number each time um okay and then uh let's just just just should be a clear uh push i don't know what this is gonna do let's add a new particle at 100 300 400 and i don't remember what this code does let's say for every particle of particles particle.show particle.update i'm just making this up i'm guessing what that object did from the example a background of undefined oh this create graphics has to happen before i start drawing to it uh i've got some other error now position.copy is not a function particle line nine what oh what i prefer to do it this way so to pass in an x and y there we go now i still have show is not a function run update display i'm going to change the names okay all right so that's what this does it makes uh i've just made a hundred particles that fall with gravity okay this works uh yeah and krabby is writing i know nothing about constructors or classes so if this is new to you might i suggest [Laughter] hey are you new to the coding train is this your first day watching well guess what i don't usually wear a cape with random numbers on it but also you can learn to code from the coding train yourself on your own time with my tutorial series under beginners p5.js i'm actually hoping to update some of these videos in 2021 because some of them are a little bit out of date but might i suggest to you scrolling down here and especially for what i'm doing right now you'll want to take a look at introduction to oop with es6 es6 is the version of javascript from 1972 that's how uptodate i am in my javascript programming uh you can also watch uh classes in javascript with es6 construct your arguments with classes in javascript and then you can even in the p5.js web editor add your own javascript file and then you can travel back in time and learn about what an array is all the way back to 2015. oh it was a simpler time in 2015. look how little gray hair i had i don't wear capes or glasses or hats i just talked about arrays i even used some strange p5 desktop editors anyway back to what i was working on now thanks for tuning in today that's all i've got show's over people i'm done never coming back again it's all over here all right hopefully that helps somebody out um i had to do that because nobody's joined as a member during this live stream uh all right now what was i doing where was i yes so those are the particles now here's what i would like to do i'm going to take this loop here and just to sort of see what might happen let us instead of drawing a circle here put a particle at this x and y so let me run this so all the particles are going to originate at the number location um what happened step is not defined well i don't know how i lost that um let step equals a 4. there we go so we can see i'm on my way right what happens i see that number and then all these particles fall this is one of the reasons why i might like to work in processing also it's going to run quite slow but ultimately if the goal is to render out an image there's some other possibilities here so uh let's change this to let's change this to a red color and let's actually say no stroke let's change this to red let's run this again okay whoa why okay and now i definitely need to set the background back to black it's perfect um what just happened here why do i not see the particles something i did something wrong in the rendering of them oh 25 255 please there we go all right so this is getting somewhere um so um okay all right so now i think i want to do something different which is i actually just want to keep track of a list of spots and i am going to say instead of making a new particle i'm going to say spots equal push create vector x y so i just want to and maybe the step size actually doesn't need to be four it can be one here because i'm just going to keep track of all of the possible spots where a particle could start and then i can pick a random one and say particles push spot dot x spot dot y well this is why i should have kept it the other way but that's fine all right so now i think if i run this spots is an array spots push create vector random spot spot what did it not like here particle.show is not a function what oh because oh new particle new particle i have to make a new particle at that spot there okay so now i'm making a new part so a couple things one is i don't this physics is not right for blood dripping so in the particle i don't it shouldn't have an initial velocity its initial velocity can just be zero zero and the gravity is fine but blood as it's dripping doesn't speed up really it's a much slower it's sort of like it reaches a terminal dripping sort of amount i would say fairly quickly uh so and maybe it doesn't shouldn't fade out it should leave more of a trail i wonder if actually i'm just curious what would this is probably gonna look terrible if i put the background in setup yeah that's this is more like what i'm going for but um can i that's actually surprised me just now that that work could i fade out the background over time so again it's speeding up too much i need to give it like an air resistance i suppose i think probably an easy way for me to do this in update where's the update method is just to say this stop velocity multiply like just take five percent off the velocity every frame so i want them to be more stuck although they don't i suppose maybe it should be like a random amount it's more like dripping but their lifespan should be maybe much longer attach them with springs shouldn't the fade be in reverse that's an interesting idea so i'm not seeing that so one thing that i really need to do first of all these particles should be much smaller um ellipse 12. so let's give it a size um and let's just say this dot r times two so that's the radius and actually let's look at the radius two um and then again this isn't exactly going exactly right i think let's make you know 10 particles per frame i just need a lot more we'll definitely improve things there we go all right so i'm kind of getting there but really it just looks like a particley mess so i think that actually they should probably have a small chance of dripping like they don't all drip people are telling me that css filters they fade in so honorable that's a great suggestion but i think i want to try to do this without css just because i don't know how to do any of that i would love for somebody to contribute an idea like that so all right i need to take a short break um so um i'm gonna this is like a good start um what i would uh what i would what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna share this link to this sketch right now uh here so uh if you when i take the break um if you want to like play around with it a little bit and if anybody like also i should just limit the velocity that not multiply it that's simon said that's a good idea if people want to like uh mess with it a little bit and give me some tips of how i could make it more blood dripping like another thing could be just to actually it might make sense for me to draw um you know i wonder if actually like overlaying the dots on that image and of course it needs to be red might actually like improve the dripping equality to it again this is like off uh i need it to be much more streaky maybe it should be faster and fade out faster i don't know each particle deposits a small amount decrease the particle's radius ah that's a very interesting idea i like that idea so um i'm gonna i just i'm saving this sketch um you can play around with it and i will look for your tips but i very very briefly want to thank today's sponsor of the live stream um and that is my friends over at brilliant so uh do you want to wait i said you should be spooky about brilliant today do you want to learn something new something spooky and new brilliance is the place to do it i i think maybe i won't do my shtick when talking about brilliant so i i i love brilliant it's one of the websites that i use to try to find a lot of material for the coding train their approach is based on problem solving and active learning so you're seeing concepts visually and interacting with them and then answering questions that get you to think and they have a lot of wonderful courses so here i'm showing you um this is highly related to a lot of the tutorials that are on my channel right now there's a whole uh course about neural networks and in fact the next video that i'll be releasing is about training an image classifier with the ml5.js convolutional neural network and if you go through the brilliant course on neural networks that is the perfect foundation or complement to the stuff that i'm doing there's also this new course that i've talked about in previous times around infinity um and so um this is one that i really love it relates to like all sorts of fractal patterns and things that i've been looking at i mean reckoning with infinity is one of the major accomplishments of mathematics so this course it starts with basic counting and you work all the way up to many different kinds of infinity culminating in the profundity of cantor's theorem so i've done a lot of stuff with fractals but the other thing that i should mention is that um there are big updates coming to brilliant uh this month it's october 31st a lot of them might already be there but they'll certainly be there if you ch as the month as the month as the date transitions into november so stay tuned for updates um and i think what i would like to do which i always enjoy taking a minute to do on the stream and let me come back to here is go to the brilliant website and check out what today's um challenge is and actually this is one of those days where i have not done this in advance because i was very busy getting my costume together this morning usually i look at the challenge before i start and this is a calc doku puzzle what is it i mean i assume it's like sudoku fill the squares with a single digit each with the following rules each of the digits one through three is used exactly once okay oh it's three by three so you get to use one through three a marked region has anybody done a puzzle like this before i got to get the chat back open i'm not seeing it right now um simon is saying that his favorite course is the one on search engines that's not one that i've looked at i definitely am curious to check that out um if you're interested in search engines i might also really recommend reading the book algorithms of oppression by dr sophia noble fantastic book around uh the sort of history and politics of search engines i really recommend it i was in a book club over the summer loved that book um okay in the example below the region mark 7 plus must be filled keep reading so seven plus must be filled with oh so two and three have to go here no no one two three so you get seven one can't go here so one has to go here oh i can't do it because it's stepping me through the solution three goes there two two oh no no oh i could do two twice so two can't go here because it would be in the same line or column got it got it got it got it it's not one two three and here it's in the line okay okay i think i get it today's challenge oh no i hate these i really find these difficult how many solutions does this puzzle have so i guess i have to work on solving it and psy in the chat is saying use a viscous force yeah i do have a whole section in the nature of code on and i bet you there's a brilliant course on this on drag force um and so uh let me let's i'll come back to that but let me um let me try this okay so if there's a two here and this this has to be 4 with multiplication so the only way i can get 4 is 4 times 1 times 1 or 2 times 2 times 1 right but i can't do 2 times 2 because no so this so it has to be oh and then the four has to go here the one has to go here and the one has to go there right okay uh oh help me out folks what do i do next um two minus so i could get two minus three minus one i can't do that four minus two i can't do that so it has to be five minus three which means a four has to go there aha right okay that's good moving along here is there anything i don't want to deal with the 72. this is like one number what do i do with that it's just any number um all right maybe i do want to deal with the 72 how do i get oh by the way this is kind of related to i was helping my son with his sixth grade math and he was doing prime factorization so what's the prime factorization of 72 uh 2 times 2 times 2 times 3 is that right or 4 times 3 or 3 times 3 times 4 times 2 it's so hard to do this in my head 72. 9 i think i've got to use a 9 here right 9 times 4 is 36 times 2 is 72 yeah so two threes so the two threes and the to the two can't go here and the threes have to go either here or here um the two can't go here the two the three this has to be two threes and two twos is that what i'm saying or four and a one but i can't do a four and a one what did i just say three times three is nine times no no three three four two so the four can't go here the four has to go here and the two can't go here so am i right and saying that the two has to go here and the four has to go here and these are threes and threes no because this could be switched but i can't or could i switch these two also all right this is not right someone's gonna tell me uh right three times three there's not obviously more that i and then a two would have to go here right this kind of makes sense well this is one possibility but are there other did i i might have jumped the gun here uh oh this is hard this is very spooky where do the numbers go there's only one possibility for the threes all right so says k week month let me figure that out right because what happens if i put the threes here okay i can't put a four ah yeah i can't put a 4 here and i can't put a 2 there so perfect thank you three threes now if i've done that then the four has to go here and the two has to go here and then that means a five has to go here okay so i think oh and uh this is this is not a five goes here yeah a five goes there okay i think this is the only possibility now what else do i know so nine plus how do i get to nine four four plus it has to be i'd have to be unique numbers so i can't do four plus five has to be four plus three plus two so a three has to go here and a 2 has to go here okay i'm getting there 4 divided by 4 divided by 1 is a possibility no yeah or that's it that's the only way i can get 4 right four divided by one so this has to be a four and this has to be a one six plus four three two so i only have five and a one so this has to be a five and this has to be a one okay oh wait and now i know this has to be a one and this has to be a three okay cooking with gas people uh yeah the numbers what do they mean i'm so scared of them um all right so to get 10 well to get let's do 40 has to have five in it five wait a three is that going to work for the 40 to get four let's think about how i'm going to get 40 5 times 3 is 15. something's wrong here this doesn't seem right hold on oh do i have something wrong oh this could be this way yeah this could be this way i'm still unique everywhere okay so i think actually i just discovered why this has to be oh no no no no hold on but there's a 4 there so it has to be 4 and 1. one something is wrong can this be a three and this ah i think it has to be like this because this has to be a four in order for me to say uh five the only way to get 40 is five times two and i need a five and a two here so i made a mistake somewhere i think i've got it now i made a mistake yeah you can't get a 40 with a three so 5 times 4 times 2 okay so this has to be a 5 but these can be in either place right now right 5 can be in either place 2 minus 5 and 3 so 5 and 3 5 and 2 those both work but 3 and 5 and 2 and 5 both work and so let's say if i did this then the 2 would go here for 10 plus wait no 10 plus oh but i have a 5 there so 2 and a 3. no something's wrong oh wait 2 and 3. no two and five oh there we go so that's a solution that is a solution so i got a solution the question is are there more i think that i can swap these three and five two and five three and two yeah okay that's two solutions there's definitely two five and two five and three two and five in the middle column oh these can be swapped no oh these can be swapped two and five is that another oh no no i can't swap it vertically uh there's definitely two solutions i think there's more right because there's more combinations of swapping these around can i swap these oh yeah that's three three oh there's four there's four because i can swap these and then i can swap these so that's two there's four there's four i'm gonna go with this four four four ready i'm so scared this is scared ah i got it right thank you everybody thank you i got it right that was really fun i love this is this a thing doku i've never heard or did brilliant invent this i've never heard of it before i want to do more doku puzzles i want to make my own goku i really got to make a sudoku puzzle generator that would be a wonderful um coding challenge to do i'll have to find the time to do that sometime all right let me take a very brief break um thank you so much to brilliant for the sponsorship again uh please take the time right now if you have a minute to sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain lets them know you found out about brilliant through the coding train um you can sign up for free you can do your the countdoku puzzle yourself you can um offer your own explanation i guess there's other people who have uh explained it here's somebody um allison snyder from the staff oh wow i can walk through it step by step oh that's really cool um and uh to unlock everything that brilliant has to order through a premium subscription you'll get uh 20 off through that um link so okay i'm going to take a short intermission break um and just to refill my coffee and then i'll finish with my random number blood dripping and i gotta show some community contributions today i mean i can't i have to do that every saturday no microphone i was muted hello it is i count random number back from intermission to read to you the random number four hundred and forty five oh my god eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight eight this is not going very well is it you think maybe i could hire like a writer and i could get like uh i don't know some cue cards all right where were we we were attempting thank you again to brilliant the sponsor of today's live stream that's probably the last time they'll sponsor me again so thanks for all the times you sponsored me before 30 479 it's coming to get me so i want to figure out how to make this better and after i make it better after i make it better oh yeah it was great muted with the soundtrack i should just mute myself more often here i'm going to mute myself i think i think i pulled a muscle in my neck there so i want to make this better it doesn't really one thing that's like really slowed down because of all the particles that it actually works a little bit better the popping up of it is definitely a problem so people are saying fade in using the viscous force um is an interesting idea i don't think i need a sophisticated formula um like uh you know ultimately um i think a terminal velocity would make sense and actually maybe even coming to a stopping point um would be good i'm just curious if i make this even more so let's let's try a couple things i want to try the fading um in and also i don't know that i actually need to fade the particles because of the way that the background is oh i forgot i'm drawing the numbers so this this fading in the background is irrelevant oh you know what i should be doing is numbers should not should be clear transparent there we go this is what i was trying to do that's much better that's the effect that i was going for um now i can put this back i knew something was wrong here but fading in is important this like them popping up is weird um it certainly looks less weird a little later maybe all right so this is a little bit better ah oh i did miss your message violet could you violet do you have permission to post that into the discord links channel hopefully you do because that's i mean uh that's the best place uh for me to pull that up oh oh violet just did the coding challenge for me um all right so i'll grab that uh from there um although i could just like remove my screen and grab it i guess that's what i'll do i just don't like to show anybody's chat messages without their permission while i'm live streaming um but i'll download that really briefly um and uh i'll take a look at that in a second um so um but let me go back to what i was doing so i feel like the fading in is a good idea um i actually don't think that i want them to fade out on their own because i only want to fade them the truth of the matter is actually i think that i should just be using fewer of them and not fading it out at all um and i want to be i think i want to just use the bottom i think this would be most effective with yeah here i think i have an idea i think i actually i think the sort of physics aspect of this was a little misguided so let me do this in a different way let me take this out completely um let me just do one let's have each particle start with a lifespan of one and in update i'm going to say i'm going to say i'm going to add also a direction let's try fading it in i don't know if fading it in is really what i'm looking to do here lifespan plus di uh plus equals dir if this dot lifespan is greater than equal to 255 dir equals negative one so this will work and then when it gets down below zero oh i'm not removing the particles um so what there's probably like a filtering thing i can do particles.filter i keep it if it's not dead is that what i do i think that's what i do and do i need to set the array equal to it i think this right i want to filter out the ones that i don't want anymore uh what did that do dir is not defined i said that in the exact same intonation as firework is not defined as always i always forget that this stock this stock that's i thought it was going to say firework is not defined there um this dot dir this dot this dot this dot so this is definitely looking more promising with the fading in uh but i uh i'm not actually drawing it with its lifespan anymore let's just see if that helps it's fading in very very very slowly so that's kind of interesting uh and so this is very streaky i like that uh so there's something about the streakiness is good it's a it's a bit much here um the fading in should happen much much faster so let's just try like 10 times as fast fading in um should r be one so the dripping is much to uh and maybe actually is what i want to do less about a continuous sequence and more about um just having a fixed number of them right so this this is kind of like what i was going for what i've got here i don't like how they appear well that's fine um the problem is the number is so correct looking i wonder if i should actually draw the the number um like what if i also do this like instead of drawing the image let's draw the number uh what if i sorry sorry for a stroke stroke 255 0 0 point spots index i dot x so this is this is not what i want to do because it's just literally drawing all of them as points but if i give it a little bit of noisiness to it um so if i were to say uh like offset these a little bit maybe actually let's do it a different way uh this is maybe like a weird direction that i'm going in but i kind of want it just to i'll first look a little um and let's actually pick a random one each time so let me do it this way i'll do the same number of spots but and what if i were to do this offset dot x so i just want to offset them all a little bit um multiply that by two stroke weight two and give this a little alpha whoa it's taking a long time uh oh oh no i think i might have crashed myself into an infinite loop or is it just like taking forever to render this okay stroke weight was expecting no more than one argument oh that stroke weight why did that take so long let's just start with a hundred of them okay so that is yeah a thousand oh look at that ah it's just got a lot of spots so maybe i want to lower the resolution here for a second to four and do a stroke weight of four yeah this is good so why are they all oh no i don't wanna yeah that this is good this is more the number is sort of like you need to drop drops to break off from the streaks i don't know what that means a spookier font would help yes [Laughter] uh the font is too big spooky or font yeah and so the other thing is like let's make the step size two it's gonna take a while that's a little bit better yeah but i think rather than that if i make the step size four do the offset a little bit bigger and do just twice the number of spots whoops what did i do wrong here oh there's a parenthesis there okay cannot read x of undef oh oh i still have the uh i wasn't doing the random ones want it to be random which is a little silly but yeah so i wonder if i use like a little image texture or make this much bigger like it's kind of silly now like i should go back to having this be um just in the center let's try doing this 256. like i don't really need this to be at the top um and maybe this needs to be like 800 now go back to this 800 by 600 just want this to be a little bigger oh i got to change both of these remember how this was going to end up being like a jacko'lantern design i'm not sure if i really okay so all right this is much better than uh then what this is getting better there's no significance to this number so first let's make this a uh uh random up to a hundred thousand because that's what the random number book floor it and let's uh let's do that so it should be a different number now each time i run it but it should always have five digits number format number format num comma five so hopefully okay so we're going to get a new random number each time now i think i could improve the blood dripping so i think having it be a larger circle that shrinks changing the background image is a good idea the color could be something more bloody so let's but i my idea right now is to have uh this dot r of like four and then this dot r minus equal 0.1 or something like that uh i guess when it gets below oh below zero so maybe i should do map this dot life span which goes between 0 and 52 55 to between 1 and 4. can i do that oh boy little zoinks oh wait i still have this in here ah that was weird okay what's going on here what's going on with the lifespan starts at one direction is 10. so if it's greater than 255 it becomes negative one oh and maybe i need to set it to 255. no shouldn't it now go down and then eventually go past zero wait why is my thing why are these particles getting so large map oh minus equals no no no that's why that's the mistake so they're getting yeah that's good it's so it's all too perfect though right it needs to have more variety to it so i think that there should be this should be uh a random value between two and five uh r max and then so this should be r max and then um this should help and this dot r equals let's make it 0 for right now to start um oh this dot rmax sorry i need to make the cut font a little smaller so i just don't have enough space to work with here okay and that's getting better it's pretty spooky looking this is looking pretty good actually they look bubbly right i need to like fill that in more so maybe this where i'm drawing them here let's just see what happens if i make this 8. still kind of bubbly how do i i guess i could use i probably wanted like some sort of texture um how do i make them i guess i guess i could just go maybe i want to go through all the spots so i don't leave any of them and let's go back to two right oh but i'm i've got the step size um right better i mean what i really want to do is go over it like four times uh i modulus spots dot length yeah the radius should increase instead of decrease yeah they look like spikes or maybe it should just be random let's have a look at uh what violet did [Laughter] uh where was this download to here yeah let's have a look at what violet did ah i like this so this is using that uh fire effect oh this is nice i'm pleased that this isn't like a million times better than what i did just because i was feeling very inadequate for how i'm getting this to look um so let me come back to this i think the i think one thing that might work well is um i realized the spikiness is kind of weird i wonder if actually doing them a little bit uh now like 10 at a time here might actually be kind of nice like and then like it's just getting overwhelmed with particles uh so it's better to limit it but i do like the idea for seeing it a little bit at a time so i could say here if spots.length let's count uh i could just say if frame count if uh frame count is less than 100 i want to finish this up like people will make a much better version of this eventually change the shades of red by the radius fade the particles have some stop shorter than others perhaps so the stopping shorter than others should sort of work by the mere fact that they're all starting at random locations make the last iteration bigger so many interesting ideas here i think that i should stop here and people are going to make much better versions of this what i wanted to look at is how to make this into something that you could carve into a pumpkin so actually i think i want to move on to that um and yeah it should track like a rain droplet on a windshield so once again it's the same url i'm going to link this uh let's do this um if uh what would be great is if uh i think everybody should play around with this and see if you can get it to improve and all and then you could share back um i guess i could make a page for this here's an old one but the drops are more likely to spawn at the bottom from bopple apple and then maybe i could collect them if somebody could sort of collect a few contributions um you know in a way that i could retrieve them maybe a github issue thread um then i can look at a few variations of this but i want to actually move on because i would like to carve i would like to see if i can make something where you could carve your the contours of your face into a pumpkin and i have a very very specific idea of how to do this um so let's let's put this aside and save it i'm gonna hit stop that's like as far as i'm getting with this today i think and i just want to do the following you're going to see you're going to like this let's make a video 640 by 480. actually let's make it smaller 320 by 240. um and i'm going to say a video equals create capture um 320 to oh no video this is how you create capture video video dot size 320 240 um and let's just try this image video zero zero so i'm making a uh you know jack o lantern filter allow using the camera okay so now we see i have the video image right here it's actually nice that i have a green screen this will make this work really well the video image here and then the raw video and then drawing into the canvas because what i want to use use this filter function threshold and i'm just going to say 0.5 right now let's see what i get so what this is doing is it's taking the video and applying a threshold filter to it so every pixel is by definition can only be drawn as black or white and then and based on a given threshold of brightness so one thing that i think would be useful would be for me to have a slider i'm going to say slider equals create slider and the range is between 0 and 1. i'll start with 0.5 and the uh step size will be .01 i have a memory of doing this very recently i don't know um so now uh and you can do this with anything it doesn't have to just be your video um and now um i need to say uh slider.value let's just make sure this works so now i have a slider and i can change that threshold which is going to be very very useful for me in terms of calibrating what i want it to look like okay but i need there's a lot more that i need to do this i'm going to use the marching squares algorithm i think that's going to really work with this we're going to see i could blur it and all sorts of things but i think i want to use the marching squares to get like some contour like cutting contours i think blob detection i could use i'm not really sure i'm go let's go with me here i do think it would be useful to know the threshold value that we like so i might also say let slider div um and let's do oh let's slide or span i'm not really sure slider div equals let's just actually create a span slider val let's just call it that slider val equals create span slider dot value and then always update it slider val html slider dot value so this is all p5 dom stuff and i guess i should move this over a little bit can i work with a bigger video will that fit because i think that would be nice let's do width and height although the video actually probably should be smaller and then i should stretch it up and now i don't have the slider of course see this is why i didn't want a bigger video let's go back to let's actually let's do this let's make that smaller and then stretch it larger because i want to have more pixels to work with when i have the algorithm okay this is perfect okay so now i can find and probably uploading an image would be better here you can find sort of like a good threshold angle i've been wearing this costume is really messing it up i love how the coding train here is like so perfectly uh thresholded that could be coding training like making a coding train like logo design you could use the same sort of technique um but i thought what i would try to do here is go and get the marching squares code because this might make it much more oops much more contoury um and so what if i get there's a bunch of different oh image i actually already did this i forgot so great this is pro webcam i did it with webcam already oh interesting so let's i forgot that i made these versions of it uh let's just see what we get here yeah so i'm kind of imagining that that this is going to work so let's interesting so what am i doing here in this i have a draw line i have a threshold value i'm setting the pixels drawing oh that's just drawing it and then boy based on this threshold of the field is are the pixels i'm so confused the field is the brightness of the pixel which is easier for me to do once i'm thresholding it so let's grab this so maybe i don't know if the marching squares is going to help me here but i'm grabbing the marching squares i'm going to let's leave this fire effect one i'm going to here no this is the number blood dripping one how come i can't find what i'm doing now here we go so let's create the marching squares field the resolution i'm going to weigh way lower because i think that's going to be needed for getting the sort of contours effectively and i might need to like also blur the image then i need to create i guess this is creating the 2d array um so let's that's going to happen in setup that's the sort of field of numbers for the marching squares um then i need this draw line function and obviously you'll need to watch the marching squares video to see what's going on here now this is what's different um if i go whoops if i go through here to set the field this is where i can do something different so hmm in draw i'm loading pixels but i want to load the pixels from sure this is fine let's let's just use the canvas as is after drawing the image and filtering okay going through the columns and rows times the resolution this is fine uh spooky john pearson thank you spooky variable name and methods names today that's a good idea spook i'll try to incorporate that i love that idea um so i don't this i don't need to do i can just pull out the red value of the pixel because i've thresholded it and i need to work with the video with so this is going to be important in a little bit uh the video let's let me go back to having them be the same size because then i can go back to differentiating that uh get the just get the brightness is the pixels at that index value uh times four right and i'm drawing a rectangle that's fine let's do that let's just sort of see what happens here okay so this is this is thresh holding it and then putting the lower resolution squares but i got a weird error brightness was expecting oh i don't need this okay great so this is uh sort of lowering the resolution so i could do the contours and then and then if um i go to here this should draw the marching squares where's the yeah oh yeah i don't maybe i didn't need the marching squares but i really think that i do uh and draw a line let's make it red right now just to sort of see what did i get wrong here um get state is not defined so i there's a get state function ah here we go that i need okay so it's drawing the i'm imagining these to be the cut lines but obviously i don't see anything at all resembling my form can i make why this thought this sounded like a good idea at the time so i definitely need higher resolution so i want this to be 640 by 480 um which means which is fine because the v because what i'm actually analyzing are the pixels of the filtering that's great then i want the resolution to be like 10. let's just see what i get here yeah but it looks weird oh and something is way off yeah because i'm looking at the video pixels which don't yeah no kidding okay okay quiet down over there um we're at noon o'clock people what's what's not matched pixels of the index which is ah this there we go okay better but okay now i can play with the threshold and uh let's so i actually don't want to draw these rectangles that sort of defeats the purpose of what i'm doing i also want to be very close and i think that i want to blur the image sort of weird idea here to make myself sort of more ghostlike which might sort of blur things uh that didn't work zero don't put a zero there that was a bad idea uh hold on hold on yeah i can't do that i need a separate canvas if i'm gonna do that filter blur let's just try this and this it's going to make it run super slow but in a way i only need to do a snapshot yeah there we go now the question is okay so first of all my outfit here in the double glasses and wearing this like cape thing and the hat oh my hair is a mess uh and i could play with the threshold well this idea kind of failed but at least what i want to show you is um it's very slow because of the blur but i kind of what i wanted to do here is say background 255. i don't want to actually see that and then have this be stroke 0 just wanted to see it like this but well this is like such a failure i thought even with the green screen this would work so well um let's see thresholding what anybody have any i mean there is something here to this like that is kind of me but i'm not high contra obviously what the threshold is you know i should probably make use of the fact that there's a green screen and have that uh yeah uh all right blood dripping now from this this is kind of interesting i want to take the blur out just because it's really slowing it down and i probably should like when i have when i want to just save it yeah i mean because this because also why not just make the resolution much much lower yeah oh there we go now i'm getting somewhere i just need to make the resolution lower i mean i need to do blob detection and then like filter out these like lower ones that's what the tiny ones the noise that's what i thought blurring would do what if i have an idea what if when i hit mouse pressed uh render equals false i set render equal to true and then if render run the blur and then at the end if render save frame jack lantern it'll save it with a number dot png and then render is false so basically i'm able to operate this super fast um but when i rent when i click the mouse it'll render it with the blur on so let's see how low can i get this resolution with it being quite speedy like it is like at what point yeah so i think four was a good number and i should get the i should get the interpolation code in here that's also going to make it better let me grab that interpolation code marching squares metaballs interpolation open simplex interpolation it doesn't really matter let's grab this one so the interpolation i think was just a change here oh i think oh this is a little scary right i think the interpolation code which smooths out the contours is just this particular loop so i think let me hit save and let me go back to this loop here i think all i need to do is paste in this version of it shoot uh do i need another curly bracket here think so oh is it gonna make it run super slow oh i did something bad use a sobo filter okay did i save it with the uh yeah yeah hold on so let's go back to like a high what did i do columns maybe just all the extra math for the interpolation oh the threshold that's weird is this the interpolation let's make sure the interpolation one is working yeah this is what i was looking to add to it this is the interpolation um threshold equals one oh was the threshold oh the threshold being one why did i have that ah what's going on people why is why is the threshold one oh oh because it it calculates it i'm so lost is this what i pasted in no i didn't get the interpol oh no this is the noninterpolation okay i'm back let's make the i just want it i i i this was this is possibly unnecessary but let's make it like let's lower that resolution it should be super fast now okay i just want to add and try adding the interpolation in which should be just a matter of replacing this with all the lurpy stuff i don't know why that's crashing that is very disturbing uh that it like that my example with i just feel like the smoothing it out will be nice and if i could just get that to work i could put my hat back on so you don't experience my hat head oh look at interpolation get state code that changes also no it's the same it's just this loop let's see it's hard for me to tell because it's so it doesn't seem like it worked correctly oh i'm assuming the values in field are between zero and one i think no i guess i should give up on the interpolation i should probably give up on the interpolation right because it doesn't seem to translate here i had two it so weird though what is did i change the way i'm getting the field of numbers oh i normalize no no that's just for the bubbles oh this one's using distance oh wait wait wait no wonder this is like a kind of a different example let's go to this one this is what i want this this is what i want all right this is the one this is more analogous to what i'm doing so let's try this one and i think the values in the noise are between negative one and one so i might have to change something uh this was getting get state which is the same ceiling field ah because it's either a zero or a one so what i want to do is round it i want to round it in mine i think so instead of ceiling i think i want to round it oh but not here i think this is going to work where does it do that huh did i did i not paste it into the right place yes i did not i pasted it into the wrong place oh i'm doing this is so hard no come back yes this one this loop uh this is like the longest bit of code to copy paste which is making this very difficult goes here and then i want to change this to round i give up this should give me uh no it's always going to do a float in javascript no one's telling me what i'm doing wrong here try changing the res back again all right try changing the res back again 12. yeah it's i don't see the interpolation happening it does the draw line function different no right so by the way as i make the resolution lower and lower the interpolation is less meaningful so i think i'm gonna get go i'm just gonna go back to what i had let's refresh this page oh whoops i'm in here i hope i don't lose my code i'm doing the worst job oh boy you're out there all twice no it's telling me what i'm doing wrong because you're twice uh this was a a bad digression and it's 12 15. i'm going to give up on it it's so not important let me just go to i'm let me go to view code which is easier than working with the web editor to copy paste and let me just get the regular noninterpolated one back because that was fine i didn't need to change it and let me go back to the resolution is four everything's going to be fine oh i forgot that i did the b divided by 255 there we go okay this is what we're working with people i don't need to interpolate because i've got like a really sort of high resolution image so let me try to get my face oh whoops so i need a button i definitely need a button uh let's create about save button equals create button render and then save button mouse pressed um and let's just put an anonymous function in here that says a render equals true so instead of this global mouse press only when i press the button because i i need to press the mouse to move the slider okay so um i can play with the threshold i don't know what looks the most like me let's see what i'm saying press render okay i got an error save frame is not defined i guess that's processing speak uh i should just make it a random number let's just do let's just let's just call it jackolantern.png for right now try this all right let's take a look at what this image looks like is it better well it's different there carve this into your jackolantern edge detection and marching squares well i think if i had a cleaner image so one thing that we could do with this is for example um let's instead of let's let's do this so for example let's grab a coding train character speaking of which where we were on the uh faq let's go to uh the coding train things let's download characters emoji size uh 320 by 320 like for example let's say we want to carve this character into the pumpkin okay now first of all just printing this out would probably be enough because you can trace the contours but let's just try it with my methodology uh download and let's now go to here where where am i close this is not what i'm looking at this is not what i'm looking at here so let us do a um let's create um let's create a file input i think it's create file input is that right yeah so i'm going to add something that i could choose a file and then there's like a callback here like got file let's see what i get i forget how this works so i'm rather than look at the documentation i'll just figure it out so if i go to choose file and downloads and i get this character i get file it's of type image and oh i get the i get the data the pixels are the image and something called data perfect so um and then i can replace the video let's do let image so if if image draw the image else draw the video so if i'm going to make it so that if i upload an image it's going to draw that instead and so now in the got file function i should be able to say like if image dot let me just look at it over here i guess i'll look at it here if image.type yeah if image dot type equals oh if data i guess like file if file.type is image oh i gotta show some community contributions if file.type is image then uh image equals create image image.data a file.data let's just see how this works so choose the file now try this character oh whoa [Laughter] what is going on insanity i think there's a lot of noise in that png but look at this you've got the contours now oh i really want the interpolation to work somebody will fix that this actually is very halloween like wait why did it do this oh because of the blur no i'm not blurring okay well let's let's play with the threshold here there's some kind of noise in the background is it from stretching it like i don't understand this at all the png has transparency that must be it right it must be that the png no but the video is not being oh the video the png has tran i got it i don't know if i need a white background or a black background but there we go because i'm operating off the pixels of the image i'm drawing so there we go now why did i get create image was expecting to oh right so it needs a um when you create an image it always should have an alt uh text tab so like i'm just going to call it like uploaded file from a user to get rid of that message uh for accessibility purposes no data is not defined where line 42 oh yeah i don't need this okay great so now there any image and i can play with the thresholding so i can take any image so for example and i don't know why i can't get the interpolation to work so that it's not so so that it's smooth but somebody will help me with that uh so let's grab let's just say um let's try like googling my image and maybe like if i take this uh uh let's take this and then now let's go back to here and we choose another file oh did i put that on the desktop no where did i save that does anybody remember save image as who knows where i put it desktop downloads let's try this there we go see we're getting somewhere so now i can play with the threshold uh and then oh i feel like this looks like a bit more and if i had a much more thoughtfully lit photo of myself like there we go now and now i can hit save render and let's see what i get so i probably i guess maybe i want to put the blur the blur option i might want to take out now i want the interpolation and the blur working this why do i have that tom scott folder i will get to that so uh great so this works i'm gonna put this in the discord uh this is as far as i'm gonna get with this people can improve upon it and i might try to get something um let me go back to the um links i guess is this the same sketch i'm not sure um in the discord i'm putting this here so this is the sketch right now oh and you don't see me this is the sketch right over here that i'm working with so you can grab the code from there and you'd see by the way it shows the images down here that i'm uploading um or i could have a much better interface to this but you could imagine how this could help you create something that you could then print and then tape onto your pumpkin and draw around now there's got to be a better image of me i'm actually doesn't need to be me uh coding train like i could try any number of these things images i could design something i could try this like let's let's use this oh i don't know what uh so like if i took this save image as uh coding train and it's going to stretch it weirdly because i'm not taking into account the resolution but let's choose the file let's go to this one and then you know kind of like this there we go uh anyway i could make this much higher resolution i could make this in processing but this now i feel like this is sort of carvable right this is carvable though there's a lot of weird like i don't know how you would carve this but you could you know you could sort of see some of these enclosed you could carve this out and then go oh i don't know i don't understand how you carve this because there's actually like enclosed shape issues oh well well well well close enough thanks everyone now before i go from this spooky coding train which it's now 12 30 i've really got to go it's really i really should it's time for me to look at at least one or two community contributions from you the viewer of the viewers of the coding trade usually i do this at the beginning you are what makes you you are the energy that powers the coding trade and i would love to feature some of your work um and the way that i go and do that but by the way if you get any of what i'm doing today working better and the idea here was that i would get like the blood dripping number and then get the contours and then that i would use to carve a pumpkin there's pumpkin carving is starting in two minutes in this house and i gotta go down and participate in that but um if you want to help give me hey carve your own pumpkin and share it with me but uh if you want to help clean up my code and make it a little better and give me a pumpkin design i will carve it on a pumpkin it might be a small pumpkin because i don't have a lot pumpkins but i will carve it using this pumpkin carving kit so uh but before i go i i've gotta show some community contributions so let's go and find the wheel here is our wheel of community contributions um by the way thank you to um there is a viewer i don't know if you're watching please shout yourself out if you're watching who created an api to grab random coding train contributions from the website i don't believe that this is using that yet but i would like it to be let's spin this wheel and what are we going to get ray casting game with maze generation uh this is from grilli 86 the original coding challenge is rendering ray casting which you could uh take a look at it's this coding challenge which sort of like in all using just total 2d rendering techniques to create a sort of old style raycasting c um system that then generates this 3d ish scene and let's look at oh and i have another coding challenge that's maze generation so this is combining them oh my god i'm so excited about this wow this is wild okay wait wait wait wait oh and i don't see the maze what are what's my what do i have to press oh i turn i need to find oh i can walk this way oh my god this isn't insane and so cool and i'm walking through the maze i love this so much amazing job can i keep going let's get to the end of the maze wow what a cool uh combination of these two examples i'm lost no i think i got to it where do i go what did i miss can i go further this way no oh but i can go this way oh that's a dead end too i've already tried this by the way is this like there's a secret command i think for like revealing the maze i seen remember looking at this before but i guess i gotta turn around this is a spooky maze for sure no this way i must find the end of this maze i must get out of here i'm trapped i'm trapped although there's there's another way there's another way i have found another way i'm going to go all the way to the end here could this be the way no i've hit a dead end i think i would like by the way for this circle to be a shape that when i rotate i see which way it's pointing or for the rays to be a more distinct higher color contrast that would really help me i think this is the way this is the way i have spoken the maze has spoken let's try it this way no what did i miss was it all the way back at the beginning is this another way to go and so everybody was tuned in like four hours later but i was still trying to get through this spooky maze spooky maze spooky this way no that's the beginning which way am i which way am i looking i can't tell wait no this isn't that where do i go where do i go where do i go where do i go is that away no that's down up to the right that's a wall what did i miss oh is it here is this a path is that the path this is terrifying and so we looked at one no this is the second community contribution oh god i gotta backtrack now why why do you keep zooming out where do i go this way boy i really did i get unlucky here am i just really bad at mazes is it a straight shot from here is it just straight down this corridor is not really what it is oh count random number has won the maze challenge oh it gave me another one that was amazing what a terrific community contribution let's look at one more today on the coding train we will be traveling to the fourth dimension we travel to the fourth dimension david snyder spookily has created a hyper cube based on the hypercube coding challenge have a look this is a fitting way to end where's my my blair witch uh simulation all right this is great i like to see this hypercube render this looks like it's being rendered actually in um with a 3d renderer i guess that's is that how i did it i can't even remember what i did but i love the hypercube as like and there's a really amazing um um video about hyper cubes that's not my video but from the the leo s uh youtube channel and i'm sure i referenced in my challenge and my uh video it's amazing um all right i was looking for my um phone which i don't know where i put it oh here it is which i can now connect to say goodbye um let's see if i can do this i just i'm so excited by the fact that i now have the ability to and hold on i'm waiting for it to connect connecting to your computer over wifi it has connected and now if i go here we can see there we are all right everybody i think this is how i will finish things out um by talking to the camera here um make it stop yeah i made it stop um and so simon wants me to remind you i mean this was an idea that i no it's not an idea that i had but let's see if we can figure out i wanted everybody to go from the coding train over to this 24hour math stream um so uh i don't know why i'm doing this here let's just go back to this feed much more comfortable this way um i was not going to do my blair witch stick anymore so let me play my old timey goodbye music although you know really we should keep with the spooky theme so if you would please let's go find it uh how do i find the math magic 24 hour of stream here it is oh let's see let me go i'm going to oh is it over it says it's finished seven hours ago what i'm looking at part two oh there's a part two fourteen fifteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one so right now are you happy that's half the deck this is the stream of the day so there's a 169 people watching right now i'm going to paste this link into um the our discord and i encourage everybody as i say goodbye to head over to the uh 24hour math magic show um say hello there from the coding train you can put so i don't don't interrupt i know there's a thing on twitch where people do these raids and they like all like flood the chat with like train emojis would be the thing but i think that might be interrupting their flow so just go over and say hi from the coding train i guess and then join um very join nicely stay tuned for my videos that are coming out on how to make a discord bot um check out the zoom annotation video if you haven't checked that out um also the convolutional neural network image classification video is coming out and um oh my battery on my uh soundboard which has to be plugged in died it could i'm gonna need to play some music as i leave so i'm gonna like put this cable across my lap into here so hopefully it'll come back alive i'm seeing if there's any questions and please if you are able to use anything i did today to carve a jackolantern uh at shiffman on twitter share it in the discord i um anywhere let me know or if you just have the design that you've like came from a coding train coding challenge using some of the techniques i showed um send that to me very quickly because i'm now moving on to carving uh pumpkins uh once again with uh this uh you know i'm really really um talking this like uh pumpkin masters the number one selling brand uh who's not officially a sponsor but there is a sponsor today uh brilliant.org just a reminder to check out brilliant. brilliant.brilliant at bullying.org codingtrain uh brilliant also has an app which is pretty terrific that you can use as well all right um my soundboard is coming back to life um and so i'm going to say goodbye i'm looking to see if there's any chats have i heard of twitter it's amazing yes um that's a that's a way of like within a tweet like having a snippet of code then you render um that's super awesome stuff and i'm getting my soundboard back up low battery that's no problem and i think my favorite of all these was this one so i'm gonna just say goodbye with this music um head over to the 24 hour maths magic show um that i'm featuring right here i'm gonna head over there too as well to say hi in the chat and i'll see you all next next saturday vote if you haven't voted and you're if you're able to vote please vote um and i hope i'll be back next saturday i'm back every every saturday in the morning is live streams tutorial videos coming out during the week tutorial recording sessions happen on friday if you're thinking about joining as a member uh when you join you'll get to see some of those you'll be able to get previews of some of the videos and things and all that stuff uh more rows would be nice for a jackolantern alright goodbye everybody so as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop stop i just stopped never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me
