hello happy May 4th I'm gonna do Cody challenge for May 4th on the coding spaceship this Cody challenge I'm going to make some scrolling text that looks as if it is scrolling off into the distance and it is the return of the 15minute timer which when has that ever gone wrong I mean it's always been so great to have the time for nothing if it goes wrong with the timer so um why am I doing this challenge today it's I don't know it's the 4th of May and I thought it might be appropriate and maybe someday I'll get a sponsorship and then I'll be able to you know have all these logos and music happening at the same time ok here we go let's start the timer and let's begin all right so I'm gonna do this in processing processing is a Java based programming environment if you were anybody else or if you were born after 1990 you would probably do some kind of like CSS transforms and have some crazy cool 3d text scrolling thing in the browser I'm old and I'd like to draw my pixels one at a time so here we go let's make a window that is let's just start with like 800 by 600 and let's let's just admit the fact that we're going to be doing this in 3d and I'm going to add the p 3d renderer then in draw I'm gonna say background 0 oh and I need some text hmm so let's make a text file but first let me save this and I'm gonna call this I'm gonna just say this is the desktop under May 4th challenge and I'm just checking the chat because I'm gonna need help definitely gonna need help I'm at 14 minutes ok and don't get distracted don't get distracted ok text edit on the e key still doesn't work on this computer so many things going wrong format plain text so let's get some text I am using in this coding challenge processing org and so I don't know this looks like some good text oh yeah this is great let's look at this let's use this okay so I'm going to save this as I'm gonna go to the desktop and I'm gonna go to May 4th challenge and I'm going to go to space dot txt no e on fingers ok there we go so now in back in my sketch here I want you access that text so I'm going to create actually I'm gonna create a variable I'm gonna call it a txt I don't want to call it text because there's a function called texted processing and just so I don't confuse myself and once I'm gonna use the load strings function and I'm gonna load look at I call that file space space dot txt but the thing is you might be wondering here I really don't have time to explain I'm going to anyway why do I have this array of strings called lines well it so happens that the load strings function loads a text file and takes every line from that text file it makes it a separate element in an array and this is actually very convenient in most cases but not so much right now so I am then going to instead say actually this might actually be really useful because I might I might want to make use of that array but right now I'm just gonna say T XT equals joint lines lines dot join and then I will join them with the line break character and join I'm going to join them with the line breaker lines that join hmm maybe I need to give it double quotes because it's not a character it's a string no oh let's check our errors cannot invoke join string on the type of string array oh oh right let's do this this is a processing function that exists lines that's called join that's written into processing there's no join function for an array in Java I guess and the join function is part of the processing API where I can take an array and join them with a line break ok now we are going to say a fill 255 because I want my text to be white on a black background then I'm going to say text txt and I'm gonna say I'm gonna give it a bounding box of the full window and let's just run this and see what we got okay there we go there's our text it is in this window there it is alright let's do some stuff I really should think about the font oh I didn't even think about this do I have time to go look for the appropriate font for this particular simulation that I then I'm attempting to code without buzz marketing for free a particular commercial process is really pointless what I'm attempting to do here oh it's a single anyway text font Oh text size let's just try text size sixtyfour okay I also want to use it that's pretty good I also want to use text align and I want to full justify that's not gonna work let's try Center just out of curiosity what does that do uh it centers it okay centers it within that box well let's we use that for right now okay we're doing well what is I got 10 minutes I have time to eat some melon there's gonna be really weird I I'm so confident about this code challenge this piece of melon which you're wondering what is the deal with this piece of melon it's purple it's blue this is the magical space melon that they eat on the planet ma Phooey that's the only planet I know delicious very good very low pH soothing of the throat okay sponsored by alien melon okay now what I want to do is I need a variable I'm gonna say I was about to say let but I'm in processing I need to specify the type float y equals zero lets you let's set the text at zero comma Y and let's say Y minus so Y is just going to change by one every frame and now we have scrolling text where'd it go oh look at this I gave it a bounding box which was the high OH this was gonna be a no edit this is gonna be a no edit coding challenge can't edit that out the camera went off it's fine it fixed it so I need to can I possibly make this bounding box without I mean I could just do this and here's the thing I want it to start right I want it to Y to start at height okay I'm getting some so now here we go processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code okay this is great I'm we're wasting time here alright I'm told there is a specific color that I'm supposed to use so let's change that r75 2 1 3 2 3 8 all right cross the finger is a flexible software sketchbook I there must be a specific font it also needs to be full justified I'm gonna see if I can manage that but here's the thing it's so this is just scrolling up but I I have made this do not forget AP 3d sketch which means what I can do right now is I want to rotate the scene this way now if this is if this train whistle is representing my axis of rotation this is the zaxis that would be something spinning around if I were to just say for example whoops move them back out here and say something like oh let me rotate by you know 45 degrees which is radians of 45 or I'm gonna say PI pi divided by 8 no pi divided by 2 is 90 so pi divided by 4 is 45 degrees we should see the text is completely gone why I need to blick I need to rotate around the center I need to rotate around the center of this look at that there it goes here it comes it's kind of like this that should be the sound effect that goes along with this all right so I what I want to do is rotate by X but let's I think actually what's going to make more sense is for the world of this universe that I'm building to be have its origin point in the center so really what I want is for I'm going to take out the rotate really what I want is to translate that the top left is the default origin point zero zero so now I want that origin point to be in the middle and you're going to see it now why am I not seeing anything I will eventually it's very slow the scrolling text way too overconfident about this but so now what I want is for the text actually to not be at zero comma Y but to be at negative width divided by two so offset it and then Y can start at height divided by two and now we should see back to what I had before and now hopefully I can now rotate right this was this will now rotate my text along the z axis so it's doing that but what I really want to do is I want to rotate it along the x axis I wanted to like sort of fold down so I don't say rotate X and processing is a flexible software is it too slow or it's not actually the appropriate speed I also can't see it at all so let's make it much wider Oh wrong color I'm told 238 to 1375 I did it backwards ok processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts I don't know it's going kind of slow let's uh let's have this go a little bit faster what else does this need this is done done four minutes ago yeah there we go what else should I do that is approximately the right speed yeah so the one thing is I pretty sure that if I were being true to this particular design it really should be full justified I'm trying to think of how to do that make it like 80% of the width yeah so I guess what I should do also the bounding box I guess I can adjust the bounding box ya know but that's not doing me any good because why doesn't that Oh No okay so negative width so hold on so I need to let me just make this so this should be negative W device so I want the bounding box and the text to be centered based on the bounding box so I've got a and I want that bounding box not have to be the full width so I'm shrinking it by like eighty percent and I probably should have the font the text size be related to the width as well so what it was like twelve hundred divided by 64 mph it was sixty point that would be a hundred two hundred so I could say width divided by two hundred right oh no I meant to say not 220 so let's do this and so that's right I guess the size is too big actually so let's make the text size width divided with times 0.15 and now whoa I meant oh one five I don't know what I'm doing anymore just just make up numbers so no point force can be really thick Oh 5% oh yeah 5% 5% is good let's make a little smaller let's make it like 3% this is really the way this is the way to program just try different numbers oh the width is still too wide ah this is the problem I liked my size I wanted to enter there we go thank you that only took me a minute 42 seconds left processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts okay what else do I need to do in my minute and a half that I have left text mode is model or shape yeah yeah so there is a text mode thing oh the full justify no I have a challenge you try oh and the reason why I was doing this is because I wanted to demonstrate Processing's wonderful fullscreen function and whoa that's weird why did that happen when I went full screen huh do I just need to rotate much more what did I what did I do to deserve this that's so weird what if I do this how am i doing on time yeah that's so weird why would I went full scope from p.3d thank you I wonder I'm so of course size is where you specify the width and height manually and a particular renderer if I say full screen I still need to specify the renderer so it was working but it just defaulted to a 2d renderer and rotate X didn't work oh the timer went off I finished here we go we're done I can't do the gibreel sleng I can't talk while I'm eating how does he do it somebody's gotta have told me we don't know who I'm talking about check out de brillz YouTube channel I have now made a sideways scrolling yellow text thing with no theme music or branding whatsoever with some processing text in the amount of time that I was given it really should have it really should be full justified I will leave that to you I hope you make a version of this please make some but that timer do you hear the timer or you just hear it because I really want to hit okay okay make your own version of this add stuff to it to make it more fun or different or with your own style I'll try to make a JavaScript version of this with p5 and the WebGL renderer of p5 we could make a 3 J s1 and then of course all of you who know more than I do prop many of you could probably make a CSS one with transforms and all that fancy new stuff I know Sarah Dresner who is like my CSS probably knows a way to do this ok put a star field behind it yes you can do that good bye I'm gonna finish this I'm just like I'm just gonna be done with this Kody's down goodbye
