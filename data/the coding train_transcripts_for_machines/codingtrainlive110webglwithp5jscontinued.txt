I'm loading slowly very very very slowly please place your corners into the slots so I can load more quickly more corners super chat pay speed up my buffering all right yeah I could spend more time working on that and rehearsing that but here I am it is me dan Schiffman on a special Thursday coding train hopefully coming out to you at regular normal buffering speed let me just switch back to my laptop view yeah it's still there maybe as a coding challenge we should make buffering animations today oh and then the kids went off of course all right so much for my stick they're really really high I'm getting high ratings getting high ratings for my ridiculously bad goofing around all right let me see here now how do I make that go away it went away and here we are hello and welcome to a special Friday edition every two or three minutes I'm gonna come back to buffering I'm buffering buffering buffering and buffering how high would this thing go what you will be watching today is a person a human being on the internet using a standard desk that goes down and up and down and up until you put more money feed it into the machine send me your Bitcoin your crypto currency of choice and then I will come to you somebody actually gave me a super chat donation that was a joke I'm doing fine everything's fine I'm okay all right here we go oh wait hello and welcome to a special Thursday coding train episode with me your host Dan shipment Cody train as you know is brought to you by what water and I don't want to buzz market this because because of the what's the buffering I've had to use a plastic bottle can you see what's good I'm here a couple extra times this week I was here on Tuesday and I'm here today because I'm trying to make up for some missed weeks in November and December I will also be back tomorrow morning if all goes according to plan and my broadcasting setup still works and I'm going to be today continuing the WebGL 3d in p5.js tutorials that I was doing earlier this week on Tuesday so that's what I'm gonna get started on very very soon and I'm looking at the chat and uh some people are asking some questions where can I buy a shirt of the channel Oh are you looking for a last minute holiday gift buffering nevermind forget about the buffering if you if you would if you feel like getting some coding trained merchandise the URL for that is coding train dot Storenvy comm you can also go to amazon.com slash shop the coding train and find all sorts of book recommendations and things you can get your very own copy of the code etrade brought to you by a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviants it's my favorite book it's the book that I read to my children at night before they go to sleep and in fact it is the book that I will read some with which to you right now are my random numbers coming at you in regular internet speed or slower forty nine thousand eight hundred and forty seven sixteen thousand two hundred and twelve sixty nine thousand two hundred and seventy nine eighty seven thousand eight hundred eighty as always I always forget the okay I'm warmed up now so let me figure out where we were last time I'm not organized so I got to get myself organized here oh whoops getting hot in here let's see so first thing I want to do is open up terminal and second thing I want to is go to my finder maybe the desktop web GL p5 WebGL so this is where I was working on some WebGL stuff so let me go there so I need to go to the desktop oh this computer just went away come back WebGL and let's run a server let's see what we last left off uh rest we had these spinning normal tourists so what I'm going to do first but there was a lot of debugging and figuring stuff out so I'm gonna see if from that session I can make a tutorial that kind of makes some sense and covers the different pieces I corrected some things in these so the things that I want to have open are the reference I know that Simon has made a wonderful p5 WebGL cheat sheet I might call this which I can which allows me to quickly look at all the different kinds of light and materials great ambient material normal excellent excellent excellent okay and then now here's the tricky thing you might recall whoops that last time on last coding train I had this whole WebGL diagram all written over here on this whiteboard right behind me it's been erased so I think I might want to try to recreate that does anybody have a screenshot for me that you can share probably in the patron slack group oh I should mention just as a matter of update patreon did make an announcement this week that they are not going to implement the features that just about everyone universally did not like creators and patrons included so if you did cancel your pledge because of the patreon fees changes that's totally understandable you're not at all required to repledge but if you want it to repledge you can and just as a reminder pledging to patreon is with that you get an invite to the slack group and some other various things at different levels okay so everyone wants me to do shader shaders it's not going to happen today but it is on my list of things to do at some point eventually so okay I'm waiting for my someone to give me a screenshot of that taya Graham I guess I could look it up myself that could not be so lazy Oh somebody I got it already thank you Matthew in the slack channel so let's see I'm gonna attempt to recreate this as much as possible this so this is kind of silly that I'm doing this oh and my eyesight is just not good enough so I wrote WebGL here and I had a list 3d geometry camera alright 3d geometry camera material texture likes me certain how in a different in a different order that's fine where's my eraser I'll just use this whoo thanks texture material lights what else do I got over here normal I talked about but I talked about that later so and then I just said I just had over here create canvas I just said something like blank comma blank comma web GL something like this approximately just to kind of make it look vaguely similar to what it was before so that was 3d what else is there hardware accelerated outright I was talking about open GL and hard ware accelerated and that's good enough I think okay so okay so n whoops where am i over here now okay so thank you for that Matthew and okay now so let me think here what now here's the other question this code oh I need to open up the code this code is a mess of things so whatever did I leave it what was at the end of I think I might just have to look at my live stream from last time so if I look for if I look for hello computer this is the previous live stream from a couple days ago and at some point I start talking about material I'm watching myself sorry you guys can't hear this okay so this looks like I think where the code was where it left off so it was just a Taurus rotating with no light maybe I was the background there just black sorry I went back too far wait there's me into XP the political 3 yeah okay okay yep there we just needed to see that okay now let me come back to here well save Oh caching or not does it am I not looking at the right sketch now I am oh there we go was it like much thinner or something there we go uh use the arrow keys to skip forward or backward five seconds that's great I didn't know that yes Topher asks so he's going to redo the materials and light stuff yeah so I apologize for this but I did look it over and I think this is one of those cases where I was like swapping out the p5 library and then I made the it just it's not worth it's not a it's not worth to having somebody have to watch a like hourlong debugging session for me if they just want to see a tutorial about material and lights and B if if Matty and I were to edit that our thing down it's just gonna be so jumbled and messy that's actually mmm it's a better use of time to just spend the 20 minutes to do the tutorial again the only thing that's a kind of an issue is it's it I'm kind of my brain is out of sorts that don't really when I do these sessions I have a very clear picture of where I left left off last left off and what I was saying and I actually kind of completely forgotten but I think if I start from here and just open with what I'm gonna do our materials and lights and so what I need is what I also need is the p5 WebGL tutorial this is very getting started definitely want this and I want to have lights and materials okay so I want to take a little bit I'm gonna leave it as is okay the other thing that I would like to do is I remember we found some really key bugs and I was kind of going back to old versions of p5 and new versions to like fix those bugs so let me let's take a minute if you guys could help me remember this oops let me first look and see did anyone post any of these issues so this is two days ago I wonder if this is somebody who this issue because I'm planning to do a video about this Oh nonsquare this so this is interesting we're gonna look at this when we get to textures there's also this from nine days ago so this is way before so what I want to look at is lights WebGL let's look for that this is a very old issue so I'm gonna I think this one has been so I think one of the things we're gonna want to do is file some issues so so I'm gonna keep track of this stuff also so what were the issues where can I keep track of this stuff I'm gonna make a so I'm gonna file these issues later in the stream so that you that everyone doesn't have to sit through it right now if you really just want to look at the tutorial material but like I really should have kept these notes before and what version was sixteen point light and directional light calls overwrite previous lights there is only one rather okay so that's one thing that's what I remember where there's some other things there was something with I think yeah I'm looking to see in the chat you know what something I'm kind of interested in I was actually curious to redo the bees and bombs a cube wave in processing in P 3d mode just to kind of compare and see what it looks like there if there's time today and people are interested in that I would love to do same with directional lights yeah all right so hopefully these will come up again so right now I am in I'm using the old version currently using the old version which I don't want to use but that will work what I do want to see is does the normal material yeah okay that's fine so I'm going to for the purpose of this tutorial use the older version of p5 that can get a little more space here and here we go all right neural networks in machine learning coming in 2018 to January that's what imma get started this week and next week is really about me trying to wrap up some stuff although I do hope to do some tutorials around a word to Beck and maybe even some clustering some machine learning topics that without neural networks before the end of next week alright so let me get started here in the newer one the Y is not flipped Thank You Simon for mentioning that so in other words for the lights or for the oh the lights are the lights aren't flipped for the is that just for the lights so check check Y Y Direction zero point five point one six versus zero point five point seven so let me just check really quickly this so in other words if I say translate if I say translate v zero comma 50 with Y being flipped it went down if it went down okay but in the new version where a p5 whoa and I get the wireframe so that's right so why isn't flips it goes down in both versions but do the lights do something different all right let's just humor me for a second here point light what do I use for a point light first I do first I do the color and then the location zero 50 zero go I have the fill on turn that off so this is very hard for me to see where the light is because it's not a sphere so the light is sorry everybody but this is sort of important for me to figure out okay so negative 200 the light is coming from above the light is coming from above so that's working correctly and in that's in the new version on the old version it's the light so as long as I don't move the Y location of the lights around I can have multiple point lights if I have one point let you know what I'm gonna do here's what I'm gonna do there's I know where I'm gonna use the current version of p5 and then at any point in this tutorial if I want to show two lights I'm going to if I want to show two lights I'm going to switch it and that'll bet the switching won't get edited out to the old version of the library and so any bugs that are in the old version of library I don't care about those yeah so the light being positioned in the correct place in the new lot new version is correct so I need to go back to take out this point light take out this translate put this back to Taurus it's 100 and put this in fill 255 oops and zero zero there we go okay so here we go so I am going to get started now thanks thanks everybody for your patience as I try to like sort this out this has been really difficult to do these tutorials but I feel like it's important to if if WebGL is to be a part of p5 and all this work that went into it over the summer to get some more people trying it and offer and helping with fixing some of these bugs and finding some of these bugs that's only a good thing I hope I think that's my desire my intentions are in the right place I'm sure I screw everything up though most of the time all right okay this is yet another video about 3d 3d or WebGL rendering mode in p5 yes this is where I last left off essentially in the lap in the previous video where I spent most of my time simply looking at 3d geometry so what does it mean to suddenly use translate with a zaxis what does it mean to rotate with an xaxis a yaxis or is the axis and what kinds of 3d primitives are there cone box tourists all of these things so but what I want to explore in this video is material and lights what are these things so material describes the skin of the 3d object how does that skin behave when it receives when it when when light shines on it right in a 2d world there's no such thing as lights we are just setting colors precisely we're saying draw this rectangle with this color but in the 3d renderer we have the option of saying hey draw this shape with this material and then shine this light on it and depending on what material we use depending on what light we use and where we place that light we can create different looks and feels we've relinquished a lot of control to the sort of pixel level determination of what we're drawing but we're now gaining this illusion of shadowing and lights and threedimensional perspective so let's go take a look at that now first of all there is action are actually already a material present in this particular example I would let's to make a list of those things and write them on the board but I'm actually just going to go here actually show you this is a quick cheat sheet that coding trained viewer Simon made so I'm gonna go under material here so you can see these are some different kinds of material that we're going to explore and at some point I want to get into texture and maybe shaders as well so but I'm gonna go back to this getting started tutorial and you can see at one point actually or in a lot of 3d environments there's something called a basic material a basic material is a material that fills the shapes surface with color and just an act which does not respond to light and that's actually what Phil is doing so in this in this particular example this fill function is applying a basic material and if I were to change if I were to add a little bit of red to that we would see we would see suddenly yeah that's a little bit better add some more red not that barely made a change there we go we can see that I'm altering the color of this beautiful spinning Taurus okay so step one now what if we wanted to add some lights to this scene so the first kind of light oh yeah let's let's let's go with this the first kind of light that we could add I don't want doing lights first I should probably just keep talking about materials ah let's get back my materials okay let's add a material now now what are the materials that we can choose to add is something called a normal material hmm you might be asking what isn't normal let's talk about a normal for a second I just feel like alright I ever feel not reading the YouTube chat so you all clean up your act all right um I'm taking a little pause here for a second all right so so let's first experiment with material so I'm actually gonna take out the film and I'm going to add something called a normal material normal norm normal material and let's see what happens look what I have now I have this beautiful rainbow colored Taurus in fact what the normal material does is assigned to every vertex which has an XYZ position and assigns the color the exposition of the vertex relative to the object center define it gives it it's red value its Y position it's green value and it's Z position it's blue value and this is actually really this normal material is just for the purpose of debugging so if you haven't figured out what colors you want things to be what textures you just want to see your 3d shapes and be able to see them as 3d just adding a normal material is useful now the reason I so time now for a second so I was just gonna I was gonna use this as an opportunity to segue into talking about what a normal is which is kind of relevant because the normal is the vector that is perpendicular to the plane and it and that's kind of how determines how the light reflects off of it but is normal material called normal material actually because of this normal vector or is it just called normal material because it's like the sort or the word normal it's normal normal boy I'm doing so much better than last time aren't I normal material it is a representation of the normals right okay so that's that's good all right so I'm gonna keep going and I don't think I talked about this see I just having trouble remembering when I talked about in the previous video but okay talking about the normal material is a nice excuse for us to just remind ourselves that this shape right isn't actually a smooth shape if I turn the stroke back on and turn the fill back on whoops oh it says no stroke there we can see this is actually just a tiled collection of polygons and what the normal is the normal vector for any given polygon like say this triangle here is a vector that points outward from the polygon is perpendicular to the plane and that vector that normal vector is associated with how the light reflects off of that plane so normal material is using the normal vector to assign an RGB value okay and but really really in this case it's just something that you would use for debugging or is kind of like a default material and or if you just like rainbows and you want everything to be rainbow colored hey why not use the normal material so let's go back here okay so now we're back ah okay so now let's start thinking about some actual materials that we might want to use for example an ambient material so I'm gonna call this an ambient material whoops I'm gonna get rid of the fill and I mean I shouldn't have had to fill there the on normal you could only have one material so fill you can think of its basic material so normal material just over wrote that I'm gonna say ambient material and I'm going to say 0 0 255 let's see what's going on now now look at this why is that not blue I said ambience material but it's not blue why an ambient material unlike a basic material or fill which just gives the shape that color no matter what the lights are an ambient material is a material that reflects light so only if there is light of a particular color will it reflect that so for example I could add some ambient light and and I'm gonna put that the order doesn't matter so I mean order order doesn't matter but doesn't matter I'm gonna say ambient light and I'm gonna say I'm gonna give a red light and you might ask the question now uh so if I have an ambient material of blue and a ambient light of red shouldn't I see purple I still only see black and because the material can only reflect the color blue and only shining the color red on it so this is something really have to think about you could try to imagine like a reflective surface that only reflects one kind of color and you have the flashlight of a certain color that's the kind of thing you need to be thinking about so what I might do here is just make the ambient color white the ambient light white and you can see now I've got the blue and I forgot to say no stroke so we can see now this looks just like the fill so an ambient material blue with a blue light it looks exactly the same now here's something interesting though what if I were to there's a couple things one is I could actually just make the material white and then shine a blue light on it exactly the same result that's important to realize that's exactly the same result obviously it's going to be different if there's lots of shapes with different material colors but what I want to point out here which I think is important is let me just change this torus for a second to a sphere a beautiful round 3dimensional sphere whoa way too big 100 that looks to me just like an ellipse if you look closely you can kind of see there's some kind of spinning or rotating here but an ambient light the thing gorillas about ambient light is an ambient light is a light that shines from everywhere in all directions so it's kind of like a magical light it's not coming from a particular source it's not shining in a particular direction and so in this case I don't really see the threedimensional quality of this sphere because there's no shadowing so in this case what I want to look at is what if I use something called a point light so we're gonna look at ambient light point light and a directional light a point light is a light that I could place think of a light bulb that I can place into the scene it shines in all directions from a particular location so what if I wanted to put a point light over here let's do that so I'm gonna say point light and I still give it the color 0 0 to 255 blue but now it's not ambient it needs to give it a location so I'm gonna say 0 negative 200 0 so I want it just to be a point light that's positioned over here at the edge where my finger is right there okay here we go ready well oh I'm sorry I put it at the Y location so it actually worked I put it above I just got the wrong spot so it's important to look at the documentation if we look at Simon's cheat sheet here point light our G be that RGB X Y Z so the x position is this one and I'm gonna make that 200 Oneg is 200 I wanted to put it over there oops and go back to my sketch and there we go we can see it's the left I could actually give it you know I could say Mouse X minus 200 or Mouse Y minus 200 and now you can see I have this point light that I can move around and I could put two point lights in the scene timeout edit oops and say and say add one point like negative 200 comma zero and another point light at zero 200 comma zero and give make that one red and we could see whoops what whatever it doesn't matter the point is I've put exam in different locations but you can see now I have a point light shining for him over here that's red and a point light shining for him over here that's blue so point lights are things you can position move and give them different colors now let's think about material for a second so this is ambient material ambient material is a material that reflects ambient it reflects light there is another kind of material that also reflects light but reflects in a slightly different way if you want a different look and that's called specular material and specular material is a material that's shinier more metallic and kind of you know a billiard ball or water or metal or something you can get a slightly different look so let's just look at that I'm gonna say a specular material and I'm gonna leave the color white meaning the material is white so it's just reflecting whatever light is there and we can see look at this you can kind of see this like shiny quality to this so I might want to do some more experimentation of sphere like the detail of the sphere and where it is and how bright the light is in different lights you can see that the specular material is quite kind of dark word you can you could imagine if maybe this were a much smaller sphere I don't know that didn't really change I think nevermind I'll I'll leave it to you to experiment with different materials and different colored lights and different shapes okay so I'm gonna go back to ambient material and point light now I want to look at the last I think the last thing we've got to look at here is directional light so what is a directional light directional line is an interesting thing it's a light that has a direction but no position meaning it's kind of infinitely far away so if you could imagine I'm in the 3d scene right here and I'm gonna say the Sun is over Earth hair right the Sun is not infinitely far away but it's so Pharr that you can kind of imagine it so I'm pointing in the direction of where the lights coming from so this is different than what you might think of as a spotlight or a flashlight which would be like the combination of a point light and a directional light a light at a certain point that points in a certain direction that as far as I know is not implemented yet in P five WebGL renderer but you can have a point light and or or directional light so let's make a directional light happen and edit point here while I go back to the p5 library so instead of having a blue and what's yellow red and green right let's try to pick the Sun instead of having a blue blue point light I'm gonna change this to directional light and now this vector this vector over here describes describes the direction of the light so if I want to have the light coming from over there like coming from the right I want to say point the vector points one in the X direction so I'm going to say one zero zero and let's go refresh this and you can see there's the yellow light coming from the right this direction okay and if I were to say negative one there it's coming from the other side if I were to say it's coming from the front like whereas if your eyes are the light you can see that my eyes are shining like directly into the scene so you can see how powerful this directional light can be so here's the thing one thing we could do now is we could have a directional light point into the scene based on the mouse so for example I could make a variable that is the mouse X minus the center of the window and mouse Y minus the center of the window now something weird is going to happen here and I should probably put this back to the tourists because I think it's going to be easier to see with the Taurus and so I'm going to say and now I want the directional light to be DX and dy let's see what happens now look at this I'm getting this kind of glitchy effect the reason this is happening is the vector is so ideally if you want the effect that I want at least here the vector that thing that's pointing needs to be of length 1 and he didn't have to worry about that when I said 1 comma 0 0 or 0 1 comma 0 because it was by definition length 1 because I they it's not that it adds up to 1 but it's like the length it's actual length is 1 so in this case the vector is like you know if I could kind of get the mouse really close to the center and you could sort of see how I can get some of that shading back but the light gets stronger so this is something you might be able to use to your advantage but ultimately I want to normalize the length of that vector and there's a nice way that I can do that because what I could do is I could say let V I can make a vector object make a vector which has an X component a Y component and a Z component which I'm leaving it 0 for right now and I could just pass that vector in as the last argument so the directional light has a color and a vector same result here but now I could say V dot normalize and what the normalize function does is shrinks the vector to length 1 and you can see now as I move the mouse around I'm changing the direction that the light is shining and you know maybe I could do something like you know I could do something like divide it by 100 and so you can see I can make the light kind of brighter based on like how far away the mouse is so I just want to be within a pretty reasonable range once I get such a high range it's very very glitchy so the strength of that light it appears also is tied to this to the length of that vector okay so let's take a look here I think we've talked about normal material normal material of so basic material by the way is fill and just so you notice here if I go back this is actually important to say if I go back and say fill 0 0 255 comment out the ambient and I still have the lights and everything you can see that light is not affecting this so an object that doesn't interact with any of the lights in the scene you can use fill it's pretty rare that you would probably want that to happen but just to note if you're wondering like why is nothing responding to my light if you're using Phil so Phil like a basic material ambient material is a material that reflects light specular material is a material that reflects light albeit in a slightly different I near perhaps way and then the three kind of lights are ambient light on just general wash of light from everywhere in every direction point light which is a light where you give a position looks a position and a color so it emanates in all directions but from one position and directional light is a light that's coming from a given direction essentially infinitely far away maybe like Benetton the length of the vector it's closer and closer or brighter and brighter okay so that's I think concludes whoops so that I think oops so that I think concludes everything right normal ambient specular material and then ambient light directional light point light okay so if you have some questions write about them in the comments I'm sure I miss lots of important 3d stuff but I will be in the next video now getting to looking at texture and then at some point I will talk about camera in perspective okay see you there all right how do I do there that was that was better okay is it something like oh yeah I should say that sorry I'm in the wrong camera I yell oh I need to issue correction am I gonna be flooded with comments of that the Sun is white light hold on hold on let's just not to you probably don't want to include this but I am going to you can edit this in if you want I should point out as mentioned in the chat that the Sun isn't actually yellow light I'm just thinking of how my first grader loves to draw the Sun it uses the yellow crayon the Sun of course is white light and I'm is probably even more complex scientifically than that but I'm just using yellow to think about the Sun in some arbitrary way apologies for that please don't flood the comments okay that's better even though the Sun itself is orange all right Simon's making the point that it would be useful to show what happens if you put point light and directional light and an ambient light I'm gonna leave that as an exercise for people to mix them I should probably say that explicitly although I it is important to mention perhaps maybe alright maybe maybe not she wants to edit this stuff in so let's try a couple other things that were pointed out by the chat before I go if I were to add an ambient light here and let me make that ambient light blue let's just see what happens so you can see interestingly enough the ambient light and the directional light are interacting with each other and everything is blue everywhere but the red and green that's coming in through the directional light mix with that blue and end up making white light now of course if this color if this were to be just red the directional light you can see that directional light is now mixing with the MU light and making things so this I really want to leave to you as an exercise mixing point lights directional lights ambient lights all these things you've learned about like oscillating color looping color transition all of that stuff that you do in any kind of 2d you could do with the lights as well so you can make all sorts of beautiful crazy psychedelic colorful threedimensional scenes by mixing lots of different shapes and lots of different lights okay so share with me what you make just with materials and lights see if anybody can make something that demonstrates the difference between specular material and ambient material a bit better than I did in this video I'd love to see that please share it with me and I'll see you in the next video where if I haven't said this already I come back and talk about extra and then in a follow up us about camera perspective okay thanks for watching see you soon okay the Sun is green everybody's freaking me out okay if I have an ambient white light it's going to wash out all the point light that is a good point very good point okay so now we are done with that what time is it almost 4 o'clock so now I want to talk about texture now here we might be in the situation where I haven't tried doing texture stuff in p5 WebGL I'm gonna leave this here and what I'm going to do let's go get the kittens I think that kittens are what we've got here right so somewhere desktop past Chrome extensions kittens kittens wait I think I did an example more recently where the kittens were oh yeah here object images kittens alright let's go grab the kittens and let's go to here just out of curiosity before I do this video let me do a little couple tests let's do some tests here John I'm gonna before I do the tutorial like when I actually try to test them stuff let me run a preload up I got a switch my got a switch my yes thank you for reminding me about the battery that was Gregory kxk kitten kitten equals load image kitten zero dot JPEG okay let me go back to here and it's in the directory so this I'm not I'm gonna kind of just test some stuff out without explaining it too much and then I will come back boy I'm terrible at this okay so they're kitten loaded just out of curiosity does the image function on its own work in P in WebGL it does not so the image function does not work the texture function should okay and how do i what do i how do i make a plane a plane let's look at Simon's cheat sheet with height okay oh wait cuz it's just the width height okay 200 200 oh yeah Superman 3 there we go there's the kitten there oh the light is all weird there we go okay so that's how you would just draw an image as a texture to a plane so that I might start with I'm also curious does begin shape can I do custom shapes and shape vertex negative 100 zero what I want to do clockwise counterclockwise I have no idea now let's try this let's first get rid of the kitten okay so that made a custom shape and I could say fill or give it a texture I'm just curious of all these things work that didn't work do I need to put that after begin shape let me make sure I'm in the yeah I'm in the new version okay so this might be something that needs to get worked on in terms of let's try a normal material so I couldn't get a normal material for a custom shape and that's weird what about ambient material nope so this is interesting this is something that has to be looked at the material for drawing custom shape burger I read the chat very rarely models is interesting know I have texture commented out on purpose I'm pretty sure texture is gonna work no do I need light hmm so I think I'm gonna stay away from doing custom shapes because that doesn't seem to be working in the way that I expect I'll have to come back to that another time I'll have to investigate that if what I'm doing this incorrectly if there's a bug but I am pretty sure if I do this all right so and let's put the stuff back in and let's take out this light stuff comment that out and try this alright so that works as expected does it automatically know how to texture oh wait a second I forgot the UV coordinates that must be why oh okay hold on let's go back for a second okay so I forgot the UV let's let me look at the reference texture or vertex hmm doesn't have it documented as having UV coordinates let's look at texture you know the examples are just showing using and it's cool that you can use a video I will show that as well the examples are just showing oh yeah sorry thank you for noticing my chroma key issue the V let's see here let me just look at the examples I know how to do this interesting its energy because I know how to do all this stuff in processing and I'm kind of learning now what works what doesn't where the WebGL examples for texture textures well look at these let's look at these for a second so yeah this is just showing with prebaked shapes which is fine so I don't know let me just try this one more time my feeling this hasn't been implemented yet the wait where am I now okay so what I realized I was missing was with typically with a what's this 196 with a when you do texturing and you say I have this image and then I have this shape I need to in addition it doesn't just happen automatically it knows how to do it automatically for certain kinds of shapes but I have to say for this vertex for this particular vertex on the image on the shape I want to assign this pixel from the image so in that case I would have to say I mean to give it like that goes with pixel zero zero this goes with pixel like 100 comma zero this goes with pixel 100 comma 96 and this goes with pixel 0 comma 96 now I have a feeling this has not been implemented this is how it work in processing yeah so that didn't do anything sometimes those UV coordinates are normalized so I would say this sometimes it only oh look at that though what is it I'm seeing something there right that's coming from the image do I need to give it like a material weird no did I get these UV coordinates wrong Phil so I think it's just not models is the way to do custom shapes in 3d but how do I create a model I don't believe models away could load one in load path to draw a model yeah so I don't know okay so I could get into that yes so I'll I will I'm just going to I'm just going to you know no stroke oh could the plane be no I can't possibly be true right okay rather than continue to hopefully not waste but continue to take up all this time I'm going to talk about textures and loading images just for the primitive shapes and I'll mention that I something about coming back and doing custom geometry another time yes so Simon is pointing out that you can load a custom shape with an obj file but what I want to do is generate the geometry algorithmically which is something that I that I know I can do in processing using begin shape and shape and 3d vertices and I will investigate the clothes I don't know maybe the clothes it's just the vertices doesn't fill the inside you're creating an opaque object on the image hmm I'm trying to do texture mapping but I'm gonna you can all go and watch my video with the flagwaving thing and process thing to see how that worked there I don't and and I'll investigate this another time okay so now what I want to do is just get back to what I was before oops just put it back to something okay all right nope ambient material check out this fill take out this plane well the ambient light is oh yeah this is what I wanted to do okay this is kind of where I left off okay please go fix the word camera Oh on the what here is it really that awful usually I'm the one it's crazy and bothered by stuff like this yeah that make you happier alright alright um here we go hello I'm back in this video I'm going to attempt to explain something and also implement something and that something is textures good timing timeout for a second I'm just gonna start over so much it doesn't have to edit anything hello in this video about WebGL in p5 I'm going to attempt to explain something and implement something and that is adding a texture to some geometry so I'm kind of checking off this list and by the way a couple things that I've now realized I've missed is I've only shown you in terms of geometry primitives and there are some other ways right in theory I think this might be at the time of recording of this video a little bit buggy because I've been doing some experiment with it there's no reason why I couldn't use begin shape and end shape to create custom geometry right to create my own algorithmic 3d shape in WebGL so that's certainly something that should be on the horizon for people and in addition to that I could also use a function called load model so if anyone wants to make like a nice model of a train or something send it to me maybe I'll make a video that loads and I think typically there's probably a bunch of different file formats of 3d models but certainly one that I believe works with p5 as an obj so if you're making a 3d model and some other 3d authoring software and export it as an obj file you could import so but what I want to focus on here is texturing and what texturing is is instead of simply having a material this sort of that is just a color or an or a certain kind of reflective continuous surface that you can actually take an image something that you loaded it could be a live video recorded video or a static image and wrap that image around the particulars shape whether it's a sphere a torus a box of playing etc so I want to look at that texturing an image so let's go look at how we do that and to simplify things let me actually first start off by just making a plane so I'm actually gonna make a plane a plane is a geometry that's just a flat plane and I could give it a width and a height so I'm gonna just say 200 200 to make a square plane so you can see here's mine this is very similar just drawing rectangle but the fact that I'm using plane one of the 3d geometry primitives means I could actually texture this right now and you can see it's responding to the light the light is still on the scene so I'm gonna leave the light in the scene for right now I might take that off so now I also happen to have a directory of images I don't know anybody have a favorite kit and they want to see right now I think let's just go with kitten zero cute kitten zero okay kid zero is going to be our texture so what I'm going to add now avert your eyes so what I'm going to add now is I'm gonna add preload preload is a function in p5 that allows you to load data assets media assets other things that are ready before set up and draw happen so I'm gonna make a variable called kitten and then in preload I'm gonna say kitten equals load image and I had a directory called kittens and I had a file called kitten dot zero dot jpg kitten zero dot jpg and now what I'm going to do here is I'm gonna comment out the material and I'm just going to say texture kitten and the magic will happen we're gonna see our kitten Oh interesting so the kitten is like so in just look at the image itself is responding to the light so one thing I want to do right now just to simplify things because I don't want to worry too much about light is I'm just gonna create ambient white light and take out this directional light that I worked on in the previous video just to simplify things and so now we can see there's our kitten oh it's spinning off as like in the end of Superman 3 which is a movie that I seem to reference way too often in my videos General Zod the kitten okay um so what else can we do let's just try some other shapes why not let's try box now we have Owen let's make the Box a little smaller now we have that kitten image on all sides of the box let's try sphere now we have to say now here we're seeing something that's now having so P 5 and the WebGL render is making a decision it's like well here's an image here's some geometry this is my best guess as to how you intended to wrap that image around the geometry and in this case if I wanted to you make this appear like a planetary surface for example I would I would get actually spherical polarized image of like a texture map or something so there's a lot of work in terms of how you might want to design images that work well in certain contexts but we can see that that just works let's just see all that I'm just here for all the shapes tourists so you can see there's the kitten wrapped around the Taurus and we get stop this now so I'm gonna go back to box oh and you can see here even with different dimensions it's it's doing different things to the Kin so I'm gonna go back to box 100 and there we go so now I want to look at some other what's interesting about this is there's no reason why we can't use a video source so if if you look under a create video or create capture let's try to use create capture so I'm gonna say and setup I'm gonna say let cam for camera cam equals create capture I'm gonna say 200 200 oh wait no sorry I don't give it a size video I think that's how I do it create capture video let's just see what happens here so where is my oops track start error hold on try to say cam not start or something I don't think so no I probably just wrote the wrong piece of code pick a random kitten yeah begin shape and clothes shape ah oh yeah Austin I'm gonna be doing I trimmed the next section definitely the next session thank you for this I'm seeing in the chat Bram VG mert has sent me an example that uses custom shapes I'm going to take drink some water I really do need to drink water why is it am I like parched in a weird way that I'm like are you just like being kind and thinking of me wait hold on why did I why's my create capture off I need to go to the Dom library oh I do need to give it no so why what's wrong with this hold on a sec everybody Oh No why am I getting this error hmm don't tell me capture is somehow like not compatible with WebGL or whatever and she I just need n shape clothes interesting okay why am I getting a user media error it's really weird Oh debug debug debug debug debug debug debug Deepak Deepak Deepak Deepak Deepak Deepak Deepak debug so I should see like restart my browser or something tonight am I using the like an old version of the Dom library so weird yeah but I just there's no reason why it wouldn't work with I if I take out WebGL all right hold on a sec let's let's let's not go to nuts here and let me go to let's try so this is okay this makes me feel a little better I think something is going on on this computer so hold on a sec let me quit Chrome huh I guess I don't think I need to give a sighs and should do a default sighs all right I'll try that I've done this without sighs no I'm getting a all right like for example if I just go to any yeah see something here a quick time oh yeah look at this what's happening on my computer FaceTime builtin I disable it that's something else using that alright dare I restart this computer all right oh hi restart the computer it won't be able to hear the sounds anymore oh wait please oh please hold whew did you hear that I'm restarting the computer sound just came back for a second alright here we go oops let's see there we go Here I am I'm like Beyonce with my background and no music let me get back to things there we go all right we're back in business so that was just a temporary glitch all right got all my tabs open and alright okay so by the way it seemed to have some new viewers today saying it so if anybody is like a sound music person and can help I'm a little bit like obsessed with all my weird sound effects but they've all gotten stale and I I need some I don't want help me with that please I would love that I just don't have the time I mean I should make the time I have the time it's just not a priority I mean maybe it should be a priority I don't know all right so I think where I last left off was I'm gonna just go from here okay so let me take this out for a second not you this should be go for wherever I added this and it didn't work to it working okay so we should see oh there I am so this is the capture element it's a separate Dom element that's taking the live webcam feed you can now see my secret green screen here okay back I forgot that I was making a video tutorial it went off in my own world all right so a couple things one is let me just make that a little smaller just so we can kind of see it there but not have it overall in the screen and then now what I want to do is can I make this video a texture on the box so I don't see any reason why I couldn't just change this from kitten to cam there I am oh oh I could do my Superman 3 thin now you please just humor me just humor me turn off this video good something else I'm gonna do this my own personal enjoyment wait all right never mind okay moving on so you get the idea I can take and by the way if I if I wanted this to appear less I don't know what I want this to appear like but I can use ab cam dot hide in which case I could actually only see the video texture on the box so this is a way you can take any image like a live video and texture and I could change that to a sphere or a torus I do want to again at some point begin ups I do want to at some point look at how I can start to assign image textures to custom drawn shapes with begin shape and end shape so I need to approach that in a separate video and just look at loading models and custom shapes so if somebody remind me if that video doesn't exist to display this to do that otherwise you're gonna see it at some point in a few videos from now so I'm gonna quickly check to see if there are any questions or points that I forgot from the live chat that's going on now otherwise this video will end all right can you use so does is there anything that I should demonstrate here with texture should I add the light in what do you mean by a simulated light begin shape triangle for custom shapes okay this is the one time where I didn't actually miss anything I said like I didn't end the video prematurely I'm looking at the chat how's the light effect the texture okay okay can you have a shadow well oh yeah yeah oh wait I could put a plane oh yeah okay let's try that all right I'm back at the end of this video I'm not sure exactly why but two questions came up in the chat one is how do lights affect texture and two how what about shadowing so just out of curiosity let me try putting a plane at the bottom so what I'm going to do just to show you a little more sort of 3d stuff I'm gonna say with this spinning cube I'm gonna put a push before and a pop after so that the rotate does not affect anything that comes after and then I'm gonna add this plane so we should see here oops there I am the puck but I want that plane now to look as if it's a floor maybe so what I want to do is translate maybe all the way down to the bottom and then rotate if I want to take this plate and rotate it like this to be flat I want to say this is the xaxis so I want to rotate X and rotate it basically 90 degrees which is 1/2 pi let's try that so you can see there it is and I don't want what I want to do also is maybe only translate it a hundred down make the plane like really really big and maybe I want to give that a a bein Tyrael so it doesn't have a texture of white is that gonna override the texture whoa bugginess ok great so we can see now that there's like this floor making it white made it a little confusing but let's let's make the background let's make it it's fine so what I want to do is let me try to add some light there's an ambient white light right now let's take out that ambient light and you can see the floor it's not buggy it just takes a little while for the video to start the floor is now black but it does have an ambient material of white so let's try adding this directional light so I this is a directional light that I did in the previous video which just shines a light from far away at a given direction based on the mouse and I'm gonna make let's make that light white just too and I'm gonna just give it AI I might be able to give it just 255 but I'm gonna give it all three let's give that a look so you can see now look that light is shining and is only able to see the sides of the the cube where the light is and you can see there's a Larry shadowing going on based on the light now the thing is the shadowing I probably have to be more thoughtful about the position these objects in order to get the shadowing to work in a way where I might actually see but I'm gonna let that be an experiment for those of you could I could you use try using maybe a point light like for example let me just actually do that let me add a point light and let me put that point light a little bit above yeah now you can see a little bit more like you can see that there is maybe some shadowing but maybe if I were to I really should stop what I'm doing like translate the Box a little bit back maybe like a little bit down like a little bit down and a little bit back mmm I put it in a weird place so I'm again I believe there's an exit hold on let's go back let me not try that cuz I don't know what I'm doing here so I'm gonna leave it to you as an exercise to try seeing what you could do with point lights and ambient lights and different shapes to see if you can get shadowing but you can see sort of the stuff that you've got to play with here and in terms of having a light that's shining into the scene with different shapes with different materials and different textures okay thanks for watching all right shading not shadowing thank you that's probably a good point oh and I forgot to add shaders to this list alright we're gonna do camera next let me switch this to a point light and just put it at the top and make the background I'm just going to change this a little bit to make the background zero okay and it's a point light and what if I oh and I translate it in the wrong place I think what if I translate this back a little bit there we go alright so now what I want to do is I'm going to take that out okay yes you can modify the texture with a shader but I'm not going to get to that so the next thing I need to look at is camera so what are the functions I you didn't see me change something here the next thing I need to look at is this and then these are some things on my list also as well as I'm gonna add shaders to this list getting to the end getting to the end of today here so and we'll see if we can fix the we can see we can investigate that on point light bug in and see where that changed all right so here's the thing camera stuff works so let me look camera camera and view there are three camera functions camera is perspective with a sixty degree field of view so that's like this oh I'm in the wrong camera speaking of camera sorry everybody I really have a lot of trouble remembering so there's perspective to override the default camera simply called perspective or ortho in perspective objects closer to the viewer in the Z plane appear larger than those farther away right in orthographic view objects are the same dimensions appear to be the same size even even when they are farther away that would have been a nice way to describe that once we did that other coding challenge sorry about that and for more information check out the excellent p.3d tutorial here what's funny is I'm acting like I don't know this stuff but apparently I wrote this p32 towards my camera perspective okay see see yes yes yes yes yes ah so we're gonna look at this I'm gonna look at perspective and ortho that's gonna be helpful camera i position scene Center upwards access see I know how this works in p f in processing is it exactly the same let's look at Simon's cheat sheet here X Y Z Center X yep so that's the same perspective fieldofview aspect nearfar ortho left right bottom top near far okay so what's a good way to demonstrate this so I think one thing I should do by the way is maybe I should go back to the kitten I don't know if it's going to be simpler and then I should just probably say ambient light so is it going to be simpler to see these differences with with out a texture on the image probably right so what if I just change this to as much as I love the kitten normal material so this is probably a better way to look at it okay and then let's look at some things like for example let me just play with some ideas so let's see what happens if I first say camera so if I were to say camera Mouse x00 what are the defaults again let me look at my tutorial so I'm pretty sure this is the default camera the light after it ooh DX is not defined why oh I don't need this anymore whoa okay wait default camera Z it would be different 0 0 0 0 right Oh weird maybe these are supposed to be 0 0 or not cuz of the there we go that's the default camera right the default camera comment this out exactly the same right XYZ okay so X what so what is it again it is X Y Z sent so X Y Z is where the camera is Center X centralized embassy is where the camera is looking and then up is like the direction of up cuz you need all this if you think about it if this is the camera you need to know where is it where is it looking and which way is up is the camera on its side so for example if I were to put Mouse X here and go back this is me moving the camera it's still looking at this thing what's weird is it's not panning because it's still looking at the same center point right you can see how that it's kind of moving to the edge but it's still looking at the same center point so if I wanted it to also look at a new center point that's me panning okay so this makes sense I could also zoom the camera in whoops by saying like Mouse X I'm just trying a few things before I'd make a tutorial about this what did I do wrong uhoh zero zero oh right this sorry that's there so this is the default location people are sending me things okay that's the default game so I could replace this like was just like Mouse X whoa it probably can't be zero plus ten no why couldn't it be yeah that's weird that's a bug Oh can't it can't be in the place where it's looking so price should give you an error okay so probably probably we make edits to the list oh no hopefully I didn't lose my shoot because like just like force quit the computer or WebGL shoots no there it is so error if camera XYZ and center XYZ are the same okay so that's camera so that I can make work is this documented in a better place perhaps here okay ortho I know to get perspective field of view okay so let's let me go back to this tutorial camera do I do feel the view in here yeah so let me just look at this for a second so this now is field of view oh boy let me just back to field of view with divided by height cameras the camera see time let's let me just look at this for a second okay that's the default field of view now if I were to change this angle to like map mouse X between 0 and width to between you know zero and PI divided by 2 that's just changing that that's it's like zooming because I'm narrowing the field of view if I didn't change the camera Z based on that though if I just made what's the near and far is perspective near and far aspect near far if I change that near and far if I make those fixed near and far then what I would see right I'm gonna get some weird stuff going on alright so that's I think I'm gonna probably not I think I'm going to mostly work with the camera and skip the perspective stuff but I do want to look at ortho so there we go so this is harder to see just in this particular example interesting that in ortho do you know do you all know why I can't see that plane because in ortho that plane is flat I don't see it from above it's perfectly flat so the fact that I rotated it you know if I rotate it by quarter PI then I'll see it there so ortho is going to become much more apparent when I draw a bunch of these at different distances but so I'll try to maybe do that as well okay all right I think I'm ready all right I mean just 440 I've got about 20 more minutes or so I wish there was something more this okay so we're gonna do camera stuff now okay alright I'm back again I'm kind of going through my list of topics about 3d and WebGL with p5.js and I'm now on to camera so in this in this video I'm gonna talk about camera now there are three functions that are important to look at camera perspective and ortho I recently did a coding challenge which I will link to from this video where I made heavy use of ortho perspective but I just got a terrible job of explaining it so I'm gonna try to come back to that in this particular video but let's start just with the camera function so the thing about a camera actually so let me do some so hold on a second I think a diagram would be helpful here as difficult as it is for me to draw anything that is remotely close to three dimensions and on a twodimensional whiteboard but let's just pretend for example that this is the scene that I'm looking at right and that's the cube and what I want to do is there's this idea this idea this is a madeup concept of a camera there's a camera over there I should turn it towards I'm out of the picture there's this madeup idea of a camera which I'm going to draw like this what might not be immediately obvious to you is there are a whole bunch of properties associated with this camera for example this camera is at a particular location it's at a particular X Y Z location it's also pointing in a particular XYZ direction so a camera you can think of this marker as the camera it's pointing directly at you and it might be closer to you or further away it might be up here but pointing it you know at the ceiling so the I need to define I have a camera I need to define where everything is in the scene then where the cameras are where it's pointing but that's not even all I also need to define a vector that points up because now if you think about it right if this is the camera and you were to this is a terrible idea for me to pick up this camera rotate the camera right oh this everything's going to go to help me hand back oh my goodness it unplugged that wasn't totally a bad idea okay time out I caused many tech guys back back ok ah the cameras all messed up this is such a bad idea what are good close enough for now Oh oh my goodness it's totally in the wrong place timeout technical malfunction that about right eternity a little more okay I'm the worst by the way do you know that I have a chair here someday I'm gonna use this chair so uh I was thinking okay all right apologies for the technical camera this half there but you can imagine right if the camera is turning is it looking on its side is it looking straight up so that vector pointing up tells us how we're supposed to turn so we need all three of those properties we actually need and this is also an XYZ value so the camera actually needs to set a camera we need one two three four five six seven eight nine arguments so let's go back and do that now here's a scene that I've set up it's mostly the same as the previous video but I'm just using a normal material as opposed to the video texture now here's the thing watch as I magically add a camera to this scene without the camera function your this is gonna blow your mind at the very beginning right up here I'm just gonna say translate 00 Mouse X whoa look at that camera zooming in and out of the scene so it's really important to realize that this camera is an artificial concept created by us to create the illusion of a sort of pair of eyes or a single eye really in the scene I guess it's a pair because you're seeing depth anyway to look into the scene but if this is my threedimensional object and this is my camera what's the difference between moving the camera towards it or moving the object or the whole scene towards the camera those are the same things so you can make do a lot of camerawork and moving things around and changing the view by just manipulating the rotation orientation and position of everything in the world but sometimes the camera function can actually be quite useful to do certain things that wouldn't be as easy to do without it so let's take a look at how that works deep breath okay so now I'm gonna go back I'm gonna take out this translate and I'm gonna add the camera function now where is the camera let's put the camera at zero zero zero now where should the camera look let's have the camera look at zero zero zero oh and which way is up let's have the camera point up zero one one points upwards one point down I don't know 100 zero so this is just about right the default camera except for the fact that what this is again if this is my object might Sene I just put the camera right here in the same place I actually want the camera to be a little bit out the camera is by default out and I think there's like a specific value for this and I always forget what it is so I'm gonna pull it from a processing tutorial that I will link to whoops so I'm gonna come over here hold on sorry so I'm gonna link I'm gonna pull from a processing tutorial that has a lot of information about 3d I'm gonna just grab this value so this is the default Z location of the camera 0 0 and then I put it here so it's the height divided by 2 divided by tangent of pi divided by 6 it's probably a better way to write that some sort of magic number and I'm gonna now I'm gonna go back to the sketch we should see this is exactly as it was right so I'm using the camera function if I comment out the camera function there it is it's the same scene but now I can start to move the camera around for example what if I actually put the camera on its side like pointing to the right right now I'm looking at the scene I just turned the camera over we could actually animate that and have it bounce around as if it's like a shake and get a shaky camera that's kind of like a fun thing to try to do again this is no different than rotating the whole scene but I'm using the camera object to do it let's put that back to pointing up what if I were to move the camera along the xaxis so I'm going to say x equals map Mouse X which goes between 0 and width to between like negative 200 and 0 so I'm gonna kind of like move the camera to the left as I move the mouse I don't this is sort of silly whoops I have a syntax error 0 with negative 2 oh I owe this should have X here now so that's probably say camera X just to be kind of consistent so now we can see the look it looks like it's spinning which is kind of weird but you have to remember they do where the camera is looking is still at the center so what I'm actually doing is this right I'm doing this right it's always looking at the cube it's just moving to the side of that plane you can kind of see you can kind of imagine that again if I were more thoughtful about this I could probably create a better visual demonstration but what I could also do at the same time is move where it's looking remember this is the sort of look at locations called Center X centralized centers needs to look at location so I have where the camera is where I'm looking and then the orientation of the camera so now if I did that this gives me a panic for some reason I did this in inverse I didn't mean to do that so let me let me just I think what I meant to do is this yeah so I don't have it backwards which is not a big deal but you can see now I'm panning back and forth and you know I could do something like change the I could have it rotate as I'm panning you could imagine there's a lot of possibilities so that's what the camera function does I this merits probably some kind of coding challenge where I attach the camera to some like moving things throughout a scene oh we can make a shaky let's just make a shaky camera because that's kind of could be fun so how would I make a shaky camera let's have the camera camera X equal random negative five five let's see what this looks like and camera camera Y also equal a random amount we use Perlin noise to have it be and then I'm gonna give Ono the Z I'm gonna make that just like an offset so I'm gonna put this in and let's have it continue to look at the center so it's like a so you can see is the scene shaking is the camera shaking I don't know but you can see now I could probably I probably could have like do something weird like mix these values up so I could have it like look in the slightly like also in a random direction that's slightly off so I don't know I can see here earthquake earthquake so I've used the camera now to make kind of a little bit of an earthquake simulation okay so that's camera did a couple more things with that let's comment that out so one thing I want to just I mention is perspective I don't want to do I have to timeout Thank You Alka negative one on why should be the sky usually yeah I don't know I'm just we'll get the chat all right what's gonna be a good demonstration for perspective let me look at my my processing tutorial did I why do I have perspective first in this tutorial field of view aspect ratio near and far so the parameters define a viewing volume with the shape of a truncated pyramid objects near the front appear their actual size well farther objects appear smaller field of view and eclipta bleah alright alright I think I've got it oops alright next I want to talk about perspective now what / this perspective is separate from the camera perspective as a function that defines how we how that three illusion of threedimensional perspective is created and it involves a couple things it involves a field of view which is really a pyramid but I'm gonna draw it kind of like a cone or a twodimensional come right so that field of view could be wider or it could be smaller and then it also defines the clipping plane so in other words maybe actually anything that comes in front of this near point I don't even see or anything that's passed this far point I don't even see so there are defaults I also need an aspect ratio I think which generally would be tied to just the aspect ratio of your canvas but that there could be some nuance there I'm sure so I have to admit that I don't know that I'm not really a 3d I'm not really a 3d person so you know I have done some examples of things I don't think that I've ever used the perspective maybe I've used it to kind of expand the clipping plane then you're in far points or to shrink it but generally I'm always working with the default field of view let's try to just at least add it though to see what we get so so if I were to add the perspective function let's get it working with the default perspective so the default perspective and I'm gonna go back to my processing tutorial to get these default numbers and I'm gonna just copy that in here and I'm gonna change that the processing p.3d render is a java programming environments I need to just quickly change this to be compatible to so basically the the default field of view is a 60 degree angle or PI divided by 3 the Z camera Z location right this is actually something that I already added up here right so the same is this right so that is probably um so that's kind of the default camera Z location and so that's how I'm defining odd that's how I'm defining the clipping plane it's the camera divided by 10 the times 10 so that's so but you know I could make these arbitrary numbers but let's just at least look and then aspect ratio is with divided by height so let's look at let's look at how this looks so we can see that's the default perspective let me just for the sake of argument make the near point is the near near point like minus 500 and the far point 500 so we can see I haven't clipped anything let me make that minus 50 and 50 so I don't know if you could see did that clip anything 10 it's got a clip something at some point hmm am i doing this wrong why is that not working for me right if I make near and far 0 is that just a bug No all right I'm gonna Mattia we're not gonna change those values because they don't seem to be doing anything right now did I oh thank you let's go back thank you for noticing that let me just see if it actually works 10 would be 10 units in front so is it 10 negative 10 still do anything that will I don't know what I'm doing now I clipped everything out huh 10 to 30 gives 120 buffer distance relative to a head Anthony writes coding without a battle plan is asking for trouble truer words of different than spoken I'm definitely asking for trouble here all right maybe I don't want to talk about put it back to what it was I think about what it was so it's camera Z divided by 10 so that camera Z location if it's like me console.log that what kind of number is that about so it's like 260 so this is basically 26 to 2600 so this is small and this is big if I were to make this 500 what if I make this mouse X oh yeah we can see a clip it away that'll be a good that'll be a really quick demonstration okay let's let's do that okay so now we have the the default perspective so the first thing we could experiment with here is like so these that that clipping plane is defined by where the camera is because you want to see something based on the camera but for example what if I just take the far end of the clipping plane and assign that to Mouse X I can now see right eye kind of as I move the mouse it kind of clips it's sort of like taking away what I can read this is generally something that I don't play with because I just want to like see the whole scene but sometimes in certain situations you might need to deal with it so another thing that we could play with is the field of view so what if that angle were a lot bit what if right now I'm looking at 60 degrees pi divided by 3 what if I had 180 degree field of view let's just change that whoa I don't actually see anything did I put everything back so what what if instead of having a 60 degree field of view I had like a 30 degree field of view so it was shrunk or even like a 10 degree field view so this would be PI divided by 6 would be a 30 degree field of view and you can see it's the field of view has shrunk so it actually looks kind of like I'm zoomed in on it I'm also the the clipping plane was changed so because the clipping plane is being defined based on the camera which would be fine in the field of view so this is this is a little bit kind of nuts here but let's let's um let's try to let's try to do something by just saying I'm gonna have the clipping plane between between between 0 and 2000 I'm going to put the field of view back to 60 degrees and I'm not gonna actually move where the camera is I'm just gonna leave the camera at as if there was a field of view of PI divided by 60 degrees so that camera and actually so sorry oops what I want to do make back up for a second here what I want to do to demonstrate this I think this is gonna work is that I want that camera Z location to be fixed so I'm gonna store that and so I'm going to just put in PI divided by 3 here now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna have the field of view be a variable that changes with Mouse X between 0 and PI so now what I should see is look how that perspective changes like this is a 180 degree field of view and MIT right here is about 60 degrees and now it's sort of like my field of view is narrowing now the camera is actually not moving here but based on the field of view we're seeing kind of a different volume and it appears closer so this is kind of a complex topic and I think I'm kind of over over emphasize it because really what I want to talk about which i think is much more important or interesting to play around with is orthographic perspective or orthographic projection in other words with perspective with traditional perspective objects that are farther away appear smaller than objects that are closer that's how we create this three dimensional perspective with orthographic perspective objects that are farther away are the same size there are objects that are closed they might be different sizes but if they are actually the same dimensions they will appear to be the same size and this creates kind of a flattened 3d look and this is a classic 3d look that you'll see in lots of game certain game designs most famously probably Qbert so and this is called Isum met isometric view is a particular camera angle whoops shoot this is a classic perspective projection that you'll see in a lot of games like Qbert so here's an image of Qbert you can see how this has a kind of like flattened 3d flattened 3d perspective so and this is a this is also referred to as isometric projection so let's see if we can create and this is what a coding challenge I'll let you from this video where I do this and create a scene that has this kind of perspective projection so let me change now I'm gonna take this out and I'm just gonna write ortho in here and you're going to see oops as I go here I'm gonna refresh this is now orthographic projection and what you see it looks like it's skewed but actually as the cube rotates and it gets further away or closer it doesn't change its size so this will be a lot more obvious if I put a whole bunch of these cubes so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take out the let me keep the rotate in there and I'm going to make a little loop I'm gonna say four let X equal negative 200 X is less than 200 X plus equal 50 and what I'm going to do and I'm going to put push and pop inside the loop and actually I also want to put rotate for each one of these and what I want to do is I want to translate by X X 0 0 so what I'm trying to do let me take out all the rotate and I'm gonna make these boxes 50 what I'm trying to do is just put a row of boxes so there's a row of boxes we can't see that do I have it actually I have ortho on let me take ortho off you can see there's my row of boxes now let's let's actually see this perspective a little bit let's make the boxes a little bit smaller let me give them actually like an ambient material and let me actually have a light a directional light that's shining from that's white that's shining from like the corner so like 1 comma 1 comma 1 so you can kind of see and actually let that light is way too bright really I'm really doing a terrible job of this 3 4 5 triangle right yeah but this is a 3 dimension let's just have the light come from the side oh boy wait time out please let me go back to where else oh yeah and let me add a sorry med and let me add a point light just that's white that is above that's like at 0 255 0 negative 200 and then from a little out front 200 so let me so we can see here now and it's I would like this love to this light you can see and let me make the background just a different a slightly different gray so we can see what again you can see there we go so you can see this perspective you can see how I've got this idea of sort of vanishing points at my eye looking at the center of this field of view let's change this to ortho let's put the rotates in and you can see we can see this perspective even more now let's change this to order and actually let me also translate along the z axis because this is going to be kind of key so I want to translate along the z axis so where do I do those translate I'm also going to translate that same x value minus 200 along the z axis and I'm going to make the boxes a little bit bigger whoops oh X there's no Z I'm just gonna use it I'm just reuse the x value so now you can see and let me actually say x times 10 whoops minus 200 oh X minus 200 anyway I'll keep them not so big okay there we go this is what I was trying to get for so you can see this perspective as they get smaller as they go back all right we're getting somewhere now bear with me let's turn on orthographic projection fourth though now you can see first of all ah I have run afoul of the clipping plane so I need to define the near and far point random might have been good and so let me actually give this the ortho function if I look at this WebGL cheat sheet that Simon put together left right bottom top near far so let me say left right bottom top and then near which would be 0 and far negative a thousand is that right whoops and what's going on over here I did something ridiculous with my this might be another one that I have to redo hold on try that again let's just first see if that works what do I need to be how come I don't know there we go why near far far I'm so confused that's so weird I'm just gonna and if I say this Oh near to the camera far from the camera no hmm interesting all right hold on go back to here thank you for the info about when I did the clicking wise alright so I run afoul of the clipping plane so if I go back to and look at Simon's books cheat sheet here which I seem to have lost I know here it is I can see here left right bottom top near far so I can need to define the volume the box were everything I see lives and so I can say right now I want to go left negative 200 200 top negative 200 bottom 200 or is the other way around I think it's the other way around top I don't know listen I never just gonna give myself a really big space negative the house in a thousand just to not worry about it too much and I'm gonna go back to the sketch and we can see there we go so you can see even though those are going backwards they're all exactly the same size so again have I really made the something have I really does my design that I'm doing really merit orthographic projection again taking this out we can see this is what the actual scene looks like and for what I just did I wanted to look this way to be able to see that difference but there are some cases and certain kinds of flattened views of the world that are still have the 3d drawing would appear more flat that you want to use that orthographic projection for okay so what am I missing I have now have done some tutorials about we looked at 3d geometry primitive shapes we looked at material being sort of the skin of that geometry lights being light into the scene texture being a way of taking image data and wrapping it onto that geometry so we've done all these things and now in this video mostly looked at the camera which is a way of moving our view of the scene around changing our field of view or even changing the perspective whether it's actual 3d perspective or orthographic projection the things that I'm missing are how to do some custom shapes in 3d maybe with textures as well how to load a model from another and by and also I should add to this list something called a shader so this is something certainly that can be done in a 3d rendering environment a shader can be applied to geometry in a variety of different ways and so at some point I would like to come back and do that I will make a quick plug for the the book of shaders the into the book of shaders calm I'll link to it in this video's description shaders it's a great resource for learning about them okay thanks for watching this video about camera in perspective alright so I don't know I'm gonna this with these through this 3d stuff this is stuff that I'm like learning new as I'm making these tutorials so I feel like I did get through I feel like today's session successfully talked about you know success it's relative on the grand scheme of things I was more successful farther away from total success but more successful with material texture and sorry material lights and texture and I was less successful with this camera and perspective stuff I think you're clipping plane should be zero 0.1 or 0.01 instead of negative 1000 breaking news and being told that this negative 1000 thing was like probably a problematic idea but what if I put things I don't know so we're gonna see if that's salvageable the edited versions of these tutorials will get published in the next week I think a new playlist needs to be made which is just like a WebGL p5 WebGL playlist and I'll hopefully do more stuff so Oh how to write text ah oh oh this is so so good I forgot about something really important something you could do with texture and create graphics oh I should do a whole mmm I gotta save this so I need to do a whole tutorial what time is it 510 I need to do a whole thing on create graph leave this here and come back to it tomorrow so what do I need to do thank you for so to texture and create graphics so first I just want to do with tutorial about create graphics in general okay that's gonna come tomorrow I think this we determined was just a bug sorry this we determined was just a bug in the old version but it's correct in the new version these are two github issues that i need to file so tomorrow i might redo the camera and orthographic projection tutorial like do that again maybe I want to do these two things I guess I could do the custom shapes I feel like it's probably pretty buggy though oh that's a very thick the clipping is relative to the camera oh that's the way to think about zero far near far make sense now to be thank you alka and austin all relative to the camera huh that is excellent hey where's Mike breaking news on track let me quickly correct one thing about ortho the the clipping plane near and far oh I can't believe I didn't realize this is relative to the camera so if I say the clipping plane is between zero that's here and between a thousand that's kind of a thousand units away this sort of like vague threedimensional units away from the camera so me saying like a negative thousand two thousand is kind of pointless because now the kick that's sort of mine but what if you like rotate the camera something maybe it wouldn't matter but I don't know it but so let me actually just put this back at zero and you know I could say 0.01 maybe is most accurate but just to see that that is yeah so that's what I needed to do I just need a further further far value could start at zero thanks for that that's my electroshock therapy alright alright so I feel that it is important here now let's see if we can look and see where where this point like thing broke so I'm gonna this is gonna be a little bit of a side this could possibly be its own video but I think maybe we'll just leave it in the livestream before I go but I'm gonna show you now is how except I'm not very good at this but my best I'm going to show you how to try to look for where exactly something broke in an open source library so I've done a terrible job this by the way if somebody wants to help me out I have been I've done what I shouldn't do but I said I wouldn't do which is simply work with it's work with the same JavaScript file throughout a whole bunch of videos so when I go to post all these code examples I don't have them anymore because I've overwritten them so if anybody has been watching these last few ones to help and help me compile the code getting a text message this is important and we respond to it just just sorting out what's happening for dinner children need to be fed food needs to be made or ordered it's all very complicated merge in in the chat is says merchant says I'm on it so thank you merging for volunteering to do that that isn't wonderfully helpful okay so wait a sec I'm gonna now should I be so kind maybe I'll save this one so what I'm gonna do is an emergent I can actually send you this one at least if that's helpful what I'm gonna do is just make a separate folder here for WebGL debugging and I'm going to and I'm gonna go here I'm gonna run a server boy I'm never getting to that word to vex stuff mi and Miriam and am I using the current version and now what I want to do I just want to go back to a simple example where there are two point lights negative 200 zero zero red 200 all right let me I don't know so let's just pretend like this could be its own video yes let me set this up and it could just stay as part of the live stream I don't sometimes if it turns out to be this like really illustrative useful thing I'll keep it but so so sphere so I'm going to say ambient material 255 sphere 200 and we get all this great really simple sketch whoa I'm looking at the wrong I'm editing totally editing the wrong file so that's now the backup the backup hi I'm the worst worse I'm so bad at this what can I do to ever make it go back okay let's take this and copy it this is probably a terrible idea into here don't replace it don't replace it keep both and then take this and copy it into here yes and replace it let me go back to here get rid of this one and rename this one then close this then go back to terminal all of you are I'm just hope you all so pleased with yourself that you have better workflows okay whoa okay so some stuff I gotta fix make this fear smaller stroke alright so we can see here I use version control I know about version control I can't bother with it during lay live streaming it would just take over everything that I do okay Mergent great question so at the moment I would like the examples to work so I we should use whichever virginal library makes the example work and then once the library is fixed we should try to remember to put the corrected version library in okay okay hello and welcome to a debugging video maybe there'll be a new playlist about open source debugging and finding bugs and seeing what we could be helpful to the open source world know if this makes sense but what I'm going to attempt to do in this video is during my WebGL tutorial series I noticed that in the current version of p5 if I create two point lights one on the Left Oh actually one on the left that is red and one on the right that is blue look whoa hold on oh no that's the sorry that's the excuse me do overtime please this is the color this is the position the worst getting tired so I should probably do this tomorrow say what for yes thank you Alka okay I'm very excited about this video I don't know if this is gonna be helpful or make any sense maybe you're watching it maybe you're not mean you are watching it well here's what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna try to have a new series to put that's in a playlist or no series about finding bugs and opensource projects and contributing and helping to fix those bugs like how do we do that and this is gonna be a heart this is a high degree of difficulty one so I'm not starting with something simple and this will probably fail but I'm gonna do my best so I just did a whole set of tutorials about WebGL and one of the thin p5 one of the things I noticed with help from the viewing audience is that if I put two point lights in the scene here's a point light that's red that's on the right side of the canvas here's a point light that's blue that's on the left side RGB X Y Z and then I have a sphere with ambient material that will reflect that light what do I actually see I only see a blue light on the left now this is using p5 version zero point five point one six so let's just let's just be sure about this so I'm going to take this point light and put it second now you can see only the red point light what I want to see and I'm going to show you this really quickly I'm gonna go to my index.html file and I'm gonna switch I'm gonna talk about how I'm doing this i'ma switch versions of the library this isn't working this isn't working with version zero point five point seven so somewhere in between zero point five point seven and zero point five point one six this feature broke this is I feel like I want some like cool Oh didn't Pink Panther her beam some music to play because we're gonna do some detective work now how can we find this so first of all how did I switch between the libraries so quickly so one thing you might notice about this particular bit of code you can ignore this kittens folder but I actually have the p5.js library here locally and that is the current the current as of the time of recording this video version of the library and in this and you can see here in my HTML file I'm referencing that particular local p5.js file now it's now commented out I could comment it back in what I decided to do it's really eat much easier is that I could use something called a CDN which is stands for content delivery network and if I search for CDN p5.js what I'll get is this particular website CD nsj comm and it has hosted versions of the library that I can reference in from my HTML file and I can get the links for any old version now one of the ways I'm going to do this right now is I'm just gonna go here I'm gonna put 16 in here and I could just we could do this all day right I'm gonna go back sorry to the sketch hit refresh it's broken so I could say 0.15 still broke it point 1 4 still up it's working in 0.5 point 1 4 so for some reason I went all the way back to 0.5 0.7 when I was doing my session but now I can see it actually works in 0.5 0.5 0.14 so what does this mean time for me to go to github so the p5.js project is an open source project on github it's a complex open source project with many files and many developer tool like workflow like crazy things or some documentation that's pretty good there's some documentation that could be better that we're working on that people are contributing to but let's just go right now to the github repository so one of the things this is the URL github.com slash processing p5.js one thing you should do is you should go click on contributors and just meditate for a minute and thank all these wonderful people who are putting in all these work and and I could say Karen just to highlight some people care and paying to the in terms of WebGL Karen Peng indefinite and I think if we come down and and find also Kate Hollenbach right here and I don't know what Stahl Jia so mind if Matthew did a lot of work in yeah here's a me I am Samia coding trained viewer so there's a lot of people on here I'm thank I'm just referencing some of the people who have done a lot of that WebGL work so something I can do now next is I can just go back here to commits now here's the thing I can sit here and look and look and look and look and look and look and try to find it look at look at dates and commits but I kind of there's got to be a way I can search for where this particular commit happened so first of all one thing I should be able to do is look for the tag for a release so I think if I search for zero point five point one four and actually it's point one five that broke it how do I look for a tag a commit that has a certain tag maybe they are tagged maybe that's not maybe that's advanced search I guess I could do attack thank you that's the releases alright so let me try to look over the search didn't work I think what to edit back Mattia to the search click on releases on the front page I suppose do that so let's go to to try to search what happened with zero point five point one five let's go to releases so we can see here zero point five point one six zero point five point one four hey where's point one five that's weird I don't know what I'm missing here so normally you would think there'd be a one five and oh yeah anyway I don't know maybe in my mind the math of my mind is just so we can see these are all the commits 628 commits since this release so we would think that in these commits one of these one of these would have broken that point light now something that I could do first of all is I think an easier path towards finding this so might be where is the source code for point light itself and by the way this same I think happens with directional light so if I go into source maybe someone watching this live right now even know if you're watching this recorded is actually gonna find this before me and can help me out here but I'm gonna go under WebGL and light so we would think probably in like j/s this maybe is where this issue might have happened and I can actually if I'm in that file I could look at the history of just this file by where it where do I how come I don't see by the way I'm logged in as myself so I have some ownership privileges over this repository so you might you might actually wise if you're following along and trying to do this to you this might look a little bit different to you but everything you'll be able to see so what I want to see is the history for this file I don't know why I'm let me just look at the history there's a button right there that says history so let's look at this floor mat format so let's kind of like look along here when was when was 0.5 point 1 6 when was that released so let's look at sorry let's look at the date let's look under releases I'm a little just and that was August 28th so somewhere right because one for with one for it's working let's just confirm that again that's one for and it's working so some some and look major WebGL updates we can see that that happened there let's go back here so 15 days ago Noah so we can go all the way back up we can here we go initial implementation of custom shaders so sorry this is so small so we can now see there was a commit to this file on September 5th there was a commit on September 11th September 15th thank you kate Hollenbach and Lauren McCarthy probably isn't this amazing work Zala stacks so let's see probably the print function is not related hopefully this is not related my guess is there's got to be an issue inside one of these so let's look at what these commits actually do so I'm going to open these in new tabs so we can see so we can see this is what and this is a little difficult for you to look at because it's so sort of tiny on my screen but we can see this changed what changed here instead of it oh yeah so this is like a little bit of like this to me looks like a minor change that's cleaning up the reference to how this is being used this is removing shader using this renderer current fill shader so this could have something to do ambient light count so that's what the ambient light let's look and see if we can find directional light count so this must be some issue here right where is the I kind of want to look at the point light do you think this could be for the point light let's see what else there is render that's the same thing it's a material stuff changed point light ah here we go the point light changed so this is point the point light function changed so let's look at that let's so one thing we can do once we sort of found it I might be able to go actually into the p5.js code itself and find point light kind of hack with it a little bit need to find the actual function sorry this is point light equals yeah here's so this is me finding the actual function in the p5 library and this is what changed this so let's see boy this is again high degree of difficulty one no what's weird here is it doesn't look like oh yeah point light count let's look for that that seems like that's going to be ref relevant hmmm this might be look at this look at this amazingly that's it like that looking in the chat change the diff view to inline instead of side by side good point so if somebody in the chat is telling me that I can change the diff view to unified I think yeah thank you for that that's gonna help me a lot so this has changed the way now the other thing that were other commits right this is the one I'm just looking at here resolving conflicts let's look at that one well that's the first one let's look at so sorry there were two right this is the initial there's initial implementation and resolving conflicts so let's also look at this initial implementation could it have broken in here and I think actually now that I'm looking at this so there is a moment where this point light count goes up and then it should set it with a different point light hmm so whatever it did before this this solution does not work hmm so let's see if we can hack something together first of all let me at least just add console.log this underscore renderer dot point light count so let's see what happens now when I go to the sketch now one thing I need to do is I need to avoid so one thing that's little bit unfortunate is this is a massive text file and you there's no reason why I can't edit and play around with this but I find that atom tends to crash which it looks like it's just done so I'm gonna switch to visual studio oh this is I'm getting a good tip this stop so hold on I was so yeah force closed so I'm gonna I'm gonna open this project up in Visual Studio because I need to use that that's gonna be that's gonna be better hopefully in letting me play around with the actual p5 library so one thing I want to do is make sure I'm using the p5 library the current one that I'm editing now and then I'm gonna go into the libraries and I'm gonna go down I'm gonna look for point light count and this dot renderer so I want to just sort of see whoops I want to see if what's happening in the sketch so you can see one two one two one two one two so that's happening the count is going up every frame current fill shaders set uniform that point light count this so something is wrong the point light location is being set so am I getting a new point light location each time let's look at what these values are so I am getting the point light location so again I don't know how any of this stuff works this is like the underlying WebGL code it takes the location the color and it kind of feeds it to these other renderer shader II things and it should be making multiple ones but for whatever reason so what's going on and for what when I make a point light this now all that's happening and it's getting the two different locations but am i over I'm just over writing the last one so something about Kerr Phil shader being overwritten is the problem hmm I doubt we're gonna be able to fix this in this video this is what I said by high degree of difficulty I probably should give up and just kind of point out that this isn't working and where I think the code problem is and the github issue I'm about to post but let's try a little bit more right so current Phil share let's take a look at what this object is maybe I can learn something here whoo undefined so I'm gonna say no loop just stop everything right now and I'm just going to look at this object so this is the object that it's doing stuff to and actually what would be really useful I have an idea now which is that what I'm going to do is I'm actually going to put in my sketch I'm going to put no loop here and what I'm going to do in the library code that I'm messing around with is I am going to look at this at the end of each of each time at the beginning and the end of each function time it's called so I'm going to put this at the beginning and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say console.log new light so let's try let's see let's see where this gets us okay so new light let me clear this so we got a new light and this is what the shader looks like and this is what it looks like at the beginning this is what it looks like at the end and it seems like the important thing that it's looking that it's messing around with is current set uniform so what is that so maybe that gets set in here is there a point light color point light count point light location so look at this here's the point light location here's the point light count and here's the point light color so now at the end of that function oh that's the end it should have let's go look at the end of the second one if we look at the uniforms and we look at the point light count why does it say 1 it should have gotten to 2 it should have gotten to 2 right getting some advice where I probably and what I normally would have done you're right is like just take the old function but I think the reason why I'm not doing that in this case is because I think a really big part of the architecture changed so this this change is just really is related to like the full architecture of how everything is working so so it's not as simple I think of just replacing the function which normally it would be so this is strange that this size says 1 because maybe because it didn't seem to really set it right it sets it as 2 and then it says set uniform to what that is but it didn't get set to 2 point like count name size type right so that seems it seems to not be taking did I forget that this dot again somebody to keep telling me that but right so like right hard code to in there and see alright interesting getting the suggestion to try hard coding to in here and let's see like hold on on a hard code to in there now let's look at the very last time uniforms point light count one hmm so I'm getting some interesting messages in the chat maybe the uniform changed name does set you point light count hold on a second here you point like count that's what it says there do i is this by definition like you point like location let's look at you point light location size 8 so where does that value where is the actual value those sighs so sighs sorry size is like it's just one number so it's actually I think sighs so the actual value is somewhere these are just the uniforms sorry this is just saying what the uniforms are when I set it it probably goes into the shader or the renderer ambient like yeah yes sorry sorry sorry sorry so this is really where I want to look current default light shader is that where it's gonna get set uniforms yeah this is I think these are just a list of the uniforms I am really lost here I've no idea how any of this stuff works I think probably I should just file my I should just file this bug and he'll give up that this is going to be a new series there was another object inside the uniform maybe in you point late so Leonardo is saying there was another object inside the uniform scrolled past all right thank you everybody so let's go here so hold on uniform you point light count location no name sighs so what did I miss what did I miss be more specific Matthew Brown is saying I should really look at calm up compare I'm gonna try that too renderer I passed it renderer okay everyone's got good suggestions here renderer renderer renderer down at shaders default light shader uniforms is this where I need to look up I don't know where right there where it passed it again okay okay attributes pointlight counties how come I don't see it count count it would be helpful if you have more specific renderer what's the next thing what's after renderer scrolling up doesn't help me because you guys are 10 seconds or 20 seconds in the past so you're at a different renderer point like oh it's just in there as point light count there we go thank you okay point light count I see it so that's correct but so that value is correct but are there actually where where does it keep track of both locations thank you I see that now please give up now and go home yeah we all found the point light count because it's on the screen how many of you errs have I lost now but now I'm hard coding it yeah yeah I know I know all right let's let's let's unhard code that I suspect that that's working like the value of the variable is correct it's correct point light count the issue is where does it keep track of see there's a default there's the current that seems to me the issue might be around the fact that there's a current this sort of like current light so it's keeping track of the count correctly default light shader so the question is it's our current light shader no current fill shader current stroke shader default light shader let's forget the attributes position right so this is just it should be passing an array a point through the uniform you can log that array if you did not before in the renderer one you're probably right so first of all probably not even an issue here that's a very good point Leonar let me go back to some suggestions that people have had i really just meant to file a bug but i so i'm gonna just look at one thing i'm gonna look at is the compare so there's a way i think i can form a URL that's going to just compare these two different releases and under files changed i can probably go to let's look at the renderer which is the which is the hold on to do let's look under it boy I really don't know what I'm doing doing it let's look under WebGL render orgy out now a problem let's look at this one now are we in immediate think we're in immediate but let's look at just render or GL yeah this is where probably the light so let's look at so can I is there a way for me to compare between versions a particular file that's the question right so how do I compare a particular file but I could just look for a GL renderer right renderer what was it called rendered render renderer GL yet whoops large disks are not rendered by default yeah let's yeah here is just gonna do it well that's just the whole file all right I'm like somebody had a sensible suggestion you could add a breakpoint and debug the function oh that's like yeah that's way too sensible I've kind of done that I just want to see like where does it actually I want to trace where it actually sets that light so in the renderer look at this crazy ambient light count the render has a point light count right and it has a fill function so let's go look yeah interesting I'm just kind of like peeking through this as no this is the thing I have no idea how the WebGL system works at all I really shouldn't be doing this yeah all the only thing in the renderer is the point light count let's see if that setting a debug marker and letting it trace it for you console.log okay hold on no see I can see that it's working this is what I've been to a console logging I've been looking at the oh but I was looking at the fill shader ah let's just look at the renderer let's just look at the renderer thank you that let's try that let's look at the renderer point like count to default light shader yeah am I missing the dis dot oh yeah sorry thanks that worked anyway yeah I meant for this just to be a lesson in filing a good github issue yeah so here's the thing these are all really excellent suggestions for example turkey writes copy only the correct rendering a J's file from the new version to old and see if it fixed it and then and only then and you know you're on the right track the issue I totally agree and this is actually I should have picked a different example like if there was kind of this small area but I'm pretty sure that between zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six like all of WebGL was rewritten to do it like to work in an entirely different way so there really isn't one thing that changed this is a pretty poor example it's like everything changed so at this point I just need to figure know how the current system works and find out why I can't keep track of multiple so it didn't really break it's just like the whole thing got rewritten and some stuff stopped working so that's so that's so that's really I think more of the issue with this particular hood so I think what I'm gonna do now and this can't be set probably can't be salvaged I love the idea of doing this is I think I'm gonna just file a github issue unless so let's look at alright so if this is going to be salvaged into a tutorial video at some point a long time ago at Matthews discretion I'm going to stop and say ok let me find a window to be on okay that was a weird edit point if this video ever exists but I went down many different rabbit holes to try to find the bug and you might have seen some of that happening and what you watched up until now but this was pretty pretty much a case where I my skill level I cannot fix this bug there's a couple of reasons one I don't have all day here I gotta go have some dinner two is I don't really know how the WebGL system works I wasn't one of the ones who designed it and I won't be able to investigate that fully right now and three like this is a case where it wasn't like a small bit of code change that broke that I could look at reverting over the summer between version zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six all a lot of WebGL was kind of rewritten and structurally so so much changed and I think it's less a case of like if this thing broke and more of WebGL was rewritten in a new way and some things aren't working anymore so let's let the next step could be filing a github issue that's as helpful as possible so let's do that together here in this video so I'm gonna go back to the p5.js repository and I'm going to go to issues and I'm going to first thing you should always do is I should look to see if there's already an issue so I'm gonna search for point light point light not working that's October night that's interesting issue with positioning point lights so this could actually be this could actually be our issue let's take a look so this seems to be describing something different and look we should aspire to have such a wellwritten issue I asked point Luke should you use realworld could rather than a normalized direction like directional light so this seems to be something different this seems to be an issue with and also this is using a previous version of p5 so I'm going to not worry about that so this I don't think is our issue although it might be related and positioning point lights so this I think is also a similar issue and so this week it's probably worth referencing these two issues and then I just want to look at so let me save this here let me save these two issues and let me look what else could I look for lights yeah issues so I don't think there's anything else related to the light so I to this issue so I think we can file an issue so I'm gonna write a new issue now what I'm gonna say only one point light or directional light works what's a good what's a good title for this issue what's a good title for this issue let's see I'm trying to give a good one subsequent calls to point light overwrite previous point lights multiple point lights or directional lights not working I know maybe that's I don't love this title maybe something can think of something better now this is helpful I'm going to this can be this what so this is like a helpful guide so what I'm gonna do is instead of this I'm gonna say I'm gonna leave some of this in here I'm gonna say found a bug and the most appropriate area is WebGL and which platform so this is using desktop and p5 just version we are using zero point five point one six web browser is a Chrome and I'm gonna say about Chrome and I'm gonna put this in there be really diligent about this and I'm gonna say operating system Mac Mac OSX and my operating system is ten point eleven point six ten point eleven point six and now I'm going to take out these comments and I'm up now I wanna describe how do i reproduce this bug so the following code in the following simple example which positions two point lights one on the left one on on the right only the last point light is illuminated is active is seen is I selected mobile sorry thank you is the platform is wrong I got it I got it though is one on the left one on the right only that is activated is active so one now I want to add some code so one thing you can do is well you want to add a block of code you add it in between these backticks and you can actually say the language and I can now go to the sketch which is my code here and I could and I can get rid of this and just do this so I'm gonna add this here so now I'm going to put this here the other thing I could do to be really kind of crazy is I could add some screenshots so I'm just say this is with the red light second so now I'm going to go to I'm over doing it just for effect here which you know that some of this may be unnecessary so so I'm going to take a little screenshot of this and then I'm gonna say and now I'm going to do the blue light second and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna say back to my issue follow it with the red light second ie and I'm gonna take these two here and then I'm going to upload that image that screenshot which should be on the desktop of this one and that's the red light second with the blue light second and I'm going to take this screenshot and I'm gonna put the code in there the the this bug appeared somewhere between zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six using zero point five point one for the you both lights are active so now I'm going to go back to my code and I'm going to switch to zero point five point one four which I think that's what I'm doing here I'm going to run the sketch again I have too many things open and I'm going to screenshot this and I'm going to add that to this issue add that in here whoops I'm gonna add that in here oh you broke my computer stop why is that there go away fine dirt ah everything is falling apart and a forestry lunch my finder I don't know why that just did that and then I'm gonna grab this one and put this here and then I'm also going to write I'm also going to write the same bug exists for directional light this may be related to and then so I'm writing here this may be related to and so remember had these issues 2 2 5 1 so I want to reference those other issues by their number 2 2 5 1 that's an issue that I think might be related and what's the other one 1 6 2 2 then I'm going to say this issue was filed by the viewers of the coding train live ok so now the next thing I can do is I can check my work so I can go over here to preview and we can see here whoops so I've got some weird mistakes here which is it got like some spaces here so I found a bug WebGL p5 GS version web browser operating system in the following simple example which positions to point lights one on the left one on the right only the last point light is active I don't like the way that sounds only the the the the second call to point light the second call to point light overrides the first rather than adding a new light that makes more sense I think so the second call to point light overrides the first rather than adding a new light so here's the code with the red lights like oh these are huge these images that's fine though I guess and then with the blue second light this bug appeared using 0.5 on both lights are active the same bug exists for directional light and this may be really this okay calling all viewers I think this issue is done does anybody have any suggestions anything that I missed or anything that would be helpful here adding a point light overwrites the previous one yeah the second call two point light and let's call that let's make this a function and you can use a single backtick overwrites the first rather than adding a new light overrides overwrites so should I say the question is do we like this title anybody have any better suggestions for this title yeah I suppose the convention could be to say this multiple point lights I don't know I'm gonna leave it lowercase so Austin is saying that I should have checked if the issue was closed and reported in a previous version too I should I'm tired now so please if somebody finds something else that's relevant that it was open and closed please add that as a comment to this issue only the final light source is rendered okay I like that only final light source point light directional light is rendered do we like this better I think this might be better let's let's use the camel case for these since they're the function names to someone saying there's a two two five seven issue is that what I said already oh there's also two two five seven okay let's look at that issue two two five seven fixed directional light and point light oh oh ah so maybe this this is before oh right because it could have been off you make a really good point so one thing I didn't do oh boy so I really botched this Austin's thing I should check if it's been closed already because it could have been fixed and closed but not but not in the new release zero point five point one seven oh I really should have said that earlier so yeah I'm just figuring all this stuff out too so let's let's do let's be let's be a little bit let's let's actually look for this so I'm gonna go back to looking for lights and I'm gonna look under closed so it doesn't look like any of these let's look at point light so oops so I'm not finding anything this is closed November 7th November 2nd so these seem to be different right these are some things that happened recently I don't what was the date of 0.5 point 1 6 this was on October 11th oh look at this so 2 2 5 7 would it be funny if this has been fixed already after all of this October 11 viewed commented commented please see the new pull request here so this fixed directional light and point light this is Maurice uh November 2nd oh I love the lessons we learned in programming but is it just a document documentation let's look it looks like it's just the documentation right everybody look at this with me it's just the dot we could be certain about this it's still broken on master okay right so heading juror is saying I should try the latest revision from master to see if the bug has been fixed I should but then I'd have to like get the whole thing and build in I don't know now I really like it's like after six o'clock there's like two hours so thankfully so okay another thing that I should have tried is to actually check because there have been some things that have there have been one thing that I should mention that I should have also done a search for is that there have been 382 commits since October 11th and 0.5 point one six is from October 11th so one of these could have actually fixed it and I'm not going to see that fixed so I should search through also the closed issues I couldn't find anything and a very kind viewer has actually checked that the current version of p5 even from github that's not that's newer than 0.5 point one six isn't working so I think this issue is ready to be filed now I should do a followup video somebody remind me of this to show you how do you really check that how do you build and use p5 GS from they'll get hub repository how do you have the most recent version that includes includes fixes following the most recent release that would be worth looking at at some point in this new series I have about how to work with open source projects on github hopefully better than I can do because I'm apparently not very good at this but I'm trying my best so let's go back to that issue and even taught me to close all my tabs I definitely should so our title final title is only the final light source point light directional light is rendered and this is all the code these are the different screenshots I think this is ready to go I don't know about the title I'm still not so sure about the title but this is gonna have to be yeah there isn't there could be Knightly build oh there's too much too much ago I will talk about this up in another video okay not to you if you could salvage this you are a genius I'm gonna submit this issue it's very exciting oh now I don't think you have the permissions to do this but because I am an owner of this repository I can actually tag it with WebGL so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna do submit alright thank you very funny good night thank you thank you very much oh well just as I had imagined huh wasn't it broken in 0.5 point one 300 I forgot that pull request oh shoot no but that was just the docks so I think that docks isn't worth to mention because it's just the pull request but do I really have to check this now let's go back to here no it's working in five one three five one two so it worked every everywhere town before the summer okay okay so now we're done with that issue what's the other issue custom shaves Aerith camera right let's do another clock okay no no I'm going so this is another github issue anybody who watched this video and feel so inclined and feels like they feel they feel empowered and they feel like this is no big deal I can file an issue I think an issue should be filed that you get a consult error in your sketch breaks if the camera and the center are the same maybe it should just give you a friendly air maybe if the error is fine actually think about that is that a bugger is that the appropriate behavior I don't know all right I really should read some random numbers right and we've got to do that I'll be back tomorrow but I really should do that now somebody last time told me where I last left off what might what I do this for like so many hours it's ridiculous where where where did I last leave off I remember I read the foreword there's no I read the acknowledgments there's no way I read this whole introduction oh my god I don't know I can't know if I can bear to do this I guess like no no no I know but see I made this I made this commitment to instead of just when I read random numbers on the coding train because that's what I like to do instead of chest flipping to a random set of random numbers and reading them I made this commitment to actually kind of like keep track of where I last was and read all of them all the way through so the problem is that I thought oh I should also read the introduction which is actually like really long and has a whole bunch of tables of not perfect so maybe I should just start here come back to the introduction right right right and I should definitely you know I'm pretty sure that I think this repealing of net neutrality is a pretty bad idea it's a nuanced issue and obviously I'm mostly from everything I've read and learned about and I am in favor of net neutrality but so this my random number protest good night everybody ten thousand ninety seven thirty two thousand five hundred thirty three seventy six thousand five hundred and twenty thirteen thousand five hundred a.m. 630 four thousand six hundred seventy three fifty four thousand eight hundred seventy six eighty thousand nine hundred fifty nine nine thousand one hundred seventeen thirty nine thousand two hundred and ninety two seventy four thousand nine hundred and forty five sixty six thousand and sixty five hey guys where was I 64 all right everybody right all right you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna make a computer program this for me just like let it stream forever all right thank you everybody goodnight I appreciate your time in watching this youtube channel I can't believe it a 615 now I've completely lost my darn mind and look at my phone I will see you all apparently I'm coming back tomorrow morning which now seems completely insane to me but I will be back here tomorrow in the morning probably around 1030 I really have absolutely I have to stop by 100 p.m. tomorrow so and I would love to get to the word to Veck stuff I would like to do these thing oh you're not seeing this right now I would love to do this stuff as well so we'll see really short protests yes okay thank you everyone and I'll see you soon any last questions I don't know what I do tomorrow I would love to keep going with this WebGL stuff redo anything that from today that's too much of a disaster and maybe look at custom shapes texture and create graphics we'll see all right words avec yeah I know that's all my list next week I don't know and maybe I turn yes maybe I turn okay I need a good way of like ending oh yeah okay great hold on I think what I should do I've gotta night this is really this is a really important thing that I'm doing right now whoops oh uh Frank lack is not doing and then unlock it myself here everyone do what you will with this hold on I've got a better idea give you guys something to work with filters yes and oops I really lost my mind okay now yep Sean says oh no Dan you're asking me turn to amine yeah hello what do you think I'm doing this for I'm open to suggestions any requests they'll take some requests before I go please do a stream with Python no no don't you see I'm just here doing ridiculous stuff with my green screen loading animation I mean there's always this too I mean here's the thing I could also enough material you know more kittens Oh kids you put the kittens in yeah this is very dangerous yeah I I'd like to live on the edge okay I think I'm gonna go and I look forward to waking up in the morning tomorrow with your creations okay background music alright I'm gonna go I'm gonna go I'm gonna go do the stairs oh the stairs is a good one okay okay that was pretty terrible try this like okay yes I do okay the problem is I'm like looking at myself like doing this so I'm not looking at the camera so the Egyptian fun was pretty good right okay does enough now I'm really turning this off okay well that's my exercise for the day what's my Fitbit say I got by heart rates up to 115 and I've got nine thousand two hundred seventy four steps alright I'm gonna now hit the I'm officially now going to hit the stop streaming button just kidding okay goodbye everybody I'm happy to do more of these tomorrow no worries okay goodbye everybody goodnight I'm gonna hit stop screaming
