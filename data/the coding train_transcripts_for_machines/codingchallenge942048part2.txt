welcome back I'm here trying to this is like the most painful thing in my entire life and I can't believe that you're watching this but you are I'm trying to make the game 2048 and I have gotten so far as to make the game work but only in what's the One Direction song somebody tell me only in one direction which is down so if I hit the spacebar everything will move down now it would be really nice for you to be able to see an animation to have a sense that what it's really doing and we haven't seen anything combined yet let's come on get something to combine there we go but you can see that everything's coming down and the numbers are combining when they're equal this is exactly like how the game 2048 plays of course this is much nicer to have a nice animation and different colors and all that sort of stuff but what I need to do is I need to be able to go in any direction so let's at least double check here and keep rest that I can say I think if key equals up arrow let's let me look in I can't remem what the constants are and p5 up arrow is something yeah it's 38 so and what if I say console dot log key ah so I think I probably want the key code because the key it's giving me it's not giving me the number I think I want I think I want this yeah so key code is what I want I want key code equal to up arrow and I can use a switch statement I'm not going to down arrow so down is what it's doing already let's just try to get up and down so if key code equals down arrow do nothing to nothing if key code equals up arrow what I need to do is just flip everything right so I can go through and I can say flip grid equals flip grid right I just want to flip the grid so I can write a function called flip for any twodimensional array and I'm gonna go through all four rows and I'm just going to say grid index I if I say dot reverse on an array does it return in a new array let a equal one two three four one two three four a dot reverse so it actually reverses the array so it operates on that same array so I could say grid index I reverse I can say let flipped equal false flipped equals true so I want to flip it then I want to I'm just gonna let I'm gonna sue Mike only going to press the arrow keys and then I'm going to flip it again so and I do I wonder which I don't need to return it I just need to flip it so I don't need to so I'm gonna flip the grid and then if it was flipped flip it back so this should be now this is just like for up and down this should work for up and down let's see if this works little little crazy thing I've done here down whoops down okay down let's go up up down up down down up down down up down up this is totally working down up down up down and eventually the games going to be over because I don't have any more moves left okay so that works poof so now I need else if keycode equals right arrow now I need to rotate the grid grid equals rotate the grid so I need to rotate it let's rotate the grid I think I want a new array I think I want a new so I'm by the way I want a function this is very silly I want to have a function and put it all the way at the top called blank grid and what that does is it just returns this because I need to do this quite a bit just give me a blank one so now I can say grid equals blank grid yeah I love that and then somewhere else where I did the crazy copy thing extra equals blank grid so that's gonna be much nicer because what I want to do when I rotate it and I definitely I need to call it rotate grid and I should probably be consistent here it's a flip grid with my naming flipgrid flip grid and I definitely should break this up into different files and maybe organize my code boy I got a refactor this stuff flipgrid change this to flip grid now I'm going to write one called rotate grid now this shouldn't be too hard I should just do a nice little nested loop and I should get I should create I should create a new grid is a blank grid and then in the new grids I J I take the old grids J I and now so what this would do is now I want to rotate the grid and then I'm going to have to unrotated again I've just rotated a few more times so right so let's think so so I'm gonna have a variable called let rotate equal false rotated so this is rotated equals true then what I'm gonna do if rotated then what should I do I just want to rotate it through a few more times right rotate it once twice one two three only three more times I'll get back right that's brilliant coding right there all right let's give this a try up down up down those work what did I express eight right arrow okay got an error cannot set property undefined at rotate grid sketch j/s line 71 rotate grid new grid is a blank grid i J equals grid J oh look at this that's really bad that's really bad J okay let's try this again down up down up right okay got another error cannot read property undefined a copy grid sketch digest line 53 aah roar it is messing something off rotate grid does not return the new grid there we go return the new grid rotate grid thank you very much ha this is totally working up down up right now I can't go to the left so now I need this is gonna be this is no problem that watch this this is total insanity but else if key code equals left arrow now grid equals rotate grid grid I want to rotate it and then flip flip grid grid equals flip grid grid and you know what I should just always return I should always return a reference like even though like because it's just too confusing you keep track of which functions do which so I'm gonna go back to my flip crit function scrolls girls girl and just say return grid so now if I'm going to the left I could rotate it then flip it then and grid equals flip and so here not only is it rotated but it's also flipped so then I can flip it back and rotate it three times and I should be good now here's the thing I should only be doing this if I press one of these keys so I'm gonna make a variable called played equals false and I'm gonna say played equals true and again this can really be refactored really I should do with part three of this to refactor this probably but all of all four of these keys I'm playing and so now if I have played then I can do all this crazy nonsense if it's changed at a number otherwise console dot log game well it's not game over because I could it's only if I have no moves left so oh I'll get to that a little bit okay let's see what's the chance oh yeah I could use else played is true right I can assume that I've played but in all other kids I can at least make this a little better in all other cases right if it's some other key played is false so I'm going to assume that I've played and now let's see get down whoops down okay down down is combining to the right to the right to the right to the left to the left up to the right to right to the left down to the right down whoops I don't know what I just did to the right eye I'm pretty sure this is actually working it actually is doing what it's supposed to do and hooray great okay so this is the functionality of the game there's gonna be a part three this is three three parts part three I'll add the score and determine if there's no moves left okay so that's what I need to do and I think that what I can do is maybe I'll if bar three I might refactor a few things I'm getting some good suggestions from the chat okay all right thanks for watching this so far wow I think I might have made 2048 by accident somehow
