the core idea of the wave function collapse algorithm is to take an input image and generate an output image many output images that all mimic the style the pattern of that original image don't you just feel so much more at ease and relax tile images ah no no i'm not relaxed at all in fact i'm totally panicking i think my brain is collapsing it works it works we're getting somewhere so stick with me all aboard let's try to make wave function collapse happen
