hello my name is Dan I'm awkward but I'm making kind of a promotional video what's in this channel here so I like to make videos about programming and I hope that you watch them and maybe learn something new make some art make something different think about the world in a different way and in these videos I use two different programming environments I use something called processing here's processing three built on top of the Java programming language p5.js built on top of the JavaScript programming language both of these are part of the processing Foundation which is a nonprofit organization I'll leave that for another video but what kinds of things do I have in my videos you might like to learn about are you interested in drawing and art and color and images well one of the things you can do with processing is read input from a camera you can draw stuff onto the screen shapes here now all of these circles are being colored according to me uhhuh and then so you can see this is kind of interesting you can learn about how to do stuff like this another thing that I'm super interested in is looking at the natural world not natural the world itself how do things work this is a flocking system originally developed by Craig Reynolds and the implicit influence it and in processing looks at patterns of like birds or bees or what about you know physics and motion and tree growth and fractals you know for interaction design for art for game design for programming games this is useful content I have a whole lot of videos about this sort of stuff are you interested in making stuff that runs on the web you could look at some of my videos about p5.js data is something you might be interested in here's an example that queries the New York Times says hey New York Times how many times did the word computer appear from 1950 to 2015 and you could see a little graph of that and also just like I don't know if I wanted to make some weird thing with some sliders on a page that like danced back and forth by themselves I have a whole video that just looks at how you do that so how do you make stuff happen on the web I did this in under two minutes that was my entire goal I've never done that before so watch it send me an email send me a tweet I've got to stop five four three
