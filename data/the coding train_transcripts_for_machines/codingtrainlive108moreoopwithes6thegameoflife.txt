some crazy idea hello good afternoon hello happy Friday it has been a very long time since I've been here live streaming on YouTube in fact it has been actually I don't want to admit this it's been exactly three weeks one week was Thanksgiving last week I had strep throat which I highly I recommend not contracting I have been told well I'm no longer contagious and that also you cannot get strep throat from watching a live stream so assuming that that's all true I'm here you are here we are here together we will do some coding and that is that this is the coding train my name is Daniel Schiffman and I appear here most Fridays and in fact I have some announcements to make which is that I have now missed two Fridays for being sick actually one strip there and when I had this awful other cold thing and I'm wrapping up a few things at the end of the year my schedule is a little bit more flexible next week as of now I'm scheduled to do three one two three live streams next week and then I will be doing one final yearend live stream right now tentatively scheduled for Thursday December 21st now you might be asking I hope you can all hear me you might be asking you might be asking well how can I find out about the schedule and if so I have a new system which is really terrible but it's better than my other nonexistent system and definitely let's help save net neutrality which is that the readme computer come alive to read me here I try to keep a schedule so this is oh this is wrong I've gotta trade this one it's going to be in the afternoon so this is today Friday December 8th all these times are Eastern Time New York City time that's my time zone this is today these are some things that I'm thinking about doing next Tuesday I will do a livestream in the morning next Thursday I will do one in the afternoon next Friday we'll do one in the morning then on Monday December 18th I will be roaming out of this room I can't switch my camera ooh there we go oh come let me try this again this bad stick that's not rehearsed I will be walking this way come on come on everybody oh look now come with me over here hey don't don't talk to me otherwise you'll be live on the Internet no no you can I just I'm doing this is some very bad schtick where I open the door there's a hallway out there where people sometimes say hello to me as you might have just noticed but on that Monday I will be leaving this room you might think that I live in this room I don't actually live in this room although New York City is a very expensive place where space is at a premium and I bet you this would go for quite a bit per month in rent if you wanted to live here but what I was saying is that I will leave this room go downstairs to the fourth floor with my robing roving mobile device and livestream the yearend show here at ITP New York University and show you a whole bunch of projects to be making all semester if you don't know what that is you can probably search on YouTube for winter show 2017 spring show no winter show 2016 spring show 2017 those are some other live streams and videos that I've done come on this way oh my goodness what's happened here sorry hold on okay come on this way so boys that beat the train okay so looking at the chat Morocco somebody is actually watching this live stream from Morocco that is amazing to me hello to all the international users viewers this is called it TCU and I'm going to go with it all right so what's happening today what other things do I want to announce a couple things holidays are coming up I feel obligated to do some marketing here I have a new Amazon page if you go to amazon.com slash shop slash coding train I think nope the coding train the coding train yeah there we go if you go to amazon.com slash shop slash the coding train you can see here this is uh you can get your very own it's not a coding train train it's a so I've just created this page to collect different books and resources that I use in some of the videos and it's true if you go to this page and click on one of these links and shop on Amazon I get some sort of commission from that so I wanted to mention that that is there and available to you I also wanted to say that those a loud clap that it is the year and fundraiser for the processing foundation you can see here that we have a goal the processing foundation to raise $20,000 in December and you can donate now if you want but my plan is December 21st will be a live telephone experience where I do coding tutorials all day I don't know if we play all day and hopefully have some guests or different things and as we watch the donations rise for the nonprofit foundation in the processing foundation I should also mention that briefly that for any of you who are patreon backers patreon.com slash coding training a couple things one is I have now sent out every single sticker and book reward everything will stick her everyone every book reward every us address and the International Book rewards are going out as we speak so those will hopefully all be finished within a couple days it's just a lot more complicated cuz I've to fill out all these customs form so anybody has any brilliant ideas for how I can ship books internationally in a more efficient way so I want to mention that now I also know I don't want to belabor this point but I know there have been some recent changes in the patreon fee structure and there's been some controversy associated with that if anything that if you are a patron backer and anything about the new patreon changes is something that you're unhappy about it's nothing I have control over but I would love to hear from you about that and if for some reason you cancel your pledge because of that please let me know and I of course I understand backing anything on patreon patreon is just is certainly just an optional thing for people who are capable of doing so okay so hey Dan what's you doing today asks Levani and yogi in the chat so I I have some good and bad news the good news is here I am the coding train is here for you on Friday to do some coding stuff I do feel like what I really I need to just this needs to be finished so I have a holes for beginners I have a whole set of tutorials right here which is this playlist so this playlist is the beginner foundations of programming in JavaScript playlist as you go to this through this playlist and you look and you look and you look you see ah suddenly I get older I'm here talking about functions and return and I have this youthful glow around me and I'm making a video that's only seven minutes then you can see parts of my brain oh wait oh no this is Allah two minutes I was by joke was giving it's longer 20 minutes so then I change and because what happened is I had a whole bunch of videos about making objects in JavaScript using constructor function and all about prototypes and that sort of thing and I am changing over today this year 2017 and 2018 will be the year of es6 for me and so I've been slowly replacing these videos so sixpointtwo got replaced 6.3 got replaced whoa oh my god I'm hearing some sort of horrible ad where's no no wait do you guys hear that what is this no stop where's that playing how come I can't see it okay it's come back to me I was really really trying to do some sort of dramatic something that's totally failed okay here we go wait wait yeah that's been replaced with classes what is an array that's just about an array a raising the loops arrays of objects yeah I look old I think I'm old in this one with a different yes yes and then mouse interaction with objects I'm wearing a coding train tshirt that's a good sign that's been replaced removing objects from arrays that's been replaced checking objects intersection no and objects and images no so I feel like I should do these last three so today I'm gonna do that just to have that done it's out of the way it's finished this series is complete for all of you who want to spend your winter holiday break learning different JavaScript you won't be confused by the different styles of doing objectoriented programming in JavaScript in this video ok so that's what I'm gonna start with what else might I do today I've had a lot of requests to use WebGL have I or did I just make that up people asked about it I wanted to see if I had some time to revisit WebGL rendering in p5.js I am so excited I recently learned about these JavaScript array functions like map and fill and reduce I like use them all the time and I use them all the time with that arrow syntax and I actually really like it so I want to bring that joy of these array functions with the arrow syntax to you because in the future I want to do a lot of stuff around working with data vector data clustering some machine learning topics and having some of these concepts of array functions will be really helpful and this I'm kind of unsure about but it's been asked so many times it gets requested a lot let's actually take a look here let's go to rainbow topics so if you're wondering if this is a repose as a place where you can submit ideas or questions it's a place where the questions go to die because I never get to any of them but in theory it's a place where I can kind of like organize ideas for future streams and someday I'll catch up to all of these things but what you can also do here on this is I can sort it by most reactions most thumbs up reactions and let's see alright this is kind of chrome Chrome extensions that could be Dec could be closed that issue could be closed and links of the videos can be there so there's a bunch of things somewhere in here but it's not very high up this one here we go Conway's Game of Life that's six that's six six thumbs up but I get this in YouTube comments a lot people are really interested in me doing a coding challenge to implement this I do have some tutorials where I do it where I talk about it and I show some examples but I never actually sort of programmed it from scratch so that's something I'm thinking of doing today as a challenge and if you have any ideas for really simple 3d things I could do as a p5.js WebGL challenge I would love to hear about them maybe you can put them in the comments and any patreon backers who are in the YouTube chat if you catch some good ones you could paste it into our slack channel I do look at the YouTube chat but it tends to scroll by pretty fast I miss most things about it okay right so Luke is asking didn't you do Game of Life a while ago and I I don't know I have a video I search on YouTube game let's just look game of life so okay first of all we're getting everything about the actual the game of life that game game thing so that's not going to do us any good Conway so oh there I am seven point three the game of life and nature of code two years ago twenty eight K views so this is kind of a video oh look at that that's new I hover over it starts to preview me it's docked so this video I explain the game of life and I talk about it and then I show by code example but it don't actually build all of the code for it and what I'm discovering is there is an audience who really prefers the videos where I just kind of start with a blank file and just code the whole thing while I explain it as opposed to kind of a more like lecture tutorial thing where I point and talk and demonstrate things okay so that whoa Conway's Game of Life 3d and minecraft okay this might be something I have to do at some point okay so that's that one other thing I wanted to mention YouTube Schiffman I have this new community tab so this community tab is something that is now on YouTube apparently and you can see like oh I posted something about the Amazon shop I'm right I actually wasn't sure if which one of these I should do if I have time for just one so I can do polls here what happens if I vote for here oh boy this is very confusing oh wait no no ah whatever no go back this is my fake account for being livestreaming of course it knows and I don't know what the password is I think I got it so if I vote oh boy this is really I had to create a channel alright nevermind maybe this is a hassle I've been the straw poll thing is better but I can't see the results here unless I did as myself and I'm petrified to sign me into myself while I'm livestreaming in case I reveal some kind of YouTube something or other by accident alright anyway so that community tab is there I'm gonna try it you know mostly I use github the tools that I use associated with this channel are github for all of the code and lists that I'm making YouTube for publishing the videos and now this community tab Twitter for kind of making announcements and maybe patreon for some crowdfunding and this and slack as a private slack channel as a benefit to patreon backers okay 3d game of life Oh interesting what did it I don't know why I couldn't see that as obvious so maybe let's try that alright let's see here now what I need to do is I need to put my little green piece of paper on this laptop I'm gonna go over here Thank You ADA I believe that suggestion came from ADA 3d game of life so that seems like a perfect thing to do and also a reason to do it in p5.js I'm looking for something oh yes green paper now I've got my train conductor hat all right so I'm feeling a little bit more settled today this is my list I'm gonna try to do all those objectoriented programming in JavaScript videos that I feel like I just need to like getting out of the way I'm going to maybe talk about some es6 authors are these actually es6 with some advanced array functionality I'm maybe gonna look at WebGL and maybe I will code the game of life in twodimensional canvas and then in WebGL looking at the shot so let's let's come back here to so let me look at these videos here for a second so what where did I where did I last leave off removing objects from arrays so this was what I did and if I go to the end of this video what happens at the end so if I click on right so if I click on it deletes the things so the okay alright so the next aspect of this that I'm going to look at is so let's find that example mmm where are those examples where I left off where did I put them what's in here all right might actually just have to go and grab the code from let's see grab the code from this actual github repository actually hold on I already have that downloaded here and where am I going to p5.js p5 GS what video is that and I'm looking at what was it oh why does this go to sleep don't go to sleep wait somebody's days I'm gonna prepare before I do a livestream already let's guess no night maybe it's eat is arrays oh that's dumb 7 is a raise yes moving objects from arrays 7.5 so in this is where I last left off with this bubble class there we go I will come and bring let's go grab 7 let's put it on the desktop and let's I'm starting to think that I should use Visual Studio so many people just love Visual Studio and I kind of seen people using in and it looks so fancy and nice I really like Adam I know somehow the I think I had this reaction of like oh it's Microsoft Visual Studio and that old thing that I used to program and C++ was like this is like horrifying traumatic experience but this new Microsoft the open source Visual Studio is apparently super nice but I'm gonna stick with Adam right now cuz it's what I'm used to and I have all my settings there so let's open this up in Adam and let me run a nice little server where am I going oh seven let me run a server and let me go to the browser so this should be whoa this should be limp can't move this over here yes this should be the last whoa I got some Chrome extensions still activate it let's turn those off I can just get rid of them and let's go here now what's going on in this example mouse drag got it hi this is where I last left off okay right this was the end of that last video this was the last example that I did in that tutorial series let's get rid of the reference to the sound library so that we don't get this unnecessary error message here and there we go all right I am just about ready so what I'm going to do is I am now also going to test and see how this looks oh that's not a good sign Randi would be telling me right now I reminded you to check your markers that's better not great that's pretty good can you see it that's the question I'm gonna walk over here to look focus looks good I think we're good I already forgot which one that was this one so this is my marker for today putting it right over here and I am now going to just clean the whiteboard a little bit and play some music now I also just remembered that I have a time limit here and I might as well plug this for a little bit if anybody let's see if I go to ITV at NYU dot edu big screens will that give me the information yes this is tonight doors open at 600 p.m. Friday December 8th 555 West 18th Street I guess you had to RSVP you have to travel back in time to RSVP but I will be there at this event tonight I will try to remember before I go to shove a whole bunch of coding train stickers in my jacket pocket so if you are there if you're coming to this event for any reason please say hello to me and ask me first sticker if you would like a sticker I don't actually just offer people stickers because that seems weird like I'm kind of like a creepy sticker offering like a which is like my coding train sticker but I'm really excited if somebody asks me and then I'm also like really disappointed and upset with myself if somebody asks me I don't have them on me but anyway stickers aside alright so that I wanted to mention so I do have to be out of here by 5 at least to make it over there and to watch all the wonderful work the other thing so okay why am i not signed into github I guess I'm not gonna worry about that so now what I'm going to do is so interesting level I'm just curious what I did in the tutorial from quite a while ago all right okay so that what I did and then here yeah okay so I'm not too worried about this and then this one whoa weird I don't remember making this page and it's also not working but uh I'll come back to that okay so here we go it is time for more bubbles so the topic of this video is and here's what I'm gonna I'm gonna actually do some pre video coding because so what I'm gonna do is actually set myself up with an example where I create two bubbles and then I am going to level one bubble too and I'm going to actually this will be useful the change brightness thing that'll be useful keep that the contained thing I'll let me leave that so and the move and the show if I run this what's wrong here bubble one bubble oh I didn't give it a size so let's try that move show what's wrong here Oh bubble one move and show and bubble to move and show there we go alright so I have these two bubbles moving now the other thing I by the way I've noticed right this is correct right if I say R equals 100 and R equals 50 and I take these out all right they get that size but if I do this is this an es6 thing or is that always been true in JavaScript is this overloading of a method are giving default values to a because I've always done the thing like I check to see if the argument was passed in and then I assign it a value if it wasn't but it looks like here I can give it a default value just here so so what I'm looking for what I'm curious is the the defaults are new that's part of es6 okay so all right so good maybe I'll sneak that into this video for no good reason I'm gonna I'm gonna do something you guys who are the live viewers will witness something very special because I'm going to pretend I'm going to pretend to accidentally have this problem and then I'm going to solve it this is going to be a staged fake bug I've never done that before know I always legitimately make my mistakes and don't pretend to make the mistakes and then correct them later all right okay so here we go okay all right and that overloading you can do with all functions right it's not just something that's available as part of constructor function right if I were to say function test X equals 100 and then I just say console dot log X and i refresh this page and I say test oh oh maybe I can't can I only do this for constructor functions hold on really oh no I just typed in something wrong yeah okay so it's this works for all functions okay of course of course it does of course it does all right I wrote text thank you very much hello aren't you just sitting at home wondering when could i possibly watch another video about bubbles well today's your lucky day this is another video about bubbles and in this video if I could come over here for a second what I want to look at specifically ah and this video what I want to look at specifically is how can i if I have a bubble object like this bubble one and I have another bubble object like this bubble how can these objects talk to each other communicate to each other how can they ask each other questions like am i intersecting you or you am i overlapping you how close are you from me these types of things and you can imagine all of the implications and possibility of this now on the one hand to do this all we need to do is figure out some math right and that math is what is the math of two circles that are overlapping versus two circles that aren't overlapping that math is quite simple in some ways I just want to look at the distance between the Centers of both of those circles right and you can see here that that distance is going to tell us whether they're overlapping or not right so one way that I could think about it look at this if this is r1 and this is r2 right those are the this is the radius of this circle this is the radius of this circle if this distance right that's all so this is r2 right here and this is r1 right here if that distance is greater than r1 plus r2 then certainly the circles are not overlapping however if that distance is less than the sum of the radii of the two circles than they are overlapping so in the one hand this is all I need to do I need to be able to say give me the distance can you see that just barely on the top between x1 y1 x2 y2 and then I need some sort of if statement to see is this distance less than r1 plus r2 then they are intersecting so let's actually go and start to implement that math in the code first but what I want you to think about is is there a way for the objects themselves to handle the computation of that math rather than that math just be fiddling about in the code somewhere perhaps less convenient so come back over here with me and let's actually let's go over here and so I have the continuing from where I left off this is essentially the same bubble class that's been in my previous videos and I'm just gonna make two objects I'm gonna say bubble one and bubble two you key on my keyboard doesn't work Holi works about 40 percent of the time if you notice me pressing it a bunch of times so then what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say bubble 1 equals the new bubble at 200 200 I'm gonna put one on the left side of the screen and one on the 300 200 the right side of the screen then I'm gonna say bubble one show and bubble two dots show so now I should see up and that's bubble one and bubble two so now when I go to my sketch I should hit refresh I don't see any bubbles let's look here bubble one oh look at this I forgot the bubble has a property for its radius and I did not define that huh here's an interesting thing as if I'm just coming up with this right now one of the features of es6 which is the version of javascript that we're using that allows us to write classes to make objects from allows us to give a default value to a particular argument if we forget to pass it in so this parameter here R which is going to be assigned to the bubble objects are property I can actually say R equals 50 right up here and then if i refresh it look I have two bubble objects this even sort of a weird I meant for this one to be at 400 not that that really matters so you can see those are two bubble objects and I could optionally give one of them the if I don't want to use that default value for R I could give I could give it a value so this is actually incredibly convenient little piece of syntax here that if you're going to have a parameter to a function and this is not just for the constructor you can do this for any function although it's quite convenient to do it with constructor functions and I want to give it a default value so it's a little tidbit there for you inside this video which is about the objects intersecting okay so now let's move them around bubble one dot move bubble two dot move let's move them around just to see okay so what I want come on come on bubbles so we're gonna have to do some work here to get them to those bubbles to get a little closer to each other hold on timeout this chat is going oh okay okay you people sometimes in the in the slack channel people are just chatting about stuff and I think I see all this activity out of the corner of my eye and I think oh my god I'm doing something horribly wrong I'm just gonna keep going yeah we're gonna get two arrays and a bubble system and all that stuff but this is the very very beginning where was I all right so what I want to do now is I want to go back and let's oh you can't really hide I did I did end up going above but this is fine you can see that I'll be better at this in the future so I want to try to implement this math for example what if I want to say right here and draw I can say alright I need to find the distance between bubble 1x bubble 1 dot Y right these are the properties the x and y of that bubble and bubble two x and bubble two dot y and oh and this should say D and then I want to say if D is less than what if it's less I don't know yeah if it's less than bubble 1 dot R plus bubble to R then and let's put all I'm gonna do something silly here let's put all this over here and I can say bubble 1 no no I'm just gonna say like background 0 200 0 100 okay so this is the idea of like now I have the math for intersection I know I need you to find the distance between those two bubble objects what's the distance between these two bubble objects if it's less than the sum of their two radius radii then it's intersecting okay so let's run this you could do it bubble be together bubbles be together okay I'm just gonna have to we have to force it let's let's let's bring them a little bit closer ah there you go now move apart bubble so one thing I could do is like you're just a terrible idea I could just design like the bubble location to the mouse or something and that then I could move it and you would be able to see but the bubbles they're gonna move apart eventually come on apart move apart I think so you saw the background okay so you get that this works and ah there we go I got to be a little bit more thoughtful about the sort of intersection things now here's the thing I don't I don't like this at all I don't like this one bit because the idea here is eventually what if I have three bubbles or four bubbles or ten bubbles or a hundred bubbles I need some way that I really just want to say let me see where I have room here if any arbitrary bubble be one I'm gonna reduce this because I just in gross danger you know why I insist on like drawing so high up if any given bubble let's say B 1 dot intersects b2 I want to be able to write code like this I want to be able to encapsulate all the idea of this math into a function in the bubble object so bubbles no bubbles know how to communicate with each other how to test one bubbles location versus another publish location so if I come back over here what I mean is I want to say something like if bubble one dot intersects bubble to then do this okay so this is the idea because then I could start having a raise of things and loops and check every bubble and I and it's just going to be more convenient than having this math sort of out here where it doesn't really need to be so let take a look at how we might do this so what this means to me is I need to write a new function that's part of the bubble class called intersects so that's pretty easy I could just do that done that function by the way because of the way that I wrote it here inside this if statement the idea is that function is going to return true or return false so right now just to have this do something I could just say return true right here and the idea here is that okay well the intersects function is a function that's called on one bubble and receives as an argument another bubble so I need to give it an argument here and I can call that other for example so now if I comment out this math and I run this right it looks like it's working but of course if I move their locations away it's always drawing that pinkish background because my function always returns true so one thing you can kind of see from this is it's often worth kind of reading the skeleton of your code and then just like hard coding in true or false and see if it's working as false I don't see it true I do see it now I could actually go and fill in the math in that part so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna grab this math that I had before and I'm gonna bring it down here and things are gonna get a little bit easier I still want to calculate the distance but what do I want to calculate it between I want to calculate it between the bubble that I am right now what is the bubble that I am right now this this bubble with what the other bubble the other bubble that you have so generously passed in as an argument to my parameter named other other other and then if that distance is less than my radius and the other radius then and only then would I return true and I'm gonna don't worry I'm going to show you something that's gonna make this nicer in a minute because all of many of you are complaining right now the way I'm running this and we can see now now this bubble class has a function called intersects which can receive any other bubble and always check if the current bubble is intersecting the other bubble so here we go I'm gonna do this they're not interesting let's let's let's let's hack something to make things lay our life's little life a little easier instead of moving bubble I'm just gonna say bubble dot x equals Mouse X and bubble dot y equals Mouse Y okay now of course I could write a function don't follow the mouse or set the mouse but I'm just gonna throw this in there really quickly so that I can do this and I go intersects doesn't intersect okay so now let's take a look at one thing which I want to change here which is that I am a weird strange person I really like the way I wrote this it just says it all I know I have an if statement and I know when it's true I want to return true and when it's false I want to return false and I've said all that and I said it in like five lines of code here but the truth of the matter is this is a statement distance is less than this dot R plus other dot R that whole statement evaluates to true or false when it evaluates to true and return true and evaluates to false I want to return false so this can actually be condensed into just whoops OH auto fill return the result of this boolean right I could just say is that return the truth of this statement true or false and this will in fact be the same exact result yay oh this is the end of this video so what have I done here what might you want to do now here's the thing a couple let me show you one other thing lets us ask a question I'm gonna ask a very important question here if I were to say if bubble two intersects bubble one have I changed anything program still works this is exactly the same program so in this case I am writing sort of a function you could maybe make the argument that you want like a bubble manager class and the bubble your class has an intersex function that takes two bubbles and you know so this is the point is there's always other ways to organize your code and you can you have to watch out for like over engineering your system but this is one way of doing it's a way that I kind of like to do it later you might see in other videos or tutorials that I make where I have instead of just all bubbles I have you know frogs and turtles and fish and kitty cats and maybe the frogs have to check their location relative to the kitty cats but the kitty cats have to check their location relatives as Turtles so having the different objects act on different kinds of objects is also something that comes up but what I would say what I'm gonna do in the next video is how do I go from this idea to suddenly having a system of like a hundred bubbles and I'm checking if every single one is intersecting any other one and what happens when we do that so I am going to do that in the next video you might actually just give that a try yourself but and then see how it goes and watch the next video okay thanks for watching I think it would be good to put an annotation with what you wrote Simon I'm not sure what that's referring to I'm looking at the chat are we doing the game of life today I hope so yes all right so I think I'm ready to move on I'm gonna just give myself a second to see if anybody has any questions they want to ask this is moving I think I could be done with the next two videos by four o'clock I still have a little bit of a cold game of life on a torus whoohoo that sounds cool that could be fun all right all right all right looking at the chat I do read the YouTube chat now annoyed and that's what I'm doing right now I usually can't follow all of it and I also have I also when you say Anna tation Simon do you mean you must mean do you mean code comment which which is but anyway and sorry I forgot the question who was it I have two chats going on I try to follow that flack one who's a small group for patreon backers but I also do look at the YouTube what do I get burned out yes alright so here we go so I think I'm just ready to move on then keep going oh annotation in the video what did I did I do something wrong I still understand what I did wrong would I make a mistake in this video I'm not sure all right I see Simon Tiger is typing no I wrote off the screen I know but it's not so bad you know you can mostly still see this right it's just a little bit cut off how bad could it be I'm the worst I just do that constantly this huge area to write with it and I can see over there on a monitor where I'm writing and yet somehow I do that anyway okay all right okay so baby you watch the previous video maybe you didn't I don't know you're here right now I'm here right now I'm going to erase this I think because what I want to do right now is look at wait a second what was in the previous video might be kind of relevant here so what was in the previous video is this idea of how do I have to bubble objects communicate with each other how do I know if they're say intersecting or not and that could obviously be more than just the sort of like overlapping this of the object let me just start over because because why not I'm a racing over here sorry anyway you guys can't see me hello it is a bubble this in my previous video which you may or may not have watched I looked at how I could test if these two circles are overlapping it's not just about the math to look at if circles are overlapping well that's interesting of course the whole point of this was really to look at an objectoriented sort of technique for how I might write code that just checks if any bubble intersects any other bubble so I could say a bubble one intersects bubble two and if I had bubble four and bubble three or bubble cap bubble dog the so many possibilities but what I want to look at in this video is what if instead of two separate variables I have an array of bubbles maybe there are many of them some of which are overlapping some of which are not how do I check how do I check if let's say I call this bubble bubble egg b c d e f g h i j k l i just had to go through them all this bubble hey I have to check is bubble a intersecting BCD after yeah is bubble B I have to check if bobby is intersecting anything how do I check if every bubble is intersecting every other bubble oh okay let's look at that all right so what I'm going to do first is I'm just going to change this program to have an array of bubbles then what I'm going to do is I'm going to create maybe just ten bubbles to start with bubbles index I equals a new bubble and I'm gonna I'm gonna give them random locations and maybe a random size and I'm gonna have them kind of small ish and then I'm gonna make those bubble objects I'm gonna comment this out here and I'm now gonna say I'm gonna look at oh I don't know if I should do this in this video well I got to do this in a separate video I'm gonna make a separate video but you could go back and look up but there is a way a new way so this is a bad idea but I'm doing going through it anyway right normally I would write this code and I would just say bubbles index I thinking about this it's fine my videos are a mess it's fine that they're always a mess show bubbles I move so let's run this right now I'm gonna get rid of this boom so there we have all of my bubbles moving showing and moving showing moving I just want to say and I I will make another video about this specifically that I've been using this new loop that's also part of es6 version of JavaScript where I could just say 4b of bubbles b dot show b dot move so these are exactly the same thing let's just come how to do this ever video but tomorrow we're here while you're here with me maybe you don't want to click and watch it this is this idea that I can I want to iterate over every element of the array and every element of the array can be addressed by its index which is typically why I might have a counter like I to count through all the index values 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 but it's too common operation to do something to every element of an array and in fact there are lots of other ways to show you later that you can even do more with this that I can just make a variable be called B you know this could be anything cat of bubbles the point is this is every single this is saying for every element in bubbles put that element in this variable and then do some stuff and then go do the next one so you can see it's the same program the reason why I don't always use this is sometimes I want to only look at certain parts of the array I need the index value sometimes I need to move things around in the array delete them but in this case this is gonna make our life a little bit easier so I'm gonna go with it I'm going with it going with it whoo okay where am I still in this video so let's here we go now I have all of those bubbles how do I know to check if each one is intersecting every other one now here's the thing let's let's think about this I got let's pretend for a second that there's just one one important bubble which is a separate bubble so I'm gonna say something like let well I called it kitty no puppy unicorn rainbow unicorn there's a unicorn bubble and it's I'm going to put it in I'm gonna put it in the center of the window and I'm actually going to do a silly thing where I allow myself to just control it with the mouse let's make sure this works right weird that oh and I've got to also this is too what am I doing here lost my mind but I've got a show and move ah there's a point to what I'm doing it's going to make sense in a minute stay with me here so you could see look at this look at this bubble that I'm moving around there's one separate bubble that's outside of the array that I happen to be giving the mouse location so what if I want to check if this bubble is intersecting any other bubble let's take a look at that so I'm going to do this if unicorn dot intersects B this is now saying hey I want this special bubble unicorn to check if it's intersecting anything in that array anything in that array they just knocked this camera okay then if so in by the way what's convenient here is I have yes I already have this function change color which I used in a previous video so I can use repurpose that function change color so if it's intersecting that bubble to change its color so let's change its color to 100 otherwise change its color back to zero so what I'm doing is I'm saying if the unicorn intersects the bubble it's got a different brightness than if it does not intersect that particular bubble and look you can see cuz I should pick that brightness a little bit higher so you can see here right there we go so you can see this is working but this is different than me checking all of these bubbles against each other hmm how am I going to do that so what I need to do is right I actually don't want anything to do with this unicorn so let's comment this unicorn out but the unicorn served a purpose because it shows us right here that this is what I want to do for every B and bubbles show it move it and then check if it intersects and really a different way to write this that would have made more sense is this and what I want to do is say don't check just that unicorn check every other B every other bubble so what if I had another loop in here right there's another loop just look at this for a second right for every bubble show it and move it then go through all the bubbles again and check if that bubble is intersecting any of the other ones ooh it's tricky yeah I feel like I need to just pause and breathe for a second but this is new to you this is this idea of a nested loop and I feel like I want to go over to the diagram and I want to try to redo that diagram for a second I think I've lost which pen was the good one timeout for a second start this diagram over again we use these paper towels more you find the good marker which one was it so this one over here yeah okay or this one both of these are pretty bad actually but I'm gonna keep the second one let's try this again I'm just gonna have four bubbles a B C and D I want to check is a intersecting B C or D is be intersecting a C or D is C intersecting a B or D and is d intersecting a B or C here's the thing though even though this is what I want to check I just sort of intuitively did something here which is what I said is that I don't want to check if a as intersecting a but really what I want to do code wise is I want to do this I want to have a check off for then B check off for then C check off for the D check off for but I want to make sure I ignore when it's checking against itself and then of course we could optimize this even further which maybe I'll do at the end of this video right if a is checking B C and D B doesn't really need to check a again but that's only for this particular case there could be other instances where we want to check a versus B and B versus a and that means something different so let's come back over here and see what I mean here so first of all I want to make sure that B does not equal not equal other so what I want to do is like okay I want to check if B is intersecting every other bubble as long as B isn't checking itself so that the process actually isn't gonna work it's sort of gonna work but not gonna work now I'll explain you I think the logic here is quite sound in terms of the the two loops but the change color is a bit of a problem so let's run this and see like I'm not seeing anything change color why not well let me do something here let me at least let's comment out this this part so what I want is I'm only going to change color I'm never gonna change back so you can see what's gonna happen now is any two bubbles that intersect each other come on bubbles you can do it there we go they change color but as they separate they stay so this is an added layer of complexity that I probably should have anticipated what it started making this video and I no way I could stop here and there might be but since we're doing this I think we've got to solve this problem I'm here you're here you can go on do something else if you want to solve this problem how can I now have them turn off when they are when they are not intersecting so here's the thing what I want to do is I need to decide I can't decide whether I want to change the color to black or white right in here and why is that oops and why is that the reason is let's consider this case where a and C are overlapping and that loop what it's doing is it's saying is a intersecting sorry is a intersecting a well no don't change the color because they're equal is a intersecting B well no don't change the color because they're not intersecting is a intersecting C oh yeah change the color change the color they're intersecting okay well we're not finished yet is a intersecting D no no they're not change it back to black because that else doesn't know that the previous one was intersecting so this is an issue right so because I'm looping through with an else here if unless it's the last one I happen to check the hole that last one is gonna change it back to black so what I actually need to do is do this kind of trick and I'm sure there's a more elegant way of doing this but just for right now I can say I'm gonna just say let overlapping equals false so I'm gonna assume it's not overlapping anything I'm gonna assume it's not overlapping anything then I'm gonna check all of them and if it's overlapping at least one I'm gonna say true what's fun about this is I could actually like the more its overlapping I could add up a number or something I'm gonna check if it's overlapping at least one set overlapping equal to true once I've done checking everything now if I'm if I do get overlapping then I can say B change color 255 otherwise B change color zero so this is a little bit of a goofy piece of logic that's associated just with this particular scenario but it's still your the core idea here is that I have this nested loop I want to check this bubble every other bubble okay so let's run this again and you can see it let me make the bubbles let me make more of them let's make twenty of them and you can see that if it's intersecting any other it is it's lighting up if it's not it's it's it's that it's not lighting up so this is complete there are some things here to change and I'm gonna just talk them through for a second and then I'll decide if I'm gonna implement them so one is is there a way maybe it would make more sense for me to somehow I think it would make more sense for me I kind of want to do this for me to put this overlapping variable inside the bubble object itself why can't it keep track of that and it could keep track of that and based on it it could just call the show function with the appropriate the show function itself could set its color potentially so that way I get rid of all this extra gobbledygook code over here and I'm left still just with the B dot intersects other so that's one thing I could do the other thing that would be interesting to try is is to see if I could reduce the amount of checks right by just checking a versus B C D and then just B versus C and D C just versus D that's actually all I need and that could actually be it doesn't really matter in this case but I really should finish this video but so okay so those are two things I lose camera it off those are two things now I forgot what I was thinking those are two things oh yeah those are two things one of those things probably what I would really want to do and need to do is go back to having the index so as an exercise that you might like to try is rewrite this code with an I counter and a J counter but you'll notice is you can start the J you see if you try this right a lot of comments I should make another video to solve this and maybe I will but so that would be interesting to look at right you need to go get the counter because you can start if I is for all of the bubbles I'm checking I can start J wherever I left off the other thing that's kind of an issue here is the following let's go make let's make these bubbles really small and let's let's add 200 of them that looks like it's working let's add 2,000 of them okay it cannot even come close let's it's it's let's add a thousand of them let's just go back to that soap that was too extreme so you can see how slow this is now you might be thinking I was just slow to draw a thousand things which is true but let me show you something here what if I take out this whole thing about intersection it's got no problem animating a thousand bubbles the problem is in this algorithm if I have to check every bubble against every other bubble if there are three bubbles that's nine checks if there are ten bubbles that's 100 cycles 100 checks if there are 100 bubbles 10,000 just doing my math there fours again look this went up by a factor of 10 but this went up by a factor of 100 and with 1,000 bubbles suddenly I have to do 1 million checks so there are there are ways around this and there are algorithms for bidding or they have fancy beams and quad trees and someday I'll have a link in this video's description to some tutorials where I go over how to make this stuff more efficient but one of the things you really got to watch out for is this every object check every other object is an N squared problem as the number of bubbles increases the number of computation cycles increases by the number of bubbles squared so so this is something you really do have to watch out for this can get quite slow and again someday description maybe I'll have a link to something which shows that more efficiently all right I'm gonna stop I'm gonna be I'm gonna stop at the end of this video and if some of these little tidbits and things are kind of interesting and important I will do them in a followup video ok good bye alright my screen went off over here cuz I don't have to I need to power things oh ok um hold on sorry this computer that had the slack chat just died I'm gonna try to plug it in so people are asking an interesting question the chat which is like well can I just check if things are within a certain range from the bubble well how do you know if things are within a certain range of the bubble oh just check all the bubbles to see which ones are within that range well are you checking all the bubbles so there there's a way of being able to kind of register bubbles in different areas of the screen and then reducing the number of checks you need to do based on where they're pre registered so to speak sorry I'm kind of opening this computer back up oh the battery died on this compute Wow oh that bubble oh did I not do slette oh this is supposed to have let in it I'm so sad this should really have let I just kind of like forgot to put that in there I should really declare it oh yeah shoot alright um I don't know much just see if it's good like magically get spliced back into the middle of video somewhere or just right before the end I doubt it this computer is totally crashed I can't get the slack this is completely frozen sorry everybody just give me a second here sorry everybody I'm just kind of trying to get this other computer back up and running yeah today's JavaScript's 22nd birthday did not know that oh pretty stay ok old I'm just looking through this okay so how am I gonna fix this how am I gonna fix this okay so one option is oh maybe I could do the thing that I've always wanted to do well let us thank everybody just give me a second here this is ridiculous poor about you this is gonna be so entertaining let's just temporarily turn off that okay okay no no a better idea this is a terrible idea little behindthescenes moment here problem is I can't get the let we'll see we'll see let me just try this is probably not gonna work well you guys will be entertained nonetheless oh hello you're wondering why that video just stopped and I appeared again it's because I did forget something important and I'm gonna add it into the code but when I use this new loop with 4b of bubble I really forgot to declare be using let otherwise it kind of like JavaScript just speak which is again oh sorry sorry sorry I had to stop that video I made kind of a mistake that's sort of important when I use the new loop where I said let B of bubbles I forgot to declare no no four four four sorry everyone I just have to pause this video for a second and come in to correct a kind of mistake that's here when I use this new loop for B of bubbles I forgot to declare B and say for let B of bubbles that would really be much better and um hold on hold on hug setting setting settings what am I talking about right there should I say for let go back to here and but it's not actually in the original video I will add to the code when I upload it just so you know okay bye enjoy watching us in the video okay so yes that's one possible way to correct it one possible way record scratch yes I don't have a record scratch on I thought somebody sent me a breaking news sound effect but it was kind of like generic what I want is like coding training breaking news right now to do something like that anyway I really need someone to just like become the sound person for this I did more music I need better sound effects it's all awful but okay hold on we come back here and we give Mathieu a second option to correct how do I turn this back on there we go second option there's a weird jump cut in this video because I just coded this but I forgot something in poor wait hold on I'm gonna because this overlapping stuff is actually not in that part of the video so what I'm gonna do is there's a weird jump cut in this video because I just coated this new loop and I forgot something important which I really should use let to declare the variable that's going to stand in for all the elements of the array so that's a correction there it'll be in the code when I upload it but as you go back in the video you won't see it there that's another correction option and then I can't think of an F let me put it in and the other option will be just at the very end I'm still here shove it the video hasn't finished yet because all the while I did make kind of an important mistake which is that I in this loop here even which is other is a variable that's standing in for every element of the array that variable really needs to be declared using let so that it is local to the for loop otherwise I could run into problems okay so now I am actually at the end of this video unless I come up with another correction and I'll see you in a future one ah I'm forgetting the outer loop wait don't go is also heated here oh the whole time I've been doing this with the outer loop that's what a terrible yeah I finally saw that another quick option is TG hi oh my god I can't go back and redo all those Corrections I'll just do one for the end that's probably what we're gonna end up another day I'll use my crazy record scratch I stop and reenter the video but let me just do one at the end okay this video there's not over because I have noticed some pretty fundamental mistake here worth in both of these loops right for B of bubbles where B as a variable that stands in for every bubble in the array just like if I'm gonna say for let I equals zero I is less than bubbles dot length if I'm doing a loop like this I really need to declare that variable B otherwise it could be it could mistakes bad things could happen so I should have let B here and then of course I'm doing this again he or I should say let let other of bubbles there so hopefully you didn't spend too much time screaming at your viewing device while you're watching the video and there it is at the end here okay thanks very much all right all right so I'm doing a bad job of saving these as separate versions oh well you just let me try something I'm gonna do a copypaste and don't everybody start telling me that I should be using git and github I'm not gonna commit all my changes live tutorial settings I use those tools for myself but what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to undo this all the way back to what it was at the end of the first video whoa maybe it doesn't go back that far oh yeah it does yeah look at this it's like everything I just did in Reverse okay so I think this is it now whoops what happened to my browser but well one is not too fine a couple more changes but I will just oh shoot so this is now the end of the first video okay and now what I'm going to do oops now I just need to save this code so when I get uploaded later desktop post seven on this it's very low I'm gonna do come on copy this thing copy then this will be seven point seven come on seven point seven and then I'm gonna go grab this code can put it in sketched yes for seven point seven so now I should have seven point six is this example and seven point seven oops that's not where I wanted to leave it I should fix that now what do I want I want like 50 of these 10 50 or maybe 20 of these there we go okay so that's where I'm gonna leave it okay so those things are done now guess what everybody happy times are ahead okay I'm looking at the chat oh I should do let me do that video right now where's that going to go so this is going to get inserted in oh the numbering is gonna have to change is that bad if I'm going to actually do a video where I explain that other loop that would have to go that would have to go this would have to go what is an array arrays and loops arrays of objects I guess I could put it here oh boy that would renumber I mean this is a big deal to renumber all these things I could also make it like 7.3 B 7.3 B what happens in this video yeah let's look at the code for that one 7.3 arrays of objects right this would make sense for me to just do that right here I probably shouldn't have done it in that other okay let's let's let's call this 7.3 B what is this called by the way ah come back computer like in Java when this new kind of this new kind of loop came out in Java is called the enhanced forloop so let me see if I could find it JavaScript of loop for of okay so it's called the for of loop for a variable of iterable okay yeah we're gonna do this is like seven point three point one or seven point B or whatever this is gonna be one of my record short videos I could just see the money falling from the sky would I make lots of oneminute videos that everybody watches dying it's really not gonna happen it's a nice idea that okay I could also do it before I even get to the objects but I'm gonna let's do it let's do it here okay would be coming from the phone we go back 7.3 hold on I really a drives me crazy get rid of the sound library I'm here to tell you about something that's kind of exciting that I really should have known about when I made this video but it's new to me and it's now gonna be new to you or maybe you know about already but I'm gonna show you this new loop in java script called for of so that's what I'm gonna call it for of so very very often the previous example that I just made right this happens all the time all the time in programming hey I'm kind of an array of things let me count through the whole array to act on everything in the array and this can happen with arrays of objects like I want to move and show all these objects it could happen with arrays of numbers like ah let me double all the numbers in this array or let me add up all the numbers in this array and there's actually other ways of doing that too that I'm going to get to in other videos but what I want to show you here is the for of loop so really what this is saying here is for every bubble in the bubbles array the problem is I think in already meant something else in JavaScript or each always meet some there is a for each thing so so I'm speculating here but I imagine the the when this feature came into JavaScript we the developers needed a word to pick and that word is of so what I'm actually going to say it's like this bubbles index I stands in for every element of the array bubbles so I can actually do the exact same loop by saying for let every bubble of bubbles and then bubble dot move whoops not bubbles and bubble show now one thing so this is what I want to emphasize here these are exactly and I'm gonna step to the side here these are exactly the same no it must look perfect on the screen right this is me counting with an index to address every element to the array and moving and showing them this is me just saying hey JavaScript I don't feel like counting today could you take care of this for me just give me every single bubble in order in the array bubbles and move and show them I'm gonna do things in later videos where I start deleting things out of the array or maybe I only want to use half the array then those are cases where I really need that counter there are often cases where the counter plays a role but if the counter doesn't play a role they just want to do something to every element this is what I could do now what I don't love about this and this is I do this all the time and lots of programmers do this is I have a class called bubble that's capital B down here I have an array called bubbles lowercase B with an S on the end plural because as many and then I have bubble which is like an individual bubble in the that's every bubble of the array so I just want to emphasize that this could just be called you know if the bubbles names were unicorn this is just a madeup variable name it is the word that stands in for every element of the array and so like I could say let element of bubbles for example you know and so but this is kind of a convention that I could adopt the class the type of thing is capital B bubble when I have an array of that I'm gonna call it bubbles with an S when I have an individual one I'm gonna call it bubble but there's no reason why you have to call things that way I could call this bubble class single bubble bubble array that kind of thing so that's really it I'm gonna use this I'm gonna use this kind of loop in other videos and then I guess I can reference back to this one when I do hopefully this made sense I'm looking around to see if anybody has any questions but you are in the future I don't even know who you are watching this video but you are there someday watching this video I'm probably not standing here anymore I'm somewhere else this video has ended for each yeah I don't like the for each I don't know why I don't like the for each I have a problem with for each everybody knows about my fear for each okay I don't think to be honest I don't think this video needs a code example please stop using semicolons no never stop using semicolons oh I'm even an add arbitrary extra semicolons for no reason okay so let's get out of here and I've got one more of these objects videos to do Wow everybody is using this Thank You Nolan using the AI from what's the YouTube thing that it has that's like the chatroom tip jars very kind of you all thank you I know you want to see the boys cry it's kind of work it on me but alright for each isn't so bad with arrow functions oh you're so true super chat thank you so my purse I don't know I don't have a preferred way I guess I'm gonna leave the super chat thing enabled it is a way that people can make a onetime donation if you're feeling so inclined I also do have a patreon I have been considering looking at some other platforms actually but I don't want to get into that right now okay so here we go now what I need are I need what I need is a small collection of public domain or creative common license licensed images ideally with transparent backgrounds like a bunch of flowers a bunch of kitty cats where can I find that where can I find that how many people are watching by the way I haven't checked that in a while these days though I can't see it doesn't show me on this page I am I not signed in here okay thank you sorry I didn't have my YouTube dashboard page up where it tells me how many people are watching and that sort of thing ah the meth you got the meth meth method channel that those are great videos yes yeah oh yeah sorry I lost my train of thought [Laughter] alright I think the for each loop is perhaps a bit more powerful in that you're actually having essentially a callback function for every element whereas the four of is just a way of addressing each element so you know I think for what I'm doing here this is much more readable than for each but maybe I'm also just not so I guess the for each way would be for each no no no bubbles for each and then I could say be something like but like something like that would be for each but I'm just kind of a more of a fan of this okay I'm not ready to get into that yet alright let me see Oh both those bubbles alright okay so I need some images anybody got images for me alright images let's see what did I use in olden times I deleted those so what did I use back in the previous tutorials p5.js if I go to seven we needed the objects and images oh I just used these flowers oh so where did I get them from I could just use these again so people are asking about so you can actually contribute subtitles via YouTube if you want and I'm very grateful that people sometimes take the time to do that it's my goal to have all the videos captioned to make them more accessible not to mention translate into other languages if that's possible alright what about your kittens from the browser extension video thank you good idea so let me go to Chrome extra extensions kittens kittens alright we're going to gonna get some kittens here Oh everybody bear with me for a second so now I need to go back to oh seven and we make kittens Pam let's let's let's get the essence of these kittens boiled down just sighs I would have liked to have some transparent let's just do it like 100 there's a kitten there's a kitten another one and here's another one and oh they're not gonna be circles anymore that's fine whoops there's another kitten whoops I've got some extra unused unnecessary pixels there and just sighs whoops whoa did I just make that a hundred inches or something yeah whoops sorry you know the camera just went off okay now kitten one whoops kitten zero kitten one kitten getting three kitten before okay so now I have a bunch of kittens maybe I'll just start from mmm trying to think here what makes the most sense maybe I will go back to Mouse interaction with objects arrays of objects mmm what's going to be the best one to turn into oh yeah let's do this one okay so let's do a mouse interaction with objects and this one's going to be us this one's going to be seven point eight images okay let me just look briefly what did I do in the previous tutorial video that was there this one is because I loaded them all right did I use preload here yeah okay all right I got it everybody don't worry everybody everything's going to be just fine images and images let's get rid of the sound library kittens and now I need to put in the kittens folder inside here okay all right so one thing I want to do is try to decide whoa Pete image in the slacker just gave me a great category flowers with transparent background hours with transparent background do I dare move away from the kittens all these were such nice flowers with transparent background what about kittens with transparent background kittens with transparent background I don't know do I need to strawpoll the kittens versus the flowers this is definitely a really important good use of our time don't you think I'm gonna stick with the kittens because I have them already and I will mention I will grab let flowers oh it just got a little dizzy there let's grab one of these I like this cactus flower image and flower dot PNG no no no no not the webpage silly goose save image flower dot PNG and I'm gonna start them all as flowers and when you click on them they turn into kittens hasn't how to get to be 415 already I just don't get half an hour organizing directories of images of kittens and flowers I'm very sorry it's time I think to take out sponsor break as you know coding train is sponsored by water if you don't drink it you might die something like that okay mmm don't chew this okay oh I can do it I can write this code in a way that will make sense to people and be useful to somebody someday in this world hello I think at this point until I make some more this is the last video in this section about arrays of objects and one of the things that comes up a lot especially when you're first learning to code is with p5 and doing graphics animations and everything I've been doing pretty much in all of these videos has just been with shapes and so as you can see here here is one of the examples arrays of objects where when I click on the click on them they change color this is one of my previous videos but I want to look at is what would it take to have each one of these circles each one these objects display instead of a shape an image a JPEG or a PNG that I load a file that I load and how could I have the same object so how can I make a bubble class where each bubble displays an image but each bubble displays a different image so the first thing I'm going to do is just change all of these into flowers okay so I have a directory app I have a directory of images associated with this project I'm going to go over to my code and it looks like this it has a bunt it has one image in it called flower dot PNG and has a bunch of other image is called kitten jpg the reason why I'm making this distinction is PNG as a format for images that allows for transparent pixels and that's something that you're probably going to find very useful when designing and using images in your code that you can have an image not just be that sort of like rectangular thing but rather have part of the image be transparent so okay so let's first I'm going to one of the things if I want to load an image into p5 there are a variety of ways to do it and I'm sure I have other videos in the future even though I'm in the future but I made in the past but are further ahead in this playlist where I look at this more specifically but a quick way to load me yeah it seems a little bit silly like oh there's a preload function set up is the function where all the code at the beginning runs well I want to load images at the beginning to use I should use those in setup but there's a funny way about JavaScript the way that it loads media files in large data files is that it those it could take a while for those things to load so the preload function is a way of saying I'm gonna have a variable I'm gonna call it flour and in preload I'm gonna say flour equals load image flour dot PNG and this could be double quotes or single quotes they mean the same thing I'm kind of like I like single quotes these days so this right here is saying hey I know you're about to set up a p5 sketch before you do that I want to have a pre setup to the setup where I want to load this image so this will guarantee that the flower image is ready to be used by the time you get to setup now the rest of our work is really as simple as if I have this image that data from that PNG file stored in this variable flower I can just go all the way down to my bubble object and look here this is where I draw the draw the bubble as a circle so I could just get rid of all of this code and I could just change and use this function called image so there's a function in p5 called image which says hey I want to draw an image to the screen just like I want to draw an ellipse at this dot X this dot y now I want to draw an image at this dot X this dot Y so now all I've done is load that image and preload in a global variable and then draw that image here in the show function so let's refresh and okay so what does this error file not found I forgot that I put the images in this directory called kittens so I need to make sure I reference that directory now note I also need this directory to be part of the same directory where my index of HTML and sketch a stuff is so there can be some nuance here in to where you store your your image files but in this case I just need to make sure I include the folder name kittens / flower dot PNG and now if I do this we can see look there my bubbles aren't flowers now there aren't different sizes and so if I wanted to I could you know kind of go a little farther with this and I could use this variable R and I could give make that the width and height of the image so one thing to realize here I'm looking over there to see if I can use my whiteboard which I'm about to but I have to go erase it first hello talk amongst yourselves well I'm so happy to be done with this the problem with this is the next time I'm going to use this for my courses although you know ok it's ok such as this Sisyphean task of teaching JavaScript where's the marker hmm where's the one good marker maybe this is it so when I drew a circle when I use the ellipse function and I I have this variable called this dot R I actually assign that it's a poorly named because it's it's assigned to the diameter of the circle a rectangle or a square which is a rectangle of equal sides if I have the X Y here this is its width and this is its height the reason why I'm bringing this up is because the image function I switched from ellipse to image but it would be almost a better example if I were switching from rectangle which requires an X a Y a width and height if I were switching from rectangle to image which also requires an X a Y a width and height the only difference is fill that rectangle with pixels from some actual image like flower so this is really what's going on so I can manipulate the size and that sort of thing I'm not gonna worry about that too much and I'm just going to leave it I'm gonna just simplify this example but let's just show it to you with our in there you can see now they're all different sizes I'll leave that in there why not okay all right so now what if what I want to do is click on these and have them change transform from a beautiful flower to a butterfly because we all know butter flowers transfer okay I have kids too a kitten I have her kittens so okay so I do have this clicked function changes the brightness let's just first make this work I think is actually complicated time out let's put some kittens okay I gotta keep going this is fine let's back up a second and what I want to do now is I want to instead of having each image be that each bubble object be the same image I want to pick an image of a kitten so I'm now going to add an array called kittens and what I'm gonna do is in preload I'm gonna say kittens index 0 equals load image kittens kittens 0 dot jpg so you can see here right I could do this right I got it and I had five of them so here's the thing this is pretty horrible what I want to be able to do is then if I have a whole bunch of images and they're named in some consistent way what I actually want to do is could I write a loop to load all of these so instead of having three images loaded into an array 0 1 & 2 could I write a loop and one thing that's interesting is I can do this very easily with something called string concatenation thanks excuse to bring that up in here so as you might know two plus two equals four however a plus B equals the string a B or Cao plus Bell equals cowbell so when you use the plus operator with text it joins the text rather than the plus operator with numbers adding the numbers and the reason why this is so useful is what I can do here is I can write a loop for let I equals zero I is less than how many kitten images do I have I think I had five I can see them here 0 1 2 3 4 at 5 5 I plus plus then I can just take this line of code put it here I can say kittens index I equals load image kitten now I don't want to load the zero kitten into each one well I could do that now for just testing but I'm gonna keep moving on I want to load this plus oh and there's a new way to do this there's a new way to do this in es6 I'll come back to that the end of this video if you're interested now this is a bold way that I can add the I in between I can say take this string kitten / kitten join it with the value of I which is 0 1 2 3 4 and then add dot jpg to the end and that will load all of those image files into kittens now let's just make sure this works by going down here and saying something like kittens index 0 that's kitten 0 let's take a look at kittens index 3 that's kittens index 3 okay so now how do I have each object have a reference to a different kitten very important so one thing that I think that I want to have I'm gonna get rid of this brightness thing this brightness was from a previous example what I want to do is have an image associated with each bubble object so why not say this dot image equals or this kitten equals what image so when I make a bubble I want to say I want a bubble to be at this X location and this Y location with this size and I wanted to use this particular image so what that means is I need to now up here I need to pick one of these images now the let's say I want to pick a random one the nice thing is if you have an array in p5 I can just say kitten equals random kittens this random function if I give the random function in an array it will pull out a random element from that array which is one of those random kitten images and put it in this variable and then I can pass that in so this is me picking a random image then passing it into the object and then the object receiving it and putting it in as a property and then what's the last step I need to make sure I draw that particular kitten image all right let's see what we got here yay look lots of random can now it's hard to see them because they're so small so let's make these kittens bigger there we go so you can see ya have a bunch of getting objects I could I'd do the thing where I click and I add new ones or I delete them but let's have all these kittens every time I click change to a new kitten so we already had this hole clicked function and I'm saying if D is less than this dot R why not just say this image this dot kitten is a new random kitten so we could see I could always at any moment pick a new image to store into that bubble objects image variable and so now oh and this is bad though this did this is for checking that funks that that is math that I had left over from before is checking to see if the mouse clicks inside of a circle and since the image is actually a wreck why don't we make those flew back to flowers because the nice thing about the flower is it was kind of like circular thing inside whatever but I could change this code I could change this code to say if P X is greater than this dot X and P X is less than this dot X plus this dot R and P Y is greater than this dot Y and P Y is less than this dot y plus this dot R right what is all this crazy mumbojumbo that I just put in there what I'm at what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to say hey there's a point it's clicked is it in between this X well you can't see that this X and this is this location is X plus R and the Y is between this Y and this location is y plus R so I'm checking to see if the X and y the of the mouse is within those boundaries and once I've done that we should yeah look I could just keep making different kittens yay it's not a square it is a square it is a square it's not a square I don't know um so I've got something goofy here where I'm just you could clean this up and try different ways and what if I make it a flower and there's a circle better to check maybe I could just change it when I click to flower so these kittens are changing into flowers when I click on them and then if I click on them again oh they still are a flower so you can see the range of possibilities you could also make the argument here that maybe this whole picking the random kitten here and passing it in was kind of unnecessary because what I could have just done is right down in here I could have just picked the random the random thing in the constructor and that's also the same thing so there's lots of different ways of organizing the code depending on what you're trying to doing generally speaking I don't love the fact that I'm using flower here or kittens here because these are variables that exist outside the scope of the class and the class if it's gonna know about things outside of its scope should probably receive them as parameters to a function but that's neither here an error it's worked and is everybody asleep now thanks for thanks for watching this video and this is that's it now you can make all of your objects and all of your things that you're doing images okay everybody I think I've done it I have suffered through you have suffered through me finishing these intro to objectoriented programming with classes in p5 and those videos will hopefully serve help people in the future as they go through the playlist and get get more get more used to stuff ok so I want to make sure I do a coding challenge I think what we'll do I still have a little bit of a cold leftover hopefully that didn't blow out your ears oh the others who I forgot I forgot about that ok hold on there's gonna be an addendum does anybody tell me what that's called the Newton what it's like the way that you in es6 you use the back tick to concatenate a string I forget what it's called back tick JavaScript string so I have a name template literals why is it called up embedded expressions yeah yeah ok okay wait there's a bonus here at the end of this video and I'm looking around as if someone's gonna catch me I forgot I should probably make a video just about this but while we're here there's also a new way look at this and I was told by the way it's just given some nice advice about I shouldn't really be using the word join because that's kind of used another but this is string concatenation kitten slash kitten + concatenate with the value of AI + concatenate with JPEG but there's a new way to create strings from actual characters and variables in JavaScript and it's something called template literals and this is in lots of other languages but this is a new way to do it in JavaScript and it involves the use of the back tick so I put back tick here and back tick here get rid of this get rid of this now I don't want the pluses anymore so this this is just like a string it's a literal string literal this is a literal string kitten / kitten dot jpg but if I want to use a variable in there and why we're calling this a template literal I can put a variable in there with curly brackets and dollar sign and then the name of that variable hopefully I'm getting this right so this is a way of saying hey I want to have this string instead of having to use plus for joining the next thing about this I'm pretty sure it lets you do this over multiple lines too which is really really nice because with regular quotes you can't have multiple lines line breaks so this should work exactly the same way template literal ah so close what did I get wrong oh right thank you I made a mistake cuz by the way I don't actually know what I'm doing at all it looks like this the dollar sign I knew it will shoot a syntax highlighted that in some way the dollar sign is an indication like hold on a second I'm going to use a template literal and so now it's saying what's inside of here is variable name and we can see the syntax highlighting fixed which is good there we go now this is working and it's the same exact program I should mention well what if I really wanted to have so one thing if I just had like dollar sign in the string it's not going to think it's part of this unless the curly brackets are there and so if I really wanted it to be this I could probably like use an escape sequence or something but it's pretty rare that you're actually going to want to have this sequence of characters in your string okay so that's a little extra bonus piece at the end of this video maybe I'll make a special video just all about the wonder of template literals because that's what I'm sure everybody on the internet wants to watch and I'll see you in the future okay alright finally finished whew that's the sound effect I like better than the sad trombone okay I'm gonna leave that like this alright what is the tag oh you can do like an expression so you can actually evaluate code probably in there as well tag template little template oh all right multiline strings and you can use expressions yeah look at that fascinating nesting templates okay this is too much for me okay are we really am I really gonna do the game of life right now is it a good idea is that what's happening today let's look at my I definitely don't feel like doing the advanced array functions because I want to do something a little bit more creative and interesting this by the way this is what I got through so far really really getting through this list now people are people want to vote that's interesting multiline strings yes alright okay I'm gonna do a straw poll because why not well that was a good mapa game of life Boyd's let's try the straw poll well let's just do game of life versus boy I think yeah why not I don't think I don't think I should do the mapa right now I'll do that later challenge the reason why I like doing the game of life is because I could turn that into 3d automata do I say automata is it has that how you spell that's not how you spell Cellular oh you don't like program the whole boyd simulation thing from scratch alright let's give this a try I feel like if I put mapa in there it's not gonna get the votes and it's gonna sew here and I may or may not choose to listen to you but it's useful information big screens yes no no I'm okay I got to get over there but it's only if it's for 40 I'm okay still Thank You Dali for reminding me boy could be 3d that's a good point it opens up a big can of worms though in terms of like how to draw them whereas whereas Game of Life in 3d it's kind of easier just go from like a square to a cube did somebody post this in the chat LeBron camera sorry the mouse is covering so while you guys are voting I'm definitely gonna I'm gonna race this then I'm gonna go onto amazon.com and order myself a big box of white board markers what would you guys think about I've been looking at these glass systems where I could hang a big piece of glass right here and draw on it like this and then I would just like flip the video so I'd be drawing and looking at you and standing behind the drawing I don't know I kind of used to the whiteboard all right let's see where this is going here yeah interesting all right this is pretty clear to me so I have to remember the game of us so let me uh well oops you guys didn't see this looks pretty good let me look for a couple things John Conway Game of Life Scientific American great so there's this and then a game of life probably Wikipedia be a good place to have the rules right here oh I remember why I was gonna do those advanced array functions it's because I was gonna use them in this really it's not really that much that I need really map or reduce okay you still probably nicely you're just like set them randomly I'll skip that I'll come back to that okay okay yeah it's funny this is so funny to me that so many people are posting in the chat dogura LP just wrote didn't you already do Game of Life some time ago well the thing is I did not already do Game of Life some time ago I I'd as a coding challenge I do have it as part of my tutorial series and I mostly I get people asking me to do it so I thought maybe I would just do it as a coding challenge you know all right the volume is low oh I could definitely raise that did that just happen just an hour's it's been all the way patron group in the slack could you confirm to me that I should raise the volume the other thing I like about the game of life is it's a good it's ripe for user contributions volume is fine okay a refactor video okay that's fine okay great thank you thank you okay I've got I've got the message all right okay so okay so this I'm also going to refer to this was so this was my I wonder when I recorded this video a long time ago alright mmm let's see let me open up processing oh if I want to update the decode to use the new array functions later okay sorry I'm just um CA sorry I just thought wraparound simple very silly what I did in this example yeah this is probably gonna be bad for YouTube compression okay let's that's better maybe just slow the framerate down yeah I'm gonna do this in JavaScript I just was opening in the a processing example so I could make something nice and full screen well it's maybe I can just slow it down by not doing P 2d yeah this is probably pretty good all right all right oh wait I should probably get the code stuff ready the thing that I don't love about doing this in JavaScript is the whole 2d array thing is so awkward could just make it a 1d array and have a function always return the value with a given column and row I don't know it's a good question okay I'm gonna slow this down let's make this 24 that's pretty good yeah okay yeah Oh 3d arrays I think I'm gonna make a 2d version in 3d where you just look at it from above sorry everybody I have to go to big screen oh boy alright so here we are wait wait wait sorry I'm still not ready here okay all right it's time for a new coding challenge and today's coding challenge will be to make the game of life this is an example of the game of life that I made many years ago in the program environment processing it's going to run for a while I can click and kind of start over with a new random set of tiles now you might be asking yourself the question what is the game of life I'm not going to spend too much time on that in this particular video though I encourage you to look at some links in the description to find out some historical background what's possible all the kinds of variations and things you can do with it but it is an example of a southerner automata I keep that word wait automata I meant to like to sort this out for myself so I wouldn't have this problem pronunciation Oh I want to tell me automata okay automata oh we just start over and drink some water automaton I can't even remember now hello welcome to today's coding challenge in today's coding challenge I'm an attempt to program this which is the game of life simulation I'm gonna do it in javascript in the browser this is an example that I made several years ago running in the processing programming environment I'll also link to the code for this version so you might be asking what is the game of life well great question I I encourage you to check and read some of the historical background this is an article from Scientific American in October of 1970 by Martin Garden Gardner about the mathematician John Conway who proposed this cellular automaton a game of life it's an example of that wait no every time I say that word I freaked out like I sound stupid I'm saying the wrong thing like cannot pronounce it was interested in problem presented by me his first public appearance was it called a cellular automaton Vanner is that's more like Wolfram coined that term all right hold on hold on everybody give me one more chance I know what's missing oh hey hello welcome to today's coding challenge today's coding challenge I'm going to attempt to create this the game of life cellular automata simulation automaton photon please don't make me say that word ever again you can't pronounce it right someone is always going to complain I'm gonna just get it wrong example of a if it's an example of a flower you wouldn't say example of a flowers so it's an example of a cellular automaton which automaton that I can say this is the last I can't start over again hello welcome to today's coding challenge in today's coding challenge I am going to attempt to program this the game of life cellular automaton in JavaScript can we use the p5.js framework what's running right here right now is a processing example using the java programming language that i made several years ago as part of the nature of code book now if you're interested in that you can also look at my whole playlist about this thing that I can't try now how it's called cellular automata the plural of otamatone and I do have some videos that give you some historical background and looking at different on Wolfram's elementary CA and some exercises and things but I'm really just showing examples in talking about the systems in in those videos in this video I'm gonna try to just start from no code and finish with the simulation hopefully it's going to work it generally doesn't so okay your hopes up but I do want to say that yeah I would encourage you to do some background reading and this is the first Republic appearance of the gate the game of life as created by John Conway a mathematician from an article in Scientific American in 1970 by Martin Gardner of course you can always refer to the Wikipedia page I'm gonna need this which is it's going to in which where it outlines the rules for how the system behaves and you can also think that there's a lot of possible stuff there's all these kinds of interesting repeating patterns and different types of things that you could create and do with the game of life simulation but I'm going to program a simple version of it hopefully that will happen then at the end they'll talk about some variations that you might think about and maybe someday I will then try to like make one in 3d or something like that okay so let's get started here's what we need a cellular automaton is a system of cells that exists in a grid it could be in one dimension two dimensions three dimensions the game of life system is one that exists in two dimensions and the idea is that you have generations let me pause for a second while I just try a different pen here this one put them next to each other it was a terrible idea so if this is generation zero I'm gonna run some computation on this system of cells on a grid and then I'm going to have a new set of cells on that grid and that's going to be generation 1 so the cells that exists on that grid all have a state that's part of a CA system so that state could be a floatingpoint number it could be a kind of animal you could really imagine in a lot of different ways I'm gonna do something very simple with the game of the game of life is a simple system of discrete States 2 States 0 1 on or off alive or dead so you could imagine a configuration of this being something like this and for each time each tick each generation each frame of animation I evaluate each cell one by one and get a new state based on the previous state so let's say I'm trying to do this cell I need this cells new state I'm going to get a new state based on this state and its neighbors so what are its neighbors that's up to us to find it could be its left neighbour its right neighbour it's only its neighbors to its but in the game of life system its neighborhood are the eight cells surrounding it so it's this 3x3 area one two three four five six seven eight so I need to evaluate all those cells and decide whether it should stay as a zero or turn into a one and the reason why it's called the game of life is the rules the rules for how we move from one generation to another resembles some type of like biological process that you might think about population or about Tyrael growth and the idea is that a cell that is surrounded by neighbors that aren't alive cannot stay alive a cell surrounded by neighbors that are alive can can come to life or stay alive and a cell that's surrounded by too many neighbors cannot stay alive due to overpopulation and we can go back to the Wikipedia page and and read those rules precisely right here so any live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies as if caused by underpopulation any live cell was two or three neighbors lives on to the next generation any cell is more than three neighbors dies by over ovulation and any dead cell with exactly three name three line neighbors becomes a live cell so this is written as if by reproduction so this is written in somewhat of a confusing way I think I could simplify this I think we could say like let's say the cell is dead it's a zero it's only going to change to a one if it has three live neighbours then it changes to a one otherwise it stays a 0 a 1 it's gonna stay a 1 unless it has less than 2 less than to live and greater than 3 live then it dies so it so birth reproduction happens with exactly 3 neighbors death happens with fewer than 2 or greater than 3 now I don't know if I got those numbers right let's go check the Wikipedia page again thank you thank you I was videos I hit the sound effect by experience live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies yes less than two dies live cell with two or three neighbors Liz I don't care about that I'm not gonna kind of not care about chain and then it stays the same I can kind of ignore that live cell with more than three neighbors dies yep that's what I've got over there and then any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes alive okay so I've got those rules correct so now what do I need hello you're over there go back over here I need something I need a date all I need to make this program work is a data structure to store this grid and this is where I'm kind of having like a bit of a headache and I'm really not sure what to do the way that I've always done this in previous examples is by using something called a two dimensional array let's think I have a video tutorial about that somewhere which I will link to in this video's description but two dimensional arrays are kind of not so much fun in JavaScript they can become a little bit weird and there really is no such thing as a two dimensional array the twodimensional array is a construct of our own human mind saying like it's really just an array of arrays which makes sense this is an array you know each row is an array and then the grid is an array of rows or each column is an array and the grid is an array of columns so I think I'm going to do it that way with the twodimensional array I just should say that it's a little bit awkward two dimensional arrays in JavaScript but I'm gonna go ahead anyway so the first thing I want to do in this program is just make a twodimensional array that stores a random collection of zeros and ones so let's go do that I'm gonna go to the code and you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna actually just write a function I'm having like weird DejaVu I probably did this in another video somewhere I'm gonna just write a function called make 2d array and I want a certain number of columns and rows okay because that way I can just say I can have a global variable called the grid I'll call it grid and I could just say grid equals make 2d array and I could say I want a 10 by 10 grid so this is kind of what I want to do I'm gonna just farm out the making of the array to another function and right now I do remember doing this because I'm gonna write this in a kind of oh there's a whole like coding challenge or video I'm gonna do this in a kind of horrific way and then everyone's gonna like give me all these like amazing es6 JavaScript fancy ways of doing this function like one line of code someday I'll come back and do that okay so now so now let me see here so what I need to do is first is I need to have some sort of array and it's going to be it's going this is always where I get confused to do I want the columns the point of using a 2d array is that eventually at some point I'm going to be able to say something like grid you know index 2 index 3 and I guess I usually think of this as X & Y and X being the columns so I want this the outer array if I'm think about arrays of arrays to be every single column right every single no no that's what X is column right and then the why is everything a row ok so I'm gonna do that so I'm gonna make a new array of columns and then I am going to say for let I equals 0 I is less than that array dot length I plus plus make a array index I is a new array of rows again I know there are all sorts of shorter and fancier automatic functions for generating and configuring arrays like fill and map and reduce and all that kind of stuff even more so I'm gonna do this and then I am going to what I want to do here now is I also want to fill them with I guess I could fill it with values down here so I'm so maybe I won't maybe I'll actually just do that so this is going to make me an empty 2d array with nothing in it and then I think what I want is I probably want to have these global variables I know this is a little bit goofy that I'm doing this and then what I'm gonna do I could make enough and I'm gonna say let I equals zero I is less than columns I plus plus and then I'm going to do J is less than zero J is less than rows I'm going to do a nested loop so that I can say grid I J equals floor random two this is going to this is going to give me a nested loop this is a nested loop so I make this sort of like 2d array structure that's empty and then it iterate over every single column in every single row and I fill each one with a random number 0 or 1 and I'm just now I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna go back to I'm gonna go to my code okay cannot read property 0 of undefined well you know it would be nice if I actually returned that array so they make 2d a function alright it's making this array it's also got to return it so that I can get it back here and then now if I look at grid I'm gonna see it's an array of arrays and I forgot there's this wonderful thing you can do like console table grid which shows me now I can see it here so we can see this is that twodimensional array that's what it looks like it's a twodimensional array with rows and columns filled with zeros and ones so step one is finished now what I need to do is I need some mechanism to every frame of animation iterate over every single spot and set a new spot actually you know what I should do first I need to render this thing I want to be able to see it as a grid of red and blue squares are black and white squares or zeros and ones of the screens any number of ways you could render this I'm gonna do it in the traditional way of a grid the square the cell of the grid is black at the value of 0 is white of the value of or viceversa okay so let's come back to here so what I want to do is I'm going to now go to draw and I'm gonna create a canvas now I'm also going to do something to make my life a little bit simpler right now I am going to make the canvas of square I'm gonna make it 400 by 400 and I'm going to I'm gonna have I'm going I just need I'm gonna be using this oh I'm in the wrong place ah sorry everybody let me come back thank you for camera camera camera yeah I don't worry everybody I know I'm in the wrong place I just have to go back what did I just do take this out I don't think I had the draw function there okay okay I don't remember what I was saying but it'll get into somehow okay what I want to do now is I'm going to add a draw function and I'm gonna be using this loop over and over again I'm gonna add this loop right because I'm always gonna any time I want to look at everything I'm gonna go through all the columns and all the rows it's pointed out in the chat that there are some JavaScript libraries and packages that manage grid systems the neighbors for you be great to use those I'm gonna just do it all without that right now just to kind of like figure it out I'm gonna say background zero and I'm gonna create a canvas I think to make my life easier for the moment I'm going to make the canvas also a square and then what I need to do is I need to draw I want to draw a rectangle add an X and a y with some width and height and it's kind of they're going to be squares so some with and width and that value is going to be the width of the you I should probably calculate the number of columns and rows here's the thing I'm gonna redo the way that I'm doing this so I'm not gonna actually have a fixed number of columns and rows time out edit point Matias sorry kept it as cold as a pain not late to big screens yet am i if it's 545 I like really have to go I mean 530 I really should go I'm still livestreaming right okay okay I'm not gonna set out the columns and rows I'm actually going to do like a scale or I'm gonna just as you have a variable called resolution and I'm gonna say that's ten or forty I'm gonna say that's forty so that'll be ten by ten and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say columns equals the width of the canvas divided by resolution rows equals the height of the can canvass divided by resolution this way I can kind of dynamically you'll see what it I can dynamically make a 2d array based on how big I want the squares to be so the columns and rows are being calculated based on how big I want the squares to be and the canvass size and then I have that global variable resolution which is probably too long of a name which I can just use down here and now x equals I times resolution and y equals J times resolution and I'm gonna now say if grid I J equals one fill 255 and you know what since I made the background 0 I can actually in this case I can just draw rect white rectangles only for the values of one so let's see I probably got something wrong here but let's try to run this nope I didn't so we can see there we go now there's some goofiness like oh it's sort of like my math is a little off and I what's this weird like nonsense over here flickering I kind of feel the need to fix that and the other thing that I can do that this is going to help is if I make this 600 by 400 and I make this like 20 right it still works and now this is driving me crazy I think what I want to do is it's there's a sort of issue with the stroke so I do I want us also say stroke to 55 yeah there we go that'll do for now sorry oops there's a little bit of an issue with how this looks due to the stroke so I could say I could also say stroke to 55 and then I'm getting something just but I don't know designwise I'm not gonna worry about that too much actually I kind of like being able to see the grid so let me actually put in stroke zero and then I'm gonna do something kind of goofy which is I think if I say just draw the all the rectangles like one pixel less whoops I think I'm gonna get the look that I want yeah so whatever there's countless ways I could deal with this but now I have I have the grid I have all the cells so so now it's up to me to simply implement these rules I need to for every single cell count the number of live neighbors look at its own state and have these rules play out here's the thing this is really important while I'm checking each cell I check this cell first let's say I cannot change its value and then go on and check the next cell because the next cells new state should not be dependent on this cells new state but its previous state and if I change the state I've lost its old state so this is where what I actually need is I need two twodimensional arrays one is the sort of old one and one is the new one now probably the simplest thing for me to do is just make a new one every frame this sort of like in some ways a bad idea in terms of memory management and if you look at my processing example that I referenced at the beginning of this video what I actually do in that example is I just have two different arrays I have an old have a new one then the new one has been the old one and I write the new one over here I just keep swapping them so I could maybe add that in at some point during this video but for right now at the beginning of draw I'm just always going to make a new generation so what I could do here at the beginning of draw is say I can say let I'm gonna call it next oh I mean the wrong I did it again at the beginning what I could do here why does that keep happening when I pressed the button change the camera the beginning of draw I can say let next for next generation equal make 2d array columns and rows okay now I'm gonna leave this here for the rendering and what I'm actually gonna do is at the end what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say I guess it doesn't really matter I want to like render first this is have like a philosophical deep philosophical question do I want to compute and then render or render and then compute kind of could matter in some situations this matte in this situation does really matter but what I would I the reason why is like I'm never gonna see the first generation because what I want to do is say grid equals next so basically the algorithm here is compute next based on grid because draw is looping so I want to compute the next generation based on the grid make grid that render and then compute the next generation based on grid make grid that render so I don't know that's bothering me I'm gonna do this I'm gonna do this after so at least I draw the first one and I'm gonna do some computation for the next frame okay okay so now what do I need to do once again loop through all of these loop through all of these now what I need to do is count live neighbors I need to count the number of live neighbors the neighbors that have one so I could do a kind of internal loop here and that would probably be a smart thing to do maybe I will do that where basically what I do is I say I have a certain I'm at a certain cell let me look at the cells between negative 1 and 1 and negative 1 and one offset from where I am I could also just do something really silly like I think you is a really silly thing first I could say let's sum equals 0 then I could say some plus equal grid I minus 1 J that would be the neighbor to the solo right if this is I comma J I minus 1 comma J is there I minus 1 J minus 1 I J minus 1 that sort of thing so if I'm thinking about this I might like add go I could like manually put in all the neighbors just like add them all up this is like I'm going on going round the horn here right plus I plus 1 J plus 1 I sometimes I like doing ridiculous things like this just to figure this stuff out now I gotta go I minus 1 J plus 1 and then what's the last one I minus 1 J this should be 8 neighbors and right this is 8 neighbors one two three four oh eight one two three four five six seven what did I forget I minus one J minus 1 IJ minus 1 I plus 1 J minus 1 I forgot to do that whole top row and then I plus 1 J I plus 1 J plus 1 I yeah so this should now be 8 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 okay I kind of hate that I did this like throwing your tomatoes at your television screen because of course you're all watching this on the telly screen so this is the idea I need to add up all those neighbors let's do this in a loop so another way I could do it is I could say ah you have a better idea let's neighbors I have a better idea let's write a function to do this neighbors equals count I'm going to give it the grid and I'm gonna give it the I and the J so I'm gonna write a function I'll put it all the way at the bottom of my code that receives I'm gonna call it count account neighbors let's call it and it's going to receive some 2d array and it's going to receive an x and a y location and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say I equals negative 1 I is less than 2 I plus plus then so I'm gonna do a little nested loop using I and J around that spot and I'm gonna say let sum equal 0 and then I'm gonna say sum plus equals grid I J however here's a problem I don't want to count myself as a neighbor so there's a few different ways I could do this but it's a little bit silly I'm just gonna like subtract it at the end like I'll just subtract it out I could have like put an if statement here like ignore it if I equals X and J equals x but I'm just gonna subtract it out at the end and then I want to return that sum so this is you could see like a couple different ways of doing this right now this is one way to kind of do this what this is doing is it's saying let me do a little loop around here negative 1 0 the positive 1 negative 1 0 positive 1 so let me check this this this and then subtract this out cuz I don't really want to count that one ok so now I should be able to I'm gonna just delete this I've now counted all of the neighbors I've got a big problem what do I do with the fact that if I'm on the edge there's no neighbor to the left if I'm on the bottom there's no neighbor below if I'm the top there's no neighbor do they bother right there's no need if I'm on the edge there's no neighbor to the right so what I could do there's a bunch of things I could do I could consider this like an infinite wraparound world we're like this neighbor to the right is this this neighbor to the left is this I could there's other ways that I could proach what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna leave the edges as fixed values and just not bother to check them which is I so what I'm gonna do here is I am going to I wanted to do like I was gonna do this loop like this you know what let's do the wraparound do i no no let's do with the simple way first I was like Holly just add the wraparound cuz I could add the wraparound code here but let me know maybe I'll leave that as an exercise or do that later so the issue is you know what I really want I think then what I want the problem is if I change this loop so I have to I have to treat the edges differently oh so but so much heartache here but I I can say what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna say oh this is the drawing well all right this is the computation so I'm gonna say if I equals 0 or I equals columns minus 1 minus 1 or J equals 0 or J equals rows minus 1 these are this is like all of the edges I'm just gonna treat them differently I'm gonna say next i J equals grid IJ so I'm just gonna keep the same values from before this is not a great solution but it's a quick one that I can do right now so I'm if I'm o on an edge I'm just gonna use the same value because now what I could do is say look at this my state is grid I now it's time for me to implement those rules right okay if my state is zero and three neighbors are alive change my state to one if state equals zero and neighbors equals zero then next I J equals one okay that's rule number one if not not zero equals three okay now what else if I'm alive and less than two or greater than three or live then change my state to 0 else if my state is 1 and neighbors is less than 2 or neighbors is greater than 3 and I probably should put a little parentheses around that one and again I'm sure they're like some nicer ways I could write this in a more concise way but you can see this is the rule right if I'm alive and I have less than two or greater than three neighbors then the new state is zero in all other cases the next state is just the current is just the current state okay so and this makes me want to put this up here at the top so that I can also just use this here so that's the state right the state this is the current state if I'm an edge hey just ignore me on the same state if I'm not an edge count all the neighbors check if I should change my state or say the same I'm singing the chat there's a typo at neighbors in the first if thank you neighbors ok what's the chance I've actually finished this so there we go I think I have mostly all the code for it okay count is not defined sketch chacha slide 55 oh right because I called it count neighbors which is a better name for the function let's try that cannot read property negative one of undefined at count neighbors so what is undefined oh no no look at this this is a big mistake right what was I doing here this loop negative right this loop which goes which is basically a loop for like a little subsection right if this is x and y right i is an offset negative 1 to positive 1 j is an offset negative 1 it's a positive 1 the sells I'm looking at are not IJ but X + I + y + J because I'm just looking relative to where that XY point is so that was a big mistake here this should be X plus I Y plus J oh so close count neighbors at draw get 55 okay Oh see it's 955 count neighbors way will cannot reap repartee negative 1 of unto 5 what's undefined grid neighbors hmm okay hold on let's look at some stuff here okay grid it so hold on count neighbors let's just try grid 10 comma 10 okay so that works that cell has three live neighbours so I must be by accident looking at an edge right I must be looking at an edge by accident oh not minus one no yeah minus one or if j0 oh look at this I just keep going anyway so this I really I need to break out of the loop so this is really like I'm done leave the loop or continue or something I don't know I'm just gonna put an elf in here as much as I hate that so because I shouldn't be I'm basically doing the edges or the neighbors but this will be much nicer if I just in this function add some code to deal with a wraparound which is not going to be that hard to do so but now it should be good there we go the game of life now it looks weird because the edges aren't ever changing but this is actually now the game of life working I really got to implement this wraparound thing so let's do that now let's fix it so that the edges consider the other sides as neighbors so how do I do that well one way to do that is with something called modulus this is really this is great and I can refer you to goal on Levin's guest tutorial video on modulus which was made as part of this channel so I will link to that but basically I think what I want to do here on YouTube is basically what I'm saying here is if I have ten columns 0 through 9 what could and I'm always looking for the neighbor plus one right so 0 plus 1 is 1 1 plus 1 is 2 etc etc etc 9 plus 1 is 10 but I want the neighbor to be 0 well guess what 9 plus 1 modulus 10 equals 0 because modulus is the operator that gives you the remainder of division 10 divided by 10 is 1 remainder 0 so I encourage you to watch that modulus video if you're not familiar with modulus so this will actually work almost getting closer if I say I'm gonna just say like I'm gonna have a new I need like a new variable name for X plus I guess I could say column I don't like column and I'm gonna say X plus I modulus columns and Rho equals y plus J modulus rows so this gets me close it doesn't get me all the way there but it gets any close so now I'm adding it up like this and I'm gonna I'm gonna get rid of this whole edges thing because no longer okay so I've got to get this there now I'm gonna have an error here right I'm still getting like an out of bounds error because I'm going to negative one why because what if in the case of I equal negative one so what is its if if I is zero right so let me come to the console here ten modulus ten is zero but let's say I'm looking for the left neighbors so I'm going through negative one negative one modulus 10 is negative one but I need that to be nine I need negative one to be nine well guess what if I actually just add the number of columns to everything right if I'm actually working with the numbers instead of the numbers 0 through 9 the numbers 10 through 19 right 10 minus 1 is 9 modulus 10 is 9 so the formula is negative 1 is negative 1 plus the number of columns modulus the number of columns oh but that's not 10 there's a different numbers in my system but let me be clear about this what I want to do is I always want to take the value I add the number of columns to it and then modulus the number of columns and what this is actually doing and think about this for every possible location 10 11 12 13 14 15 I'm gonna go all the way up to 1910 yeah yeah it because I is 0 0 1 10 this is this is the result of I plus columns 10 module sorry X plus I plus columns right so if X is on the edge zero and I say negative 1 what did I make this confusing I'm not even on the right thank God thank God I didn't switch it because I totally just like that explanation was horrible so thank goodness I didn't switch the camera I'm so glad I didn't switch the camera hold on let me back up here anybody can have a screenshot for me what the whiteboard looked like a few seconds ago so I can erase it back to that point and it's half past no but I'm really close to done we won't be doing the 3d sure wait how long did I do that for I don't remember where I was does anyone is anyone in the patron group capable of looking at so this is what it is right now but before I before the last time that I was there what was it I'm waiting to see if because what was I don't remember how much I did oh wait thank you okay great so it was it wasn't fair as much okay I don't have to go back that far I was just like kind of doing it again so hold on I'm gonna look at this no that's what it is right now that's what it is right now I don't want this TMC gave you what it is right now I want what it was right unless I didn't add very much no but this was all my crazy explanation so I need what it was before so I know what to erase thank you for people in me I can't really see maybe I can't really see in the YouTube chat unfortunately easily I really appreciate that parsley though parsley just posted in the YouTube chat if someone can post that into the slack Channel that's an image great thank you okay this is good so I'm looking at this image right now and all of this stuff anybody know the last thing all this stuff is gone all right so this is looking exactly the same excellent thank you so the problem is I don't remember what I was saying all right whoops all right well I'm just gonna give this a try so this is what I was saying last here ah okay so let's let's try to confirm this again okay the idea is that I have an x and a y point so that point might be let's say if it's on an edge for example might be like zero comma it's on the left edge might be something like 0 comma whatever the Y is you know tip 5 so this is the x value and I want to take X plus I plus the number of columns modulus the number of columns I said oh this is gonna be simple but it's kind of this is really kind of like a crazy thing to do but you might write this out and practice it but on your own I say it will make sense to eventually so when this is going to work basically let's say I is going to be the values negative 1 0 & 1 right X is going to be the values 0 through 9 if I'm thinking about all the possible all the possible columns so let's just take 0 and negative 1 for example 0 minus 1 plus and in this case I have 10 columns plus 10 modulus 10 is actually 9 modulus which equals 9 so 0 negative 1 to the left of it that wraps it around to get the neighbor on the right right it doesn't work for just any arbitrary thing in the middle like if I take I to be 3 sorry if I take if I take sorry X to be 3 3 minus 1 plus 10 modulus 10 we'll see how this 10 intended kind of cancels itself out can you see that am i off the whiteboard I'm close to being off the whiteboard that equals 2 right because this is 12 modulus 10 is 2 so this actually works and then what if I'm on the edge if I'm at like 9 right if X is 9 9 plus 1 is 10 plus a number of columns is 10 is 20 modulus columns 20 divided by 10 is 2 remainder 0 0 so 9 to the right gets its neighbors 0 so this is kind of goofy it like shifts everything over so it can kind of look across the edge so I'm this is going to work you can believe me or not believe me but it's going to work and I'm gonna put this in so now what I want is X plus I plus columns modulus columns y plus J plus rows modulus Jo rows add those all up and the game of life thank you thank you for watching this study challenge thank you thank you so let's try and make you let's try doing a couple things just to get a little further here let's let's I don't know no I'm not gonna do you do all the next stuff I'm just curious like let me make the resolution 10 so we can see that's with the 10 so you can see it's running pretty fast in the browser I have a pretty slow low resolution so here's what you should do now I'm gonna stop this is a perfect opportunity for people watching this video to make some variations some things you can think about well one thing is what if you make each one of these cells an object so each state might not actually just be it can keep track of more than at state zero or one it could keep track of whether it's changed state or stay the same or how long it's stayed the same what if you visualize those what if you visualize with different colors based on the history of the system what if you allow a user to draw with the mouse and set cells on what if you look up some of these repeating special repeating patterns that you can create certain kinds of patterns what if you are you gonna think of more and what if you did the edges in a different way what if he cues to floating point numbers instead of zeros and ones and did like an average or something there are so many ways you can create a system lowering the resolution why don't you drew didn't draw squares but circles used images how can you visualize this system how can you change the rules or how can you visualize the system in a different way to create a piece of arch or for some other purpose I look forward to share what you make in the comments there'll be the code link from here and a readme where you can submit your versions and I'll come back in a future live stream I'll share some of the community made versions run this again there's one other thing but I do think that making cell objects is a path right right now I just have ona and you should probably do the swapping thing like maybe maybe that's one another thing you could do is like you really maybe not don't make a new 2d array every time but what I'm thinking about here is what if instead of each one of these being a random value you said something like new cell I comma J and this cell object can ki can animate it can move around the stem cells could move they could grow they could shrink they could keep track of their history there's so many possibilities there if you make an object for the cell okay thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed this coding challenge and you share with me what you make good bye um alright 540 okay everybody thank you very much I am oh I got to read some random numbers I don't remember where I was maybe I won't worry Brandon numbers today I'm happy to take some last questions I'm pretty good for about three or four more minutes so I'm going to people are asking where do I have to leave well one thing is I've been here for I know in the almost three hours now yeah homes three hours and a half three hours now so that's one reason why I have to leave but I'm also going to an event tonight called the big screen show doors open at 6 o'clock which is 20 minutes from now it will definitely take me at least 20 minute I can walk there but it's probably got half an hour walk and maybe I'll take the subway but if your dad would try to remember put some stickers in my pocket and then if you're there say hi to be say you were watching the livestream etc so I've only been here for two hours Simon no no I started at 230 p.m. Eastern it's 539 it's 540 Eastern athletes so I will be back next week I'm hoping to actually do three live streams next week if you can believe it it's important to me especially for the folks that are supporting me on patreon to try to do what I'm committed to for that support is for live streams for month and I think I'm a missed one in November and I missed one in the so hopefully doing a couple extra next week will catch me up so ODF ello sounds says that's a four minute walk right now so technically you're supposed to RSVP maybe you could just I think it's probably fine if you go anyway just name drop me say I said you could go and dfl Oh sounds if you actually do show up try to five you say hello okay oops alright so thanks everyone for watching today I am so glad to be back I feel kind of good about I feel like that coding challenge kind of went well does anybody have an estimate how long that was like do you think I was like a half an hour challenge think about the editing a little bit 20 minutes I don't know okay I thank you everybody for watching and I'm just checking here all right Oh wonderful Overmind that's wonderful if you want to translate all the videos to Portuguese I'm send me a message on twitter at Schiffman if you have a Twitter account so you could because when I get submissions on YouTube it doesn't tell me who submitted them 25 minutes relevant okay that's pretty good music video play the coding challenge video I don't know what that is Oh coming in January 2018 some videos on machine learning thank you everybody I'm going to click stop streaming now
