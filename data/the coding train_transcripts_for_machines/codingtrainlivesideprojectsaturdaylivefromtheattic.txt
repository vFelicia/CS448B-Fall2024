so uh good morning everyone we will get started in a few minutes i am this is my test of my mic uh let me know how i'm sounding um a little pouring of the coffee sound happening right now getting myself set up got some exciting stuff to show and going to mute let me know in the chat this is do and then as soon my code so welcome to welcome to the passengers of the coding train we'll be getting started in just one moment but thank you for your support and membership me do hello happy side project saturday on the coding train it's me and yo together i've seen green which means my mic is on i see a picture of me i see chat happening i think i might have started a live stream with no technical problems uh it's not gonna last it's definitely not gonna last uh i have so many things that i'm working on and thinking about and trying to do and yet no plan at all for today other than to hang out with all of you and chat for a bit um let's start with our ceremonial reading of the random numbers to get warmed up uh we have a new member um i would love to know the proper pronunciation of moyne khan's name um khan thank you very much for your just showing a little leg look at that i am wearing pants they're called shorts here uh in these united states where i live um in the land of brooklyn new york i don't know what i'm talking about moyne 16473 and let's get us started here twenty two thousand four hundred and eighty one forty thousand two hundred and forty sixty two thousand two hundred and twenty three fifteen thousand two hundred and ninety three thousand three hundred and forty two thirty eight thousand six hundred and eighty one twenty eight thousand eight hundred eighty two ninety six thousand lost my place 180 80 315 76 806. thank you this has been random numbers with the coding train i'll see you again next saturday wouldn't that be great that's what i should just do just like a two minute live stream i don't even know if it was two minutes there's a very loud noise over there and you might think it was like a rabbit or a raccoon or some sort of strange creature who's made its way into the attic with me but no it's my cat i have two cats i don't know which one it is because i can't see it there's a huge mess in this attic where i set up this streaming equipment i pushed everything to the side book is going back the music is muting and uh where i want to start with is by thanking today's sponsor which i don't necessarily do right at the beginning but i've got to do today because today's sponsor is letting me or allowing me or facilitating me or giving me the opportunity to show you a little behind the scenes of the coding train today's coding train is sponsored by lg yes lg life's good uh i have a button a new button it says lg on my stream deck i'm gonna press it i'm a little bit afraid i don't have the setup where like it shows me what i'm gonna show you first let's just go right into it there it is this is my new lg ultra wide 34 inch monitor you can find links to this monitor in the video's description and this has totally been a game changer for me um what i'm showing you here is my sort of con like i'm over here by the way hello um i'm showing you my console for where what i look at when i'm always like looking in this direction while live streaming this is a new setup at home and over here you can see this is open broadcast studio where you've got the uh repeating recursive video inside video inside video uh forever pattern um where i can kind of monitor my mic level down here if i were to play some music oh what it's not working i don't know why the oh oh i don't have the laptop audio added oh look i'm going to show you i'm going to add it right now this is what i do audio source audio audio input capture add existing laptop sound this was a new uh there we go and so now i can see the laptop audio uh i've got my um by the way my stream deck over here where i can just mute that laptop audio really quickly but i want to just turn it off um and then over here i am monitoring the youtube chat so for example uh i see that uh marcos says whoa look at that real estate yeah 34 inches of water it's like it's like mind blowing i need two of these actually i it's like so much that i just want another one maybe lg will send me another one ah it's okay one thank you mwah thank you for this one monitor um and uh uh saying yay coding garden is alive which i'm not sure if that means coding guardians live is that coding garden live also at the same time oh my god what is the cat doing i gotta go get that cat in a second do you hear it you can hear that rustling right what is the cat gotten into oh my god um uh i think someone confused me for the coding garden or maybe cj is live at the same time all right so i'm reading the chat um have you connected your laptop to your monitor yes so i also use this for coding um and maybe i'll show you that midway through the live stream i have a um i put up my like browser window uh with the javascript console hold on hold on something's happening is the cat stuck no he's in a box it's okay it's entertaining for the for the viewers they can hear you you know um i forgot what i was talking about uh and no i'm not talking to you i'm talking to the millions of people of the internet i know i'm sorry um what is going on here uh one of my cats chewed through a mouse wire once called said both xp that's not good um but wait i was showing all the pieces of my console here so i have the chat oh right you're asking about coding with it so when i use it for coding which i will show you i put up like the javascript console my terminal window all the different pieces of things that i need to look at while i am working on stuff and then i actually then my laptop which is here which you can't easily see but i'll pull it up i usually actually keep my code on the laptop and this is just my secondary display for all the debugging i have like i'll put like the p5 reference over here but anyway this side should just show you so much room for roblox says unoriginal and yes this is actually the main problem uh with having this monitor this is the sole reason why my children decide they insist on using this workstation because they want to play roblox only on this monitor uh and so that kind of drives me a little bit crazy and then they start unplugging and moving these around i have to reset everything up again it's kind of a nightmare but they did make this beautiful lego and i can also um not yet a sponsor show you my technivore mocha master which i will now pour into my cup um and um what was i saying oh and then i wanted to show you the discord chat so this is what's going on if you would like to become a coding trained member that's one way you can support the coding train uh well anybody can join the discord but i'm looking at a um live chat of discord over here and also i can see my little graph here on youtube studio of the concurrent number of viewers it says here that 574 people are watching with a chat rate of 34 blah blah blah see this graph is going up come on people let's have that graph go up so um just to mention a few other things about the monitor uh it is 34 inches 21 by nine do that math uh ip uh wq hd ips display it's a 99 color gamut i don't even know how to pronounce that word but i think that just means basically you can see every color an hdr10 uh multitasking dual controller onscreen control amd freesync technology a threesided you can see this virtual borderless design there's basically no bezel or border here at all um and it has this uh wonderful uh a giant a height adjustable stand that you can tilt and uh move up and down which i'm afraid to do right now for like breaking my whole setup all right so thank you lg um you can find links to more about this monitor in the video's description and maybe i'll try to do some coding on it a little bit later back to me uh so how are you all doing the cat was taken away it's very sad um and i'm like now uh let's see uh teach us coding now please says gabriel wood what kind of coffee are you drinking if you could believe this i forgot the name of the brand but something organic and it says on the uh it says low acid because you know i'm i'm a very sensitive soul i have a weak constitution and uh i really have to wash my caffeine intake and my you know acidic intake i don't know if it makes a difference but all right stretch stretch stretch let's start with sharing some uh oh wait oh no that's the wrong music projects from you the community of the coding train thank you for being you you are for making your own creative coding projects and or sharing them with me on the codingtrain.com website which i will now maybe show to you ah here is my laptop i am in the corner with my green screen um i do have kind of an issue that i wanted to ask about let me just pause this for a second so because we've got this like nice little extra camera for today if i go back where i was showing you the monitor um i can also sort of move to the side here and you can see that's my green screen and i have these um by the way these are the lights that will blink these are phillips hue lights and they'll blink i have it set up to blink if someone joins as a member um and i thought i was like oh this brilliant idea i have which is to like put the lights around the green screen to fill it in so that there's no shadows but um one thing that i'm noticing and you can't really see it um but um with the sony alpha camera i have when i look at it without the chroma key maybe i'll show you that real fast so if i go here and i go to um i'm in camera only and i go to this thing and i go to properties and no no filters and i turn off the chroma key do you see that waviness over here that's like the frequency of the light the leds that don't match up with maybe the frequency of the camera oh my goodness topher has joined we're gonna have to say hello oh and there's the blinking so at least it's nice that you can see that right now um and we uh if i could press the button fast enough you might actually see it there you go um but um i would like to figure out how to clean that up a little bit or maybe i just shouldn't use these leds and something else for the sort of backfill of the green screen but i was curious if anybody has some advice on that let me put the filter back on uh close and back to the laptop oh no back to me where we will say welcome to topher jay who has been a supporter of the coding train for many many years we're always in there got a moderation thing we've communicated on many an occasion and now just today topher wanted to see that blinking and guess what topher for your membership with the coding train i blink my lights for you i gotta give you a random number too is somebody keeping track of these random numbers maybe people keep track of their own random numbers what if somebody has the same random number we should get shirts i'm a proud coding trade member my number is 21 121 there you go uh but i forgot what we were doing we were doing community project sharing time which is a thing that i like to do on saturdays to share the work of those of you who watch coding training video tutorials and contribute your contributions for example maybe you recently watched the marching squares uh cabana video and made something like oh i know unoriginal pun is watching like marching rays and if i click over here wait wait wait wait wait wait stop everybody hold hold this is wild okay let me see if i understand this the marching squares uh algorithm is one that looks for contours around um oh no you people you have to stop joining crosson mesh kawakkar thank you for joining the coding train with your membership you won the award of interrupting me while i was doing something very important by showing unoriginal puns wonderful community contribution but i thank you for your support and your membership i will blow my train whistle and maybe even someday you'll receive some stickers in the mail i would love to send you a baseball i got my smarter everyday baseball the other day and i forgot to bring it home i'm so sad because i have a place on the shelf it went to my work address and et cetera et cetera et cetera anyway i already lost this chat is too active and i've now lost it just says member this youtube interface oh there we go prasa mesh uh your random number is let's make this more dramatic your random number is this is a very long sound effect it's got seven more seconds what happens at the end i have no idea 88 771 this i better turn back over here to fulfill my destiny to become an ad man it's very sad that's kind of nice actually and and i'm very grateful for my uh well i don't know what the next part of that sentence is uh back to here okay no here so this if i understand it correctly is um the marching squares algorithm which you can see i don't know if this is using noise or just randomness created these contours and then the ray marching algorithm which uh emanates uh rays from this uh shining smiley face and hits the contours and stops it don't seem to be running rather slow i'm curious if that is true for everybody or if it is um just for me sometimes i feel like stuff runs super slow on my laptop when i'm streaming because i've got things all connected doing like a million different things oh and i forgot i'm not in the picture um today's mug by the way i have like a collection of mugs this is really embarrassing usually i show you my math mug let's see if this one will auto focus on it i clear castle which i actually got visiting high cure class just just just to say like it's not like i got this in the mail i was there and i picked up a mug years ago back when there was a world to move around in and now we just exist in floating in space with green screens talking to each other over the internet which i'm very again once grateful for this connection to the outside world that i have um from my attic um in brooklyn uh how's the audio by the way because i have the mic on original punch saying don't look at the code the mic is um pretty far from me today but i could move up closer to it and speak to you in a different kind of way i hope you all shut this off now by the way i think streaming really on saturday has definitely increased my numbers this is way more people than are usually watching um i will show you it here on my behind the scenes view 673 right now okay uh too many buttons all right now um you'd think that i would just bookmark the wheel that david snyder made but i can't manage to do that so let's go to codingtrainwebs let's also address something let us talk about hacktoberfest for a moment i don't know what to say about this um hacktoberfest i i believe it's put on by digitalocean yes presented by digitalocean is a monthlong um event digital event i guess it's a monthlong program where if you support some open source projects by contributing you will pick a limited edition tshirt or plan to treat well that's nice that they offer that option for sort of like making less stuff in the world than planting a tree instead um and i i think this is coming from a very good place it's i've enjoyed this program before i don't mean to be critical of it i am experiencing some difficulty and i would like to just speak to the community about this because it's creating a lot of work for um essentially what our volunt some volunteers who help maintain these repos um i do have um people who work for the coding train and as well and that's a tricky balance that i'm always trying to strike um but uh if i go to pull requests here and i'm gonna go to i believe this is the repo where we're seeing the most of this traffic let me move this over um let's go to closed um and we're going to see improved a bit improved docs minor edits improve docs improve dock modify docs update readme correction of typing say improve docs improve docs improve doc improve doct improve docs improve watch down docs improve docs there's a lot of work to and it's a lot of email notifications i get a notification for every single pull request i don't necessarily look at everyone or i don't get to it before somebody else does um and this is kind of a problem so um i don't know how um this can be addressed on a from the sort of open source community at large on a larger scale but at least in our small local community here i want to thank um violet graham many people who have been helping with this um and you can sort of see uh for example if i clicked on this one improved a bit we'll see that gypsy dangerous added invalid and closed this issue this is like work it's a significant amount of work to do um but i want to go over to the issues where thank you to violet craze they um created this issue to sort of help people think about a positive and productive way to contribute um and it's violet is also in the chat telling me and marcus is asking why are those invalid so let's go we'll look at one and see hopefully hopefully we marked it correctly we might be making mistakes because of the amount of noise and traffic um and okay which i like i have to say by moving my head up and down i gotta practice that more i was asking if i record i don't record the saturday live streams to disc maybe i should i don't have as powerful a computer i could always it's it's it's being archived through youtube which who knows if that will last for posterity and maybe i should keep my own track of that but um yeah let me i have to think about that but sorry all right wait wait wait bunch of things so uh profit match is saying you can add tags to the progress yeah so that the invalid tag is something we added let me go back to this um and by the way i'm gonna be here until about noon and once again i just i should be clear like i've really segmented out my tutorial making process which i have uh two new tutorials that i've recorded that are coming out soon and my live streaming process which is just like hanging out and kind of goofing off so there might not be a lot of anything happening today so all of you you maybe i can get this number down below 500 it seems like there shouldn't be this many people in the world who actually want to watch what this is right now so i encourage you to you know move along or put this on in the background and um you know i don't i don't have a plan i'm just kind of winging it here okay um let's look at one of these pull requests um that's marked as invalid um wait am i in the right place oh i need to go to the closed ones um we'll just go to this um first usually the one you can really tell by just called improved a bit um and if i click on this one um you can see that there hasn't nothing was there's nothing here in the pull request comment other than the template so this is our template um if i go here to files changed um i can go here and you can see there's just one little change tell me about how much you love blueberries what is this from it's one of my program with text tutorials it just changed it to how much do you love blueberries so there's nothing malicious really i think about this um and i probably should have been more thoughtful about like i don't mean to be calling out a single person and no i'm not showing their i their name was their username was shown and um i think they're probably their intentions are good in many ways and um but this kind of noise makes it hard to manage the community um so that's why it's marked as invalid because it's clearly to me it seems that it is a pull request with the intention of making a trivial change to be able to accumulate for pull requests for the hacktoberfest um thing so um but what i wanted to i wanted to be positive about this so uh i think you you you should participate um and contribute to open source and this um issue that um violet craze um they added is a a wonderful guide to how you can make a productive and positive pull request to the coding train and to be clear you will never be criticized well hopefully it's up to us to um live up to these ideals so you know please let us know if we're doing it but it is the coding trains desire me my desire and people who help participate and manage the community to never um yell at somebody or put them down or criticize their code this is an open inclusive welcoming space for you to try contributing open source you can get it wrong and we'll help you try to get it right and there is no right or wrong but um here are some things that you could do so for example i'm going to show you some community contributions if you made your own project based on one of the videos you can submit it to the coding train website through a pull request that's what this is under number one um this ten print for example i don't know if it's still true is the one is one of the videos that has had historically the most community contributions you can um all right hold on a second i gotta mute my maybe you can't hear bear with me for one second so all right i'm back uh sorry about that quick digression uh back here we are um so you can make something um and uh add your creation oh this is these are the steps to follow so these are the steps to follow um in terms of a nice way that you can contribute your own work um there okay sorry sorry about that um all right now um oh okay uh so where did i want to show community contributions but thank you to k weekman who um uh lifted a good question from the chat from uh mushi next and turtle joe players are you sure those are real people's names are you just making is this your question okay weak mom you just wanted to no okay um and violet is saying these are steps for making a community contribution have meaning to make some other issues with other suggestions but the those aren't there yet but this is these are helpful steps and i actually also have um uh i think if i search for community contribution uh coding train um i i'm pretty sure that yeah this particular video how to add your contribution to the coding grade website will also come up because i pretty much have a video for everything okay um and then there also is this other guide which has that video on it anyway okay where was i uh so the question from the chat is how much time did it take to learn javascript well i don't know if my answer to that question is obvious but i would say a lifetime i don't think there ever is a moment where you finish learning coding have learned it now i do it it is uh and certainly in my experience you know i started very late in life um well not relative to when most people start coding certainly now in terms of it being integrated into um or educating education systems but i have been doing it now for almost 20 years and i have to relearn it over and over again because it's a constantly moving target um but i know you asked specifically about javascript for me i can only really speak to my experience um i started i don't remember when it was but i should look back and find this but javascript i certainly didn't really program in until i would i want to say like 2015 maybe a little bit earlier than that um and i think i spent a year bef of sort of like figuring it out and i'm still definitely still figuring out but i don't know that i felt comfortable in javascript the language um for for at least a year and also like i don't know 80 percent of the 90 whatever the percentage is of things that people who work professionally uh developing for frontend and backend web stuff and other things in javascript no maybe they don't know 80 of the things that i know i don't know but like i don't know most of the like frameworks that people use i don't know how some of the latest yesterday i was trying someone was telling explain to me what axios is um and so um there's there's so much always to learn okay um all right so marcos is factchecking me said i believe you were already teaching javascript before okay i don't think so maybe maybe i was we'll have to look is there a way to connect a node.js that uses discord.js with a processing p5 sketch aloho um that is coming soon on the coding train all right i gotta move move along here let's get back to our community contributions we are going to spin the wheel which i can only ever find by scrolling down into issues to this one called real link did i bookmark it maybe i'll bookmark it and here thank you to gypsy dangerous for helping to create this wheel um by the way um i think this is a project now that i'm using it regularly we could uh could use some attention we could make some improvements to it um a we should you know something to do is to check to see if the data that it's drawing from is up to date that's a lot of work to do i don't know how to best manage that but um also i've mentioned like i like the idea of maybe some of the people's names populating instead of numbers but here we go let us spin the wheel i would say there is a high probability that we'll be looking at one of the gypsy dangerous projects uh i'm joking gypsy dangerous has uh submitted so many projects there's no this is not a rigged wheel here number 41 we're gonna take a look ah have i looked at this before i mean the problem is i've looked at so many of these i remember what i've looked at live or not um uh prime spiral phylotaxis contributed by sam lee so this is based off of the coding video phylotaxis um that the and if this is uh if i look at the orig i like to just sort of look at the original example which is here you can see this is the original example from that particular video and now you will all contribute to hacktoberfest with no spam pull requests only productive useful pull request yes i am hypnotizing you the open source community you will get your tshirt but you could also plant a tree all right did that work hopefully the internet has been fixed i fixed it everybody thank you all right what was i doing yes aha uh prime spiral phylotaxis oh and using um codepen so one of the things i always like to see is different code editors and platforms um perhaps this i would i get um this is also using looks like native canvas oh and d3 we can see here the code so this is really um wonderful to see i especially enjoy seeing people who take the concept and use it with a different environment and so this to me i believe is also known as the ulam spiral i don't know if i'm pronouncing that correctly i've been meaning to do a video about it in fact um at one point i had this conversation with um stand up maths matt parker about this spiral and i have like a nap i still have like i don't think i kept the napkin but i kept the photo of it it's like in my email like as an email reminder from like three years ago but uh the prime spiral is oh uh um the set of prime numbers devised by mathematician stanislaw ulam 1963. so i believe it is a uh way for sure somebody tell me if i'm right about this um that i think you can sort of like follow a spiral pattern and then a dot appear and sort of like as you're counting the steps a dot appears for a prime number and um you sort of can learn quite a bit about the density of prime numbers and a pattern that's kind of revealed by looking for this uh yeah so you can see here this is sort of like the spiral and then so this would be an awesome coding in the cabana coding challenge video um one thing i haven't really figured out now that i have my regular schedule is how to do the coding in the cabana videos i don't have an extra day of the week uh unfortunately so i again i could take a one of these saturdays off and try to record one um i had some ambitions there but anyway um thank you uh dombo um for your wonderful you can't really can you see the blinking lights you can see my face is kind of like blinking right um all right thank you for that uh sam lee let's look at one more community contribution because i talk so much and spend so much time and it's sort of hard for me to look at more than just two okay spinning the wheel the wheel and we have landed on i feel like it's good that they're numbers it fits with the random number you know we should create instead of a wheel we should have a book that just flips pages and picks a random one uh number six you selected nika cruchell random walker with colors okay so the original challenge is random walk um which is this one very simple algorithm um to move a dot randomly in four different directions and trace its path and if we go back here let's see what we see here from mika so a couple things i love about this uh this is wonderful thank you for sharing this oh sure first of all it's visualizing pi so i love this so one of the things that's interesting to me about the digits of pi is the sort of question around uh detectable is there a detectable pattern or no is what is the distribution of digits um is this visually distinguishable at all between a pure random walk um but an eye just looking at this just assumed here's a random walk larger steps and colors now i wonder here i believe the length it looks to me like the length of the step might be tied to the digit or the color i don't know but that would be an interesting thing to try right when you get one move just one pixel four move four pixels or maybe you pick the direction based on the number i don't know i i wonder how this was done each oh it says right down here read the manual folks each angle corresponds to a digit of pi so you could have the an angle that corresponds maybe a length um the color there's so many uh possible ways uh pi day is a while from now but that's that there's always wonderful possibilities to think about visualizing the digits mapping the numbers to various um parameters within a design system okay um thank you for these wonderful two community contributions um i do try to check them all out the community really enjoys them one thing that's wonderful for me especially also is and i'll just show you an example of this in my nyu class this week um we were looking at how to make your own pose classifier which i cover in this particular video and it was like a wonderful thing for me to be able to show like the students homework was basically to make their own version of this and i have um four uh uh or five just examples of things other people things have made um just right here for us to look at in class and look at look at the halo of the sun right around me right now it's a little sad how i'm always trying to like make myself giffable oh that's one thing i wanted to look at today was the um tenor uh gif tender.com tenor gif api all right let's figure out what we're doing today now it's 10 40. um i just named unoriginal punishing i name dropped matt parker i don't know i didn't mean to be doing that by the way matt parker is not who i think of when i hear the name matt parker because i know somebody else named matt parker who i talk to all the time actually i don't talk to all the time but i used to more often and i i should anyway what i'm talking about i'm getting a little clamped up here okay um what's next i think i might need some help here no no all right first of all let's log in here we go so uh oh wait we've got some we've got a problem this doesn't usually happen to me uh i have a very good connection here at home um where's that button here um i'm getting a message here uh right here it says youtube is not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming as such viewers will experience open widget so i click that stream health poor this has not happened to me uh recently um so hopefully you're all seeing this oh yeah you feel like 7.5 stream per second all right we're gonna try to address this shoot i i was concerned this would happen when i started streaming from home i do have uh an expensive you know i paid for like the highest bandwidth possible through the uh um theory of fiber line but one thing i think there's probably a lot of people in my house using the internet i'm gonna go to my wifi settings and give the this pc priority so we'll see if this uh helps um um i can also let's just see i'm gonna um i could also check my i have a mesh maybe one of them got unplugged um which maybe i'll go check when i take a break but hold on let me let me do the wifi priority thing and see if this helps so i'm going to wifi um let's see desktop windows device up um can i i don't want to pause it if i go to devices set priority device desk this must be the i have so many devices it's got to be the windows one that's the machine okay um for let's prioritize it for two hours uh check um i know i i i want to it looks fine oh wait and it's back it's back to excellent okay great so um i would like to run um uh an ethernet line uh up to the attic but i just don't i guess i could get like a super long cable and just like plug it like run it up the stairs and plug it in just on saturday mornings um but i did get an uh uh some new mesh base stations and i put one right up here and i so i the signal has been very good um but i guess that happens from time to time okay the warning is gone now um all right hopefully that will not come back so let's take a look at this so um ah this is something i wanna let's make a list um now just for a second here i had some things open that i don't want to open oh yeah well actually this list is fine but let's just make a new one uh all right sorry everybody this is silly what i'm doing where to come up with some possibilities i should work on the live poll app so that people could vote in real time i know simon will will want me to do that oh it got lower when i was using the filo taxes that's interesting uh where am i here okay so um i want to look at body picks 2.0 um i have made yesterday i recorded a this is done now i recorded a video tutorial on machine object detection models um so hopefully that'll get edited and released in the next week or so um um this this these are things i need to record as tutorials ah um i would like to uh download all code coding train captions that's something i want to work on because i want to train a model for that um these are things i want to do uh this is really a tutorial i want to record so these are all um um a tenor gif api something we could play with um i need to figure out um this question about fetch plus twitter or axios that's something i could work on today um and then um i want i don't think i'm gonna do this right now the everyday calendar is behind but i um behind the green screen for today but i want to um do serial um i want to do camera pixels over serial to everyday calendar so that's the thing i want to do and then there's the live poll uh application which is sort of like a little project that i'm trying to work on anything else um anything else that twitch has an integrated poll system i know what am i doing here oh youtube i cannot i cannot quit you youtube yes am i saying it wrong um it's actually the live poll application would be a perfect thing for me to work on briefly while showing you uh a coding setup like this so i might do that um in a bit this is weird okay um let's um this time this i can't do right now i feel like i'd have to unplug actually i could but it's so bright in here right now that i i should be i should work with the everyday calendar at night um i'm just looking at the chat to see if there's any uh everybody people seem to really like this poll application all right um these are four things five things that i really feel like would be worth taking a look at today um i think um this is yes the thing that i have for spinning okay here we go everyone oh i typed axis yes this should be axios you sure didn't autocorrect me or something okay oh interesting this is perfect actually because one of the reasons why i wanted to look at body pics uh was to figure out um if i could um use that particular machine learning model to control the everyday calendar um and so um i could do more more than one of these um some of these are going to be well famous last words an hour three hours later they're not that quick but um oh people are upset let's do a poll now i'm gonna work let me okay here's the give me 10 minutes um i have a timer on my watch i set it for 10 minutes okay i'm going to allow myself 10 minutes to look at body picks 2 and whenever the 10 minutes is up i stop i take my break um people are saying body pick sounds in nsfw are not safe for work don't worry it is very safe for work it is a machine learning mod have you ever been on a zoom call where you used a virtual background guess what i'm not saying it's using body picks but it's using a machine learning model that separates uh foreground from background or the sort of contours your silhouette the pixels of your body from the background and that's exactly what body picks does um so uh then um let me just look at that really quickly i'm just i'll show people people don't seem happy with this choice anecdotally i don't i give myself 10 minutes okay um so first of all um if i go to learn.ml5js.org um this is actually a particular machine learning model that is in ml5 if i click here under body pics and i scroll down and let's find just uh one of the oh you know what it's actually easier to do this i'm gonna go to examples um and i want to well let's look at this one that says image oh and actually whoops ah i'm the worst um let's go to the web editor once let's go to the one that says image um actually let's use the webcam because that's sort of the point of what i wanted to do uh webcam and i'm going to run it let's see what happens so this is what body pics does and you can see um it it allows you to create a mask um and you know of course i have a green screen here so that's giving me a lot of possibilities that i don't really need something like body picks for but if i were to uh have a much noisier background this particular machine learning model has been trained on segmented images images that have been labeled with people person body pixels versus uh background pixels so this is exact you know i'm not work at zoom i don't know how what they're using you know um exactly and and but zoom is a particular video call software that i use a lot right now and oh i have a video coming out about how to put a p5 p5.js sketch with a machine learning model into zoom oh i'm so excited about this i forgot about that gotta work on that this weekend um so but this is actually working quite well and this is what i was imagining using with the everyday calendar so if i could get with a machine learning model a very a clean or not it doesn't even have to be clean because it's so low i just want to get a silhouette from any generic video um oh but i was gonna do this with processing i don't know how we get body pics and processing that will be an interesting challenge um and um let's just let me just look up everyday calendar um so if you this is what it looks like it's simon yetches uh and so i worked on this last week to um to be able to control all of these different lights uh spots on the calendar individually and so um i could inconceivably walk up to it and see my reflection in it so to speak in real time that's what i want to do eventually now this particular ml5 example is using the original body pics machine learning model i believe this was trained and created by our researchers at google part of the tensorflow team and um that what was i saying here because i started looking at the chat and i forgot what i was saying ah there has been there is more recently a newer version body picks 2.0 which has not um which is not in ml5 yet but hopefully in a future release soon enough so i want to look up body pics 2.0 tensorflow um updated and where is gonna yeah so let's look at this one of these um blog posts i mean this has been oh updated so let's do this body picks 2.0 has been released and you can see here in this demonstration image that not only does it do image segmentation for your body uh you know foreground versus background it there's key points here as well as your body itself is segmented into different parts so try the new demo let's try that i just want to see if this runs a lot faster and it does so you can see this the performance of this is much faster i don't know if it's more accurate than um than what what i just showed you in ml5 but you can see this video the frame rate is very uh is very fluid and this demo is working very uh very well and i bet you if i switch it to one person um and then it can also try this other base model presumably um let's see what happens here um here's another base model with one person is this faster is this better i don't know so i wanted to try to get this working um but um i am i've already used up i have four minutes and 30 seconds left uh so i don't know four minutes yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm not talking to you um so um maybe i'll come back to this uh ten minutes sounds kind of short so simon maybe do a straw poll in the meantime ken maton is asking can we use ml5 in java in processing so this is a great question and so no in the sense that ml5 is a javascript library and it won't work just out of the box without you know any further work in processing but just about everything in ml5 is a layer on top of tensorflow.js and tensorflow.js is a port or a port is exactly the right word but is the javascript implementation of the larger tensorflow machine learning library from google which is written in c plus most people interface with it through python but there are java bindings this has been like a fantasy project of mine yeah that's welcome to my fantasy java bindings for tensorflow what a likewise um um to uh look into this uh tensorflow for java um and try to see if i can get this running and processing anybody wants to work on this um hit me up don't hit me i don't have to i don't unfortunately just i don't believe i uh i don't i don't think i can i have the the time for this right now um in that especially that all my teaching is um so much focused on um um javascript these days okay oh it's getting warm it's very warm up here in the attic the sun is shining all right let's um let me take a few minute break i'll put up a straw poll just out of curiosity and i'm going to take a short break when i come back i want to try i want to show you uh work how i work on a node web application with a sort of like separate monitor setup um so i'll show you that um briefly um thank you to lg for the sponsorship and for sending me this uh monitor um and so that'll be at least a little bit on the live poll application but let's um let me go to a straw poll oh i don't i think i like the other one better i don't know why uh maybe i don't i don't know what were my choices well so this by the way if you pick body picks it would be me actually just trying to write my own code this no one's going to want but this is this is the first step to an ai model that would speak like me suppose potentially you know assuming that the captions of my videos there's a correlation there tender gif api which i do want to make a video tutorial for figure out fetch this i have to do for um this is just like twitter api i'm just gonna call this twitter api uh live poll application and i mean i could put this on there i'll take down that green screen but i think i should leave that out okay um you know what should i allow mo i wonder if it would be more accurate if i allow multiple choices because if you have to only pick one is that really an accurate reflection of what the community is interested in um i don't know let's do a poll as to whether i should allow multiple choices or not i guess i won't allow multiple choices i'm gonna allow multiple choice no uh i hope somebody answered this question for me i can't believe it's been an hour uh i see unoriginal pun is typing i'll wait a minute um chinchya mathur is asking did you try out openai gpt too i don't have beta access to gpt so gpg3 um you might be asking what is gpt3 it's a a large language model that um allow multiple choices okay tetris make the list yeah tetris i could get started on i honestly would be happy to get started on that okay um let's create this poll all right so hopefully oh my timer is up perfect stop um hopefully uh somebody can put this poll into the chat you know sorry to everybody someone who's going to have to manually retype zxqq3v36w uh put that poll into the chat please um i will take a look at the results no votes wait what do i want um honestly for me i want to look at the twitter api although that might not be successful because i need that for my my class um i also um also this would be good to have because then i we could just use it all the time oh i i'm going to vote for them all i don't i don't know i'm not voting did somebody paste it in i'm still waiting to see it appear in the chat all right let me do it thank you to siobhan unfortunately you have to be there we go k weekman did it all right here we go uh results so will this show me in real time i will leave this up and i will be back oh i have to press refresh manually i will be back in just about five minutes so do do do so do do don't ah i am back i have an issue by the way first of all i just very warm up here so i got rid of my sweatshirt um i have an issue with my stream deck it often like starts to like just work really really slowly like for example i'm gonna press now the laptop only scene and there it finally appears and then i'm gonna press again the uh to put myself back and like i don't understand why it's it's usually when it's working it's instantaneous it's very responsive and i i've tried so many things reinstalling uninstalling i don't know if anybody's experienced this but if you use the elgato stream deck product let me know all right so it looks like the results are fairly clear and i think that's good um this is kind of like a learning project for me um kind of learning more about serverside programming learning more about networking i gotta refresh my knowledge and understanding of web sockets which i think i might want to use well that's not entirely necessary and then mostly while the reason why i'm doing this is because i want to work on more interactive um overlays for uh live streaming so and um that's something that by the way i don't think i'm gonna run this right now but i the the video that i'm going to release shows you how to create an overlay in a um video call so it actually will work with the video i use zoom platform um but it's it's i use open broadcast studio to create a virtual camera and then i can create a layout with overlays in open broadcast studio then i can train a machine learning model to recognize when i'm saying raising my hand and put like an animation of like i have a question in front of me or something like that this came from an idea that i referenced in the video from a twitter user cameron hunter um so anyway um that's also why i'm working on this because i like the idea of just overlays in general sort of augmenting a live video stream and so that's that's that's kind of the focus that i want to work on all right um i'm also going to use this as a sort of perfect confluence here as an opportunity again to sort of thank the sponsor lg who sent me this particular monitor that i'll talk about because i want to what i'm going to do is set up um my coding environment on this monitor now i have to do something a little bit odd to do that so the first thing and by the way you can find links to about this monitor in the video's description um the thing that i'm going to do unfortunately is the what's coming out of the laptop right now the hdmi cable that's coming out of the laptop is going into the streaming pc so i'm going to unplug that kind of dangerous here and plug it into the monitor so um i'm doing that right now so there it is then um i actually should have um one thing that's uh wonderful about the monitor is how just this is how like well it works for example how do i get back to that it's already giving me a message like oh you've connected a new external input and you want to use it i could have clicked yes has this nice button on the bottom i can just go over here to input and i can switch it oops um go over to input and i can switch up i believe i'm in hdmi one and i should see oh i can't see my streaming console anymore oh look at this it auto i don't know why but for whatever reason i've got the cozy coding um uh background can i change that change that so by the way i can't see anymore what i'm live streaming i guess i could go and look watch the live stream on my laptop wow my console is gone like am i still live streaming do you see it near me you could tell me but i don't know i guess you could um if you like i could look at the disc you know what i'm gonna do i've got um discord on my phone here so please codingtrain members if you could communicate with me in the coding train live chat um um i'm looking at that chat right here and let me know if i'm still live streaming and showing you anything that you can that useful so let's let's get a picture of gloria pickle uh i've got to find my mouse again this is crazy where's my mouse it's so much screen space do you see me do you see me i don't know where what's who's seeing me where uh all right um where's my mouse i gotta find my mouse it's so much screen space that i can't there it is uh which way is this way uh okay hold on this is really crazy that i can't find my mouse give me a second here um let me try unplugging it for a second here because i can get my mouse back on um this screen can plug it back in stream is still good okay please keep me um posted uh i'm looking for displays and i'm going to say arrangement okay that's perfect so i'm going to the right when i want my mouse to come over here there's my mouse and then i can go back to desktop and i'm going to bring my mouse over and i want to pick gloria there we go there's gloria pickle oh she is so cute all right so now i've got this picture of gloria pickle and now i'm going to start setting up my coding environment so first of all let me just um say uh quickly that this particular monitor um is um the lg ultra wide 34 inch um monitor um it has rgb 99 color gamut in hdr 10 multitasking dual controller on screen control amd freesync technology three side virtually borderless design and a tilt height adjustable stand and by the way it's really nice to play roblox on in addition to coding on so please check out the just the links to it in the video's description um all right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to i term open that up and i'm going to bring that over here okay all right you're finally going to need to use the cursor trails is that still a thing all right try to keep your messages in the discord chat right now to like important things where i have to like fix the thing on the live stream because i cannot see my console right now um all right so that is so let's go to uh desktop you i don't you probably can't actually read what i'm doing so um live poll we're gonna go to the live poll app um then i am going to uh get a browser window i'm going to bring that over here this is what i like to do i have i can run um so and i can say let's let's look if i do index.js and i go to localhost 3000 i love you localhost 3000 we can see there's the live poll um and i can i can have so much screen real estate that i can have both the web app that i'm working on as well as sort of javascript console for errors right here um i can put this up here then what i will also often do uh while i'm coding is and i'm coming back to my monitor here i will go to like um have my references wait what here um i will have my reference uh up here so i'm typically this would be like the p5 reference potentially so this is how i like to have a setup so i have like node here mp5js.org and i might go on to the reference and then you know if i and and then of course there's the actual code and so the actual code itself i will um have on this laptop so i'm gonna um open up another tab here i'm going to say code i'm looking at the chat no one has said anything i can't see the youtube chat right now and i'm going to open up um this and basically what this allows even though i'm having all this trouble with my mouse right now as soon as i'm done and i have the code open basically um and actually a really good thing that i could do to improve this setup would be to um well actually i'm not going to do that right now so the nice thing that i could do here is just fix this um i can so if i'm going to make a change like right now i'm i want to change that to be blue and i'm going to add some a console log like console.log test um and i can just uh it's going to refresh it and i can see here ah there's my console logo is there an error i'm changing the code like i'm typing over here and then ah it's now yellow if i want to do stuff in terminal i can just do that over here and i'm able to do this without like moving the mouse around because i can just switch between windows very easily so i always keep the mouse and my code editor on this here but certainly if i were just using this monitor like it doesn't have it doesn't have to be a secondary monitor there's enough screen real estate that i could very easily just fit my um code editor uh in a panel here the terminal here so many possibilities so let's let's try to just um start thinking about how to work on this let me remind myself what is this live poll application so the idea is that i have a server well i have done nothing on this so i'm looking at the code right now there's a lot to work on and it's about 1120 now know how much further we'll get but the idea is that i want to run a server that anybody could look could go to a web page and the server is going to serve that web page and allow them to vote in one of four options then the server is going to keep track of all of the votes and then display them in real time on a web page and this web page i would then show as an overlay onto my um onto my live stream makes sense um let me go back to my i'm very disturbed by not having my live stream console so i just want to see that uh okay great so i'm back to my live stream console i don't know why it's detected a new device here and discord um this is really like i mean coding with a large monitor is awesome but having running a live stream on your own in an attic you don't know how i would do it without having all this screen real estate um and simon's pointing out you can't see the code which is why i'm going to switch back now to actually doing this from my laptop in the usual way i just wanted to show you that configuration which is incredibly convenient for working on a project all right so i'm going to switch the hdmi plug again i think you'll be able to see me do that i'm coming over here hello so i'm just taking this hdmi cable which was connected to my laptop and i am now plugging it into the capture computer for live streaming so that shouldn't change anything that you see it's going to change a lot of things for me um and um i've got my console back and i hopefully can switch back to this view yep and here we are and here's the code so and now everything that i open now now here's the thing this is why it's so great to have a secondary monitor um because now i have everything uh on one uh screen here so i have to sort of like alt tab between all the various things which i'm used to doing while i'm streaming it's no problem but they're all sort of in separate places okay so let's think about how we're gonna do this my children are arguing can you hear that argue with each other hopefully it doesn't get too intense all right so the main thing that i need to do i think first is to have some kind of database on the server that's keeping track of the votes and i like this particular node package called nedb or any db which is a very lightweight database so let's try i mean i could just use a json file frankly and that's what this is but let me install nedb and let me run this which i like to do whenever it tells me to and then let's go down to the code and see i want to uh acquire it require and also i use this in my intro to data and apis so i think i would like to find those those examples would be helpful um do i use it here data selfie app just just take a look at this for reference um yeah so this is what i do and then i create a data store and load the database so let's also do that and then i want to create us one route uh which is just like a vote route should i i think i could probably get away with it just being a get request but it should probably be a post when you vote should it be a post or a get does that matter so i get you know the words get and post what's that loud noise okay um all right let's see um let me think about this let's just work with a get request right now um called vote hey vote register to vote um and um i'm going to add in this exact thing so we're going to set up a route and i realize i'm kind of jumping a lot of you might not be familiar with anything that i'm doing that's a little bit what this side project saturday is um and um um i don't need any of this sorry i'm being distracted by lots of noises and i just want to get a parameter here um let's just do console.log is this how i do it request.params so i want to create a route a get request so get versus post an http request is a request that a client like you're on a web page you type in the server your google.com or whatever it is you're typing in you make a get request please give me the stuff a post request is like ah i'm going to send you some stuff and you could give me a reply but you can use a get with a get request you can sort of send information that is like a parameter to the get request so i think i'm going to use that right now um and then um respond no response dot send uh hello is this right so i think if i set up this route and i restart the server and maybe i should use nodemon um so nodemon or node monitor is a way to run a node um a node application where any time you change the code it will auto restart and so i want that to be a global module so i think if i say npm install g nodemon did that work and then i think i could say nodemon index.js so you can see here to restart it anytime enter rs watching paths watching extensions starting so now in theory if i did this you can see it restarted the server so i don't have to remember to do that sometimes i want to intentionally stop and start the server but this um so if i go to local host 3000 a vote i get hello friends um and now if i do uh no i want to use um maybe i should use those like reston routes so if i do vote slash a um if i do i think if i configure it like this choice then then is this what i do so this becomes i don't know the terms for this choice becomes like a variable basically and is it in request.params is that where i find it request params poll and then i think i could do console.log request prints uh choice i think this is how i do it so now um and so let's um i'm gonna do i'm gonna just send some json back um and i'm gonna send vote uh i'm gonna co i'm gonna get the choice and i'm going to say vote choice okay so now great so and whatever i put here i will get that back so i know that's being logged in the server now probably you know oh there's so many things to think about when you create a web application and i'm going to make one that all of you are going to be able to probably like destroy and hack and ruin very quickly so um but you know such is life so now in the database how do i add something to the database um this is the date insert so i can cr i can insert something but i don't want to i want to keep track of a k oh i almost want to just use my own json file i want to update update is what i want to do if it doesn't exist so wait i have a lot of control here over what's going on let's insert um so like if i say uh just for the sake of argument choice a is a zero like this is oh no no um this is so confusing like label is this what i want to do um it seems silly to use um i guess i want to make a poll object yeah maybe i should just make do this poll uh i don't need a separate entry for every choice every entry to the database is a particular poll that makes more sense so the poll has a 0 b 0 c let's just say it's gonna have four choices right now and then um database insert poll so if i do this there it is now i don't want to do that anymore i don't want to insert another one so let's take this out i just want to have one i have to think about how you insert a pole but now uh this is why i don't uh uh database and see what happens here great uh so and it should be that in the database is just this one poll hmm so i could have just do this without a database at first and just use persistent memory while running the node server but because i'm going to restart the node server so many times i need to save the votes like i want to like save and reload the votes so i probably need a separate interface for adding polls um and then which one i'm loading but this is just going to be the only uh poll and then i should give the poll a name like i should be able to look it up by a name maybe this is the unique key there's so much to think about here and i'm just trying to like skip 90 of those steps uh yes paul and simon is right the vote route should look like vote poll idea choice perfect thank you so let me do that um let me go back to i like this idea so i that was just my like quick way of adding something to the database and then so now this should be poll id choice let's try this and so now here i should be able to query from the database um where where where where where where how i query basic query means you're looking for documents whose fields match the ones you specify find planet solar i just want to find one with the i particular id so let's do this so so database find id is params oh response params poll id and it i can actually just do this right why why is my auto format doing that to me that seems insane all right fine can i make this um does this uh does any db support promises oh a dead simple promise wrapper has this been maintained two months ago i'll take that all right let's try this uh i like to use promises you'll see why in a second i like to use the async and await syntax now it's how i do everything find one is actually what i want to do maybe um so let's see npm install any db those are called promises i hope this works and now i should be able to switch to any db promises right um and then um now i should be able to say i should be able to make this function a sync function and say uh poll equals await database find ah no stop seriously what what setting do i have this is making me crazy does anybody know like how do i find quickly where that setting is it's like the line length setting maybe um and i need an equals here i'm gonna just have to i'll leave it for right now and then let's see if this works um so my server oh crashed database load database is not a function why not data store create oh do i do it this way there are no callbacks all right oh will this work whoops i oh i'm i'm so used to restarting the server myself line length okay let's see can i line length uh extensions text maxed i don't know i don't know how to find this setting if it's part of like something that i installed like beautify config is that what i'm using um and can i like add a user setting maybe somebody can tell me where this might be yes lint no must be beautify um can i how do i get the json oops yeah like something like this like editor line length now beautify beautify oh someone's going to tell me command shift p type settings.json prettier print with if you're using prettier am i using prettier i don't think so uh i can't recall uh print with no i know i could disable format on save i like it formatting it on save i just don't want a longer line length okay gotta go back to here somebody will tell me okay okay let's make sure this still works um let's go to here a 404 not found all right so i need to do the poll id which is insane that i have to like but i'm just going to do that let's just grab this put it uh vote slash this slash b okay uh cannot read property poll id of undefined um pull id let's just send back um uh response dot um params all right hopefully this is gonna work oh request oh did i have response up there why did i have that that's a mistake there we go why did i say so the request is the data coming in responses for things coming but going out let's see what happens here okay is the database still there yeah it's empty wait database find id oh do i have to say like underscore id that's weird all right let's just be there must find field equals true i guess i have to go back to the regular nedb docs to understand how this works um fine basic querying is finding by an id like is that not fine is that like a get or something in this it seems like i'm not supposed to do this because it's underscore but let's just do this um and here we go there we go okay well that works all right did anybody figure out my uh line length i don't know how you would figure it out i guess i would look under extensions like where where's exten is this extensions yeah i have beautify these are the things i have installed eslint and beautify settings uh extension settings config path to a file oh i can create a file js beautify rc beautify ignore um beautify line length vs code yes cool open extensions menu then click on extension change the line length extension settings change the line length yeah extension uh i don't understand um extension settings doesn't seem to be a lot of extensions huh tab size editor line length oh yeah but javascript format wrap line length is that what i would do but that's for that seems weird should i not use beautify where's cj when you need the coding garden is it what was it uh is i'm not looking here okay hold on oh pretty we'll always do this okay maximum line yeah dart this is crazy that this is what i'm stuck on it's 1140 formatter in js section okay all right command shift p format document command shift p uh format talking with configure default formatter i'm lost totally lost all right this is what i was looking for line i guess i could put this in js beautify like i guess do i need to do it in my own file just install printer just install prettier i thought cj uses beautify though i just took my settings from cj in the settings in the js section okay um text editor where do i find javascript uh javascript extensions eslint typescript i don't understand js ah no this is making me crazy settings editor control w side project to fix line length come on i really i really want to fix this just install come on people oh i'm gonna get this i'm gonna get you line length i've done this like so many times maybe i should use prettier um all right hold on vs code javascript line length that's obvious command to rewrap code to respect a preferred that's from 2000 maximum line length in your code prettier line break when curly brace okay cj uses prettier scroll down i'm sorry all right all right fine goodbye i uninstalled it prettier this is what i want do i want prettier eslint i don't know let's try this okay installed it now i've installed prettier why is there a setting for every single like language but no all right it's totally prettier didn't i prettier is installed settings so i think the settings the setting that i'm looking for is not a setting of the code formatter it's a vs code setting it uses old control shift p really gone off the rails here these extensions conflicts with eslint search for prettier in settings all right i don't think i need to restart it but let's restart it um i'm really off the rails i was making progress until i decided that i couldn't take it anymore ah okay i got rid of beautify and put in prettier and it's fine now all right great amazing all right who knows what happened but i'll take it i'll take it we can move on now okay so now what i want to do is update how do i update um i found the poll then um so let's make sure i'm doing this correctly um and i'll get back where am i here okay i get the poll back and then i want to whatever the vote is i want to say poll so we're going to say const vote equals request params choice so i should maybe i'll call this choice poll choice plus plus and then can i how do i update it then what i want to do is use update insert find update remove persistence update right that's what i want to do insert db.update query update options callback oh it's the same kind of finding query used with find and find one but it specifies how the document should be um oh so i can just update it and increase the number at the same time let's see if i do that so i should be able to say update um and then set um see any db increment count i don't want to auto increment the field in any db find sort limit exact this seems crazy there's got to be a way to sort of like update this one with oh increment there we go so it must be like this increment queried by the modifier distance 38 so maybe i can do this weight id increment choice um wait no no how do i i want it to rap i'm just kidding go to the next line [Laughter] i have the opposite problem now um increment this like with this let me just do this for a second if i do this no matter what i vote for it's going to increment a by one right let's see if this works oh error invalid code use i guess i need like a try catch to get a better error message we've got 10 minutes left in this live stream okay there's no special function for updating you don't need the separate plus plus it does it automatically um this is display like this will eventually require object dot keys poll for each uh pulling but people are um all right so increment a by one that's what i assume by looking at this documentation oh increment distance 38 maybe this doesn't mean increment i mean the thing is like i can easily just get it add one to it and then update the value maybe i should just do that i'm gonna do that right now uh um find one id right update id like is this would this work right and this is there's got to be a better way to do it but what i'm doing here is i'm saying give me the poll increment the count of the choice by one and then update the poll and then send it back let's see if this works um yeah so this works so i'm gonna i'm sure this could be fixed in one line what if i put something that's not there oh look at that it adds it so obviously i need some kind of protection there to not do that but that's fine um all right great okay so this is now voting route and then um i want to just do app.get votes and then this uh so this would also be the poll id and then you would get um where what am i doing here um await database find one response.send this is a lot of duplicate code but why not all right so then oops and this is putting this into a sync await function so i've got two routes now in the server one where i can vote and one for i can see the results so let's go back to the p5.js sketch and um i want to use uh fetch so let's do like a function called count votes and i'll say i'm going to get from the server uh yeah i know it's supposed to be a wait i was gonna add that in later stop fixing everything for me i'm writing the code not you uh and then oh okay and then um so now draw i'm going to uh do this do this okay so first we have and then we will count the votes and then in draw i'm going to get the choices are object.keys of the votes and then for every choice of choices and i think actually i'll use more traditional loop because i'm going to spread these out i am going to say uh rectangle well i got to fix this 10 um i uh i'm just gonna pick some arbitrary choices right now uh start at 20 pixels down spaced out by 20 pixels and the width is gonna end with 10 pixels high and the width will be the um votes choice dot just that count times two times ten and uh phil uh let's just make it zero uh no stroke and let's see if what this does so now if i go to here all right get localhost 3000 votes didn't work oh i need a i need a um an id so what's the id that i need uh oh my god what's going on here this is bad that's not what's supposed to happen i'm not updating it something is really wrong oh dude i did something terrible all right let's not worry about this right now oh i've done something bad i don't know how to use net database.db net any db apparently um but just for um just to get this to work for a second let's just see if this works assignment to constant variable at count votes choice is not defined let's sketch line 18. uh oh that's the thing in the array okay all right let's put um let's put uh fill uh text uh so let's do who let x equals 10 let y equal this uh let's put the text at uh of that choice at x comma y plus 20 plus 10 um and then this will start at x plus 20. whoops uh uh what's what's what happened here what did i do what did i mess up choice no that's right i just wanted to require is not defined i don't have require oh that it's auto adding some weird stuff for me that i don't want okay it's got the id there i got to work on this all right so in the chat has it brace style collapse preserve in line okay okay i'll get to that later um all right so this is the uh now i just want to have this be like live so i'm also going to do a set interval count votes and again maybe eventually i want to use web sockets but i'm just going to like every second maybe let's try like half a second let's count the votes so in theory if i were to take this and kind of put this page over here and i'm going to vote for b yeah look at that every time i vote in real time it's updating yes okay so that's kind of working uh it's about just about noon so i've made progress on this a very very slow crude progress i don't have an interface the database is not working let me see if i can at least fix the thing where i'm updating the database correctly does anybody have all right so let's start over here maybe i so did the server restart no okay so this is correct let's filter out id um that seems like i don't want to to to send that to display that so um isn't that like how does filter work oh i can't do anything anymore i'm like my brain is dead i have to end this live stream um filter uh to do better do something different than this uh all right so this should remove that every oh no i have to actually refresh the yeah there we go okay and i don't all right so all right so now i'm getting the live votes and it is coming from any db now if i were to vote it's counting it is it it's making separate entries so what am i doing wrong in instead of update all right so this is clearly wrong i'm finding it incrementing a value and then updating it filter value value does not equal id thank you all right so people are upset at my not actually using i'll actually do filter i just got kind of tired it's like this is easier uh i should probably filter it somewhere else but i can basically filter by another function so i take the element and i'm just looking as long as that element i filter out i say if it's not equal to id um this what i'm doing apparently that worked right i filter out any elements oh i keep all the elements where this is true so it's not equals yes okay um i could use a regular expression uses an append only format it should auto compact at some point really that's what super bunny the pen only behavior is built into any db it is working as expected they purposely don't do seeking overwriting oh chris manning is suggesting uh redis so is any db something i shouldn't use i'm happy to okay i've got the message now that it is using the append only format fine i don't know what um i i just want to use something simple at the beginning that like makes sense but what is redis um oops i never heard of that redis database npm this looks popular what is this a high performance node.js redis client i don't know what that redis okay what is redis what is redis open source inmemory data structure store uses a database cache and message broker it supports data structures such as strings hashes list sets this looks good um i like this this sounds like what i should use should i switch i've never used redis redis is for cache use firebase remote dictionary server a key value store uh it isn't file based try out low db i want something i guess actually this is silly because my realtime polling application i don't actually need to save it to a database i just thought like we could save polls and i maybe i should use a database and have a local one i'm now realizing that's kind of unnecessary i'm over engineering this is a small local json database powered by load upload i mean the way i want to do this is just write my own i was going to do this by just using writing my own json file i mean ultimately that's what i should do uh firebase suits this i don't want to use a database as a service for this um right now um that's probably silly i don't want to over engineer this i can always come back and do this later all right i'm gonna leave i'm gonna i'm gonna file this as an issue okay so i'm i'm looking for your feedback here um let's go to um because i have to wrap up um um database okay i don't actually need a database because i can just store the votes in memory for a real time poll but what if i want to restart the server and not lose the votes currently i'm using any db just as a simple beginner friendly database example please add your suggestions and thoughts to to this thread all right so people um you can go to the coding train live poll issues and comment there and i'll think about this for the next time since i have this working i just want to put this as an overlay so oh right i forgot that i was trying to do this on glitch all right so i'm gonna do this in a very crude way but it's gonna work um but how am i gonna get it so that people can actually vote even though you're all gonna like hack first of all let me do a mapping let me let me try to like keep things in check here so the first thing i want to do is normalize the values um so i'm sure i could do this with higher order array functions but i know the minimum is going to be zero uh max votes um so let me just do four let choice of choices let count equal votes choice um max votes equals whichever one is bigger which is math.max between count and max votes is that right and then console log max votes let's make sure this is working um not a number what why did that not work oh first of all i'm in p5 so i don't have to do math.max number for the first parameter what choice well how come that didn't work oh is it because i'm no i filtered out id oh those are the choices what what am i doing here no i filtered out id i thought do i have to set it oh i guess i have to well how come that worked down here weird i don't know what's going on oh because the width maybe this is so weird anyway it's working now okay so i have the maximum and then i want to um map the number of votes between zero and max votes to a width between zero and let's just say 100 so whichever so if i go here so as i continue to vote the number b is going up but it's just sort of normalizing them okay so that's what i wanted to do also to keep them normalized just as a percentage in case the votes go crazy um now one is not a is one log the count you need to do choices yes so that's um okay okay so excellent i'm gonna do something a little weird here you'll see in a second um just gonna make the background green because i'm gonna i'm gonna the way i'm gonna capture this is not the way that i intend to eventually but wait why there we go um and so actually instead of doing that i got to get rid of the autofill that it's doing that has nothing to do with let's add um how do i do this body background is that is that how css works there we go okay so what i'm going to do now could i if i'm this is localhost could i open and my pc is on the same local network can i open this webpage on the pc um serving this here i was gonna do this it's gonna show you um uh all right i'm just looking at the chat this is i'm i'm wrapping this up i want to get allow people to vote so i maybe i should deploy this to glitch let's you all break it but why not um so let's go to coding train live poll uh edit project i don't have a way to i need to figure out a way to sync my local development with glitch um yeah i just need the ip okay i'm wrapping up people by the way i'm i'm running 15 minutes behind um okay all right i definitely have to be done by 12 45. i mean i need to be done well before then i can use ngrok i'm afraid to use ngrok i do want to learn and if i use ngrok am i opening myself up to any like extreme risk i don't like glitch is not working all right i want to learn ngrok secure public urls for testing your chatbot all right what could go wrong what could possibly go wrong sign up i don't have it do i dare sign up with github or google um people in uh uh uh coding trained members trust trusted members tell me if i shouldn't use ngrok but i think i'm going to um brought the out saying don't use ngrok okay no what i want to do is i want people to be able i want to give a url the chat where people can vote uh without destroying i mean i could deploy this to like digital ocean or something i could also just demonstrate it and i'm the only person who can vote if only i had a live polling application that i could use uh you can just download it no need to sign up i'm i'm trusting prothmesh right now which is telling me not to use ngrok um oh local all right i'm gonna i'm gonna um so download this is so bad no a profit match i need to serve my node application so it's not about hosting the client all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna go for it if you all hack my house i'll be sad now how do i use it oh i have to i have to sign up fire it up i should learn how to use this what could go wrong ngrok is fine for testing okay all right i'm gonna sign up for this um but just not show my screen while i'm signing up for it um let's use i'll use my coding train google account or i probably should use github i hate like connecting these things but i'm just let's just use github um authorize ngrok private sure okay so i'm i'm there off okay so this is great my auth token is here so i'm not showing that i for once i'm not showing you my auth stroke token unzip path to ngrok i probably want it so i'm just i'm going to um just just give me a second i apologize for not showing you what i'm doing but it there's an auth token so i'll explain what i'm doing in a second oops and let's go desktop and grock into live poll i'm just going to put it on i'm just going to put it on the desktop right now i know sorry you can't see what i'm doing okay great i've got ungrock let's see if i can do my auth token auth token saved okay okay so now all right so let me just um i want to show you what i did without showing my auth token so let's see if i can just do something really quickly this is very hacky but i'm going to show you the steps that i did right now so basically i downloaded oh sorry i downloaded ngrok which is um as soon as i zoomed the little thing i put covering up my auth token all right i gotta there's gotta be a quick way i can reset that off token right authentication uh toke uh your auth token uh regen reset auth token okay yep all right so i've reset the auth token so the one that you just saw doesn't work anymore just so you know um i don't you need to start on the command line so um um and then i'm going to you don't see i'm gonna i'm gonna do it again i won't zoom into my um i won't zoom in this time no zooming so these are the steps i have this ngrok file i i um i then run this ngrok auth token to authenticate and then now i can i should be able to run the other ngrok commands which i'm going to do i'll do a tutorial about this at some point and then i can always just blur it out um if this works well um so let me go and sorry ngrok right all right so now i should be able to oh hold on okay i should be able to now use this command ngrok http 80 and it's going to like run a server with some and this is going to send you into my computer oh my god this is very dangerous oh but this doesn't how's that going to run my node server i need to use ngrok from within like i'm not serving those files i want to expose can i integrate it into my node code this doesn't make any sense all right this is not going to work without i don't know how to do this right now right like for example there's nothing in this directory that's private but i'm just gonna go into public and if i type in uh uh ngrok http 80. oh whoops i guess i got to put it in my path will this do it so i'm running this server and if you go to this url right now oh make sure a web service is running on localhost 80. oh so it will actually work okay great but i want to do it on port 3000 okay got it so i'm doing it on port 3000 so if i go to this amazing you should all be able to see this if you go to this url oh that's wild okay so now oh i don't need the background color then because i actually have this uh working so i should take i'll i'll leave the background color why not so i'm while you're all hacking my whole system here i'm gonna go over to um my camera only layout and i am going to go open up a browser and i'm gonna say ngrok so i'm doing this in open broadcast studio i can actually show this to you sort of because i can go to here but you can't really see what i'm doing now so i'll just come back to here ngrok uh okay so i can use an n i can start ngrok from node itself so create new ngrok then um i need the to be what's the url 41 b 8 e e 0 d 4 d 8 dot n grock dot i o okay here we go um should have filtered better okay people i gotta fix my bad words could show up here thank you for uh telling me that filter elt um so i want to just use a regular expression that i'm only filtering for votes that are well i could filter in the server itself but i'm just going to filter here is a abcd test i think this is how um i think oh you don't see what i'm coding right now nope um i'll show you what i'm doing um what i'm trying to do is i'm saying filter by uh test a regular expression that it matches a b c or d um like start and end so it's only for and now because we can't have nice things let's see if that filter worked nope what's wrong with this regular expression i forget how regular expressions work um oops oh that's not a function okay that's how it works okay this is it i'm gonna make sure that it only is a valid one there we go filtered better people okay uh okay now back to here and let's see if i can refresh this ngrok how do i refresh so i refresh properties refresh there's got to be a way i i feel like i remember seeing in obs refresh there we go there we go okay so there's the poll and you can vote for your favorite option a b c or d vote people there's no interface for you to vote vote but this is it except it's over here this is my live polling application running on this laptop here for ngrok um i'm gonna vote i'm gonna do some voting to make sure it's updating unfortunately i have to vote manually oh my god there's by the way these are the messages that people um i can actually show these because nobody put anything bad um if i go back to here i might these are these are should have filtered better hello kittens foo potato hello people greeting from germany ddd so they're still in there i'm not actually filtering it and saving in the database but a is winning with 116 votes um we'll go back to here and i'm going to try let's try voting up d can everybody try voting up d for me and so i'm voting up d so this is great this is my live poll if now if i actually created an interface for it if i actually created an interface for it and let people have the url and all of that you could vote live on the coding trade but that will be next week on the coding trade because i have finished i gotta put it on the other side of me because i am not capable of um gesturing to my to my right so here it is the live pull you can see it's actually an overlay um and um so let let's go ahead and uh commit all this do i have chroma key set up on it already it's weird that that just worked um maybe i'll kill the ngrok now um let's see can we get a moving people let's get a moving let's just see if we can do this as a community let's see if we can get a to grow while i'm while i'm kind of finishing things up here closing a lot of stuff um i think it might have broken i'm getting a bunch of error messages but um this is pretty interesting to see i can see in real time through ngrok um what all the connections that are currently open and what people are doing if the stream goes down it's because it's the same internet connection yeah sorry for people are asking how to vote there's no interface for doing it or anything right now so um but let me um let me go ahead and um commit this code um i'm not let me add to uh get let me add the database to git ignore um because i don't know what's in there so um why is it still showing up did i misspell git ignore oh it's in public that's why um let's move that to the trash and just i want to create a get ignore file no not in public will can i move it yes move already exists oh oh i'm silly i already have one because for node modules right of course let's add that great perfect uh live polling work from stream and um this is what's known as a clicker by the way i don't know if anyone knows that reference um get push origin meme i'm still running it by the way we can check on it here a is winning now thank you everybody that's so cool this is really fun i'll be able to use this soon enough once i work on more of an interface and some other stuff for it and then i should actually also like i'm accepting community contributions to this and i'll just merge but i the reason why i didn't merge them when they came in is i meant to merge them or look through them on a live stream so that'll be next saturday it's 12 30 i really gotta go uh so did i push my code all right i'm gonna kill ngrok um should filter out with is not a number yeah um let me i'm gonna kill ngrok look at this we can see all the requests that are coming in wow is somebody trying to like ddos me because there's a lot coming in very very quickly um let's kill ngrok how do i kill it i'm pressing ctrl c is it dead if i close this tab yeah i think it's gone i don't know what all those errors are all right the server's down nobody should be able to connect anymore if i go back to here it's there but i assume it's just gonna be frozen with that right now all right everybody thank you for tuning in what is coming up so most recent first of all let me say a thank you again um it's just a lot of people using it okay uh thank you again to um lg the sponsor of today's coding train episode this monitor has really changed the way i'm able to work and live stream and keep track of everything going on um i encourage you to check out the links to this particular lg monitor and pick up one for yourself that's another way you could support the coding train um in the links in the video's description um other stuff that is happening in the world of coding train is um let me go to youtube uh the youtube channel could hold the coding train i recently released this video tutorial about github pages and there are two more that are coming out and i'll show you one of them uh not the tutorial but i'll just show you the code example the probably the next one to be released is looking at on the up the ml5 object detection model so i'll just run this um and what it does is if it would work huh oh no it's about to come alive it's just being slow um it it's using a pretrained model to do object detection um if i hold up my phone it's gonna uh get that as a remote or a cell phone um and let's see does it recognize this bell no train whistle banana so i made a whole video about this particular model i actually should show you um in most of the video i actually just use a static image or really being slow today ml5 object detection here let's take a look at that oh what this is that i'm seeing over here um uh come on oh why is this not working there we go so you can see here the object got couch dog and cat that's gloria pickle and greta goose so anyway there's a video tutorial coming out about this model stay tuned for that um as well i've done something really fun that i hope when i can get this released people will use i created a um i wonder if i can actually even just pull this up so i created a sketch called zoom annotations and what this does is depending on it's it's it's trained for me in a different context but basically it creates this keyed set of popup animations that i'm able to overlay over um a zoom meeting and i in the video i i go through how that works so that you could raise your hand or give a thumbs up or a thumbs down and have these different annotations appear over your video image so stay tuned for that those are the things that are coming next um and i hope i really hope that people like play with this and make their own versions of it um it's gonna be a while like this this one is taking me some time to figure out how to like get the example together and the video added together to release but those are coming out soon so once again my process every friday i'm doing recording video tutorials the first one of which just came out here you can tune into those recording sessions by signing up to be a member but don't worry if you can't don't worry you know you won't miss anything the videos will all come out and then on saturdays i'm doing my side project saturdays that's what today was uh hopefully you'll um i'm getting a million text messages because i really gotta go uh lots of stuff is happening um so hopefully i'll see you on a future live stream maybe i'll try to like um um we'll do this polling more i want to work on the everyday calendar so many things i need to do so stay tuned thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this live stream um what do i want to say i don't know um that's what i want to say i'm tired um i was just looking to see if there's any questions in the chat um tutu see you later lovely passengers uh uh my brain once if i go two and a half hours i can't put words in a sentence together anymore so i hope that you all have a nice weekend um and that you spend time in however you can with people virtually you stay safe you wear your mask um and you make something creative you do something nice for yourself you take care of yourself do something nice for somebody else um make a pull request to the coding train um but maybe not a spam one that would be a nice thing and i will see you next weekend next saturday 10 a.m every saturday except for when i change it which will be probably fairly often but um right now that's the plan for next saturday all right um i'm gonna put on some goodbye music um and kind of just say goodbye as always i always forget that this stop this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stock stop i just stopped um we're gonna get this live pulling thing really working sometime and i'll see you soon never forget this never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me it's unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it kittens the kittens the kittens the kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effect all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes i really lose okay all right everyone this is me turning off the stream by the way you can go check out uh kobe uh twitch.tv plays things um that's what this message just came in here and now i go over here and i hit uh end the stream okay everybody and stream if anybody has any tips for me by the way to help with this to be able to use these leds but not have this weird effect would love to know and goodbye and stream here i'm clicking it
