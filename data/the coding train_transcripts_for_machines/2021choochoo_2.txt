stick do do good morning uh test one two uh testing my audio how does this sound lovely to see all of you in the chat from all over the world montreal albania texas waking up early in texas london korea vietnam wow let me know how my audio is and i will be starting up in just a minute or two do do good morning coming to you live from an attic in brooklyn new york it's me dan happy 2021 welcome to the first live stream of the coding train in 2021 all right ah okay i'm thrilled to see over here in my monitor that i look like a normal person well i don't know i don't look like a normal person but i look like a human being and the keying is working because as of about five minutes ago the sun was shining incredibly brightly through a window right over there and washing out everything but a cloud has passed which normally i don't think of as a good thing but uh looks like everything is looking good this morning hopefully you can all hear me and see me okay it is lovely to see so many people from all around the world in the chat and i'm just thrilled to be here on uh what is now uh january 8th 2021 at about 9 35 a.m eastern time now i um this has been a week uh i thought maybe we had put 2020 behind us but um it appears that 2020 the vibe of 2020 is carrying into 2021 quite a bit um i hope that everyone is doing okay that you're safe and healthy and warm and comfortable i know that people are facing so many different kinds of challenges all over the world in so many different ways and i hope that the coding train can bring something to you to at least lighten your day a little bit and that's what i'm here to do today so first what my goal for today as in this first live stream of the year is not to accomplish very much it's really to just set the table set the stage if you will for what i hope to accomplish i'm not a big fan of new year's resolutions and this is not a live stream of resolutions but it is will be this will be a live stream of planning i think it will get me it'll take a little bit of time uh for me to get really going in 2021 the first couple weeks of january a little tricky for my schedule kids are doing remote school at home just one floor down i'm hiding up in the attic they have nice desks downstairs uh in class we'll see if hopefully nothing will go awry uh while i'm up here live streaming um but um i i once i get kind of ramped up i hope to be producing a lot of content over the next few months and i'm going to talk about what that content will be today as well as do a little bit of clean up on a couple little remaining projects left over from 2020. i'm gonna take a peek over into the chat uh crings is making i saw this suggestion go by like four or five times and i really quite like it make connect four sounds like something in my wheelhouse i like to make simple games uh with simple visuals i like anything that's on a grid that's good um and uh two players um over uh over the network with sockets so there's a lot of um you know unfortunately there's a lot of great stuff and i love this idea so maybe i can add that to my list somehow um bavia is asking for me to please say their name which i just did while i'm also saying please don't ask me to say your name it's a little bit i always feel guilty that i can't do it and there's too many people asking so you know i prefer uh i will say people's names here and there i i hope that brings a little brightness to your day though um do a neural network marcus says with audio as a cnn please so one thing that i should say just generally speaking um yeah and this is a great i'm going to pull up this comment from uh christian vickmann one of my new year's resolutions is to is to really get the name pronunciation correct uh i'll come back to that in a second what was i saying uh ah yes so i'm not putting machine learning and ai behind me in the sense that it won't be part of my work or or videos or content that i'm exploring but i do want to table that for a little bit it was a major focus of the fall and i have other things that i want to focus on this spring which i will which i'm about to get to but um this is a you know i don't know if i want to just ride the popularity of whatever the whatever's the current hype train so to speak i think whenever i say train i just have to blow the train whistle right but making a coding train werewolf mafia among us game would be fun agreed agreed very much um i think that could be a great thing to do i would like to get back to the sort of coding challenges um simon i don't know if what you are showing me is your random number generator thing but if that's what it is i i will be showing that in just shortly uh simon uh is asking me to show a particular web editor sketch which i will bring up all right like thank you uh okay weekbond for that and now everybody's saying say my name in the chat okay what have i got in store let's move over to my laptop here um and let's just get started so first of all i don't know if you noticed new live stream thumbnail design so i don't know if you can see it anymore because i am live streaming but if you ever come to one of my scheduled live streams in advance you will see in the thumbnail a short list of possible topics so that's something you can look forward to for me helping sort of get organized with letting people know what's on the docket i also have put in the video description what i'm thinking of doing today so if only i had access to that then i would know what i was doing maybe somebody who's in the member discord could paste my list from the description into a chat message and then i could put it up on the screen because i don't know how else i would possibly get something that's on the internet up on my screen um but what i wanted to begin with today and um is nice audio noise reduction huh i haven't done anything different so solar liner says nice audio noise reduction i do have a new microphone which is this elgato wave product you know every once in a while i have sponsors here on the coding train i'm looking at you elgato got some key lights got a nice microphone love this stuff love stuff it's great and kobe has come through for me so let's bring that up here so let us let me first begin with this list uh which i am now i guess i could order it differently hold on let me move the disk stream chat down in my layers here boom there we go so now my head will go over it if necessary so topics for today so i want to talk oh i don't know where the sample i have a sample train whistle to show you i have a video that i'll show you so uh i want to talk about my obsession with random number generators and look at how i'm planning to create a custom unique random number generated piece of art for every member of the coding train and maybe eventually for anyone who wants to buy one or anyone anywhere in the world that could if i could gift one to everyone in the world i would sorry i gotta start you know it's kind of like a vaccine roll out i gotta prioritize i suppose um uh that's that's really not an apt um analogy here at all um but so i wanna i wanna look at that um i am i'm i love running and jogging it's a big part of my life it's one of the one of the few things uh um there are other things too that helps sort of helps with my mental health honestly if i um that's it's uh exercising and jogging in particular outdoors um and uh uh smarter every day um is starting an initiative oh my goodness we have our first member welcome to passengers brian gallaher first member of the new year you have won the opportunity for me to get out my random number book and to find within this random number book a very special beautiful singular unique random number just for you brian and it will be thirty thousand and twenty eight now we need i need a system this is the first experiment i need a system to keep track of that it's brian gallaher 30 0028 um let's see if somebody could put that as a message into the chat i'll bring that up on the screen as well because it will be highly relevant for just my first topic so um but back to what i was talking about i want to look at this initiative that smart every day is uh started called forrest gump 500 to run 500 miles in 2021 i can tell you right now uh drum roll uh please how many uh miles have i run place your bets place your bets everybody get your bets in place y'all bets i have to find my uh run keeper app i'm going to look at uh my stats and i have so far completed um in 2021 in my goal uh 3.2 percent 16 miles out of 500 miles so um i wanted to build something that could help aggregate people participating in this up um uh initiative to run 500 miles um and i think i could do it through twitter and and revisit my uh twitter uh library so when i get to that maybe people want to tweet at destin um if he wants to join um and sort of check that out and provide any feedback but i'm not getting there yet who knows if i will get to it because i'm very fame famously on the coding train i make a list of things to do and i pretty much get through the first one and i usually don't even uh finish it okay thank you we've got brian gallaher 30 028. so um bringing that up on the screen um and it says brain which i think is a typo but i kind of love it um i think um simone uh yertz uh famously named her brain or her brain tumor uh that that she uh went through uh an ordeal with um having surgery um brian now brian is being renamed to brain okay yes and prati and prati and simon have both created something for the random numbers that i will take a look at and i think those are great wonderful initiatives i might just for the way that i work need to sort of like start from a blank slate a little bit but maybe we can integrate those or combine them or have multiple uh multiple front ends to the same database of random numbers okay live poll checkin if i can get to that we'll see where that project is at and then really planning 2021 is probably the most important uh piece of today i will say just right now for those of you who are wondering about schedule is that i like that stig by the way suggested i can't unfortunately i can't um highlight youtube chat messages on my screen here only the member discord ones but um stig writes a member perk for personal md5 hash uh read out by dan i do like that idea uh wonderful suggestion for 2021 appreciate it okay um let's see where are we i'm going through my list uh and then uh my one of my new year's re again i'm not um not making new year's resolutions uh because the news resolutions are only but uh if i were to make a new year's resolution revisiting the fractal flame algorithm making a like probably a coating in the cabana video with the fractal flame um is something i would love very much like to do all right let's um let's start off with the planning aspect i feel like this is going to help me get going i think i don't know i don't know what i should do uh maybe i need to live poll which i should start with and like put on music um month on is saying you rocked in that collab music video with flammable man thank you i worked very hard on my little portion of that all right let's let me go straight into the um random number train whistle thing so give me a second here that's why i was putting this music on pull something okay okay um i think i can hide this for right now and come back to it okay so um what i'm showing you here on screen is a video that jason heglund sent to me jason heglund is the illustrator and designer for all of the all the coding trained characters um we have been working you know originally it was my intention using the laser laser cutters is that what they're called i don't even remember the laser cutters that i have access to at nyu to a laser etch these wooden train whistles and i had actually ordered i have a huge box of them that turned out to be pretty poor quality i uh they may um they're fine they're nice and hopefully i'll do something with them but i found a company in vermont that sort of hand makes um artisanal trade whistles if you will they're much nicer quality they make a beautiful sound i have one in this house where i live and it's not this one this is just a toy train whistle that i ordered off amazon um but i don't know where i put it um hey downstairs if anyone finds my crazy train whistle you could bring it up to me but it's not high priority just yup just yelling downstairs um so um so anyway that's what the the train whistle looks like and um you know with the pandemic i sort of haven't been going into nyu i could probably get back into doing this but jason did some experiments out in his shop um out in oregon when he lives and so this is a video that he sent me of the latest so i'll show you first you're seeing what you're seeing is the coding train characters etched onto one side and then uh now this is really what i want to highlight for you this is what is etched on another side so this is the random walk visualization with a little bit of code and if i zoom way in you'll see here if you can see this line of code says random seed and this is just a temporary placeholder one two three four five six so my idea is for um to etch in this little code snippet from a random walk with the uh members a random number right there along with this random walk visualization that was seated that will is a deterministic will always at least with the random number seating that is in processing or p5 or whatever i use always reproduce that exact result so this is currently and i've lost the youtube chat um this is this is what it currently looks like and i'll just show you like some other experiments i'm going to keep playing this video um you can see oh we were also experimenting with um i guess it's going to zoom in on it so let me let it go zoomed in okay so that's the random walk side this is a 10 print the 10 print design and then this is as you see the uh marching squares um design with uh i can't remember whether it's perlin noise or open simplex noise or whatever it is in the background so actually it would be great to use the live poll to have people vote on which side is their favorite i think i want to stick with the random walk visualization it's not the most elegant or beautiful design but it feels conceptually the closest to the sort of core ethos of the coding train and this sort of beauty or art or um visuals through and it doesn't have to be visuals but um this idea of creative expression through computation and starting with that sort of like just the very beginning first step is hey let's make stuff random so um so i don't know what people think about this um you know this has been a really long process i started sort of like working on this idea well over a year ago i think i have to go back look through my emails and messages so people have been very patiently waiting who sort of signed up to receive one of these but you can see that getting closer um so what i wanted to work on today actually is a website that both keeps people's random numbers um yeah and violet uh is noting that that they like the 10 print visualization i agree um and and you know well uh remains to be seen what the final design will be but the goal for today is first of all anyone could on this website type in a random number hit print and it would basically maybe get a pdf or an image of this design so you could etch your own train whistle maybe set the dimensions you know so i don't i don't want this to be limited to only people who are able to sort of pay for the membership but i will make the one you know jason and i and anybody else who collaborates will make the um the the custom trade whistle for um for the members so i want to build this website that both is a database of people's random numbers as well as letting anybody put their own random number in and generate their own design okay everybody with me you got it this is what i'm working on today um and then yeah so um so i found the code that i worked on briefly like a while ago when i was very quickly um sending jason samples to work with and i haven't actually looked at it so let me so we can see here i've got a folder here with uh and this must be yeah this is the random walk visualization i assume i think this is exactly what is on that whistle does that look like it matches to you um i tried a version that made a pdf actually oh that's interesting which one did we end up using the pdf or this is the 10 print design and then this is the um this is the marching squares design um so let's let's go with the random walk sort of see now why did i make a pdf now i'm not i'm stuck i'm flummoxed i'm stagnant well we can open them both up and see what the difference is i can't remember ultimately whether the system that jason is using with the particular laser is the etcher is using um a pdf or an image but either way let me let me do the image one because that'll translate better to p5 for right now anyway so i'm just going to go with that and um okay so this is no all right so the the aspect ratio for this particular design that fits on the whistle is uh i don't know why i wrote it this way it's kind of nuts 480 divided by two 1500 divided by two i think i was trying to get it to look smaller then i am running through is this one million points one million points oh that makes sense one million random numbers okay that's awesome that's conceptually tied yes it works i'm making a stroke weight of two drawing a point this the dot starts in the center and then um and then picking a random number moving x and y randomly uh drawing the point uh the next point and then saving it as a png and exiting so let's just run this and see what happens and then i'm going to pull up i'm going to pull up um where did we find this oh wait i got to get this here um we have the random number 3028. so let's put that in here thirty thousand and twenty eight um and so we're going to say right here random seed thirty thousand and twenty eight so just to be clear if i take that out every time i run this it's going to be a different pattern because processing is seeding the pseudonumber random generator differently each time randomly so to speak but as soon as i put in random seed and now i remember why i had this divide by because i think if it's like i want to kind of like look at it uh smaller um but generate a higher resolution image so this is the pattern that will come up every single time for this particular random seed if i run it again we see the same pattern again and let's go back to making a larger version of it and there we go so interestingly the size really does oh because i'm keeping it on screen interesting what if i took this constrain out let the random walk leave the the space the drawing space um if it if it will i think i kind of like that as that's better so okay so now what i want to do with this is i actually want to create i'm going to create a p graphics object called canvas and that um that will be the full high resolution uh image that's four 880 by 1500 pixels then the size of the canvas will be that divided by four so i there's something that i can see easily on my screen um the size of the window i should say in processing and then this should everything should now be based on the canvas and i am going to draw everything on the canvas um the numbers can change is irrelevant then canvas.save no loop is fine and then when i'm done i want to draw image canvas so i want to see that canvas but shrink it down so let me just make this with a hundred thousand points just so it runs much faster to make sure it works hmm did i do something wrong here let me run it again null pointer exception why do i have a null pointer exception under create graphics is this maybe something that can't happen in settings ah i need no point exception so uh thank you violet is reminding me um that i need oh and i don't have the stream chat up uh violet is reminding me that um i need begin draw and end draw thank you for that and i guess now so again feedback for this stream chat i need quick access to the pinned ones because now i have to scroll and find them because there's a lot of comments to move them off uh i guess i could clear all the other ones uh okay and i don't think i need to remember thirty thousand twenty eight um so now i can just remember that i need begin draw and draw i forgot about that so absolutely canvas begin draw and then canvas end draw here this is i don't believe this is needed in p5 which is one of the reasons why at least that's my excuse for why i forgot it okay let's see there we go it's so tiny all right because it's only a hundred thousand points okay looks good uh now let's go to one million points a little drumroll so it's so small because it's only a million points so i could up the number of points the other thing that i could do is technically speaking um i could increase the stroke weight to four and then always move it by two pixels so i could do something like step size equals two uh and i might wanna say something like stroke weight is the step size times two and then this is equal to the step size so i'm always moving according to the step size let's try that see what we get yeah so this looks like what i would expect it to be um let's see what um let's see what would happen if uh oh what happened there what did i do i meant to keep it constrained oh this needs to be canvas dot width i was like oh i'm constraining it uh but i constrained it to the little divided by four size window okay see what we get that doesn't make a huge difference um but we're gonna get more points in the window itself because it's not allowed to wander off but it's not the true random walk this bothers me i gotta take this off okay so this is good um um kk wikman is saying on average it will be the square root of n away away from the origin after n steps um that's wonderful to sort of think about and consider thank you for that comment um all right so now um what do i want to do i think it's always going to kind of lean towards going one way oh or the other because the other thing is i always need room in this design to put the little code snippet um and uh let me now so i just want to look at a lot of these so i'm gonna do something kind of interesting here at least interesting to me i'm gonna seed use a random seed of frame counts always reseed the random numbers then i'm gonna say uh save frame random walk put in these um hash symbols i guess i can't call save frame on um on a p graphics office object office that's fine i'm so used to javascript now that this is confusing me what to do here so let's do that and i should now see and let's get rid of no loop um let's do this so i just want to put on um my waiting music and we're going to do a whole we're just going to create a bunch of these let's see what they look like oh i just realized there's a problem i need to put begin draw yeah and and background there that should do the trick all right i just want to see if i'm oh why didn't i get oh because x and y also need to be reset back to the middle okay now we should get a bunch of them so it feels like i either need more points or a larger step size oh i like that one what do we think people there's always room generally you know it'll be in a different place for the code snippet and the random number of course that could also go on another side higher step size and points i kind of don't want to i kind of don't want to change the number of points so i think about 1 million points seems right to me what if i make it a step size of four i'm also not sure why i'm doubling the stroke weight based on the step size is it giving it more heft yeah it's continuous bigger step and fewer points says andrew i think actually i really like where this is right now i just want to look at the um i want to look at the sort of higher resolution renders right now because we can really uh zoom in on them just to sort of see what ah so that's why i increased look at this the strokes are like little dots like that when you zoom in on it so it has this weird kind of that's why i so one thing is i could do is just actually make it a rectangle maybe that would make more sense like instead of drawing it as a point uh what if i said this i'm just curious i made it a rectangular point now um would i want it's gonna go up here um would i want this to be wrecked mode center i think i would let's see what these look like an idea from the chat is to center the canvas at the average of all the points that is a really interesting idea so why i do like that idea i i sort of there's something nice also about the consistency of it them all starting from the same place um and and the dabbing bear which is a great name by the way saying a lot of rectangles might cause performance issues so i'm not worried about performance issues right now because it wouldn't even matter if it took me an hour to render each one but let's see what these look like and i should have renamed them so i could compare them side by side but yeah now we can see i think so this is this is definitely what i want i want it to be um the sort of perfect pixel size of each step um and i'm not sure what advantage there is to like making it higher resolution with a larger step size than lower resolution with the same step size really seems to make no difference but um but yeah okay so i think this is good this is good enough for now because this could always be improved that i can take this and move this to p5 because ultimately this will fit in so let's look at a couple of these um so i want to show what a couple uh folks from the community have made let me get into uh discord um and pull these links up so i'm going to put the music back on here let me find okay and then i'm looking for the other one where is prote's okay okay just get back to discord okay so first of all if you are not a member of the coding train discord i said coding train please come and join right now um i will put a link into the chat um however um i'm sorry i'm looking i'm reading the chat right now um bounce the walker off the boundaries okay wait did that oh it came it came through so also you could just go to thecodingtrain.com discord that will get you an invite into the discord the discord is where the community gathers um for discussion and sharing and help um and it is also what i use during my live streams to post links to things that i'm looking at that people if i want people to have quick access to i could put those into the youtube chat but it's a little more awkward for me to press all the buttons to find that chat so um uh come come over here and check out the lynx channel come on into the discord so um two uh friendly faces from our community have made some sketches related to the uh random number assignments and by the way again everybody can have a random number um and so uh let's look at this one this one is uh called capricious brazil which is a wonderful name thank you simon i think that's probably the default name i don't know why i'm not logged in here to uh the web editor and this is a project that simon made welcome new member your random number is 63 579 and that's on the end of i love this so so much i think there's so much potential in this idea the one thing that i don't know what to do about is um i do not want the random numbers to come from the job the browser uh javascript based pseudo random number generator i want them to come from my very special book again again help me internet help me find an original print of this book from i think it's the uh i i should know the date off the top of my head with my obsession with this book um let's look it up uh this was the first edition originally published in 1955 um so that is my uh i would take a later reprint of it but i'm really looking for an original no missing pages print of this book from 1955 i would pay a large finder's fee i know but i've been looking on ebay and all sorts and it's really hard it's hard to just to find but someday i will find one um so i really would like the random numbers to come from this book so one thing that i think we could do is uh if we were to use something like this is have i mean a transcript and this would be really useful a transcription of this book so perhaps already the audio like is there a kindle edition of this book is there a raw text file is there an ocr version of the book that's what solar liner is asking that's exactly what i'm looking to find if not that will be a project that we will undertake there is no reason why i couldn't scan this book digitize every random number you know my dream is to make an audio book version of this release it on audible but in which i have been slowly trying to read over time i'm still on the first page but i guess i could i guess i could sort of really dedicate myself to oh yeah actually if i just really i could do this this could i mean i could do this like not live streaming like i could just record myself i'm gonna do this this is my project so anyway um so that's that's what we need uh to improve this simon thank you for working on this um i think there's a lot of uh design opportunities also that we could add to this um but i love it um so thank you for that um so we're gonna we'll continue with that i think that the big step would be to get the um to get the uh uh a digitized version of the random number book okay now this is created by um um and i want to make sure i get the name right so give me a second here um you're in the chat right now i know um which i think maybe fun planet perhaps uh is a github or or handle that i've seen online um let me go back to here so if anyone wants to take a look at a simon sketch um i will paste that into the discord uh links channel thank you simon for that um and then oops when i'm not on screen then let's take a look at this coding train random n o dot tk um is the url for this i'll paste that also into the discord here so let's just see how this works so if i type in my name my random number is one two three four five six my phone number i think you random had a reason for having the phone number in there but probably i don't want to be asking for people's phone numbers i think also maybe this is something that is there's really would just be sort of more of an admin panel for me although maybe there's a way for maybe this would be maybe there's a version of this website for everybody to put their own random number in i'm gonna hit submit um invalid name what my name is invalid no i don't know why that is is it because i don't have a phone number um it's required so one two three one two three one two three four let's try that no uh eight hundred five five five one two three four not sure what's going on with this so found a little bug there can we find anything here um so i like the idea of this an interface honestly i think like a github file marked a json file on github that i can just edit and add somebody's uh name and random number um and that way i can manage it through pull requests might be a little bit easier than and then keeping them keeping like an elaborate uh uh full stack web app um but thank you this is a wonderful start and i see that there is also a secondary link which is where i can now find and export to a csv file so this is great again i'm not so sure about the phone numbers but i like the idea for this so thank you for this is really amazing and does the search work yeah the search even works this is really amazing work um and so we could consider using this as a base but i think what i want to what i'm going to work on right now and i'll just do this in the web editor itself is um so i'm reading i'm reading the um the chat actually because uh keith um keith writes a comment deep fake audio your voice i have uh some weird side projects that i'm working on related to some podcasts that i listen to and i don't want to do and just as like a fun goofy project not to actually fake somebody's voice i'm interested in looking at models that can train a texttospeech engine based on existing audio and i haven't been able to find anything that i was able to do pretty easily with that um so a hider in the chat is saying uh there is a link to a million random digits text file so if somebody wants to get that to me right now i would gladly uh pull that up um all right so what i the thing that i want to start with is i want to just pull over and i realize there's a big irony here which because this processing sketch was originally a p5.js sketch that uh chuck england trans transcribed over to processing now i have this processing version that i'm going to transcribe back but let's bring that over to here we'll call this whistle generator and let's just quickly translate this to uh javascript and i don't think i should call this canvas anymore and boy that font size is small oh so we ran corp according to um according to uh kay wickman the rand corporation actually maybe has published their own version of it okay um let me let me keep going with this here uh i don't need the settings function this over a little bit what is this hero it's just one of the patterns um i'm going to call this uh let's just call this whistle whistle equals create graphics so i have i don't know if begin draw is necessary but i will keep it random c that i want to let's go back to using a particular random number and uh this there we go and i call this whistle the constant um and i just noticed that i have this as a rando walk not random walk let's let's get rid of the save for a second and let's make this many many fewer points just to see if this works uh canvas end draw image of whistle so i think and then i'm going to say no loop i think i've translated everything let me just get rid of this stuff for a second okay what did what went wrong what went wrong begin draw so i think there is no begin draw an end draw in p5 it just doesn't there we go this looks good now why is it all the way over there ah pixel density uh the pixel density nonsense try this what is going on what is going on oh no could the image be picking up direct mode no looking at the chat here um uh and prati is telling me to remove the dashes from the phone number that's why that form validation didn't work but i'm confused what i have done to cause this to not work like why is it over here canvas width divided by two oh whistle whistle whistle ah oh my god there we go okay great let's go back to a million a hundred thousand oh that's the 100 000 a million there we go let's do let's add the whistle save okay and now let's look at the png there we go um so i'm just curious is the random number generator is not going to be the same as in processing so it's going to be a different image if i do it here on this website versus with processing i guess i could run processing uh you know command line on a server to generate the image or something crazy like that okay so now i think what i need to do is let's create input with a number in it let number and number equals create input and i think i can um then let button equals create button generate button dot mouse pressed function uh i'm gonna say redraw so uh let's just call it uh let's let's actually not use draw at all uh ran let's make a function called oh well hello random walk and we'll call this random walk uh random seed will be uh parse int of number dot uh value and if i'm right about this and let's say background 255 here huh why why why there we go okay so the idea being that i could place the random seed in here click generate and i will get the image now if i change the seed a little bit hit generate i will generate the image so this in many ways this is just the first step i so i think what i want to do is turn this into a github repo um you have in that github repo uh you know a json file maybe i think i could do this without a server just have a json file that has members and random numbers um and then uh we could also create a url uh with like a query string that goes to a particular member or a particular random number and generates the pattern so i'm going to shelve this right now i think this is enough um and so uh i'll put a link to this particular sketch into discord i'll put it right here so if anybody wants to play around with it um you're welcome to do so and stay tuned to the discord we will announce and link to the github repo if you want to contribute to this system that i'm going to use to generate the designs for particular uh whistles okay yes guerda asks why are you doing this i don't know i just am it is what i do okay an hour has passed i've got about another hour left today um i'm gonna i think i want to take like a like a two minute break here um but i don't even need to like turn the stream off i just want to uh open up a few windows i mean let's so the next thing i want to do in terms of my schedule here um i'm reading the chat um the next thing i want to do in my schedule is really sort of start to plan out 2021. okay all right i'll be back in just like two minutes here so do do okay i am returning back here um and all right so i want to start looking at the twitter api and this uh running tracker thing that i want to do hmm i wonder if i should just work on that next i do need to do the planning we'll come back to that all right so let's let's work on this um um oh boy this is going to take me a minute to get set up here music back on do what the am i not signed in is that why oh where is my phone for two packs um authentication code speaking of things i should have done before i started live streaming i don't think it matters that i'm showing this to you okay i'm now about to figure out how i want to use twitter i'm currently logged in as myself which i really don't want to be logged in as let's see if i can yeah i'm going to use this okay okay so here's what i want to do um i'm logged into twitter on this um account that's called a to z bot example if you're wondering why it has that name so the course this is this is a this is a unfinished really un barely started project from fault from the fall if we went one of the things i wanted to do today was go back and look at my list of things that i meant to make videos about tutorials about in the fall and one of them was rebooting the twitter bot series i did not get to that at all i didn't even make one video but because before that was making a discord bot series which i did do but i didn't even finish that so i have to figure out like what's realistic for me to do still with discord or twitter now that it's 20 21 and my focus will be you know spoiler alert my focus is for the spring is the nature of codebook um and what's this by the way oh that's just uh visual artifact of the browser um but um i did start on this sort of like twitter api library um node module during the live stream so i i want to like at least it's still it's still you know it's still the first is it the first week of january second week of january i think i can allow myself i can indulge myself working a little bit more with the twitter bot twitter api now the course that i was teaching in the fall it's called programming from a to z it's about programming with text twitter bots discord bots were part of that course that's why this example is called a to z itp i'm going to go to developer.twitter.com and a developer portal okay so um and i'm going to make dare i make a new project or just use my api keys from this one i think i'm just going to use my api keys from this one so all right what um what's going on here so i actually recently added a new example which will uh search um search twitter so this so this is something i actually worked on over the holiday break not on a live stream i did this on my own i added a new function um in the my twitter uh library which has a search function um and i can pass it any keywords it goes to i'm still using the 1.0 twitter api and i can search go to this uh this particular endpoint search tweets json and just pass us the query the keywords so and then i pass it to a get request which does all the oauth stuff that needs to be done and there should be a way i can i can probably page through them also so what i what i want to start with is i just want to create like let's look up um uh what is it the gump 500 see i think if i search this i'll probably find it yeah okay so let's follow forrest gump 500 and what would make sense as a hashtag for right now uh fg500 is that could work um let's see if this is empty um oh you know what i want to call it gum 500. yeah okay great we'll call it gump 500 forest 500 i don't know what's better just for testing right now i will use this so i'm going to go to my example which the first thing that i need to do is i need to create a to work with this example is i need to create a uh a dot env file that doesn't just have the dummy data in it so let's make a new file called dot env uh paste this over this is again welcome to 22 welcome to the coding train where a person who likes to make youtube videos about programming but often uh uh continuously by accident reveals their secret api keys and tokens while live streaming so um let's um so the reason why i was saying gump i was interested in is a littleknown fact story time here historical footnote um i uh i don't probably shouldn't admit this but many many many many moons ago back in my youth my utes so to speak when i was a young college student i participated in an acapella singing group and at a cappella scene group's nickname was the gump i will leave you to the rest of the internet to find old photos of me if they exist uh um out there somewhere okay so um what was i doing uh yes so i'm gonna go over to here and i'm going to click on this keys and tokens button first i'm going to move over to there and click on keys and tokens and i'm going to go view keys wait okay here now great so i can show you this page this is the next page that i'm on here and then i'm going to click on this view key so as soon as i do this i do not want to show them to you although i could show them to you then quickly regenerate them um but i'm just i think i i think we're just going to ask for you to have a little faith have a little trust in me that that uh that i'm going to copy paste the correct keys without you seeing it so oops wrong button so i'm clicking on view keys i'm getting my api key right now putting that into consumer key getting my api key secret putting that into consumer secret then i am going to go down to access token and secret and the only way for me to get these and by the way one thing that's really important is you need to make sure you have read write permissions i mean um in order if you want to actually don't need to have if i was actually making a twitter bot i would need to have um write permissions to be able to post to twitter but anyway so i'm going to click regenerate yes regenerate and i'm now going to get my access token uh and paste that in i'm going to get my access token secret i'm going to paste that into my env file i'm now going to close that file go over to env sample i'm going to go back to here close this window and i think i'm starting 2021 off on such a great new leaf i successfully and i'm sure i'm gonna ruin this in any second now i successfully generated api keys and secrets copy pasted them into a dot env file explained exactly what i was doing i didn't once show those keys on the live stream um so but and they're now sitting in this particular dot env file has exactly this content in it the only thing that's different is it has the actual um uh uh api keys so if i go back to here one of the things you'll see is i'm using the node.env package um which will then load those consumer key consumer secret token token secret from that file and create a for me to authenticate with the twitter api which happens here in my choo choo tweets module so let's just now search let's let's search for a hashtag um gump 500 and solar liner says in before he actually clicks accidentally clicks the dot envy i didn't do it i didn't do it um let's so let's go back to twitter um let's make one post oh yeah gum 500 what was i i'm at um i said i was at 16 miles um let's tweet that and then um and then everybody's talking about how i'm gonna show those guys i'm not gonna show those secret keys come on yeah i can do it i can do it um i'm gonna go back to here and go to examples and search and say node indexed wait uh okay the dot env is there uh node index.js ah okay uh whoops i forgot a very important step which is to say npm install i've got to install all the node packages uh now i should be able to do this okay oh so we got um two tweets oh somebody wrote oh this is really dangerous stuff now in the la um uh hello mr daniel uh you can just call me daniel no need for the formal mister um and um i can also see here um my 16 miles so now here's the thing this is just doing a search of historical tweets and i think what i want to do which i have not really investigated if i go back to the um can i get to the docs here so what i used was a twitter api um and i probably should investigate the twitter api version 2 but i'm using standard 1.1 um let me just go to fundamentals maybe data dictionary no tweets right i'm using this search tweets so this is the endpoint that i'm using um api reference is what i want to get to right get search tweets so you can see that that's the that's the api endpoint that is what is in my code um here under search that particular endpoint and then this is the only uh parameter that i'm using which is q for query for particular search keywords but you can see i can limit the tweets to language locale all sorts of since a certain time a maximum id um so that um so like but but that's not what i want to do what i want to do is i think there's the i the account activity api is what you need to use if you want to listen for um events for a particular account so if i want to listen for when my account has been mentioned or a tweet has been replied to but i think i can still use under standard sample realtime tweets or filter realtime tweets i think this i should be able to use um which for a search for a particular hashtag so how do i do this i don't actually know how to do this streaming uh and this might be unrealistic for me to actually figure out today all right we launched a new version of the post statuses filter endpoint oh so do i need to use twitter api version 2 early access or can i get this post statuses filter 400 keywords 5000 user ids one filter rule power track i don't need that filtered stream so i don't understand how this works this is a post to filter track so follow track keywords to track okay yeah i thought v2 was out as well profit mesh is asking so i'm going to get myself till 11 a.m to work on this which is only 15 minutes but let's see what happens if i at a minimum add this particular request for and this is a post right this is a post to statuses filter so if i look at this um like i have a um just a simple like i can look at this as a like if i add another function to my library and i'm going to call it filter and i'll give make the argument keywords the endpoint should be this resource url so i can paste that in here i'm going to the filter url then the body of the post should have i only want to use this track keywords to track so i want to uh track the keywords whoa what just happened there yeah track the keywords and then i want to await post to that particular url with this post body and all of the authentication and the actual post request all happens down here i'm using this oauth package so now i can go into my search sample and i should just be able to i'm just going to comment this out and i'm going to change this to filter and let's console.log the response and see what i get um so it's sitting there waiting so why is it waiting is it going to suddenly nothing happened there so what do i get i don't understand oh return response but it should have returned that's what i meant to do no no not using this endpoint correctly where is my filter function turn await this.post i mean just to be sure about this just to make sure uh my posts are working does he see the youtube chat uh it's lo it's using long pole it's a socket i know what do i do with that now i don't know what to do with it uh how do i listen um uh let me just make sure this is working hi from node.js let me just let me make sure like my post requests are working and now if i go here into profile yeah so that worked um the tweet came up um check listen function in twitter documentation okay so now that i get oh stream.twitter okay so how do i use this okay returns public statuses multiple both getting poster grip but get requests to okay response formats json am i not in the can i look into guides okay stream oh yeah i'm looking at the chat see if anybody so what um let's look at what's that twitter api that i also was using as a model twitter lite let's see if they have this um let's see ah they do have this stream you know this is a this is a much more okay so thoughtfully created api so let's look at um stream statuses filter ah so on so then there's these events so basically i mean i should just use this library that already has this implemented but i want to understand how it works um so i am going to right i think i need to i'm going to go look and see how how it's done in this particular library so client.stream let's just clone this whole library and again uh you know if if i were really just sitting here trying to make this project happen it would make much more sense for me to use this working node module but i'm i'm playing the long game here i really want to understand the twitter api in a more robust way so i'm going to sort of like keep with my own code implementation so let me clone this library and just see how it has implemented it it's also typescript oh boy this is going to be tricky for me so index stream resource stream okay so public stream so i guess this is coming from oh my god i have no coming from stream.js oh my god i have no idea what to do this is so complicated twitter.js what's in here create oauth client ace endpoints twitter handle response where yeah make requests get post put oh that even has a put do i need to use a put stream okay authorize request data request fetch requesting then response so i get a stream stream emit start on okay so this i need to do something with this just read the docs you can maybe use a generator function use a 408 to stream results back to your script um i'm reading the chat here um all right this is gonna this is gonna take a longer investigation um this is using what is this fetch is this is this the same fetch that i'm using cross fetch cross fetch what is crossfetch interesting uh fetch api this is probably latest version so this is probably not too different from what i'm using um how come i can't okay let's take a look let's dig into this a little bit i think i understand what i need to look at now with a little a little bit more detail so let's go to here and let's see what i get in my post because it's never going to resolve um what's this does this function ever execute so it gets to here okay it gets to here and then this wow it just sits and waits post it opens up a connection i need to create a stream object i guess all right i have to put this aside or i could just switch really quickly and use twitter lite right now let's just see if it works let's try using this twitter lite um i'm gonna make a new project and i'm gonna have to investigate how to do this later on my own i'm gonna make a new project and uh let's now here's where i run the risk of showing my env file again so just give me a second here and bring my dot emv file over uh from from that other example i was working on okay so okay so um i'm now in a new empty new project um um a new project um uh with the index.js file package.json and my.env file so let's go over here and say npm install a twitter lite so we're gonna we're gonna grab this uh twitter library um and uh i'm going to just there must be like a quick example here test stream test yeah this is what i want to do basically um whoa this is way more than i need but let's um all right so um all right so i'm getting my special dot env i'm requiring oh no this is a test this is not an example hold on come on twitter lite get post new client new here we go this is what i'm looking for okay so i just need this let's start with this and let me go back to my this example which i will need to get just my env stuff and i also want to say import no not import require i need to inqui require okay do it this way um okay so there we go so i've got the twitter api um and then i need to say dot env dot this is where oh i'm so close to making it through the stream without revealing it back to this view i'm going into my dot env file people uh consumer key goes here oh no consumer key i just don't remember what the things were called consumer secret and then they're called uh token and token secret so i can show you what i'm doing again so oops token and token secret okay and so now let's just see if this is going to work by looking at a very simple example let's verify the credentials so let's see if this runs oh and i need to uh install env and looks like this verified my credentials correctly that's promising so i don't think i need to do that anymore and now let's look for stream tweet thread streams okay so let's do this and let's just only track uh gump 500 and then do this next tick stream destroy i don't understand why i would want that but okay um all right so this in theory now um i should be able to see here in this function any tweets that come through with tracking this parameter so let's see what happens starting the stream going to twitter gump it's 11 o'clock after 11. we're so close though now uh hello tweet this that worked okay so um so i think that i am going to need to learn how this streaming works so that i can implement it in my own twitter library and we can see people are uh i don't know what the ping oh i guess the ping is just doing that every so often to like stay connected um and throw an error and what is i don't understand looking at this here why i need to have okay to stop a stream call stream.destroy that might take a while though if the stream receives a lot of traffic also if you tap destroy stream from an on handler you may get an error about writing to a destroyed stream try to defer the destroy call next tick i'm not sure i understand this is like api 2.0 all right i'm going to leave this without the destroy method and what i'm going to do is i'm now going to have my server i'm going to create a miles dot json and i it should allow people to use kilometers but just to the simplest version of this um let me create uh a json file that has um an an object in it okay an empty object so then um let's this is gonna be my database and i should use a proper database but this is gonna do for right now um i'm going to uh create oh i'm gonna i'm gonna use the node uh file system module uh and then you know this is gonna have to be honor system anybody could just tweet gum 500 500 miles and they're done but i'm going to say miles equals read i'm just going to read file sync the name of that file miles.json utf8 is the file format i'm going to call this data and then i'm going to say miles equals json parse that data so this is the miles so on let's actually let me just name a function um new tweet um and let's write that function um function async function new tweet console.log data so um and i want the um require fs promises yes i thank you solar liner i do want that um does it i like to use the um read file sync though just when the program starts up i will come back to that um okay so console.logdata.tweet so now i need a regular expression um uh i wanna look for if that tweet includes some number of digits followed by some number of spaces optionally and then the word miles anywhere well let's i just want to look at the for the first instance of it actually but case insensitive so then i want to um what is it called maybe it's screen name and tweet like if i go back to uh the example it was tweet.text if somebody could look this up for me i just want the username of the person on twitter um which uh i think it's called screen name um but i'm not sure and then let's just say console.log screen name let's console log some stuff uh screen name text and then i always forget how regular expressions work so let's just play around with one here right here regex match um hello 500 miles no so hello 500 miles match yeah great so there we go um and then what if i make my regex capture the digits um yeah so then i get an array and i get 500 as the second element of the array perfect okay so this is what i want um so it's the string match the regular expression so let's capture the number of digits um and then let's take let match equals text dot match regex if match if there is a match then the miles equals and i i eventually i'll make this work with kilometers and all sorts of other things miles equals the match index one uh console and then so what i what i need to do is say um add to my database miles a screen name updating their miles equals that number of miles and then save save right right file sync uh json uh the file name is miles.json is that the first argument uh the path is the first argument miles.json and then i need to say json stringify um oh i don't need p i guess yeah let's keep people in there so so it's people miles dot people let's just call this database it's sort of silly but eventually that might be a database and so yeah because also i just had this be miles and i think we should say parse int that particular match database people screen name equals miles and then i want to stringify database uh and let's format it nicely okay so this should handle anytime there's a new tweet look for the text see if there's a match with the number of miles added to the database um okay you probably forgot to remove my message from the screen no i was keeping it up there for reference but i guess i could i guess it's been a while okay so anybody see anything i did wrong here uh i'm getting a lot of pings so let's rerun this server i'm going to tweet gump 5 500. i ran a total of 16 miles so probably you should tweet like how many miles you ran i could add it to your total but i don't know we'll do some like fancier natural language parsing or something um gump 500 i ran a total of 16 miles so let's see we should see that come up here oh we got an error uh dollar sign is not defined so first of all it probably wasn't screen name oh it is screen name that's a user dot screen name text so i need to do user dot screen name that's fine uh oh how do i do this i'll just do this and then we're talking about name so that's the name and then that's the name so where uh where did this go wrong where is oh there's an extra dollar sign here okay great all right little couple fixes there let's rerun the server um i i have run 16 miles in toto total okay tweet okay that's promising i see i don't i don't need the console log all of this stuff i don't need to console log data now if i load here oh look at that yes 16. so uh anybody should tweet now something of how many miles you ran and it should show up here let me give it a minute for people to do that and then i'm gonna make a quick visualization of it um so let's make a route i need to get all my express stuff going here what was here we go so this is from my work but basically kind of redoing what i do in my working with data and api series so i'm just going to grab a bunch of things from there like i'm going to add express and i'm going to create a web app i'm going to serve i'm going to serve a directory called public um let's create this after i've loaded the json file um oh oh no um let's see if anybody's tweeted yeah look at this look at this people's miles are coming in i might have to clear that out like i'll clear it out after uh so it's definitely working um so now what else do i need um i need a get request let's add that i'm gonna put that stuff at the bottom here now um i want to send out the database so i believe um let me install express let me run the server if i go to localhost 3000 api okay database find i don't need any of this i just this is i mean it's so much more complicated i'm not using a database okay uh little api here what what i exceeded the connection limit oh that's sad uh did i not destroy my streams is that the problem because i'm not going to worry about that right now i assume this will i will this will reup in a second um okay now let me at least see if the visualization is working um okay so great so now i'm getting this here and i'm getting the number of uh miles that people have run um we're gonna add a little um well never mind um i will i will do some moderation later um and now let's see okay so now i just need a public directory and let's make a quick p5 sketch um index.html and then uh sketch style um he wrote negative one miles and skipped the minus that's interesting uh that's a good good bug bug report there uh let's get uh sketch.js and wrap this up people uh sketch.js and um let's get rid of the style sheet i don't need the sound library and then what i'm going to do in sketch.js this is going to be i mean i want to do something with an interesting visualization but i'm just going to say fetch api um okay like visualize visualize visualize this will be an async function and i'll say await and then we'll say response equals await fetch api and then uh miles equals response.json um await and i can actually just get the people from it why do that not and then say names object got keys people and then i want to sort that by a dot miles minus b dot mi i want to sort them in order of miles maybe um i don't know what is going wrong with my then four let i equal zero i is less than names.length i plus plus um and um uh let's get the create div names index i people index names uh ran people.names so this is okay so let's see so in theory now if i very briefly um grab so i have this list in my miles.json file and if i go to whoops oh i need to serve the public directory um which is did i have that already oh i am i already have that okay so i should be able to go to now just uh oh let me rerun the server oh it's listening again that's great and now if i go to here a weight is only valid in async function oh i don't need the away there it's fine where's my syntax error it doesn't like this for whatever reason just do that for right now where is my syntax error oh by the way i don't know what i'm writing here so where is my syntax error async function it's making me crazy back tick line 12. ah thank you there we go this should work right yeah that's fine okay data is not defined where okay okay create div people okay people oh i don't need the dot miles what am i doing there there's no there's no uh each person is not a large okay there we go oh i want to say miles ah so confusing period all right uh why is it undefined people oh names index i let's use this let name of names name people name ah there we go and it's uh b minus a there we go so obviously this isn't really a i should do some kind of progress visualization something really nice but we've got it so uh in theory now um and i'm gonna uh the internet you're so annoying i'm gonna add something to make certain numbers be blocked because the immaturity of the internet never ceases to uh amaze me so now uh let's deploy this so um and i think i should i need to do a dot get ignore and so git ignore should ignore dot env it should ignore node modules and it should ignore it should ignore what else um should it ignore the database yes so it's gonna ignore the database so unfortunately i'm going to also need to then say here in the server if miles i think i can do file exist or exists exist sync miles.json if if if it exists um i think this is what i want to do let's get rid of this file delete i think this will work uh 11 line eleven oh oh whoops i think this is now what i want to do okay so did it create the file oh no it'll create the file hopefully once somebody tweet something let's see what happens okay we got an error oh right of course well what happened here i've run 21 miles cannot set property index.js line 43 oh there's because i made i i i have this structure like this so i think this is what i need to do yep okay we're good so we'll create that uh great all right so we'll create that file um and now i can no wait why is the dot env in there oh i put it in public ah ah help everybody move it yes okay so this looks good to me right now oh how do we do that like um is it because i haven't committed anything created app during live stream okay great okay okay so now uh we're going to go over to coding train we're going to create a new repo i'm going to call this gump 500. uh public tracking forest gump 500 mile files miles uh public um create repository and then we need to do this and then this um i need to create an invi env.sample um so hold on everyone i'm so close to showing my env file by accident uh env a sample um and now i can bring you back so this is an env sample file uh and i'm gonna say all right so i think next step would be next step is to go to glitch which is my deployment methodology du jour and i'm going to do new project import from github and i don't love the way this works but i'm going to just do it this way i want to figure out a better way of doing this but um i'm going to do it this way for right now we're going to import the project i'm going to call it uh gump 500. um and uh i think so i need all this in the dot emv file um let's look at the logs it should be giving me lots of nice errors start script is missing so i need this what's really annoying about this now is i want to make some changes here and there's not really i probably should just deploy this somewhere else there's there's really not a great way to use github and glitch and develop locally i probably what i probably should do is use the vs code plugin for glitch but just for right now i'm just going to say start just to get this going node index.js i think that's what i do um so now it's should be installing the packages i'm going to get get the correct um api keys and put them in here but so i'm i'm taking you away so i'm going to do that right now so going to my actual env file and copying that over to glitch closing out of that and closing out of it here okay so it is now um let's show the project um so i think is there oh it hasn't written the miles.json file probably because it needs a tweet so i'm going to tweet from my actual account no you know what i'm not going to do that right now i'm going to keep using this hey 16 miles or choo choo so now okay i got it oh it's not gonna no got it right here we go look at this okay it's working all right so uh i mean i have to i have to manually refresh this but we can see that um we can see that this is working okay so i'm gonna put this aside um this is what i would would love for any help with um uh i would gladly accept where is this github repo pull requests here to first of all help document what this project is in a readme um help do a better job of like error handling and parsing the tweets and authenticating it maybe i should check whether someone ran is adding to their total or offering a new total i don't know what would make sense um actually it would probably make more sense for me to use not a json file but like a database and data service in the cloud or something just so like i can sort of disconnect and have that be part of the env file like codes to a particular database and that way as i'm like redeploying it to glitch i don't have to like worry about if i'm losing the data so there's a lot of um there's a lot of possibilities um of things um that i think that that could be improved here so we'll see if this project catches on um and has any value um yeah i actually am starting to think that separating the twitter parsing from the front end might make sense because i don't really need a server i don't know so i i i leave this now to the wonderful people viewers of the coding train to jump on in and help work on this um and we'll see where this leads and then if it starts working well i might um actually see if we can um talk to um the folks who are organizing the gum 500 and make this something more of an official uh thing and i will return to it more um all right so that is that it is 11 38. i'm going to be wrapping up now let me close out all of these windows and we'll sort of like see what's going on here look at this oh look at this that's a lot of miles loku ad uh close that oh i didn't um that's fine i didn't post the glitch um we go sorry let me go back to glitch just so i can give people this app if they want to um gum 500 so uh share what do i do share show where's the share button uh remix new project switch project this is like crazy that i can't find where i share it losing my mind share there it is nice button there uh oh project links live site project members well i guess this is what i i thought there's like a link to the like a project page um which is sort of silly for me to be looking for that because these are the important things but anyway i will uh just share to discord um this is the glitch project and then but that's it might be a temporary deployment and then the um this is the actual um github whoops github repo okay so those are fine though you can find those in discord so now this has been a long live stream if you want a github to production deployment you can use reversal okay which needs a bit more configuration but can work with server apps and you can easily connect real databases to it easily heroku works pretty well for this kind of thing okay so that's uh says violet so these are good suggestions i really like glitch so i kind of like the idea of using it but maybe i need to rethink how i use it and when i use it so but yes maybe looking into versal or heroku are things that i might also take a look at thank you for those tips a date dot now is good yeah adding a date with um luan and other and in the chat or talking about adding a date a graph over time to so many pos there's a ton of possibilities um you know the i think a big core question here is um to what extent is the sort of selfreporting aspect of this going to fly like you know on the one hand the point of doing this is not to like there's no prize the the the what you get from actually participating is the fact that you actually ran those miles so reporting that you did if you didn't gives you nothing just ruins it for yourself and for other people so i think that it can work but um you know and i didn't i don't want to go down the road of like you know using runkeeper using strava and then upload and authenticate and oh off this and like upload your data it's just too much so that's why i thought like a hashtag for selfreporting being able to aggregate that information visualize it it's kind of a nice way of doing a quick project like this so that's what i'm thinking um we'll see i'll return to this we'll we'll revisit it next week so what's what else was on my list from today where's my list from today i have to point so far back in the chat there's no way i can pull that up again um okay so i should have just copy pasted it into like a text file or something but i'm gonna put this away why is this showing up as green because it definitely should be okay that's fine um let's close all this out i know where i can get my list i'm gonna bite the bullet and just go to youtube the coding train and pull up this by the way do you like my new thumbnails i like this on the some thumbnail oh look it shows this live and on here there like that uh okay um ah and so now let's see what did i not get to all right so um this is i'm not gonna check in on the live poll um you know i do have a very bad habit it would seem of starting these kind of like community projects like now this gum 500 one the random number one like leaving them to languish the live poll is somewhat in that state but i i will come back to using it at some point when i need to have a poll but let's let me now plan what's happening in 2021 so i'm going to go here to this so this is a file that i made i might have updated it i updated i guess on october 11th but i'm pretty sure i made this at the beginning of september and so i essentially want to oops uh grab everything from here and i want to create a new file um add file create new file we'll call this spring 2021 i could just dot md and i am going to paste all this in there and start to go through and figure out what i want to keep that i didn't get to and what will just sort of come back another time i'm sort of curious also to do an accounting of what i did um okay so which i really should do if somebody wants to help me out here um i i could i probably should do this live but um i would like to then annotate sort of annotate and archive that fall 2020 file um and but sort of mark what was done and what wasn't done so i could refer back to it later but i'm gonna do that here so basically i'm gonna i don't think that i'm going to keep much here although um i do know that what will come up eventually is neuro neuro evolution with um ml5.js but i did do object detection i never ended up doing videos on body pics i did model training did i do did i make something with json or cs video i don't remember i did some more convolutional neural network videos that's awesome runway never really got to the runway videos um i think what would be nice to keep from here is um and i think people have asked for is layton space walk so maybe i can um and you know there's there's more that i would come to but uh so i'll leave that there a to z is kind of now oh but let's see i i know what to call these i'm going to call them um i think this is somebody i bet you somebody else uses this name i want to make i want to start a new series of videos that are no more than uh what's a train what's a train name local stops express stops express stops maybe i want to make a lot of really really short um short videos like five minutes or less on like sort of javascript uh javascript language topics that i constantly uh refer to and the reason why i thought this fixed global npm permissions is kind of related to that but let me quickly make that list and people can give me some uh additions to this so but off the top of my head it is enhanced object literals object destructuring um a um generator functions a string template literals is that even the name for it so i want to do these and more uh express line i like that javascript express line um okay so that's something that i really want to do this year um and so so i'm bringing that up so i'll put this up here i don't know where to do it i never did this i did do this i did use the tenor uh okay discord bots so i do want to finish the discord bot series um i am using an api and i think i might use the movie db this is an api that i started working with for another project and it's kind of fun so that's just to sort of expand on the command handler deal with the new slash command i've made this command handler video that hasn't come out yet where i'm parsing all the commands with an exclamation point and from what i understand there's a new uh discord now has a new sort of like way of having commands with a bot using slash so i have to like look at that and then uh in embed embeds i don't know how to say that um fractal flame i want to do that i still need to do this side projects these are i want to keep this vinyl cutting and plotter on the list um uh guest this is a great question that uh okay week one is asking about nonsecret guest plans so it's not that any of the guests are secret but because nothing is like really formally confirmed yet i would prefer not to mention it until it's like but i do have uh two or three uh guest conductor videos that are in the works and you know it's really my fault that a lot of these didn't happen in december it's been a sort of slow process but that is coming thank you for asking that uh okay um so there's that and then uh and then what is the main content is the nature of code 2.0 so let's just look at this very quickly simon is saying call them javascript bytes if i want to keep them less than 256 seconds that's kind of a cool idea kind of like this idea uh i'm pretty sure that like somebody i'm sure somebody has a series called like javascript bytes video series or something you know when javascript bytes tech bytes right so i'll consider the only thing i don't like about that is it's not train related but let's let's go to nature of code to playlist all right lastly let's go to here so this is the course that i'll be teaching at nyu i actually might be using an lms system for the course but regardless i will sort of post sort of core material to this github repo um but looking at this now um you know again i have to register my utter disappointment and sadness about how youtube basically got rid of the whole learning playlist um because i no longer have this like great um uh like playlist with chapters um do i have it here that's one of the main things that show i don't know why how it doesn't show up on this page i gotta reorient this page playlists um let's go to yeah this is what i'm looking for it does say whoops close it does nicely still say learning playlist there so the only feature that youtube kept and to be honest the very thoughtful wonderful people who worked on this and i i you know i i there's so many things about uh the people who work at youtube that i love and appreciate and you know i understand didn't really take off i suppose or add the value that they were hoping for really really drives me crazy that it's gone so there's 21 if i go here i'm just going to click on this so this is what i started last spring and i got kind of interrupted by the pandemic so i need to look here and see like i have all the a whole set of videos for chapter one i have a whole set of videos for chapter two and i think this was i don't think i left any additional there was one i have to check with matia there was sort of like another video that i think i recorded and we sort of were editing and never actually released so there might be a 2.6 there somebody can help me remember do i say anything at the end of that video about 2.6 but i definitely need to do uh chapter three chapter three um so what's in chapter three um like oscillating motion angles radians angles angular motion polar coordinates i have some of these videos already but i think i will remake them uh and um let's go look i don't i don't know how detailed i'm gonna make this right now but i just wanna sort of like scan through this um yeah also springs pendulum springs yeah that's what i was kind of trying to remember waves pendulum and springs i've made some of the so where where am i here uh waves pendulum springs so that's chapter three chapter four i think i did these enough completed previously because i did a bunch of videos on particle systems so we'll have to see what i need to return to there chapter 5 uh mater.js oh no no but i think i'm reordering the book um i think i'm doing a ton so i'm gonna i'm not sure what i'm gonna do about the physics libraries i might so i definitely need to do um i think i'm reordering the book by the way so chapter 5 is going to be autonomous agents so this i need to do steering behaviors and i have a flocking coding challenge but um there's just more that i need to add individual group so i just want to add more to that chapter six uh physics libraries um a lot of so this is like right now chapter three really has to be done i have in chapter five so if i were to make i don't know how to prioritize these but i guess i'll use like bold is that bold i can't remember i think that's bold um so these are priorities because there's nothing not nuts i don't know how to think about this i'll just make the list uh chapters um chapter seven autonomous ca i'm just gonna make the whole list this is right now chapter because i really need to wrap up it's noon chapter eight is uh fractals i mean i just want to expand these and organize them and and make a playlist that includes some previous videos that i made some ancillary stuff around it so i'll have to like look at these individually um the gas the genetic algorithms it's really uh completed uh not sure what to do about this and then chapter 11 is the new chapter neuro evolution so this is really kind of my plan and what i'm hoping is that so khaled is asking in the chat um are those video tutorials or book chapters so i am going to be working on updating and revising the book and hopefully by the end of i don't know june having the second edition of the book completed so um and i'm going to make video tutorials along with that and my goal is to have the website have both all of the text of the book along with video tutorials embedded in it so and to completely relaunch this website and this is a huge project i don't know how i'm going to what's going to end up being the priority how i'm going to approach this and what's going to really get done but this is really this is my focus so um you know as much as i'm making this list of all sorts of other stuff you know i kind of don't want to i want to be able to like tie a little bow around the discord box to like finish that off i want to keep doing coding challenges and some of these side project things and i i think that these like little quick express stop videos could be really useful and it would be a nice experiment so i want to do all of that but um uh so but this is really this is really the focus so i think i'm gonna like leave this this is like a helpful list for things for me right now for what i want to focus on and do um pull out ideas and things from a nature of code book so that's what i'll do with the coding challenges you know simon did an accounting like that coding challenges playlist which is really the most popular series of anything that i do like that's that in many ways when i was first starting the youtube channel i had making video tutorials previously to that the coding challenges were the main thing and there were like 50 done in a year or more and i think last year i added like six and a lot of them are kind of not really in the style of what the coding challenges were originally envisioned so i i would like to get back to that in a way though that might have to wait until the summer if i'm really going to just more focus on this sort of like sequenced set of tutorials um mukesh is asking is there any video on p5 sound oh thank you this is exactly what i also need to do look at is intro uh code introduction to programming with p5.js i need to i i think some of those videos have fallen a bit out of date um and i need to be able to um also update them so let me go back to uh playlists um uh back to coding train playlists and i'm looking for um can i close this out here not this one so this is by the way um why i have this website you know because this is what i want to read i guess i could look at it through here sometimes i find being on youtube i one thing that would actually be great for the website in addition to the i i don't um there's a lot of things having to be redesigned here but it might be nice actually to just always have a link to the youtube version of the playlist because sometimes it's easier for me to browse there but if i'm looking at this i basically think that once i get to here variables um so these this is where i want to start redoing them um i'm trying to look here so many i mean but i might be able to just knock all this out in a day yeah actually oh somewhere i use circle there's somewhere where i use circle actually i think i redo almost all of this no can't be right so i'm not sure so these were made in 2015 uh i think yes so i need to make a list so i um where's that stupid playlist uh will this get will this find it no yep the trailer all videos there we go so this so i think i need to do looking at this yeah not this one 2.1 to 2.5 so it redo 3.1 3x 4x 5x um 3x 4x oh yeah this um and you know i might rethink how these are i think these are okay i think i there's somewhere where i say circle object and that doesn't work anymore but maybe that's actually um where i'm doing something with like object literals somewhere i don't remember where that is um and then maybe these are okay i can't remember i don't think they're using the web editor but i think that's kind of okay so i think i'll make that my goal and kind of leave oh 7.1 7.2 i should redo those and then so i think this will be a realistic goal 7.1 7.2 so i think these are the ones that i um want to redo so okay good for right now um i'm just going to commit this file um we should redo this this should use the new convention of i'm gonna you know i might mess up too much stuff by doing this right now so i'll do this later um so there we go so this is now the plan now schedule before i leave i'm gonna leave in just a few minutes um but um before i go that's noon i definitely gotta go my goal is to have weekly live streams which is essentially what you saw today i didn't do too much goofing off or reading of random numbers or looking at community contributions those will be segments that i hope to do um during my live streams um today was just sort of a get organized say hello live stream um and then um what uh and then i will be doing pretty regular like multiple times per week hopefully tutorial recording sessions so if you've been thinking about whether or not you want to join the coding train as a member and you can go to the channel hit the join button um those recording sessions uh will often live broadcast those available to people who are members so for those who remember stay tuned i'm hopefully going to be starting to do that next week where i'll be i don't know what i'll start with whether it'll be chapter 3 uh 2.1 to 2.5 redo the new um express stops idea or finish the discord but those are the things that i'm hopefully going to do two days next week of recording stuff so um thinking about how long it takes to do um editing and captioning um hopefully there'll be lots of new videos being released on the channels by the end of the month um but prop but i'm i'm no long i'm most likely not going to be doing weekend live streams anymore oh thank you niraj uh you can see my lights are blinking over here um i um what did i want to say i lost my train of thought i i think well ideally this time slot friday mornings will be my live stream weekly time slot i'm probably gonna do about three per month i might take some fridays off to get more just tutorial recording in frankly because i really want to get all this nature of code stuff done so my goal is three live streams per month one or two recording sessions per week um we'll see how that goes one guest video per month that's like a nice sort of like a goal for me um we'll you know at least through june we'll see what happens this summer um but um so yeah so next friday that's when i'll be back i might switch the the weekly live stream to a different time because fridays might actually not work but that's kind of my plan so i hope everyone's doing well i hope this was somewhat useful or interesting to you today i welcome again your contributions on um this gump 500 project and i also need to put this sketch um onto github um so people and we'll host it with github pages probably so that people can uh contribute to this um generating the train whistle design um project as well all right ah reinforcement learning yeah q learning let's put thank you for that let's see if we can put um onto this list you know this is kind of a uh this is a stretch goal seems unlikely got to get rid of that fulltime day job uh reinforcement learning q learning there's an nyu student who is a coding trained viewer who then went on to apply to nyu is now at nyu who has been sending me some really excellent tutorials and examples with cue learning i think could be a good model for um some video tutorials all right um i'm gonna play my goodbye song which is about uh three minutes long i'm gonna sort of keep an eye on the chat see if there's any quick questions i can mention and then otherwise i'll be back a week from now don't forget to join the discord i'll paste the link i mean i'll press a button here which will send a link to the chat um oh the dog really needs to go for a walk so i've got to go oh i forgot i have a new prop like just like my bell with my train whistle this one i'll put it near the mic i think i should use this instead of the bell i don't know what i should use it for yeah here's simon's uh accounting of all the coding challenges 2016 47 1741 1841 1926 you know i think i think exceptions can be granted for 2020 what a year that was uh three playlist whoops on uh p5 play i don't know is p5 play still actively maintained i'm not sure hi chris hi nolan yes i remember you donated uh andrew is saying new content is always great but nobody should sleep on your old content yes say hello on behalf of all of us to pickles well i don't know actually we call her pickle but i think the name pickles is actually pretty great use the sound when i make a commit it's a good idea more music in 2020 100 on the coding train will from america helped me put together some stuff for the processing telethon so i got to get back in touch with will and continue that i don't know i i feel like i was uh um a little less crazy today and just kind of like hanging out and typing stuff in and talking and chatting i don't know if people think of the vive i barely played any sound effects or music or did any goof goofy stuff so maybe this is the way the stream should be maybe i should get back into my more zany internet character well well this is the end of the song 10 seconds to go i'm gonna take you out with this dot song and i will see you all next friday live on the coding train is when i'll be back all right goodbye everybody see you next week as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop get stuck i'm gonna do this stop stop i just stopped this dot never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm going to say once again here we go let's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens the kittens and kittens the kittens and kittens and the kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over the kittens and kittens wait just at the last second it's the last second there's a new member hello and welcome member whose name i can't say because it's written in a another language with a character set that i don't know how to pronounce but welcome with a nice little beautiful watermelon uh i would say a little slice of watermelon profile picture welcome to the coding train your very own random number is ten thousand uh is anybody actually still watching this that's on it's on page 43 it is column one two zero one two three four five six seven column eight you should know that because it's the last column is column nine and it is row two thousand one hundred twenty it is ten thousand seven hundred and ninety eight so welcome i don't know if you're actually watching or if you just happen to join that's the thing i'll get the notification in the live chat whether or not somebody is watching or just um happen to join um through another means while i happen to be live streaming but you got a little extra minute with me here but i'm really saying goodbye now i'm gonna click this button that says end stream and i'll see you all next week goodbye whoops no end go here end you
