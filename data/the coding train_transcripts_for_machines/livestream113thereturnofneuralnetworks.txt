hello happy 2018 it is me Dan stripping life on a Friday as I hope to and expect to all of 2018 I'm sure on this and Fridays here and there but this is the coding train I'm starting a new year fresh but I hope that some of you were able to tune in to my end of the year livestream where I broke out a keyboard and tried to sing some songs hopefully not have you actually watched that it was so I'm just hoping that everything seems to be working yeah so here's the thing I really had planned to do some grooming and freshen up but I don't know if you know this I kept this backup pager cuz it's really really cold for something you probably live in parts of the world where it is much colder and it is even colder than this yearround but for New York City it's quite cold in I find that this is like having a builtin ski mask basically so as soon as the weather warms up a little bit I will get back to the being a little less I don't know wilderness man thing that I look that I'm going for right now okay so yes I see that there are some viewers from Quebec which as we say here Quebec I think it's Americanized pronunciation of Quebec right my right I don't know if I'm right so but maybe to your chagrin or maybe to your happiness today is the day where I'm making a commitment to continue doing a set of tutorials and examples and coding challenges around AI and machine learning and so in the broadest sense what I'll be starting with here today is continuing my playlist where I was building a little JavaScript neural network library from scratch bit by bit that's what I'm gonna do probably for the entire time today up until about 400 p.m. Eastern time I'm getting the audio is out of sync you know this is what happens I cannot control this the audio being out of sync although actually hold on a second let me let me see usually I say that I can't but oh my goodness my old hole let me look here in my settings here because I do do something I do actually have a builtin delay I think that I put in one point when I was out of sync I don't see it anymore no way I forget where that is an open broadcast studio advanced output audio oh no it's fine so I'm gonna I'm gonna just keep going one thing is that eventually these videos most of what I do today will be edited into shorter chunks that get uploaded later and the wonderful matcha who helps me with this can often realign the audio in what I like to call post Claude nooks young the French is like something about French is filtering it's through my head today postproduction so even if the audio is a little bit out of sync in this YouTube version but I think mostly I don't have control over this because I just have a computer I have some software open broadcast studio I have a microphone some cameras I send it out to the internet and it arrives on your screens in some form so I'm gonna keep going yeah I know I know it appeared the beard what can I do it's very cold this Alps so let me get you some updates what's gonna happen this month is I will be here every Friday and I'm gonna continue I just already said all this me know just get started okay well this is another business there's a new year let me tell you about what is out there on the internet that you could look at related to the coding train so you can if you like the work that I do you can support me on patreon patreon.com slash coding train you may also find actually all these links at the coding train com you can see here latest video this should be me this should show up here be live streaming I don't know why that's my latest video you can subscribe you can like all the videos I'm told that the machine learning algorithm that YouTube employs to recommend its videos appreciates when you like and subscribe and you can find some links to the videos here I know what I'm done you can also some of the anytime I use a book all the books that I use as learning materials for myself you can find those at amazon.com slash shop the coding train you can also get yourself your very own coding train branded it's not at all I wish I should have a coding trick what about what I turned into this 2018 apparently is the year me just trying to sell you stuff but train whistle here and that's pretty much it so that's what you're watching now I also like to remind you that I use in almost all of my tutorials open source software from the processing foundation I also full disclosure and one of the organizers directors members I don't know what the right term is of the processing foundation it's a project that I spend a lot of time working on and you can also support the processing foundation it is we're not prosecution is a non for profit entity so your donation is tax deductible depending on the laws of you wherever you with but certainly for the US is tax deductible so those are the kind of as this is a new year 2018 things that I would again Simon is making a point in the chat which is a good one that I should say machine learning and deep learning instead of AI and ml so here's yeah so I think a long time ago when I was doing me when I started this playlist I kind of had some introductory video that talked about the terminology of machine learning deep learning artificial intelligence I like to think I agree that there is something very specific that I'm doing right now which is using neural network based systems for machine learning and then that might turn into deep learning as these are neural network based systems get more complex and sophisticated and the amount of data that's going in them gets much larger but I like to in this very abstract way if the camera went off already think about what I'm doing as broader than that while the tutorials yes right now are really zoned in highly specific what I'm interested in is as a creative coder just to use that term for a moment what are ways that my systems that I develop can appear have the illusion of our perhaps even actually have intelligence and in that sense artificial intelligence is a nice really broad term for that so what does it mean for Boyd flocking with other Boyd's on the screen to suddenly have a brain and make decisions based on a neural network or what does it mean to have all this data that's coming from you know some type of quantified self system and visualize it and analyze it in a machine learning like way so there's a lot of that don't really make much sense but I really want to think of this sort of like broad that that broad picture and I'm not this is not a channel on this is not a tutorial for kind of you know specifically related to only data science and you know machine learning in a kind of scientific which is actually a really good thing to learn I don't know why I said it like this that's what this is this is me being scientific apparently but so I'm trying to treat this sort of broad creative approach okay yes pointing out all these excellent things in the chat you're wondering what this chat that I'm looking at this is my this is a slack channel for patrons of the coding train there's also a youtube chat where everyone's telling me that the audio is out of sync I'm aware of it where is that in open broadcast I just want to make sure I didn't yeah I'm gonna just take a minute to look at this audio issue one more time we're open broadcasting studio audio delay where is that setting audio outofsync huh sound settings Advanced tab audio global hmm I don't have an advance tab miles of the in collection tools under settings probably oh it Vance I do have an advanced tab audio audio default I do not see in a delay stream delay 20 seconds 20 seconds people tell you for some people are okay it's some people it's out of sync which means there's probably nothing I can do about it I swear at one point though I did really I didn't add a setting clap alright alright everybody start off 2000 team with a nice I'm gonna do two things actually one thing I want to know is if my if my audio is different than my sound effect audio this is just out of my own curiosity okay little live live little live live stream debugging so I am now going to clap and so my questions for you are did you hear the clap before you saw the clap after you look laughs how long was that play now I really want to check this all so I'm gonna do this ticktock sound no that's not a good one I'm gonna do the buzzer sound and I'm gonna raise my hand when you hear that when I I'm gonna go like this when the buzzer goes off and see if the buzzer and my finger at the same time even know I don't know I don't know what I'm doing there's a delay in that sound doesn't start at the beginning when I hit the button nevermind does it that dust I'm gonna hit the snare drum and now was there is there is that so 200 milliseconds sound was right see that 200 millisecond delay i think i have a 200 millisecond delay audio ahead so where is that settings advanced somebody must somebody watching must know somebody must know open broadcast studio audio maybe it's actually in hold on hold on maybe it's actually in here ah mic advanced audio properties I found it volume sync oh yeah there is a synch offset by a hundred milliseconds interesting yeah I know where it is now so I wonder if I should I'm gonna delete that I'm gonna get rid of the sync offset I got it I can get rid of that offset okay I got rid of the offset and I'm gonna see is it worse or better I know everybody says who cares I don't know why I'm not gonna know where I won't waste too much time on this but I can fix it worse same worse worse worse better same same worse worse same same worse worse same same worse worse worse worse worse or same same same words oh this is very scientific of me okay I think I know what to do I know what to do and I've got it now everyone be amazed at my amazing ability to fix the audio sync issue and here we go ready here comes another clap it's gonna be perfect alright so I made it 300 everybody that's what you people in patriot in the slack channel over time you can all see I really should use this Bell but you can't start for you to see it so I think I got it perfect great okay uh so let me talk about some things number one I want to mention that I'm gonna mention this book again you go to amazon.com slash shop slash coding train this is a book that I used first of all back up a little bit let me let me open up the playlist let me to open up the playlist YouTube Schiffman and what's the one that I'm looking for under playlists this one okay so this is a playlist that I began back in when did I do this I think it was when were these videos published it doesn't tell me here these videos were made at the end of May I believe and some may perhaps in June and then I had this bicycle accident and I kind of took a couple months off and then when I came back it was the beginning of the semester and I was teaching other stuff so I wasn't really able to get back to this so this now will be my top primary topic for this semester which doesn't mean when I say primary it's still planning on doing other I have some github stuff but I want to keep doing do I got to go see more of those coding challenges that I want to get out of the way I really want to do some more videos about working with processing in Eclipse and Java to make processing libraries so I do have a bunch of things in my on my mind that I would like to get to huh I should I need to get to I term at some point no I did Chrome extensions though but at least for the next couple months this is what I'm a focusing on now some this was actually fortuitous the what's that thing the silver lining of looking on the bright side of having had this delay is new stuff has happened number one three if I go to my Twitter we just tweeted about this because this is just so darn good way better than anything I could possibly make three three blue one Brown is a YouTube channel and a three blue one Brown has several different videos about neural networks and how they work they're really good so these have come out since I started that and so these are a really excellent resource for a deeper dive into the mathematics these are animated they're edited there's a lot of beautiful work done thoughtfully done on these videos they make so much sense a wonderful animations it's very different than my style of like haphazard trying to explain things in live coding but so I think that's good in that I there's no way I'd ever be able to make something of this quality that within me but this is an excellent resource to dive a little bit deeper into some of the maths behind how neural networks work as you know along with or before you watch my videos where I'm gonna try to code this stuff so that's number one that's excellent the other the other thing that's happened is that a new JavaScript library has come out called deep learn j/s deep learn j/s is a JavaScript library that is you might call it like a tensor flow for the web it doesn't really help if you don't know what tensor flow is but it is a hardware accelerated machine intelligence library for the web so what I'm doing right now what I will continue doing today is create this own let me open up atom create this here we are this is good I've been working on this somewhat ridiculous matrix and I'm going to call I'm going to change it to es6 class a class but matrix library which has like a bunch of functions like I could add a number to every element of a matrix or I could add two matrices element wise together so I've been working on this rather absurdly and I intend to continue and finish this the what I want to have hopefully by the end of this month is a complete set of tutorials for building your own vanilla basic neural network in JavaScript with no other dependencies p5 might be a dependency in terms of how I might visualize and draw it but the library itself that does the neural network math will all be there but this isn't really going to get us very far when we want to do some maybe more realworld or faster more optimized projects for the web and that's where deep learn Jas comes in I think I mentioned in some of my videos where I started this matrix math stuff that there's math Jas and like GPU dot rocks there's a bunch of JavaScript implementations but deep learned yes it's a project developed at by Google of the big picture research group up in Cambridge sort of part of the Google brain initiative it's an open source library it's not an official Google product but it's an open source library and there's I encourage you to check out the examples tutorials all this stuff so in relation to this along with a whole bunch of other folks here at ITP students and other staff faculty and researchers there is a library under development called if I go to github.com slash ITP NYU /p 5ml I think what could be the no it's a that's not the final name of it any in any case let me find that repo p5 sorry t plur and j s so this is also why am I not logged in here I'm gonna sign in to get up at some point so this is also a library that's under development that will also allow me and you to do a lot more with these machine learning algorithm is if I can summarize it step 1 build and in a vanilla meaning basic with no dependency is not worrying about being optimized or having it really be very good but build all the pieces of a neural network from scratch in JavaScript to understand how it works step 2 replace the engine that does the math the matrix math that's in that implementation with deep learn Jas so that it works a little bit faster step 3 start to actually use deep learn Jess which has a set of classes and objects for different neural network architectures to do projects and so just let me just show you for example if I go under examples and let's go into this KNN image classifier so let's actually run this for fun let's run let's see if this works this is by the way a simple if you might have you've seen Google's the creative labs project teachable machines which I am also going to reference in some tutorials that used as a explanatory this is very similar to that and so Mike I gotta turn my webcam on so here I am I'm going to do this so that's me training this neural network system this machine learning system let me just say that category a now I'm going to do category B and now what I want to do is start guessing so I fear II it should know whenever I go I'm a whatever I go I'd be I'm going to start guessing and here we go hold on training this design could use a little work but you know usually I'd have a higher resolution but you can see it here let's look at confidence of a is oh I'm standing in front of it hold on so you can see confidence in a and confidence of B so these are the kinds of creative projects that we can think about making also um and and there's lots more so I want to get to all this but I've got to start somewhere okay so that's my plan and we can see where I left off this is where I left off well I left off update on machine learning video series which was kind of like I'm gonna take a break from this for a while but I left off here matrix math part 2 so what I hope to get done today although I'm quickly running out of time just randomly talk is matrix math part 3 which will be doing actual matrix multiplication matrix product and then implementing feedforward the feedforward algorithm for the neural network and then next week I hope to come back and look at training and back propagation so that's gonna be that's kind of my plan okay so I'm looking and it looks like I see Chris who has done a lot of work ITP student who's done a lot of work with the P 5 ml library is in looks like is in the live channel so hi Chris answer all your questions okay now so before I get started let's just see if I can if there's any questions I can answer in the YouTube chat really quickly hi from Sweden it's all right there don't look like there's too many questions there people are asking for shoutouts I don't know what is the Amazon store for coding train please okay oh and through that question yeah I should mention also Suraj I didn't mention Suraj that this is another YouTube channel which I would highly recommend ah no I know I feel I just sort of that was kind of like assumed for me so I also would highly recommend if you're interested in this topic I mean this channel is amazing and completely dedicated to this topic so I would definitely check out Suraj's channel which I watch all those videos as well ok yes I will be making some processing things in the future will you make a tutorial on how backpropagation works on convolution or recurrent Nets I don't know I mean again my plan is to do all the pieces of the vanilla neural network from scratch but using a library like deep learn jazz that's gonna have the architecture for a convolutional neural network built into it so I can really just use the library to implement a convolutional neural network but I certainly will talk about what it is and how it works but I don't intend to build every new neural network architecture that's been developed that comes out of paper from scratch in JavaScript in this I don't think I'm capable of that I don't think that would make sense so ok the store so there are two places if you're interested in coding trade merchandise there's coding train store Envy calm and then there is where I have all the books that I'm using and there's a bunch of them need to add amazon.com slash shop slash the coding drain ok all right so now I think I can get started oh oh it's three blueberries what is talking to me videos are so good I can't it's like I wash it I'm like oh Mike oh my goodness what am i doing I'm like a complete crazy person these this is what like this is the model of Education different styles different strokes for different folks hopefully what I'm doing also has value but those are really good all right okay so it's this is gonna be a little tricky because I got to get sort of back into this frame of mind I did try to do that dukes I did some reading and actually watch some of my videos she almost never do just to try to see what I covered and that was a that was kind of a shock to see what they're like but this is where I am in so let me get this I don't need the whole desktop open here in Adam I'm wonder if this is a new year if I should just switch over to using Microsoft Visual Studio I guess not today I'm not ready for that today I feel like it's a new year I should start like I want to use glitch I love glitch this year I'm going to use that just close all this stuff I'm gonna close this let me go to terminal desktop now open this up one thing I just want to check here also is I might as well go ahead and update to the more recent versions of p5 and and then what else was I saying I want to do I need to run a server and okay so there shouldn't be anything there really this is what matters and okay all right yes I'm gonna do the convert to es6 okay so first I'm going to make a video that the first the first video that I'm going to do here I guess will be ten point eight which will be kind of like a little bit of an interstitial video of like moving over to es6 and I know um one thing I asked this in the slack channel I didn't get a firm answer I'm pretty let me try to look this up if I were to use the array function map the array function map is not does it can I look for it somewhere here that's actually it's not he actually es sick yes yes five I guess I just think of it as es6 cuz I've never used it and then when I was like looking at yes sick stuff I was looking at these things okay so I'll mention that as well because I want to do want to convert everything to es6 keep finishing the tutorial and then i also want to use some advanced array functions just to but I'm gonna not use the and the arrow syntax and all that stuff but I'm not gonna do that at first okay okay so it is 236 p.m. we have about an hour and a half left you can hear me blowing my nose probably because I forgot to hit mute but life will go on yes it's true I am back and I am in severe cold weather revisiting my machinelearning playlist which is really not at this point of machine learning it's something stuck I be hurt we try that again hello I'm back I'm finally getting to that neural network playlist which left off in May and I'm continuing it now you might be watching again you might be watching through the future when it's all been completed but you can as you could see some time passed and Here I am again now the last video in this playlist looked at vector math and I believe I looked at adding oh I can actually look it up here the last thing I did was this function multiply which was simply multiplying a matrix by a scalar so taking each element of a matrix and multiplying it by a single number now you also might notice here matrix prototype multiply yeah what is that well since I last did these videos I have started adopting yes six classes class is a template for creating an object that's part of ECMAScript version six yaddayaddayadda I have a whole playlist about that stuff if you don't know about classes you can go and look at those tutorials but before I move on and finish the vector the matrix math that we need to build this neural network I want to rewrite all of these when I have so far with es6 so that's all I'm gonna do in this video okay so let's actually do that first let's wander over I was first building a neural network object the idea of a neural network is having input nodes a hidden layer and output nodes so let me first change this to be a class class neural network and then once I have a class this constructor function actually can now become constructor called constructor and you know what what the the method that I'm kind of adopting is when I pass arguments in I actually give those arguments and parameters I guess in this case in the constructor definition I give those parameters the same name as the property's attached to the object and they are differentiated by stay with me this dot that's right okay so so there we go so now that converted the neural network class it wasn't a class before but if constructor function into an es6 class now I've got to do the same thing with the matrix constructor function so this was the matrix constructor function and I now want this to be a class called matrix and I'm gonna put this around everything and I don't know what Adam wants me to do but okay and then this constructor function is now called constructor this is what happens to the constructor and this is just the randomize function all these functions that are attached to the prototype can just be written by their name inside of the class this is ad and this is multiply and that's what we're gonna be working on the next video all right so so in a moment I want to check let me let me check to make sure this is like still working so if I go to the browser refresh the page I should be able to say things like let m equal a new matrix 3 3 by 3 i should be able say console table m and I can see oops nope I think this mistake in my previous console table M matrix and you can see there it is so this seems to be and I could say m dot add the number 5 and then I could look at it so it still seems to be working I have a matrix that's 3 by 3 it by default it's filled with zeros if I add 5 to it it looks like five if I say m dot randomized now I can look at it again it has random numbers so it's still working that's good now here's the other aspect of this one thing you might notice is that I'm doing a lot of loops and array operations like I'm saying hey for every element of this array at index I did next J do this thing except there are actually you probably know this already I'm very slow on the draw here whoops let me sorry this was not on you probably know this already I'm a bit slow to catch up with these things there are a bunch of useful array functions I often think of them as es6 like this video is about converting it to es6 but really they've been around before es6 and these are those these functions called like map reduces one fill is one and I filter I actually don't remember what filter does I know what these do and I think having access to using some of these array functions will make this matrix lot will be useful in the development of this matrix library however for simplicity's sake as I go on into the next video I am still going to do all of the matrix math operations in the sort of longest long winded astray it's not actually a word but in a very longwinded way then I think and I'll try to come back and and use some of these and I and I should mention that where am I going with this eventually this I want to learn and understand all of these matrix operations and write the code for them to kind of get my hands in there and figure it out but in the end I'm gonna actually take out all of this stuff and replace all of the matrix operations with a library from Google called deep learn so stay tuned there's gonna be a lot more about this live and a helper library where deep learn can use with p5 in future videos alright so I think that's pretty much it for this video I'm now ready to kind of like get back up to speed and the things that I need to do our finish this matrix class with more useful matrix math operations I need to be able to multiply two matrices together and understand what it means to do that and then also uh and then finish this to add the rest of the functionality for the neural network that uses that stores all the pieces of the neural network in these matrices and implements the algorithms I'll be getting to all that stuff so see you in the next video Oh audio way before in the the sink was not fixed for the other one okay that's fine you know that all unfortunately that'll match you will have to fix that but I can fix that right now for the future whoops I didn't that didn't occur to me that that would be an issue Solon let me fix that really quick I realize there's just two separate audio settings for each no it's the same that's weird the audio settings are the same for both so hold on let me let's just let's just be sure about this whoops and of course the cameras going off ah whoops canceled Oh weird yeah weirdly the video that's so weird I can actually see the delay in I could probably restart open broadcast studio but mmm do you guys mind if I that's really weird wonder why it does that can I do is there an advanced video is it possible I have a like delay on this hold on sorry just excuse me for a second so I don't understand huh I don't understand what's why it's doing that yeah unfortunately I know I could probably have separate settings for each one but I think I'll spend all my time doing that yeah Simon's mentioning let in the in the for loop where did where did I oh my goodness oh thank you all right let's see wait this video is not over yet I forgot that I should also replace bar with let's replace all all right why why why do you keep meeting me to put my password in hold on a second I think I'm something weirds going on I just realized something a little bit weird is going on I have a feeling yeah I know why it's it's asking for my password every time I change it because these this files are not owned by this particular login and so I have to fix that okay that should be fine all right now whatever all right yes I do read this chat Jeffrey but just very rarely I don't know what to do about the other yeah I can see that it's I can actually yeah wow that's a huge delay so I didn't realize this I can actually see the delay in I can actually see the delay in what in my preview window but why why would it be different for different cameras is there does anybody know how to do the video delay in open broadcasting studio settings advanced video output streaming huh the camera was restart stream all right let's let me restart the stream YouTube is actually usually pretty good at it if I shut it down and restart it it keeps it as one thing why not I'm just curious why not try I'm gonna just try that okay everybody I'll be right back yeah the delay actually looks completely gone to me now which interestingly enough it might be there might be a delay there because I have the builtin delay so check this again and here did that fix it okay great all right great okay all fixed thank you everybody all right so I just have to remember so let me think about this what do I want to do I want to multiply okay so first of all I gotta get my terminology right let's see some of you guys can help me with this one thing I want to do is actually let's go back to this particular video and let me see what the whiteboard looked like at the end so this is oh I'm in the wrong camp grammar okay you can now see the difference of the beer so this is what can I please move out of the way my goodness yeah that's a little bit better there we go all right so this is what I had before if you don't mind bearing with me for a second I'm going to I'm over here I know you can't see me but I am erasing the array functions from the whiteboard and I am going to kind of rewrite some of that stuff my video looks so dark so scaler elementwise dot products so I'm just gonna write these scalar elementwise and then three dot product okay so I just made that list which you can now see there and yeah so so what I want to do is get my terms right what I'm talking about is matrix multiplication but there are different countries let me just think about this and I'm gonna kind of like do this twice I know people don't really like it when I do that actually no one's actually ever said that I try to get rid that glare okay so in other words when I when I when I'm doing multiplication there's I could multiply by a scalar in which case that has to be element wise or I could multiply by another matrix and then that could be element wise if only if this matrix is this so if I have a matrix some arbitrary matrix you have same exact size as you right if I'm gonna do oh sorry if I'm gonna do element wise this is me just practicing by the way I'm gonna do it it has to be the same exact size right because if I have two matrices and I want to multiply each element by each other element it's got to be the same size or it could be like weirdly the same number of rows only now but then if or no that's Orica multiplied by a vector I can multiply also by a vector just do kind of like element wise per row but that's but this is called this element wise same exact size that's called that like hod how do you how do you say that that a product that I'm gonna get this wrong Hadamard products right so that's the Hadamard product I believe this is an adornment to go through and explain all this again in that second Hadamard product Hadamard and then if I'm doing the if I'm taking one matrix multiplied by another matrix and doing the dot product I could also do then there's the dot product which with two vectors would give me a scalar but and in this case the row let's let's look let's look at this matrix let's find like a Wikipedia or reference matrix top product oh look at this nice forget about Wikipedia thank you for this okay I want to look at this the the matrix dot product we end up with a matrix that has the same number of rows as the first order matters the that sort of distributive or associative property what all these things are I don't remember associative property come on just give me an image to show it to me all right this is a distributive associative property multiplication right yes which is that the order I could change this is not true for commutative commutative yes yes okay we c'mon we are still at commutative properties that what I'm looking for thank you yeah either order but not true for matrices for matrix multiplication okay there's cross product I don't want to get into that so I'm what I'm trying to just is that correct to call this the dot product and that is the the you have to have the order matters a dot B B has to have the same number of columns as a has rows columns must match rows because and let me just practice this again if I have a b c d e f times g h a b c d e f g h j right if this is what I'm doing this equals I'm done this in so long the do this again don't worry when I'm way off the screen here this equals I'm gonna get a 2 by 2 right because I'm gonna get 2 rows from here I always get wait a second yeah yeah yeah I always get the number of rows and then the number of columns comes from here no no no because I can I can multiply this by oh I'm confused I confused myself matrix product columns has to equal rows rows didn't have to equal columns thank you I knew that was real and you hos backwards here okay okay the columns has two of a has to equal the rows of B this was not going to work de ABCDE F a B where did see go hey b c d e right so for example what am i doing here this is two columns well this was still oh my god I've lost my mind the number of call this is fine the number of columns has to equal the number of rows because what I'm gonna get now is this is you always say rows first so this is 3 by 2 and this is 2 by 2 and so my result and actually the one we care about the most here is just because what we're gonna but I mean let me explain it this way is we're gonna get two by two here at the end and the way that we do that is with the dot product so it is let's let's pull up that math is fun page right here where we basically take the dot product of the vectors right so we take I yeah yeah yeah right right this example is probably a better one did I do it wrong again I told did I do it wrong again let's just do the same as the so the columns has to equal the rows in a second oh yeah yeah no no I'm right I just like the I like this so you could see here the columns has to equal the number of rows this is actually kind of a nicer way of looking at an example because neither of the matrices is a square so I kind of like that so I wonder if maybe that's a better we can borrow we can borrow ABC that's what we can start the way head start a d e f and then we could say for example ABCDE F a b c d e f g h i j k l okay so I know why I wrote the LD way this totally makes sense of course the the number of columns has to equal the number of rows because we're going to because we're going to take these three there we go we're doing the dot product I the reason why I was saying a number of rows has to equal the number of columns I was thinking about it backwards I knew that way I had to take the dot product of this times this I was thinking of this as a row and this is the column but this is a row made up of three columns and the length of this is what matters so we basically make a new matrix by taking the dot product of this vector with with this that goes here this vector with this that goes here this vector with this that goes here and this vector with this and that goes here okay so this would be a times G Plus B times I plus C times K and this would be d times G Plus D times I plus D okay I think I've got it right and what I'm being told breaking news is that you can just call this the matrix product so this element wise is the Hadamard product and the this is the matrix product so what would be Oh M X and P oh yeah that's interesting okay so this would be am I correct about the Hadamard product that they have to be equal is there a special way to do it if they're not equal I don't know that I'm gonna I don't know that I don't think I actually need this product so I actually just only need to reference it let's see if I'm a matrix product do we have a nice Wikipedia page there we go it's our a nice diagram oh yeah look at this awful diagram well actually probably a beautiful diagram okay I like this one okay great great okay so I can use matrix product is the standard sure product that's interesting okay all right so now what I need to do is do this tutorial oh I forgot I have to actually implement the code for that that's gonna be interesting I'm gonna do a terrible job of that I'm almost certain you know what's interesting actually is I'm gonna do a video later this month about unit tests working with a continuous integration company etc and actually one thing that I could do is test to make sure as you modify the code it's the math still works that could be something I could do okay we erase all this I'm gonna I'm gonna redo all this I had to work it out in my head try to make this a little bit cleaner okay okay all right yes no I realized that the Hadamard product is certainly useful I just don't know and if I'm ranking a full like fully implemented matrix library that I really wanted people to use I would want to make sure every math possibility is accounted for but in this case I'm just kind of like putting stuff in when I need it for this neural network so okay anything else oh I'm looking at the chat okay okay everybody's everybody's got great suggestions yeah I am not erasing the whiteboard with my hand I had a paper towel kind of like cupped inside my hand okay right people are telling me begin with the neural network the linear algebra will follow I got you I got you what you don't what you might not realize is that's actually what I've already done I have this playlist and I have introduced all of these concepts and now I needed the matrix math so I'm doing it but that actual kind of this is happening in a very longwinded way you know I probably could in some other universe do all this stuff in one video that just takes like an hour or something but I'm kind of breaking this up into parts because I I take a long time to do stuff okay here we go now I don't want to use a squirrel that's right I don't wanna use a square matrix as an example even though I make it simple because you can get you can really mislead yourself what do you have square matrices and thinking things work in a certain way when they don't okay it happened here to my alright and we are here this is the video in this playlist which really comes right after 10.7 matrix backs part 2 this is matrix math part 3 where I am finally going to look at okay matrix multiplication or really I should say matrix multiplication okay so if you recall what I'm doing with I know it look quite different but I already covered that well bring this one was made a while ago anyway if I have a matrix right and what I mean by a matrix is a grid of values and let's say I have one that looks like this a b c d e this is a 3 no no it is a 2 by 3 matrix we always refer to the number of rows before the number of columns now what does it need and and and previously with when i made some videos just about vectors i talked about this thing called the dot product but i'm gonna change that here and write the matrix product so first of all what does it mean to multiply a matrix by by something i could just multiply this matrix by a single number and that's what's known as well it's not really that's what's known as a scaler sorry scaler if i multiply this by a single number then i just say if this was a whole bunch of ones multiply it by two i got a whole bunch of two's you know if i multiply by two double every value in the matrix and I think actually now I did that in the previous video I could also do what's known as element wise multiplication and that is also referred to as the hata mard i don't know if i'm pronouncing that correctly and do somebody in the live chat that's going on right now told me that it also son is called a short product and what that means is imagine I have another matrix that's exactly the same size as this one and in fact I could kind of do that little small over here and I could say G H I J kl right so I could have another matrix if it's exactly the same size and mine if I multiplied these together I have a new matrix which is has a times G B times H C times I D times J elementwise each each element of the matrix get multiplied by its corresponding other element now I don't those are perfectly valid I'm looking for my eraser perfectly valid ways of doing multiplication oops but what I'm really interested in is the matrix product and the reason why I'm interested in the matrix product is because I want to use the matrix product for a neural network for example this node in a neural network is going to be the result of the weighted sum of all of the input nodes x weighted connections and this one is also going to be the weighted sum of all of the input nodes x weighted connections and so on and so forth and so these weights are stored in a matrix and the inputs come in in a matrix as well so the inputs we could think of like this and so what I actually need hold on time out for a second I got confused so if if the columns the number of columns of the first one the number of columns of the first thing has okay so the weighted the weights go here they're multiplied by the inputs got it okay sorry so if this is how I'm representing the inputs then you might discover that I have this matrix of all these weights that I need to both apply those inputs by to get the new values of the outputs of this hidden layer now anyway I kind of talked about that in a previous video and I'm going to talk about it a lot more in the next video when we look at this in more detail but the point here is that this idea of a matrix product is something that I'm going to need so what I want to do don't worry about the neural network stuff so much right now I'll come back to that what I want to focus on is how does the matrix product work so one thing that's very important to understand is a matrix product which I'm going to use the dot to signify matrix product let's say I have a matrix a this is my matrix a and I'm gonna have another matrix called B and that matrix is going to be equal to the following g h i j k l one thing you might note one thing that's really important is a matrix product B does not equal does not equal B matrix product a the commutative property does not hold right 3 times 4 is equal to 4 times 3 they're both equal to 12 but this is not true here and another thing to realize that's super important is that if you have look if you have a dot B it's only oh the camera went off ah when did that happen how long ago did that happen okay must not have happened that 103 11 p.m. must not have happened that long ago oh no welcome to the coding trade podcast I'm trying to figure out what what did I last say I'm waiting for somebody in the patron group because they're a little bit more trustworthy than YouTube chat one minute 36 seconds ago yeah I don't this doesn't matter how the exact amount of time I don't know what the last thing I said was don't worry about the neural network thing okay that's the last thing I said okay wow so they'll quite a while ago I know I've lost my rhythm here let's see got it oh yes so the whole thing where I was talking about the commutative property okay fine fine all right so I'm going to pretend I finish just erasing the neural network thing and I know I'm in the wrong camera so don't worry about the whole neural network thing I'm going to come back to that in next video go through that in detail what I need to do here is just understand I know I need the matrix product how does it work and then we'll see how it's applied in the neural network example okay so let's say that I have another I have a matrix a and I have another matrix B and that matrix is equal to g h i j k l I'm writing the L like that so that I can see that it's not at one or whatever okay so I have these two matrices the way that I write the expression a matrix product B I'm gonna write it like this a dot B the dot as the indicator for the matrix product now what couple things that are really important here one the commutative property does not hold a dot B does not equal BA this is not true and you're gonna see why in a minute you know if I were to say three times four that's equal to four times three they're both equal to twelve but again this matrix product is a different kind of multiplication this commutative property does not hold so that's kind of key another thing that's really important is the matrix product is something you could only do if the sizes of the matrices match up and what do I mean by that now one thing you might have something but realize like if I was doing when I have that example the Hadamard product that's only gonna work if I have two matrices with the same exact dimensions right because if I if I don't have the same rock dimensions how can I multiply each element by the other element because some elements might not exist in one of them but something even completely different is going to go on here I need to have for this to be valid I need to have the columns right the columns of a equal to the rows of B and you'll notice I made these do that so I have to have however many columns I have here three I have to have exactly the same number of rows and B otherwise this won't work and the reason is what I'm actually going to do is the reason why I use this dot here is I'm going to use vector dot product vector dot product so you might have to go back to one of my previous videos where I talked about the vector dot product or going to do it here again but what the vector dot product does is it takes kind of like the sum of all the elements multiplied the element wise elements both tied to each other what do I mean by that so if I say a dot B what I'm going to get is a matrix that has that has sorry the number of rows of a I'm confused here and the number of columns of B right so there's a time out for a second I'm getting on because little time I'm going to pause at that explanation right because I want to go back to my example if this was multiplied by the number of columns e FG is multiplied by the number of rows the result I get is actually the number of rows and of the first in the number of columns of the second yep okay I had to work that out in my head can this visible okay I'm gonna get when I when I take one matrix the a matrix product B the result is also going to be a matrix now how do I know the dimensions of that matrix it's going to have the number of rows of a which is how many two followed by the number of columns of B what so in the enemy in a two by two matrix now this is going to be different with any all different matrix dimensions and after you watch this video you can make up lots of different matrices and play a game with yourself to like do this matrix product with pencil and paper boy won't that be fine I'm gonna go do that later myself I'm sure but here we can see I'm gonna get a square 2 by 2 matrix now what am I doing here how do I fill in each of these blanks so I'm gonna just put a little blank square here I know I need two by two well what I do is I take the dot product of the row of the first one with the cup of the row of a with the column of B right so it's almost kind of like the intersection this first element right I gotta get the first row of a and the first column of B that's why they have to have the same number of rows and B as columns in a so what this actually is this value here is the dot product of these two vectors which is actually I'm just come over here which is a times G Plus B times I plus C times I ok so that's this element here now let's do this element here well I'm in row 1 so I stay with Row 1 of a but now I'm in column 2 so I go to column 2 of B so now this particular value is a times h plus b times j plus C times L okay that's good now let me do this one this one is the second row times the first row the first column of B D times G Plus e times I plus F times K and then this one here is going to be the second row times the second column D times h plus e times J plus F times L okay so that's the math for any arbitrary set of matrices you take the dot product of all the rows with the columns to fill out your resulting matrix product and you must have the same number of columns in a as rows of B okay so pause this video if you want try to draw some diagrams Google matrix product google image search matrix product you prop up with a million visual examples of this watch three blue one browns videos on linear algebra which will probably teach this in a much more intuitive and nice way but I don't link to that in this video's description I'm now going to try to implement this matrix product in code okay what's the chance I got something no one is yelling at me in the chat which means I might have actually gotten that right did I get that right do I deserve a nice sip of some cold water oh shoot people are saying C times K oh I said it correct I just wrote the wrong thing right okay all right all right all right minor correction hopefully I said the right thing but I do have something wrong here a times G B times I C times K this should be a K right here okay I said I are well I thought maybe I at least said the but it's fine get a little bit wrong I'll get lots of nice comments about that okay so now I need to implement the code for this I think I can do this do I need to think about this and try it first all right let's just do this okay let me just okay okay so let's now go to our code and try to write an algorithm to do this now once again my plant and I'm in multiply hmm I wonder if I should just let me write a new function and call it a product no let me let me call it and multiply when I want to multiply a matrix by another matrix by definition I want the matrix product in this case so I'm gonna do the same thing I did in the add function which I'm going to check if n is an instance of another matrix do it one way otherwise assume it's a scalar and do it another way and so it's still doing this every time I save hold on pause for a sec yeah okay it's fine now hold on let me do this again so if and I'm gonna do it what sorry I'm gonna do the same thing that I did up here in AD where I'm gonna check is it a matrix or is it a number so if n is an instance of a matrix I want to do the matrix whoops do the matrix product otherwise do this scalar product otherwise scalar product so I need to write the code for the matrix product now what do I need to check first was this right yeah what do I need to check first now first I need to make sure that the number of columns of a is equal to the number of rows of B otherwise I can't do a matrix product so I want to say if n n is B so ends rows so let's say if this dot do we have rows in a variable yeah if this dot rows does not equal n dot columns then return I don't know undefined maybe or null and Mabel add an error console dot log Rose must rows of a must match columns of B so one thing we can do right now let's just even see let's see what happens here let's make sure that this check oh I mean the wrong screen the whole time oh I got the worst I'm the worst that was quite a while ago too okay good news is I'll just do this again let's do a lot of undoing sorry everybody that's me electroshock therapy zeng myself okay a system that would track me is good but I need to be able to override it because I often want to like just reference this and then come right back okay I'm just start this whole thing over I'm gonna make one video tutorial today you know that's that's kind of how it is I do need more than two hours to really get a lot done it seems like in these video tutorials maybe I could just instead of doing the feedforward part like do some other coding challenge or something okay okay so let's try to implement the math for this so where I'm gonna do this is in the multiply function and I had written that before to do scalar multiplication and I'm gonna do the same thing I did an ad where I'm gonna check what is the thing coming in is it a matrix or is it a scalar or etc so I'm not going to bother with the Hadamard product I'll add that into this matrix library if I ever need it but I'm just gonna check is N and instance of a matrix if that's so then I want to do matrix product otherwise I want to do scalar product okay so now I need to write the code for the matrix product right there but first I must check are the columns of a equal to the rows of B otherwise I cannot perform the matrix product at all so I'm gonna come over here and I'm gonna say if I mean the right screen yes if the a is this matrix object if this dot rows know if it stud columns does not equal and rows I kind of don't like this is called n here but whatever this then and I'll use this more strict equals here then ID to return like undefined or something like just get out of here this is no good and I'm going to console dot log columns of a must match rows of B columns now I could be more thoughtful and I can use a trycatch and some error handling but I'm just going to do this for right now just to be some and let's actually make sure this works so if I go back to loading that code and I said something like a is a matrix that is three by three and B is a matrix that is five by ten if I say a multiply B I get undefined and it says columns of a must match rows of B so that's working and I could just say B is a matrix of five by sorry three by three also then they match and I'm say a multiply B I still get under firing because I have done it yet but I don't get that error message okay so now I need to create a new matrix so I'm just say the result is a new matrix that has the number of what did I say it has the number of rows of a and the number of columns of B so it has the number of rows of a and the number of columns of B come on Adam keeps wanting me to put my password in okay all right so that's good now I need to do each spot so for each row whoops for each row and for each column I need to do the dot product of values in column oh my goodness this is so simple it's kind of simple when you look at it this way right I need the values of I need the dot product of the vector of the values in all of row J time out time out out to think about this people tell you oh whoops first of all I have an error before I can do this I have an error here and what I want is if I'm at 00 I want all of the values I want to do the sum of all of the values well so I want of a bro okay so of I console dot error makes an error message that's good Oh an OBS plugin to check for movement oh that's interesting I need three nested loops I know I've just heard it my brain hurts it got it's like really cold and it like throws slightly on the way here I know I can do this I know so let me just think about this for a second so if I have let's think about this for a second if I'm looping through every row as I so I'm starting here and every column as J and you know the convention might be to have these swaps but whatever that's what I have right now I I need to take from a I need to take every element from row I and molt and multiply it by every element of column I in B column J in B and then add those together and then I have i J okay okay so I need to say in other words let's just do this manually in this case it would be this dot matrix I times and matrix J sorry I I need yeah I need another double nested loop in here right because I'm going to take this and add I plus plus one but staying in J J plus 1 right is this right I plus 2 J plus 2 I mean this isn't I'm making this up because I don't I'm doing this an arbitrary way we don't know what the actual rows this this just goes up depending on the number of rows columns there are all right right so maybe I only need one loop here because I need one loop so what's that know because these could be different yeah k week Mon is telling me in the chat another way of thinking about this is I could say and you know what would might be nice actually one thing that I could do here just at least I think it's gonna help me work this out is I could say let a equal this dot matrix and let B equal n just to have variables called a and B for the two different matrices and this is still the result but in other words what I'm saying is a and this is B so a I K B KJ so so hold on let me with K sum over K so hold on so let me put this here did I get this wrong this is B you is it yes so you know what's wrong about this so let's look now we can get this right here's what I'm doing here I want a I want to be increasing not the row but the column I did it wrong I did it backwards do you guys like watching these videos where I try to figure it out I don't know could I could just get it right the first time could just like start over and get it right but what I'm doing is I'm every column of a which column is I'm actually using yes it's call it's all its row i but I'm iterating over the columns of course of course of course so it is this Jay so this is actually this is what I need so what I should be able to say is result I need another loop for let K equals 0 K is less than and I can use remember I could use a Scala's or B's Rose those have to be the same so I'm going to use AIDS columns yes k plus plus and then I'm first I need to say let sum equals 0 and then I'm going to say sum plus equal a index I k plus B index K J this I think is right and then I have to put that in the result result result i J equals sum so if I was using like some other vector library I could like pull those out then do the dot product but let's see here let's make sure this is right I want to for every element in the results I want to sum the dot product of all of the column spots in a that's K with all of the row spots in B and then I've got the result and line 50 so I've seen deep space in the chat says lying 57 oh yes sorry this needs to be multiplied so these get multiplied I'm summing the product of all those yes and of course there are much faster ways I'm not looking for any any efficiency here I'm just trying to understand the algorithm and make sure I have something that works okay so now I need one more curly bracket and I think if i zoom back out here I think I am done this is the algorithm right I have a new matrix that has that is of the size of and this I should do this down here the size of a's rose and bees columns then i go through it and i do the dot product of a vector from of a row of a and a column of b store that result okay and bi yes here's another mistake b equals n dot matrix right because the actual twodimensional array is stored in a variable called matrix it's not it's not the it's the the object itself has the data inside a variable okay so how are we gonna test this well let's look at let's look at hmm did that make a weird sound i just put my hand on the microphone let's create a known scenario actually let's not okay let's yes alright so here's what we're gonna do I'm gonna say and I got a remember let a equals a new matrix and I'm gonna use though these dimensions it's two by three Oh a has already been declared so I'll just keep using bar so new matrix let me just refresh the page clear oops I'm doing scratch all that let let a equal a new new matrix that's two by three excellent let B equal a new matrix that is what I'm gonna do three by two that's what I did in my example three by two then I'm gonna say a dot randomized B dot randomized you know what I should do all this just in the sketch itself I know why I'm doing this in the console so I'm gonna sit let me do this in the sketch I actually have a sketch here so I'm gonna in that's a p5 sketch and they not didn't use anything about p5 I'm gonna have a be a new matrix that's 3 by 2 sorry 2 by 3 I'm going to say the same for B which is 3 by 2 then I'm going to say a a dot randomized B dot randomized console.log a dot matrix and console dot log and not dot log table B dot matrix so let's take a look at that okay so now I have to make two matrices this is one and they would random values in them now let's now let's say a C equals a multiply B console dot table C ready everybody ready ready ready I so people are born me be able to reproduce the results so let me just do random seed one so by the way random seed is a function in p5 that'll seed the random numbers so I should every time i refresh this page oh that did not work oh what am i using for random values in my library Oh cuz right because I don't want this to depend on p5 so I seeded it whatever what it's fine I will worry about seeding it later ok now so I'm gonna get different random numbers each time but we'll see all right let's see so now I'm gonna say let C equal a dot multiply B oh I didn't get anything there oh oh I didn't console.log it oh man console table C dot matrix oh I forgot about that part okay here we go again shoot all right so what's this error sketch that Jess line eleven cannot did Isis forget to return it I forgot to return it didn't I okay you know what would be nice is that the end of this I said return results and this actually goes where here right I got a return how to return that result all right let's try this again no I forgot hit save alright let's see what's going I'm gonna stop doing it stupid sound effect is apparently I'm doing a terrible job at this let's just are we even here this is everybody's favorite debugging here uhoh I'm being told breaking news breaking news the return is in this for loop that's not good oh right because this just the return was in the for loop that's terrible and this says results and it should say results okay I'm feeling a little bit a little bit more confident now what what what turn results mmm sketch dot eleven its console logging something but nothing is there oh no but yeah I know there's an issue with hold on Oh debug this for a second here oh my goodness I'm completely losing my mind here so it's very important to realize that result is the matrix object ah the matrix object has this array called matrix which actually stores the values and there's no like set function or anything so what I actually really need to put here is result dot matrix right equals this result dot matrix equals oh no and then return results right so I these values that I'm calculating this probably be like a set function or something like that and I probably should just created a 2d array here and then made a major but whatever this is what it needs to be I think we got it now oh boy okay let me do some console logging in here console.log result and then let me say console.log results here all right so that worked Ruth's a problem here columns and rows are undefined so something is really going wrong here new matrix a dot rows B columns alright let's look at a dot rows undefined line 5000 this is the worst I'm really doing a horror look so I've done something terrible here but hopefully you know you're watching this video it may be this is valuable to you I have really conflated the idea of the 2d array that stores the values with the object and I'm using it in all sorts of terrible ways so let's think about this this is this is this is what I want a is this B is n now I can get the rows and columns but down here I really need to say a dot matrix B dot matrix right and and that goes into the resultant matrix so hopefully this is clear to you the issue let me try to rephrase it again in case it's not there is this idea of a matrix object it has three properties the number of rows the number of columns and the actual 2d array so where I refer to the variable that's the matrix object and I want to actually do something to the data I have to say the name of the object dot matrix and some I'm forgetting to do that in so many different places so what I'm gonna do what I'm gonna look at down here is I think now everything is correct if a and B are the names of the objects I could pull out the rows and columns from a and then I could pull out the values from a dot metrics and B dot matrix and set the values in resultant matrix okay how could I shouldn't be confident I really should not be confident this is a terrible idea but I'm confident okay so we finally got three things if this is a and this is B this is a dot B anybody want a fact check from me for this is it coming the chat I don't I'm gonna pop in a wait now this will get edited out anybody want to fact check these yes Simon I saw your comment about the other functions changing the current matrix not giving a new matrix back that is true and I probably should be more thoughtful about that in the library put small numbers to be easier to check wrong doesn't look right okay let's see all right I'm gonna have to check this myself six times three yeah it definitely does not look right didn't know no that's right six times five is thirty seven times one is seven zero times five is zero thirty seven it's right it's right that's good seven times five is thirty five plus 2 is 37 plus 30 is 67 so those are right and then seven times six times three is eighteen plus seven is twenty five that's right all right I think it's right it's right yay okay we got it everybody thank you thank you these numbers are in fact correct I took a little break there and check they are right I encourage you to pause the video and check them yourself to see if you understand how the library is working one thing that actually could be really useful I don't ever employ tests ever really but I should learn about tests and I should probably do some stuff with tests on this channel so I think I might come back and try to do some tests that would if I ever change the code for this matrix library to ensure that the math still works so maybe someday I'll come back and do that but and now yes there needs to be a lot of tidying up and refactoring I can use these array functions and I'm gonna get to all that but now we're ready the next video I can take this matrix library this matrix class and use it in my neural network class to perform the feedforward rhythm of taking all these inputs multiplying them by weights and getting new outputs which then go into other node they become inputs to a hidden layer of nodes eccentric search I've talked about that in the previous videos and now I'm gonna come back and actually do that I do want to point out something Simon in the chat did mention a good point which is that if you look at all of these functions randomized effects this actual object add effects this actual object I'm doing something's different with matrix multiplication where instead of affecting this actual object I'm creating a new object and returning it so I probably should be more thoughtful maybe use like a static method for that and so maybe I maybe I'll refactor that some actually you know what let's do that right now now I'll refactor that later wait time timeout the reason why I don't want to do that right now I'm not going to do that right now because I haven't talked about static methods oh oh you know we're gonna do some refactoring okay actually so even so I'm gonna do in the next video before I get to the neural network stuff I'm gonna do a little bit of refactoring with this I'm gonna take the multiply function and make it a static method and I'm gonna look at using some advanced array functions like Map Reduce and that sort of thing to just sort of clean up the code a little bit alright thanks everybody and see you in the next future videos oh I need transpose Oh crud well let's do it hold on Matt's gonna give it let me like rerecord the whole end of this video I'm gonna go back to where I mentioned Simon's comments okay Simon in the chat makes a good point where if you look at this class all of these functions randomized add multiply up to multiply they change the object that I'm calling the function on so if I say matrix a I say a dot randomized that matrix object actually changes but in this with this matrix product I'm not actually affecting the object when I say a multiply B I don't change the value of a I create a new a new matrix object and return that value so I probably should refactor the library to do maybe that no matrix product in a slightly different way and I could use something called a static method so I'm like I'll come back maybe in a later video when I refactor this a little bit I want to mention that now but it also reminded me that what I've been told in the chat that later equals never but I sometimes sometimes I do come back I do come back and do the things I say sometimes I also need to transpose a matrix that is another whoops that is another matrix operation that I need I don't know where to put it but I need to transpose you'll see in the neural now in the feedforward algorithm actually don't think that I need this in the feedforward algorithm but when I get to the training step where I see if that neural network made a good or bad guess and try to adjust everything internally to tune it to get a better guess I think that I need to transpose a vector what does it mean to transpose a vector to transpose a vector means to just like rotate it so if I'm correct transposing this vector would turn it to this so I I might have gotten that wrong in which case if you watch the next video I'll correct it and if I got that right in the next video I will implement it okay so stay tuned I'm gonna transpose alright alright Oh what warez is Dow in the chat ASEC I made a matrix library but it was so much more messy is that possible could you possible may get more more messy okay all right did I get that right about transpose I'm gonna do the transpose video now too because I have time it's not a saying vector instead of matrix all right fine what happened what happens when you get older is you start mixing words together maybe that doesn't maybe I'm not you know it seems to be happening more recently okay let me let me let me redo this all right just just ignore me for a second there's one more matrix operation that I need from the neural network stuff I think I don't actually need it for the feedforward so I could come back and do it after that but I do need it for the training aspect when I adjust and tune it based on the with the guesses well I get to all that later the thing that I need is to transpose a matrix so how do I transpose a matrix if I have the matrix a with a certain number of rows and columns start rows and columns the columns become the rows the rows become the columns so transposing this matrix would turn it into this matrix okay so I'm going to quickly in the next video write a function that does exactly that alright alright alright alright wait did I do something wrong again I see I see I see so many people typing am I good am i good I'm waiting for somebody in the pastry group to tell me I'm good Jose says I'm good see I don't some people yes okay thank you all right all right you know what I need to do is I yeah cuz I'm gonna want to return a new all right all right all right Thank You Simon further comment about vectors and transposition okay if anybody can think of a very very short coding challenge so Ricardo there are moderators in the chat actually I think all right here we go okay another matrix math video I I need I mean there's lots more of matrix there's lots more to matrix math and again let me encourage you I will link to in this video's description to check out three blue one brown's youtube channel which is a whole series about linear algebra I'm just kind of implementing the minimum that I need for this neural network example that I want to build in JavaScript so the missing piece and I just talked about at the end of the last video is to transpose a matrix transposing a matrix means take all the rows and make them columns so ABC this row becomes the first column ABC this row becomes the first column D yeah now this is yet another function which requires me twitch which requires me to make a new matrix so I'm not actually taking the matrix it's I mean it could take the matrix and redo it but I think what I'm going to do is make just write this function transpose what I want to do is have a result I guess I'll call it and have that be a new matrix that instead of having write the rows and cop the columns become the rows the rows become the columns so I'm going to say this dot columns this dot rows so I'm crazy that I Adam I think it's because oh it's each of the files hold on just just ignore me for a second I gotta fix this it's driving me way too crazy I'm gonna rewrite this function I know what's going on I copied some code from I have different user logins into the computer and it doesn't think it owns the code so if I go like get info on this file yeah I did it on the folder that's so annoying and it doesn't do it to all the files recursively so I have to say that this file really belongs to processing and processing has read and write and do I really have to do this to all the files was there maybe like a checkbox for like doing everything does anybody know I'll just do them individually because I'm just bear with me I just want Adam to stop yelling at me and now it will stop should change the username decoding train once I called it processing okay okay so I'm gonna write this transpose function and the first thing I need to do is make a new matrix which I will call result again equals a new matrix and it has the number of rows that it used to have columns and it has the number of columns that it used to have rows and I should be able to just say now it should be as easy as it should be as easy as if I was like ever going through the entire matrix and I should be just saying that the results matrix I J equals the and actually I should say the results matrix J I equals the this matrix I J we see this now it's possible I got this backwards but it should be if I'm iterating over all the rows and columns every row column position should become the column row position so I should be able to just say J index I equals the of the new matrix is this matrix I come egg i J that should work so and then I need to say return again return results okay so let's test this out could I really have done this this quickly very unlikely oh why am I saying plus equals should not be plus equals it should just literally be equal and if I go into the sketch that I had and all I need is a so I'm gonna have this random one and then I'm going to say let B equal a dot transpose and then I'm going to say console dot table a and console table B all right let's take a look I'm not accounting for the number of rows and columns differences I think that I am hold on let's take a look probably get this wrong whoops and of course I need to consult the actual matrix object to see it try this again six seven four one zero nine six one seven zero four nine six seven four six seven four one zero nine one zero nine all right I think we got transposed correct so that's great so we did this we're done we're done with the matrix math videos and it's the next one that will the next thing I need to do is actually start thinking about how does this feedforward algorithm work if I were to write a feedforward function and I were to give it some input by word you feed some input how do I ultimately return some guests so this is where lots of matrix math needs to happen so again if you're interested I'm also going to link to three blue one Browns video what is a neural network it's an excellent animated explanation of a lot of the things that I covered in the earlier videos in this playlist but what I'm going to do is try to write the code for the neural network right here once we have that done I think I'm going to just try doing a couple tests like I'm gonna solve a problem called XOR which is a really simple problem and I'm also gonna look at the EM NIST data set which is kind of like the hello world of machine learning with this neural network and then then with the idea of just seeing if it works so that I can then once I know that it works I do some more creative stuff with it okay so thanks everybody and see you in the next video okay all right it's after 400 and I think I have to go unfortunately but I will be back next Friday and I will get to the next part next Friday which will be starting to build this out and I would say that hopefully it'll go faster but probably well but we're gonna get to all this stuff let me just check my messages see if I got any important message while I see if you guys have any questions all right no okay so yeah I know I could do what's a what's a coding challenge I could do before I go I can't do Tetris I could think of something like really simple let's look let's look let's see if I can make it what were the ones that I was looking at rainbow that I thought were possible and then I want to see the ones the ones that I thought were possible I assigned to myself no no Koch snowflake true no Langton Zant no none of these are very simple double pendulum weirdly no need something simpler mmm simple sound pinball the oven we had for rotating oh oh there were some things that I feel like I had some Corrections from dragon curve yeah looking at looking at all these suggestions Langton Zant really isn't that hard right I already have the the the game of life one okay all right squares on a plane are colored variously either black or white we arbitrarily identify one square as the aunt and can travel in any of four cardinal directions at each step it takes the aunt moves according to the rules below and a white square turn 90 degrees right flip the color of the square move forward one unit the black square turn I degrees left with the coach camera all right all right all right all right we can do this we can do this we can do this all right we're gonna do Lankans aunt as the coding challenge for this week um and I say have to leave it for I really meant 430 because I always never gonna take a little longer but I really have to leave at 430 you know 445 the very very latest we just we just send a message here just don't mind me I'm wasting time that I don't have but all right let's I'm gonna do something here which is I want to find my game of life code here it is and I'm going to copy it to the desktop and I'm going to call it lenghtens ant and then I'm going to in terminal actually never programmed this before let's open it up and whoops what's going on here oh my goodness I have some nonsense code because I was explaining something okay great so I should be able to use this structure for Langton Zandt so I'm gonna allow myself do you we all think this is okay there is so much similar here that is this okay to start my coding challenge with this same make 2d array function these variables that talk about the grid initializing the grids to zero and just drawing the grid a one is white are we ok with this start from scratch people really think how interesting interesting I will start from scratch if that's what people think me I am Samia is saying that's sensible it's just I'm gonna end up programming exactly this again vote and people could just you know this is like part two and what alright I'll give it a couple minutes to vote I'm gonna do a poll in both I'm just curious to be scientific about this now a lot of people are telling me scratch can I at least keep this make 2d array function how about at least keep that I think I should at least keep that people want me to time this as well all right yeah I'm going to I'm gonna at least use that make 2d array function cuz I don't know I'm gonna allow myself that and all right hold on whoops look I'm wasting all this time that I could just be doing this with trying to make a poll in here pixels as squares would be fairly neat wait wait I'm getting some interesting suggestions so I mean do it as a pixel by pixel level make it in processing that's a good idea I should just do this in processing yeah let me do this in processing because it's so similar at least we could see something kinda that's a great idea that answers that solves lots of problems it solves the problem of doing it whether I should do it from scratch or not and it also solves the problem of of people who keep saying will you do more challenges in processing yes and that this will be a lot faster to do it on the pixel level I'll do it on the pixel level okay we're gonna do it on the pixel level in processing from scratch and we'll make a JavaScript version we'll port the code don't worry Oh lenghtens ant okay okay all right here we go you're saying openFrameworks yeah you guys are gonna have to do it redo it openFrameworks yourself somebody I'll have a guest do some openFrameworks tutorials I keep you need to make that happen okay whoops all right what's this thing here that's the Bell visible slightly visible okay so let me close all this stuff click this click this click this and we're gonna do lenghtens ant oh uh oops yeah replace it alright Oh checkboxes that's a great idea okay somebody posted that nice antimage I don't know that I don't have time to use that but but thank you cuz I don't do it pixelbypixel anyway alright here we go I'm moderating the chat oh yeah I like this okay here we are a coding challenge for this coding challenge I'm gonna do in processing and it's cool I'm going to attempt to implement this thing called Langton Zant now one thing I might recommend is go back and watch my game of life coding challenge because there's gonna be a lot of similarities between these two this is an example of another cellular automata system however I'm gonna do this one in processing so we just sort of see a different environment I will of course make a port to JavaScript so if you make your own variation of this and want to share it on the web you can look at the p5.js version of this so what do I need what I need with this first cellular automata system just like it is it otama taw is it at um I could never get this right I need to have a two dimensional array and this is actually a place where I'm kind of happy that I'm using Java in processing where I can say I can make this grid a new two dimensional array and you know what though guess what I'm gonna do I'm gonna have every cell be an individual pixel because processing is pretty fast I could do individual pixel setting so let's instead of having like a grid of squares that are larger size I'm actually do it on the pixel by pixel level let's see how that goes so let's just decide in advance actually I don't need to decide in advance I'm going to create I'm gonna have a window that's let's just do like 200 bytes 400 by 400 to start and then so the array is going to be a new array of integers which the same nonresponse width and height and it's actually going to just fill that whole thing with zeros so I don't actually even need in Java if I was doing this in JavaScript I've got to like fill it with zeros but I could just a good just assume that it's filling it with zeros great now wish really learn what license it is let's go take a look so it's a it's a system souther automatic system that will produce interesting patterns and I need to follow these rules okay so squares on a plane or colored variously either black or white so we'll say white if the aunt hasn't hasn't been there that'll be oh well I guess zero it's black white is one I don't know we'll figure that out we arbitrarily identify one square as the aunt so let's start that let's have the aunts location we're just going to call that we're gonna have that just be x and y and the aunt is gonna start at 200 200 okay that's where the aunt's gonna start I probably should say with divided by 2 whatever so I'm going to say grid X y equals 1 that's where the aunt is and actually to be honest with you maybe I should have that be the value 2 so I can have 0 4 but let's let's keep going here so the aunt moves according to the role rules below at a white square it turns 90 degrees white right okay so actually what I want to do is each time and let's make a background of white I need to figure out what is the state of the current spot where the aunt is right so this is the state of the current spot where the antis so if the aunt we can look at these rules if the aunt is at a white square okay and then we need to keep track of its direction which way is it moving so I also need a direction and let's just be let's do something goofy and do like these I think you're supposed to like it kind of make constancy maybe you say final or something but I'm just gonna call them cap I'm gonna say like up oh that's a reserved word in in in processing aunt up is 1 2 0 and is one and right is to this might be really silly the way that I'm doing this ant left is three so I'm gonna make up some constants that keep track of the direction and I need a variable called ant direction and I can just call that direction so I have I already have that I have the ants XY location and its direction it's probably a nicer way of doing that but I'm gonna keep going with what I have its direction I was going to start by going up that's its direction so now if add a white oh you know what I should have those in clockwise order because then I could just add one is adding one is turning right subtracting one is turning left so this should actually be up is zero right is two is one down is two and left is three so if the state is white and I'll have white be one no white should be zero because they're all starting a zero because I'm filling it with white so if the state is zero then the ant should turn right time's it if if the state is white if it's zero the ant should turn right meaning ant so just direction plus plus and I'm gonna what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to almost in a silly way write a separate function for turning right because I can I need to deal with like so this is ant this is Direction plus plus but if Direction E is greater than ant left then Direction equals ant up right so I could use modulus but I'm just gonna be sort of silly about this you can all do your nice refactoring and I'm gonna say and if it's less than ant up it's ant left so this will account for when 0 goes to negative 1 it should be 3 when 3 goes to 4 it should be 0 and again I could have done this all on one line of code with modulus but that's fine so if state is zero turn right and then what's the next thing flip the color of the square and move forward one unit okay so then state grid X Y should now be one right that's flipping and move and then move forward needs to be a function so I'm now going to write a function called move forward which is if Direction is up then Y minus again I could use a switch statement a case statement all that if Direction is right I could do this with all sorts of fancier ways Ales if but I'm just gonna really try to I'm gonna really try to be longwinded about this to understand it if it's down y plus plus else if direction is left then left is X minus minus then I need to account for the edges so if X is greater than width then X equals 0 if X is else if X is less than 0 then x equals with minus 1 and again I could use modulus but I'm just gonna be super longwinded about this and I'm gonna do this for Y and I'm gonna change that to height and put Y in here and here we go okay so now I have this crazy long function a crazy long function for moving forward it should change the x and y value based on its current direction and it should wrap around the edges okay so now move forward okay else if what what could the other if it's the state is already one if there's really only one other possibility but I'll be I'll check else if state is one turn left turn left change the state to zero and then move forward I think we're done let's just run this it's not gonna draw anything but let's just run this and see if we get any errors I usually don't like to write so much code without running at first okay it's running but let's now see now all I need to do is visualize this grid and I should have probably made this the pixels are in a one dimensional array but I'm now going to loop through and I is every X column I plus plus J is every why I don't want to use X&Y because I already use those for the ants and then and I could actually you know what I really could be so efficient about this because I could make this is very silly I could make an image I only have to change one pixel each frame it's really silly for me to so let's do this I can't bear I mean let's do it this way first but I am gonna refactor this because this is really ridiculous what I'm about to do so the pixel location is I times width plus J and this is a formula that I have used in countless videos and I'm gonna call this pics for pixel so the actual pixel location in the window is all the pixel colors are stored in a 1 dimensional array and so I but I'm gonna operate on those pixels I need to say load pixels and I also need to say update pixels so I will refer you to my video tutorials about pixels in processing they'll be a if this is not infinite to you I'll I'll link to those tutorials but basically what I need to do now is just say pixels index pix equals something like if I say color random 255 what you're gonna see here is whoops when I run this sketch is every pixel is a random color now what I want to do is I want to say if grid I J equals 0 then set that pixel to white otherwise if it's equal to 1 but that's the only other possibility set that pixel to black and we should see this is just rendering the results of Langston's ant with each and every pixel as a cell in the grid so let's run this and we could kind of zoom in and see is this the correct pattern can anyone confirm or deny for me that this is the correct pattern let's see if it looks kind of like so this is what it should look like after 11,000 steps all right let's stop this and I'm gonna do something I'm gonna say I'm actually just going to do this all at once I'm going to say for int N equals zero and is less than 11thousand n plus plus I just want to know that I did this correctly I'm going to just run through the whole algorithm 11,000 times then I'm gonna render it and I'm gonna say no loop so it's only gonna do it once okay so this is instead of watching it animate that looks pretty good right that looks exactly like hopefully dad yeah I can verify that these well it's flipped but that's fine because why is up what you could you could flip it if you want I flipped it fine okay great so that is working we're done yeah but this is this is making me crazy because I've only changed one pixel every frame so I can't bear to leave it this way I'm gonna do one there's so much refactoring of this that you could do and actually I'm gonna leave that in here because one thing but just having this in here by the way and taking out the no loop like this is this I can make it appear to run much faster like this is doing five five five cycles per frame of animation so to make this more clear what if I did 100 cycles per frame of animation whoops you can see that this is happening much faster now whoa oh whoops we have an error array out of bounds exception okay where did I not what did I not do correctly uh if it's greater than with minus 1 greater than height minus 1 okay good thing I checked that let's try this again yeah there we go so we're gonna get some pretty crazy patterns after a while and I'm sure you could be clever and think about like modifying the rules to use color made you get of multiple states so this is actually running super fast because processing can really handle doing it at this resolution but you know we could ask like what if I do this at like 1200 by 800 like ooh so we also had an error if it's not a square so I have to fix that mmm wait hold on let's 120 by 80 is that the error yep and 8 somewhere I have a mistake in my code what if I do at 80 by 120 yeah so where if oh no cuz hold on width / 2 height divided by 2 Oh though that's fine and 120 by 80 that worked no so i times width plus J oh my goodness I have this totally wrong had for me worked that's why I was on it sighs I had this formula wrong the whole time ah I referenced my tutorials and everything I just did it really quickly that formula was wrong I need to look at the row I mean sorry the column and then add to it the row times the width well glad I checked so now this is right so let's what I want to show you is what happens if I go to like 1200 by 800 which is probably beyond the Wow so you know processing it really is not having a problem doing this superfast but I could make this much more efficient so one way that I'm going to do that is I'm going to make a P image and I'm gonna call that ant and I'm gonna say ant equals create image width height RGB so I want an RGB image and I want that to be white to start with so there's probably a way for me to do this more efficiently but I'm just going to set every pixel of that image to white so so I'm gonna set every pixel to white and I'm gonna say aunt dot load pixels and update pixels and then I'm going to instead of doing all this I'm just gonna draw that image so that's me drawing the image now the only thing I need to do is change whatever changed the state here so what I need to do is like I need to do it though before I move forward but we're always going to move forward right so that move forward doesn't actually have to be in there it can be down here and I can now find that pixel location as X plus y times ant dot width right that's the pixel location in that image and now if I say ant I might not even need the load pixels what I'm gonna put it in here anything aunt dot pixels and you know what I could just use set because I'm just doing one pixel at a time set will inturn the set function internally calls load pixels and update pixels for you so I can just say ant set the XY to the color and so I'm gonna say if if grid X y equals zero then the then the colour should be black so we're gonna assume the color is white and we're going to make a color we're going to assume the color is white if it's zero we're gonna set to black and then we're going to set that pixel so this is me just doing that one pixel at a time cuz I only change one pixel per per frame or per cycle here I'm actually doing 100 and you can see this is the same exact thing did I do that work correctly let's let's go back to let's let me just see here I think I might have a slight issue let's double check let's go let's double check that this is right by resetting this back to 400 by 400 doing this 11,000 times and then saying no and let's see here did I get is this location correct let's see now let's take a look at that as compared to the Wikipedia again I'm doing like a mirror image of it but yeah that looks right so I think it's right so now we could let it run again the same way like let's do like we could probably do like five hundred perfect the thing is that fact that I'm doing five hundred so really if I want it I should really be smart about this and say aunt load pixels to be the most optimized I shouldn't use set and I should say aunt low pixels and update pixels at the end of all of this and then I should say the location is X plus y times aunt ton dot width and I should say aunt dot pixels that picks location is that color so this would actually be the most optimized so I'm only calling up little pixel an update pixels once only changing the pixels that need to be changed and then I should be able to do this and what did I miss oh I have no loop in here still I should be able to do this at very high resolutions really fast so for example I can change this now to full screen and run it and it should have no problem doing this super fast so let's let this run for a little while I'll be back in a minute or two this will be it and you'll see me again after this ran for a while the if condition is backwards could be all right so hold on maybe I'm having some errors so while this is running let me look at the code so what's wrong possibly here oh if it's zero its oh it should be if it's one oh I'm back from you waiting because I think I got this wrong it should be black if it's one so hold on a sec let's run this again there we go and again this is going to run for a while and then I'll be back to see what the pattern is the in a minute okay I think I got it right right now is it right me I am so me we got to wait a while before it actually finds itself and this is by the way not part of the design ah there we go we're getting something now what time is it all right oh there's a number file video so I should reference that one okay okay so this is what it got you can sort of I can sort of zoom in here and see like what sort of interesting beautiful patterns are here someone in the chat told me there's a number file video about Langston's ant which you can get more of the background the history of it and the possibilities I would encourage you here's some things you could do you could refactor my code to make it more efficient you could think about how would you make this have color in an interesting way maybe maybe the grid isn't is it just pixels maybe it's not even just squares maybe it's a grid of interesting shapes or patterns you use color in some way what kind of beautiful thing can you make from lenghtens and and if you want to make this run on the web take a look I'll also create a JavaScript version of this but again if I think if you want to get this sort of like fullscreen speed of it you're probably gonna want to do it in processing so thanks everybody and see you soon just in case let me make I'm gonna make an intro in case Macchio wants to use this hello you're about to see a coding challenge where I produce this Langston's and I'm using processing which you can get at processing org it's a Java based programming development environment and library which you could find other videos where I talk about it some more but I thought I would mention that since I've been using javascript and almost everything but I also will make a JavaScript version that I will post and I also should mention if you want to learn more about Langston's aunt before you watch me do the code for it I'll link to a number file video all about it as well in the description ok thanks and enjoy the challenge okay so in case it's useful to use that when it gets edited together I'll have Matt to use that okay everybody I have got to go I think we did a good job today of getting a little bit through yeah this will make a nice thumbnail too so yeah I'm gonna keep letting it run I'll see if there's any questions I mean one thing I should do is just I could really really increase the speed do you guys mind cuz I really have to go I want to just increase the speed oh yeah you should increase try it yeah yeah so you should try all these things but I just want for my own sake to just have it run like I think I could do ten thousand no problem yeah see how fast this is like let's do I mean we could do a hundred thousand pixels no problem each frame yeah so there we go that's a hundred thousand pixels each frame it just looks like noise to me but is there a pattern in there I'm in the hello YouTube compression okay I gotta go everybody thank you for tuning in I should read a couple random numbers before I go because maybe some of you are at a place where it's your bedtime you want to lie down curl up get cozy with a blanket it's cold outside light the fire two thousand eight hundred eighty nine sixty nine thousand six hundred eighteen seventy two thousand four hundred seventy five seventeen thousand seven hundred sixty eight sixty two thousand eighty eight forty nine thousand seven hundred thirty seven forty four thousand eight hundred seventy three seventy nine thousand one hundred ten three thousand to try to you thought it was done twenty 1175 1450 thirty six thousand five hundred twelve we should have this in the background sixtyfive thousand seven hundred thirty seven thirty thousand five hundred seventyone 69 thousand three hundred eighteen eighty five thousand eighty four twenty seven thousand nine hundred twentyfive ninety seven thousand five hundred and thirty eight thank you everybody for tuning in tuning in to this week's Kodi train I'll be back next Friday I will continue the neural network stuff I'll be doing the feedforward algorithm if there's time I'll be doing the backpropagation algorithm and solving one or two simple problems and I'm gonna just and then I'll be refactoring using deep learning j/s all that stuff I'll get to it when I get to it so thanks everybody and if you're interested in that book you could go to amazon.com slash shop slash the coding train and get your very own copy of a million random digits with 100,000 normals deviance unfortunately it's a reprint if anybody knows where I can get original copy million random digits like I would love to get an original copy not the reprint does it exist anywhere I don't know so maybe on ebay or something if anybody finds one tweeted at me and my new year's eve was excellent bye bye bye good night England just looking at the chat for a few last things this is my goodbye song I will let that stick around so I'll look and answer any questions for two and a half minutes Arduino programming um I don't do a lot of Arduino programming but there is if you go to ITP program where I teach has amazing Arduino and physical computing resources if you go to ITP NYU edu slash fist comp which is this URL right here and go to under videos I mean first of all there's tons of non video tutorial information but since we're here in the world of videos there in this album I think so these are an incredible resource of videos doing all sorts of physical computing stuff made by Jeff Patterson and Tom I go and you can see with guests like Benjamin light and so I highly recommend you check these out maybe I can get some physical computing folks to be a guest sometime Alka asked I have an echo dot now are you still doing the Lexus stuff I would like to do it I didn't get to was on my list for the fall doing a Lexus kill a bunch of tutorials doing it so I right now my priority is those neural network examples but Alki would like to come back to that if I can shaders I would like to get to that as well a computer vision with open CV ah there is a wonderful book that just came out Brian Chung Amazon oh I should put this OpenCV I need to put this on the page this book I have a copy of it um yeah I have a copy of it am I logged in as myself I'm never gonna be all login as myself and add it to my anyway I need to add that to the page somebody will treat me and remind me to do that I need to add Brian Chung's book it's wonderful and I keep meeting ready to Amazon review for it C sharp water my new year's resolutions are cook more I'd like to cook a living in New York ordered a lot of delivery and eat out a lot I want to cook more that was my main New Year's resolution and well I ever turned myself into a cyborg well I do have a large amount of titanium in my arm right now there's a quite obviously a screw right here and a metal plate you can feel right here so I'm part cyborg I think already processing in Python mode I would like to look at that as well I'm not really that much of a Python programmer how many years when you started programming I started programming at the 8th I mean I did the quick answer of this is I did do some programming in middle school I did a semi language in basic and in elementary school this would have been in the 80s but then I didn't actually program again route at all until I think I was 28 or 29 a whole bunch of years ago so I and I learned at this program called ITP where I teach and I so that we have an undergraduate program and a graduate program here interactive media arts interactive telecommunications program I usually include links to those in the video descriptions of your interested as well ok so yes I should start a whole new YouTube channel look I was thinking the other thing anybody interested in a gaming channel I a Nintendo switch arrived and I've been I've been kind of getting a little and I'm not really addicted to it but I've been playing a lot of Let's Dance anybody play I could do practically do everything to another one I could do the entire dance routine to another one bites the dust but I will get a copyright violation if I play it here so off to anyway now I've been learning some new moves like it's like this is one of them from if anyone's ever played less let's dance on the Nintendo okay see you guys I get an endless stream now I'll see you next Friday thanks for thanks for tuning in anybody wants to trade intend to switch games I'm looking for alright wants to sell me some used ones at a low price I'm looking for Odyssey I need to get the ones I want able to get arms Zelda Super Mario Odyssey those are on my list I'll just get them off I can't bear to pay full price for these games so I'm gonna start looking on eBay ok where do I hit stop streaming there it is okay the buyer
