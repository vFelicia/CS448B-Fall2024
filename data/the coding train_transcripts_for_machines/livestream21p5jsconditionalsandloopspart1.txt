okay I think I am live could anybody hear me or see me one for mark the one person is out there let me just check the cameras here this is another camera I should have checked the focus actually before I started I think it's good let's see how well can you read that okay I'm doing now I can see we can see what's how long the delay is now okay low audio okay I can raise the I can raise the volume level great okay audio is good okay okay okay I gotta turn myself but the view of myself watching myself off because I think you definitely crazy so now the stream is working I'm gonna turn the volume off I'm gonna hide this for a minute and I will come and check that actually I wonder if there I need a chat only view because I'm like looking at myself okay I got to turn the cameras back on I know camera turned off okay so which let me start over here uh let me fix this a little bit there we go okay so welcome if you are actually watching this live I'm here live thirty seconds ahead of you my time is different I'm my intention right now is to record some video lessons so the video lessons I'm hoping will be about ten minutes each and this however what you are watching is kind of raw uncut footage so to speak where I will do some like warmup exercises vocal exercises make trip and make sort of mistakes and configure things and that sort of thing I have a list of videos that I would like to make that I'm going to talk through and what I will do is periodically in between recording videos check the chat because I welcome feedback or questions and that sort of thing I mean ultimately I'm not sure maybe all this should just be the live stuff but right now the system that I'm using can broadcast live and then I hit another button that's kind of like record so these moments we're all going to like record mode trying to do a 10 minute video the topics for today are I need like a big screen that just has the chat going on it not that there's like a lot of activity and so on in the chat but it's nice to have to feel that there's somebody there my list that you can't see over here on this wall is oh the overall thing is I want to talk about conditional statements and loops and actually if I looked at my old videos that I made last year with processing and were like almost 10 videos and they're divided up in sequence ttan I'm gonna try to condense this a little bit so I just want to perhaps have a video that's just basically about boolean expression in an if statement I need to look at I want to look at how you get a thing that's moving to turnaround which is sort of a classic first conditional statement problem I want to look a cover else and else if as well as and at or at some point and then want to look at loops and drawing shapes in a loop and talk about the distinction between a loop like a for loop or a while loop and the draw loop the draw loop that's looping forever for the purpose of animation which there's always a kind of key point of confusion for students as well as maybe if I have time I don't know how much time I'm gonna try to do this all the way up till lunch for about two hours so I have to take a break at 1130 to go I'm quick quick quick task I've to do it 1130 and then I want to also talk about see if I can have a chance to make a video about a loop within a loop so a nested loop and drawing things on a grid which i think is a nice kind of thing to play with when you're first starting okay so I'm gonna like ease on over here I have this button which switches to this view and now I see myself like 30 seconds ago I'm gonna check the chat left only left ear hmm oh yeah shoot I would like to fix this I don't know how shoot so unfortunately yeah so I think I got it I'm gonna make a note of this somewhere ah the audio thing I think when it records the okay I have an idea unfortunately I'll put I'm over here Audio shoot view details audio audio ah mono this waiting to do uh save shoot okay I wonder if that fixed it for all of you with the one ear problem I just changed the stream setting to mono I have to wait unfortunately like about a few seconds for you to like catch up to me in real time but did I fix it for anybody I could stop and start the whole thing but I'm a little disinclined to do so it's I hate this lag I've got to get this more real time has a change for anyone nope so it's still one year huh okay I have a feeling if I stop and start actually maybe I could just I have an idea I think if you all stay on this page and I go to live control room which you can see now what I'm going to do is press this button that says stop streaming so I think you'll see a break and then I'm gonna hit restart and hopefully the audio will fix okay so I'm gonna stop I will not be able to restart no I don't want to do that okay shoot can you guys tolerate this hope you can view and watch page so I think unfortunately the whoops yeah sorry everybody so unfortunately this it's just going to be in one year right now I apologize for that the videos that are getting recorded it's get recorded as a mono signal into both ears into stereo so when you watch the videos later so I wish I wish I had a good I wish I could just fix this right now but didn't seem to work okay keep going thank you guys okay all right so I'm I'm getting ready now so I'm gonna put this away I've got my p5 Sketch open this is the p5 sketch I'm going to start with when I start to look at conditional statements and then over here is where I'm going to start talking about conditional statements and I'm ready okay so I'm gonna check back I just hit the record button in a second and I'm gonna check back after I record this first video which I hope will be 5 to 10 minutes I'll check back if you guys have feedback or questions and you know if anybody has any significant feedback I might I might do it again actually I forgot to put this sign which says recording you can't see it on my door so there's a door here look at the outside world over here okay uh here we go that was a little bit of coffee which I'm drinking and boy I've been going for 20 minutes so far not having a serve recording this is terrible ok 1038 here we go and one two okay I gotta start over hello again so this video I am now starting a new little section of videos about working with code and programming and all that fun stuff in p5.js and the topic here is conditional statements conditional statements boolean expressions true or false if this than that if this than that otherwise this how does a program make decisions while it's running so in the previous videos when we started working with variables my topic was kind of okay how do we store information and that information changes over time now we start to think about this new question how can a program take different paths right the only path we really have right now is starting and setup that's the first thing that happens moving on to draw and looping over and over again draw repeats over and over again we saw that you have these event functions like there was also the event function mousepressed so if you click the mouse the code would take a break from draw go execute something down here and continue and draw again but now I want to ask the question how can the code executes differently each time through draw so one time through draw it might draw a purple circle and the next time through draw it might draw a pink circle and in fact this I would like to be the first example that I make in this particular video I don't know if I if I can get purple and pink just right but I want to have a circle that's drawn with two different colors based on something that the user is doing perhaps where the user is positioning the mouse would be a good place to start so in order to do this we need to learn about conditional logic another sort of term we can think of in this case is boolean expression boolean logic from the mathematician logician George Poulos which I'm probably not getting right internet will correct meaning I assume dub dub this over or put some sort of like popup thing I don't know whatever fancy thing that works here so boolean boolean the word boolean indicates that something is true or false this is often also thought of as one or zero zero being false one being true and what what I'm going to show you how to write is an expression that says if something is true do this code if something is not true don't do this code so let's think about how the kinds of things the kinds of boolean expressions that might evaluate to true or false so I'm going to give you a boolean expression right now and in your mind you will think about whether it's true or false and hopefully this will be a rather easy one five is greater than six this is not true this evaluates to false there's another one seven is less than 210 this is true so you can see I'm starting by creating these boolean expressions using something called a relational operator a relational operator it's an operator that is going that in this case is going to compare two numbers there's lots of ways eventually in code that you'll see that you can have something that's true or false but a good way to start is just comparing numbers are these numbers equal is one number bigger than the other one or is one number less than the other one so now that we have this idea of how we can create a boolean expression a mathematical operation that evaluates to either only two answers true or false we can learn the syntax for writing that statement into our code and this is how the syntax works if we've got a word in the English language if that means exactly what it says if some boolean expression that is inside parentheses this is our boolean expression if boolean expression open curly braket close curly bracket so we've created another block of code this is a block of code with the beginning or at end just like setup and draw our blocks of code with beginning and ends and the key thing here is if if this boolean expression evaluates to true then the code here should be executed if this boolean expression evaluates to false then the code here should not be executed so let's say I write something like if five is greater than six fill to 5500 so only ever if five is greater than six should you set a red color now if you're thinking about this piece of code here you're realizing this is what I would have created in this scenario is kind of ridiculous and and useless in a way like five no matter how much we try over and over and over again five is never going to be greater than six ever I can't I mean maybe there'll be another universe or a parallel universe or some other kind of wormhole thing we go through and five will be in the six but right now in this room where I am under these very hot lights that make me feel a little faint for a second and five is not greater than six so you can see this is while this is the correct syntax this is showing us the idea here this doesn't really make any sense the point of what I'm trying to show you is that if a variable is part of this boolean expression a variable has different values at different times of the day and different moments depending on what other things are happening in the code then that variable might sometimes be greater than six or might sometimes not be greater than six and so we can change this expression to say something like if Mouse X is greater than 100 so now as the user is moving the mouse it's not greater than 100 it's not greater it is greater than one so this code even though it's sitting there in the draw loop I haven't put it there yet but that's where it will live this code will not necessarily be executed in fact you could run the program if the mouse never goes past 100 my code will never happen it will just sit there never get executed this is the power of a conditional statement so let's go and look and put this into our example and I think that will actually wrap up this video just sort of the very very basics and there's more to it than this but I'll get to that okay okay so here we are I have a nice simple example that I prepared in advance this is me actually preparing to make one of these videos in advance I've got create canvas up here I'm drawing a circle so no fill so what I would like to do now is add something down here if Mouse X is greater than and let's say 300 which is the middle of the window fill i 255 0 let's try to give ourselves some purplish color and we can see this is what I've added here this is the syntax so you can see what you can see a couple things here so the boolean expression is in between parentheses the if statement opens with the curly bracket ends with a curly bracket and notice how Phil gets indented so the indentation is not changed the way the code runs but it helps you visually see you could have a lot of lines of code you could have a lot of things happen within that if statement so those curly brackets say this is the code that should be executed and remember if this evaluates to false this doesn't happen draws looping over and over again it might be true it might not be true so let's run this and see what we get this is very exciting ok where's my mouse I don't know I think it sounded like 50 so we're not there yet okay leaves like 100 150 done 200 ok we're getting they were close it's almost there there oh yes we got it all right so you can see that as the mouse gets beyond 300 that circle turns this purplishpinkish color when I move the mouse back it's off so this is pretty exciting and you could think like almost have this sense of like making a roll over here I mean we don't at all but you can start to imagine like what's that if statement that says if the mouse is inside the circle highlight it so these are the kinds of things you all these interface elements that you might be used to using on your computer this is how they work and I don't know if I will actually solve this particular problem in a video it involves looking up the distance function because you've got to test the distance of the mouse from the center of that circle but that could be something if you want to have a tricky problem to look at you might sort of see later I'm gonna definitely get to an example that that uses a rectangle try to see if if the mouse is within the bounds of the rectangle I think that's in my mind of future videos so there's one other thing I want to mention just to kind of like make sure this video kind of like wraps itself up and doesn't leave off any details V I showed you these relational operators there are other ones there is greater than n equals there is less than or equals so in other words v is greater than or equals 6 this is actually true no it's not I bet to stay like that's not true v is greater than or equal v right because it is equal it's like I'm like I was doing so well with this video now I'm kind of losing my mind here a little bit so but there are other relational operators that you could use these are probably the most common ones you're gonna get pretty far and then there's also double equals there's a funny distinction between the double equals and a triple equals in JavaScript I'm gonna leave out of this video and just use double equals because the distinction and maybe this is a bad idea I'll have to rerecord this or write something in the video's description but there's a key sort of thing here if I want to check this if Mouse X is equal to 200 I cannot say Mouse X eat I cannot use this as my expression the reason I cannot use this but as my expression is that single equals means an assignment operation meaning I want to assign the value 200 to Mouse X which is not something I want to do Mouse X doesn't even get the sign it just picks up the value of where the mouse is so if you want to test different if a variable is equal to something you need to use the double equals and I know maybe 1 when I get two strings that's when I look at the distinction between double equals and triple equals and some might say that you should actually use the triple equals instead of a double equals I really gone off the deep end I really thought about this I wouldn't have mentioned this in the first place so these are some things you look at but honestly this is generally not such a good idea because you know when are you really trying to test if the mouse is on an exact pixel generally you're looking for ranges so and I think what you could get started with is take something you made earlier where something is growing or something is moving according to the mouse and see if you can have a color change or a shape change or something you could do that kind of interesting here's an exercise for you is have this shape change have it be a circle or a square or possibly even is it could you have three possibilities or a triangle depending on where the mouth X is or the mouth Y is that's something you could try doing as a quick little exercise after this video okay this was 11 minutes and 20 seconds which is I've tried to keep these to ten minutes I almost sort of got that and I'm gonna hit stop now and record the next one just stop buttons over here okay okay now hi ever you guys if you're watching this on the livestream anybody is actually still there and pull this up now okay how is that for anybody should if like said that instantly so if anybody has any feedback comments thoughts I'm gonna go straight on to do a quick bouncing ball demonstration will be next so I'm going to start preparing that and if you guys have comments conditionals too and I'm gonna go back to this but I'm gonna have an X I'm gonna say var x equals zero and then x equals x plus three and there we go so this is my next demonstration the circle turning around with an if statement yeah the the yeah I would love to have all of these subtitled I'm thinking of yes some people have volunteered to subtitle and also I'm thinking of using like canonical Turk or five or something just to like pay a little bit of money to help get things up titled but yeah okay anybody have any last feedback I'm gonna give myself a minute to get situated I think it's 1050 I've still got to take a short break at 1130 and then I'll start up a new broadcast I'm hoping maybe I can do all these conditionals by 1130 that I can do the loop ones bouncing ball yeah okay okay I'm going to erase this and I'll get Rick one last time to see if anybody has any feedback excellent thank you it's nice to have nice feedback okay losing my mind in here and okay I'm gonna get started into the next video so I'm gonna close this I really have to remember to turn the air conditioning on when I stop cuz it gets so hot in here okay now we're gonna run this okay I got to clean up this coat a little bit to make it more visible and I also need a good system for figuring out where to put all this code you know I really ultimately my whole plan is to actually record videos in front of this green screen here but have the background not be a video but actually like a live code editor and a canvas but I just didn't have time to get that ready and want to like make all this content and I'll spend a month getting that system right they won't have made any content so that'll be in the future someday who encouraged me to do that or help with that let me know okay so I'm gonna record the next video start over here actually I'm gonna start over here it's gonna start over here okay and here we go hi okay so this is the next video about conditional statements looking at them in JavaScript and with the p5.js library and editor just burps of the start over again and I'm actually gonna have a little sip of some of this exactly I'm like even weirder if there's like not the live stream here fig because I'm like trying a little bit selfconscious to not be so crazy okay this video is a high so I wanna I start too quickly it's okay everything's gonna be fine I'm gonna get this one we get this one what am I gonna say first hi hello okay hi again so in this video I would like to look at a kind of classic problem that comes up in programming graphics when you're first getting started that requires a conditional statement you really need an if statement for this problem and the problem is this so here I have a little bit of an example here we can see there's one variable x equals zero there's a canvas I'm drawing that a circle at that X and X every time through draw is increasing incrementing by three what will the result of that be this circle that moves across the screen and it leaves and it never comes back so the problem that we need to look at here in this particular video is how do we get that circle to turn around and come back okay so I'm gonna come over here for a second and the topic if you just watch the previous video we are looking at conditional statements conditional statements an if statement has this format if open parentheses close parentheses open curly braket close curly bracket and some sort of boolean expression true or false goes in here so let's think about what is the condition that has to be met in order for that circle the ball so to speak to turn around so this is the canvas here is the circle it's moving along if the location of this circle is at the edge that's the condition so if that's the condition for which it should turn around so you might think what's the name of the variable X so if X is equal to width you might think that this is where you want to get started in and this is not completely illegitimate I mean this could work and it's sort of the right idea if the circle location equals the width of the window that's when you want to turn it or turn around why I feel like I want to start this one over again I'm gonna take your gun look it going that's starting over okay so but this this isn't really good think about it first of all I am in in the program that I just showed you X is going up by three each time x equals x plus three goes up by three goes up by three because of by three so if the width of the window is like 200 it might not ever actually X might not ever actually equal 200 it might be at like you know 197 well that'll be at 200 but whatever is divisible by 3 up there near 200 so this isn't really good we need a condition that will no matter what catch that circle before before it goes too far off the screen and if you can think about that a nice condition for that might be if X is greater than you could use greater than or equals but I'm just gonna use greater than if X is greater than with what do something so first let's just make sure this is the right idea so let's come back over here and now we can add high back over here we can add this to this particular program and I'm standing in front of it too much you scooch this over scooch this over that's a little bit better so I'm gonna add if X is greater than width and remember with width is a builtin variable in p5 that knows inherently the width of the canvas and where does it get that value it gets it from here it's news I could have put 600 I could put 600 oh no where I'm looking I could have put 600 down there but if I ever change the canvas size its you know then I don't have to change the number elsewhere in the program so using these builtin variables is a useful thing so I'm gonna you know you may not have seen this but I'm gonna add a print statement so something you can always do in p5 is say println which means print line I'm going to print a line down here in the console that's going to say off the screen so we should only see that message print if X is greater than width so let's run this and we can see I don't see the message see the message item see the message I see the message so you can see our if statement works it only triggered printing that as soon as it left the screen so now you have to ask yourself what what's the what's the thing we put there what what do you put there in order to have it to go backwards okay so here's what here's what you might be thinking it's not right here's what you might be thinking if going forwards is x equals x plus 3 then going backwards is maybe x equals x minus 3 right so if X is greater than with then go backwards ok it's going forwards it's going oh hello uhoh something has happened a camera froze what's being streamed right now hold on sorry this video broke down ah let's try turning this on or huh okay that fixed it uh you know what I didn't really I kind of was like losing my train of thought I could do this whole thing over again uh stop okay I guess that that threw me off too much okay oh that was tragic just don't pick your nose was I picking my nose I don't think that I was okay uh how long was that so far no it was only five minutes well you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna guess maybe I'll just splice the to I can record again from here and splice the two things together uh maybe I'll try that okay I just okay I like seeing when you guys are gonna see the actual live thing which is like terrible okay I lost my train I thought okay let me minimize this well okay I really want to do this whole no no I'm gonna I'm gonna do it from here I'm gonna have to just put two videos together which I think I can do I can put two videos together okay and here we go record like sorry there was a quick technical mishap of the camera so I'm just kind of picking up where I was before hopefully this will work so running this program you could see what we try to do is I lost mmm yeah no I'm sorry I gotta start over it's so hot in here okay okay stop start again sorry there was a technical mishap but I'm starting from where I was before we were looking at this example where we that and we were evaluating this as a solution if the circle goes past the screen we wanted to go backwards so shouldn't it go instead of by plus three we should decrease X by negative 3 subtract 3 from X so if we run this let's see what the result is it's going it's going it's getting to the edge now interestingly enough it doesn't go past the edge anymore but it also doesn't come around and go back so this is where you really have to think about what's going on logically sorry everybody when technical things happen ok try this again okay we're almost where I was basically at the end of this video and I got stuck here ok I can just pick it up from where it was before ok technical mishap but the camera is working again now where were we we were looking at this particular scenario we need to get that circle to turn around we know it's moving to the right because it's increasing by 3 every time through draw so when it gets to the edge it should decrease by 3 X equals X minus 3 now this is flawed logic but it sort of has this almost intuitive idea that it might be right but we need to figure out why is it wrong and what's the correct way to do it which will hopefully help you understand about how conditional statements work even more so let me run it and let's see what the problem is so it's moving to the edge now that if statement is true and it moves back by 3 but what does it do the next line it moves up by 3 again then it comes around to this draw again is it over the edge yeah move back by 3 and then move up by 3 so this didn't really solve our problem I just moved it back once and then this line of code is still executing what we need to do is figure out a way to permanently have the the circle stop increasing by 3 permanently stop increase this decrease by three we need the certain number three to turn into a negative three for the next many cycles through draw and how do we do that how do you need to do that the way to do that is with a variable so let's look at this again let's say I say if I have a variable speed equals three and then I say x equals x plus speed I'm going to take this out so X is always changing by whatever the value of that variable speed is and when the program starts that speed variable is three it's three it's three it's three is three Oh what do we want it to be willing to turn around what if we made that speed variable negative three now x equals x plus negative three is the equivalent of x equals x minus three so all I need to do here is say speed equals negative three so at a certain moment speed equals negative three and when we get to the edge people differ and it's moving around and knots coming back and goodbye so for you with this exercise you might think about okay what if it's also moving up and down how do you deal with the top and bottom edges how do you deal just with the right and left edge how might you have a change color or change size how could you have other things about the circle change every time it hits boundary maybe it's speeding and changing so each time it hits it starts going faster and faster there are lots of little variations on this that you could try that I might recommend doing to kind of keep playing with this idea of a conditional statement and in the next video what I want to look at is something that is kind of missing here is what if I want to say if it's greater than with do this otherwise do something else so this idea of an else or an else if it's something we need to look at we could also join boolean logic with a and and an or you know if I'm feeling nervous and scared then I don't know don't make videos about programming or if I'm to get the idea and or so those are the things I need to look at in the next video which I will do so I'm gonna hit stop here and you're good enough you're watching it anyway okay okay that was three minutes so I think that was about ten minutes in total I'm gonna open up the chat again if you have any questions video and sound out of sync okay thanks for the comments and feedback everybody I'm gonna start getting ready for the next video erasing the board and thinking about what I'm going to do if you have any questions you ask or any comments like something was missing or something was wrong or let me know hi oh shoot result this is now the part of the livestream where I'm quietly erasing the contents of the whiteboard so I have till 1130 before I'm going to take a short break but I'm actually doing quite well in the next video what I want to look at is else if and else as well as and and or I think I could do that in one sort of silly though maybe I should just make those two shorter videos it's hard to say but I'm trying to keep the conditional logic down to three videos and then I'm going to try to do loops in two videos cuz I'm making less than I used to make okay so what do I need now I want to go back to I want to go back to the first example I had open recent conditionals one okay now I have a editor bug that I want to file the editor should remember the kind of Windows oops I'm not over here sorry the editor should remember the window size and then okay and location let's see move this over so this is what I'm gonna start with this simple example which was doing this and what I might do is yeah I want to do it else and else if so I think the way that could work would be to maybe I'll do the thing with the different shape so depending on where the mouse is like half way or a third of the way I'll do a different shape that'll work so something like yeah I'll just do it in the video I don't need to do it right now okay so I think I'm ready I'm just gonna check see if anybody had anything they wanted to say maybe combine them in case people aren't sure which to use a situation yeah yes I think that's a good idea I'm gonna I'm gonna do it okay thank you okay I'm gonna start recording it now okay so go over here and my stream I'm about to start my topics are else first then else if and then and and or so kind of cover all those can try to make this about 10ish minutes that's my goal okay first I need to tie my shoe so livestream you're looking at a blank board while I am tying my shoe this is my life I'm talking to myself okay here we go so we've looked now at conditional statements in a couple scenarios one we just looked at making something happen in the code based on where the mouse is and we've also looked at making something happen in the code based on where something that's moving around the screen start over now that's the right idea but I lost my train of thought for a second okay hi so this is the third video in a minute and a quick three video sequence about conditional statements JavaScript using p5.js the library and the editor so what I've looked at so far is what is a okay one more time last time I swear hi so this this is a third video I'm gonna wrap up this discussion about conditional statements in java script and p5.js here so we've looked so far at a conditional statement and what's allowed us to do it's allowed us to have something have the draw loop executes differently depending on something that's happening in the code whether it's where the users mouse is or where a given shape is on the screen it changes direction or changes color this is this has allowed us to create different paths and have the program do different things based on certain conditions that evaluate to either true or false and this is the essential topic here but there are a few additional features to the way that you can work with conditional logic that allow for other possibilities and the first one that I want to show you is just the keyword else so if you think about it you could say if it's very hot you know turn on the airconditioning and I might add to that statement if it's very hot turn on the airconditioning otherwise take a nap I don't know why this doesn't make any sense but you get the idea this idea of otherwise else is essentially that otherwise so if I were to say something like if this is what we're familiar with if now sex is greater than 200 if this evaluates to true execute this code and we know that if it's false we don't execute the code that's in here but what about in this other case of otherwise else and otherwise else do this other code so we now created this sort of like sequence nested block we have an open curly bracket and a close curly bracket and then a nut then an else and then another open curly braket in a closed curly bracket so what I want to do is go find that previous example we made where that I made where if the mouse gets over to the right hand side of the screen the the circle turns purple so now I don't want to do is say like if it's on the right hand side of the screen have it draw a circle or change the shape so I'm gonna based on if it's using else that if it's on the right hand side of the screen do this otherwise do this other thing okay so this is where the else comes in so let's look at that syntax now okay over here so we can see this bit of code right here this is where our this is where our if statement is and now I can I want to add an else right here so all I need to do that is type else and add another open curly bracket and actually notice the editor itself just filled in that second curly bracket for me so you can see if this is true do this code and basically what we're saying is if that's not true do this other code and so I could have kept with color but what I'm going to do is I'm going to take this ellipse and put that here and then I'm gonna here I'm going to say draw a rectangle so now we can see and I'm going to zoom back out we can see do this otherwise do that so let's run this code and we can see okay well right now the mouse is not greater than 300 so when it starts were actually X I'm at the program is executing that otherwise statement and ask the mouse moves over we've got the circle so you can see that circle is turning into a square based on where the mouse is we've got this conditional logic okay now there there's more to this than that so in addition to having an else so one thing I should know here is a conditional statement you could only ever have one if and one else but there's something you can put in between there if mouse X is greater than 200 execute this code now I could say otherwise execute some other piece of code but I'm gonna say something different I'm gonna say otherwise if suchandsuch else if Mouse X is greater than 100 execute this bit of code else if Mouse X is greater than 50 execute this bit of code in all other cases else execute this bit of code so these if statements can actually become this much longer piece of logic where you're testing a whole bunch of different conditions a kind of classic example of this it doesn't really apply to drawing in p5 but to sort of think of these logic is a program that grades somebody so you could say if the grade is greater than an if the grade is greater than 90 assign the letter grade a otherwise if it's greater than 80 assign the letter grade B otherwise if it's greater than 70 C etc so you can imagine there's a bunch of different conditions that were testing and you have to start with it if you don't have to start with an else but you can only have one other otherwise in all other cases and you can have as many else ifs as you want in between so again the this this idea of seeing makes a lot more sense in the context of a practical example and we could look at testing like where the mouse is on the screen is that here or is it here or is it here or is it here which one of these conditions is it met so I want to actually put this in the code but I'm gonna do it in a slightly different way this is actually correct but I'm gonna put I'm gonna start with Mouse X greater than 50 then 100 then 200 and reverse this order and it's not gonna work and I want to also discuss Y which is that's one key aspect about how elseif works so this is a really tricky interesting problem if you haven't seen this before okay so now I'm over here and I'm going to add so I'm gonna start with sorry Mouse I really should have done color here because now I to like think of four shapes but it's fine so if mouse X is greater than fifty a circle else if Mouse X is greater than 150 do a rectangle else if Mouse X is greater than 250 let's do a line and you know what I'm gonna do just because I'm and then in all other cases do a point 300 to 200 okay so now we can see I've strung together this conditional logic and I'm gonna kind of try to zoom into it a little bit to make it a little bigger here you can see okay if the mouse is greater than 50 otherwise if it's greater than 150 otherwise if it's greater than 250 otherwise draw a point so I should see either an ellipse a rectangle a line or a point now this isn't going to work so let's keep your mind churning about why it's not okay so there we go we've got a point which makes sense in all other cases right which is it's not greater than fifty hundred fifty two hundred fifty it's not greater than any of these we should see a point so now when I get to greater than fifty what do we get a circle now I should get to greater than 150 ash of a rectangle or greater than 250 a line so why are these not why are why am I not seeing a rectangular line why why why this is sort of a key key distinction here so one thing that's true about this is that as soon as any one of these evaluates to true the program kicks out of the if statement and goes to the next lines of code that are below that if statement as soon as any one about these evaluates to true it doesn't check the next one so the order of these is very very important only one of these sections of code can be executed not more than one if you want more than one to be executed there's a different way of doing it which I'll mention the afterwards but for a conditional saying this is one whole statement where if is joined with else if else if and else only one of these can be evaluated so let's go back to here and look at this again let's think about if mouse X has the value of 275 well in our minds what we want to it is 275 is greater than 250 so we should see that line but let's now let's be the computer for a second and go through this logic mouse X is 275 is 275 greater than 50 yes it's true it is greater than 250 so an ellipse is drawn and I'll remember as soon as the first thing evaluates to true we kick out of that and go to the end so none of these others are checked so the order of this really matters if I have just checked if it was greater than 250 first then I would have found that one right the order here really really is really important so in this just in this particular scenario the way that I've written this code I need to check 250 then 150 then 50 and we can run this program and we should see first we're starting with a point then we get a line then we get a square and put these kind of close together than a circle so based on where the mouse is a different shape is drawn so this is a really sort of crucial piece of information as to how these if statements work oh okay so now it is true however that I could also I hesitate to do this but I could write this with it not being without these else so if I take out these else but leave maybe and I'm gonna the else ifs I'm going to take out this one just three separate if statements let's look at what happens now you try to think to yourself like what's gonna happen here so I'm gonna run this I've got a line I've got a I now I see all three of those so these now are not related to each other they're just three distinct if statements on their own so when the mouse is 275 it's greater than 250 and greater than 150 and greater than 50 so all of these occur however if I string them together with that else right then as soon as the first one is executed the next one is not checked so these are essentially the tools you have to work with and it really depends what it is you want to implement okay so there's one other tool thank you my watch almost a 10 minutes here which is about the length I'm trying to keep these videos there's one other tool that I want to add to this video which is and and/or so let's look at this here another thing that you can add into a conditional statement is an and or an or so imagine if you said something like this if mouse X is greater than 50 and now this is incorrect syntax so I'm just going to write the word and here for a second and mouse X is less than 100 I kind of write what does this mean if this is the canvas and this is pixel 50 and this is pixel 100 what is + Mouse X so when does this evaluate to true well this evaluates to true anytime the mouse is greater than 50 this evaluates to true anytime the mouse is less than 100 both of these together the whole statement only evaluates to true if both of those are true which is all the area in here you can think of it as the intersection so with an and if you join two boolean expressions with an and they both have to evaluate to true in order for in order for the the code here for the full statement to evaluate to true now you could also have an or here if you put an or here only one of these needs to evaluate to true in order for this whole in order for the this code to evaluate this this this code to be executed for this to evaluate to true so let's think about this if Mouse X is greater than 50 or it's less than 100 well guess what that's every number that's ever been invented or talked about ever in the history of the universe of numbers right because try to come up with a number that either greater than 50 or less than 100 every number 2 is less than 150 7 is greater than 50 171 is greater than 50 so so this is kind of like not so into the logical statement but it makes a lot of sense with an ant now the one thing that I'll mention here is even though I'm using the word and an or this is not actually the syntax so the syntax for writing an and into your code is two ampersands and the syntax for writing an or into your code is two pipes pipe pipe ampersand ampersand so I want to go now and I'm gonna go down and make two quick examples I'm going to add an end to our mouth X example and I'm going to add an or to our bouncing ball example you'll see how both of those work okay so over here what I would like to do now is I'm gonna go back and I'm just gonna make a rectangle which is that 300 200 100 100 and I'm going to say if Mouse X is greater than 200 and mouse X is less than 300 so look at this if Mouse X is greater than 200 and less than 300 let's see what that results in whoops I would sorry I'm gonna draw the rectangle always and I'm going to change the fill color if this evaluates to true okay so look at this the mouth it's no it's not greater than 200 right now or okay whoops how come oh sorry I did that wrong I want it to be greater than 300 and a little less than 400 sorry about that my math was off see look if the mouse is over the rectangle it's turning purple otherwise it's not of course if I'm up here also you can see as long as it's in between this side of the rectangle and the other side of the rectangle that fill is executed so what I might say to you as an exercise is can you add some more hands to check if mouse Y is greater than the top and less than the bottom and this would be the code for a roll over here so one of the things you're going to see as we work with p5.js more and more and more is that a lot of the is that we're going to eventually be able to get a lot of this stuff for free like we're in the browser I'm working in the browser there's rollovers there's buttons there's all sorts of things but as you started to learn to pro and just drawing shapes kind of raw shapes working with the pixels getting your hands dirty with the pixels in the canvas you might take some time like try to program a rollover try to program a button that's actually something I need a video about something about checking if the mouse is pressed anyway this is because there's much other content here that I realized I need to make so but this is can get you started so try to make some rollovers can you put more than one on the screen can you get them to change different colors try things like that I want to look very quickly at an or and so I'm going to go back also to my other example and remember this example where the ball gets to the right and turns around and goes back when am i doing that I'm doing that if X is greater than width so what I want to say now is if X gets to the right side turn around or if it gets to the left side turn around so what's the left side if the right side is greater than with the Lexx left side is or if X is greater than zero and by the way what's another way I can take right one when it gets to the right I want speed to become negative three when it gets to the left I want speed to become positive three so negative 3 positive 3 negative 3 positive 3 what's a way you can change a number from positive to negative to positive to negative to positive is negative always just multiply it by negative 1 so if I take speed and said equal to itself times negative 1 what you will see here is speed is 3 and now speed is negative 3 and now when it gets to the left side up speed is positive 3 name so now you have this circle that's just bouncing back and forth so this is again something you might start to play with with this example further top and bottom changing size changing color can you have more than one circle on the screen which is a little bit tricky right now because we haven't used we haven't looked at an array yet which is a list of things but but that so this kind of fills in some gaps and in my mind I've thought of a lot of other gaps with conditional logic that hopefully is helping you here okay I'm going to stop this video and I'm I might make one more thought of a couple other things that I wanted to mention about conditional logic and then I also need to make some videos about loops okay oops stop okay okay I'm coming back to the live stream and missed it yes and yes thank you for these okay I have a spammer here I wonder if I can flag the spammer remove okay okay so thank you guys for whoops oh no that was just me frozen in his face thank you guys for listening to this live broadcast I'm actually going to like stop and start in again in about 15 minutes I'm gonna do more videos I'll just make this a new broadcast and hopefully I'll have fixed that mono ear thing so if you want to tune back in again you're welcome to although I would understand if you didn't want to high antonius so I had 20 asleep just arrived but I just have to go and I feel like a quick thing I have to do it 1130 and then I'm gonna be back but I think there's no way to continue the same live broadcast so I'm going to start up a new one which is fine because this one's been going on for an hour already I'm gonna turn the air conditioning up and then I turned the lights off to get a little cooler in here and I will I'm like mmm it's like whole inception thing is to making me crazy and I will see you again in a little bit so I'm shutting off the stream which I need to do by going to live control room and stop streaming thank you guys I'll be back I'll post something on Twitter I guess if that's where you want to follow or I probably just go to my YouTube page will show up again it's like another live event and I will see you guys soon okay stop streaming
