hello this is a total surprise I was just up here doing some stuff and I was like a half an hour this is what I've always dreamed of I just have a little extra time I believe to get to something I'm just gonna like turn on the live streaming and be here the live stream them the cool the main live stream for this week not to mention the one I did yesterday the kids will be this coming Friday and so today I don't know how much it's gonna interest those of you who might actually be tuning in right now but I have a little gap in my intro videos let me see if I can find those let me turn off the sound here for a sec and go to here and go to here so I need to feed this so you know this year I remade I really need to read I want to remake what I remade Irene may i remade one two three four five six no one's telling me that I you did my microphone by accident today that's good all the way up to 1.6 were remade so these I made this fall and then I don't I don't have time to just continuously remake all these tutorials and they still apply but at some point at some point at some point here I create and let me just look through this video at some point I start I make a class maybe in a separate JavaScript file let's see I'm not signed in with my YouTube premium I need to sign over my YouTube premium so here already okay no I don't have a separate bubble j/s file so I haven't shown how to do that do I at some point anybody watch these recently no what about at the end of the video no look at that okay so this that's where this would go so right now I'm gonna make a quick video that will be six point four I mean it's gonna be just like a couple minutes long so I need to grab that code so I think now if I go to coding train website and go to code tutorials p5.js if I just six six point three here we go and I bring this into here that's great oh how lovely so let me move this over to here let me move this over to here all right so here we go I'm ready for this right now oh hello there it is me from the future entering into your playlist of intro to programming with p5.js in the previous video that you were watching about objectoriented programming I was using a text editor known as the atom text editor the p5 web editor didn't exist yet now if you started this whole playlist from the very beginning you'll notice that I started with the p5 web editor because I made the intro videos just like a month ago and then the other videos about object were last year and some of them were two years ago the narrative follows but the videos are all made at different times so I'm stepping in here for a moment just to show you a bit about working with objects and classes in the p5 web editor and one of the things that you'll want to do probably so this is the example from the previous video six point six point three so I'm making six point four right now and what I'm going to show you here is what if you know I'm gonna eventually make a much more complex sketch and it's gonna have you know bubbles and rainbows and unicorns and cupcakes and puppies and turtles right so I might have a class turtle class puppy and class unicorn you know this this one sketch JS file could get quite long and quite large so one of the things I could do is I can actually make a separate JavaScript file I can call it anything I want I'm gonna call it bubble Jas and I can put the bubble class in that file and allow me to sort of know that when I want to make changes of the bubble I go to that bubble file when I want to make changes to set up and draw I go to sketch touch yes when I want to make changes of turtle I go to turtle touch yes so that's what I want to show you it's not really necessary for this but it'll help you sort of scale up as you move forward now you can actually it doesn't just this isn't just only for putting classes in separate JavaScript files it's just a good time for me to show you that you get a multiple JavaScript files for one sketch in the web editor all right so if I this is where you want to look and I should also reference to you casee tarik Asia and the creator of the p5 web editor meeting nice 20 minute video about all of the features which are also referenced which goes through a lot of different pieces of the web editor I'm just kind of highlighting this one thing so I want to go over here and click this and you can see now I have the project folder and look all of the secrets are revealed all this time you've just been working with sketch jas that's your JavaScript code but the sketch digest code is only executed because it is referenced inside of this other files hidden file index on HTML this is actually just a plain old HTML file and we don't know about HTML maybe you do in my next playlist about like p5 the p5 Dom library we get into what that HTML file is a bit more but if I look at it we can see that I look at this there's this reference script there's a script its source is the file sketch j/s if I want to have a new JavaScript file I'm going to need to edit this file and I'm gonna need to make a reference to button dot J so I need to make a reference not button bubble whatever I was doing an example earlier that was button bubble once I've added that I can then go here and back to this a little error right here I can click this and I can say add file are you seeing that and then I can zoom back out and I'm going to name this bubble J s and you can see it appeared right there I'm going to click on it it's empty I'm gonna close this I'm gonna go to sketch guess I'm gonna grab my bubble class all of this code and I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna paste it in here I'm gonna hit save and now I'm gonna run it again it's the same exact thing nothing has changed the difference is my code for setup and draw is just right here and my code for the bubble class is now in a separate file so when it's time for me to think like you know what I want the bubble to move faster then I can just do this and change these numbers here I'm gonna put on auto refresh so that it updates automatically whenever I make these changes so you can see ah it's going faster then it's like slower but mostly to the right and then I want to change the you know the color a little bit too you know so I'm changing things but now in if I want to change stuff with the sketch I want to change where the bubble starts then I want to change this here so you can see I have now just resource organization to enter of the URL for it duplicate this sketch into your own account try to add another class and another JavaScript file or maybe you like just add like another JavaScript file and put the mousepressed function in that reorganize your code with multiple files don't forget to go in and reference them in index.html hold on you can set which modifier key in the settings I mentioned oh people are talking about something unrelated in the live chat going on okay good bye later ok there that was fast oo I know what I went to mention hold on let me match it was like good to know a perfect know edit video that I'm gonna have to adjust cut out that thing about me looking at the chat and I would say okay so okay so you now you've wrapped up this section on making classes and objects in JavaScript if you want a little exercise here what I might suggest is duplicate this sketch the URL to it will be in the video's description um see if you can add yet another JavaScript file maybe put like the mousepressed function in it or maybe add some other sort of object turtle that I keep referencing you know this little turtle that moves across the screen can you have a separate class I'll give that a try I will also note and I'm gonna do this in a separate video that's gonna come in the next like it's actually going to it will appear around objects and images or somewhere I got to look where it should go but I'm gonna do another video where I show you how to add media assets to the project which you can load so thanks for watching this and I will see you soon goodbye okay so that was good a little quick quick I wasn't kidding when I said quick videos so now let me see here I guess I mean in this playlist let's look at what happens in this one I really I have YouTube premium so that specifically said that ads don't show but okay so this is a no have I and I still still did it make a separate okay so I wonder what I'm saying here I have to listen to myself for a second and so there's a couple ideas one is I could leave this video as is and just make a separate video that comes before to show like in the next video I'm gonna use these kittens and flowers but I'm going to show you how to get them in the web better that's probably what I should do we could also I could also unlist I'm never gonna delete a video but unless this video and I have Matt you edit in like like right here like stop I'm going to show you how to get these things in the web editor and then have it go on probably the safer thing is to do a separate video so I think I'm gonna do a video here so let me go back and the other thing I need to do is then get get in section 7 here this one so I need all these images I think I have this code somewhere desktop maybe Desktop website yes yes yes tutorials p5.js by the way anybody wants projects helping me think the read organize all this stuff would be amazing eight seven actually one thing I want to do is now that there web better just it just means everything everything I ever do on my channel I want to have a web editor version that you can just click on in the videos descriptions of that if you that I could would love help with but that's not what I'm doing right now I am going for here object images kittens so let's just move this to the oh no not move it let's paste it on the desktop just minimize this for a second move it over here and move it here how do I get a nice yeah there we go no I want this yeah there we go I'm like obsessively kittens and kittens and kittens there we go now the web editor and this goes here this can be here and appeared in Roswell asked beard inferior to the one in the video true okay so now this one is gonna come right here alright so this is gonna be like a prequel 27.8 I don't know whether we should renumber them or what figure that out later I'm gonna cycle the camera hello again it's me from the future inserting myself into your playlist of videos I am making a video to go right here in between seven point seven and seven point eight I don't know how you ended up here but this is best the intended point of watching between these two in this tutorial series so what I'm going to show you but you could also just be here because you want to know how to add images to the p5 web editor so this is in a series about objectoriented programming and in seven point eight this next video I look at how to use an image in an object and then have multiple objects each showing a different image all sorts of fun so but in both of these videos I'm using the atom text editor and just opening up my JavaScript p5 sketch in the Chrome browser directly and now I want to show you how to do this oh and here I'm in the p5 web editor so I'm gonna create a new sketch let me just save this and create a new sketch I mean it okay cuz that's something else going on and okay so what I want to do is just look at what let's say I am I've made this beautiful sketch it is this beautiful rectangle it's just this lovely shade of gray but what I really want is a kitten to appear there oh I just so happen to have this nice directory of little tiny kitten images I like this one and what I want to do is load this kitten JPEG into my sketch so code wise there are two functions that I need to know about one is a function called load image and another is a function called image so I might as well talk about those two while I'm here although I think I probably talked about those in the next video as well but more importantly the purpose of this video is how do I actually get this image this image into this sketch so once again this is a time for me to go over here and reveal pull back the curtain of the p5 web editor I've done this before when I made a second JavaScript file we can see that there's also an HTML file and a style dot CSS file what goes on in these files are things that I get into in a future playlist about the p5 Dom library but right here what I want to do is I want to go here and I want to say add file I did this is exactly what I did when I made a new like bubble Jas file ad file but here instead I can say oh you know what I have a feeling by the way this is the high contrast this is sorry this is maleeh this will be irrelevant that I'm saying this soon this is the high contrast theme this doesn't look like it passes the line pause for a second I we're going to file a bug report here color contrast checker we're going to coming down this download this or kind of just use it here or I can use it here so somebody help me out here there's a way to like there's a tool that I there's an app that you can download let me see color conscious analyzer Mac OS yeah let me grab this one let's see if this works sorry for this digression but this is super important let me run this okay do this no come on come on people what is it control option I can never remember command no option no I forget there's a way to do control if I control privacy no privacy privacy privacy privacy security privacy privacy security security privacy general yes open anyway thank you very much okay now let's check this the foreground color is there's a way I feel like there's a way that I can actually just know this there's a way to have this grab the color from here how do I do that color analyzer edit there's a color picker here I guess I could just look at the CSS whoops I'm determined to use this in a way that I saw a demo of this recently that was amazing but I don't remember how do I have to take like anybody know how to do this hold on I'm sort of I went off the rails here but I'm I'm I'm a stubborn stubborn person oh can I use this oh there we go that's what I want to look at okay I figured it out okay so I want to pick this color I'm gonna pick the darkest and the background color is white yeah look at this this fails the high contrast so close this let me take a screenshot of it let's go to p5.js web editor here we go issues now could there be one already what should i search for like high contrast I'll just search for contrast let me see ability to run multiple tabs so you can move the Bunco code no that's a different thing all right so this is something else okay so I'm going to erase this because I'm confident in well I'm gonna say new file new file drop zone low contrast in high contrast drag and drop instructions so can I give it a label like accessibility is there no accessibility label I won't worry about a label new file drag and drop drop low contrast in the high contrast mode on Mac OS Chrome browser the instructions drop files here to upload actually can I just get that from here drop files here to upload is not a high contrast and then now I'm going to drag this over here preview it yep okay and contrast tests alright I think that's good enough submit this issue there we go and I will reference this in the video's description and I'm gonna come back to here and I am going to all right back okay all right ah all right so now I can go here just like I did when I added a new bubble das file I'm gonna go add file and then here instead of creating a new file what I could do is actually drag a new file right in here or I can click here to select a file but I have my where'd my kittens go shoot I messed this up try this one more time I'm too easily distracted which is a bit of a problem sometimes okay okay so I want to look for this little arrow here again and click Add hold on yeah so I want to look for that little arrow again and click Add file just like what I did before when I added a new JavaScript file like bubbles yes but now instead of typing in a new file I actually am just going to drag a file over here into this region I could also click here and it's gonna open up a kind of like finder thing but I'm just gonna come over here I'm gonna grab my kitten this lovely little kitten I'm gonna drag it over here and then it's going to upload it is done and we can see kitten do dot JPEG is now part of this project you should realize though there is a limit I can't remember it's like five megabytes or ten megabytes you can't upload really big files to the web editor at present you know maybe in the future we'll figure out ways of managing the data so that you can okay so now just to just to finish this off I said I want to have a variable called image and that's the image where I want to that's the variable where I want to load the file into and then when I once I have that I want to draw that image to the canvas of course it's giving me an error now cannot read property with of undefined cannot read property with of undefined but because the image is not there okay so I need to actually load the image and then you might think like okay well there's a load image function so why not just use load image and in quotes reference the name of that JPEG well this doesn't work because I cannot call p5 functions outside of set up or draw it doesn't actually know what a p5 function is so what I could do is then say all right well image needs to be a global variable and I'm over explaining this but I think it's worth sort of noting all this so let me put load image in setup and there it worked there's the image of the kitten hmm why did this work though weird let me run this again did you see how like the kitten wasn't there at first for like a little bit like what if I say here no loop the kitten doesn't appear even though it Kim's being loaded and set up and then being drawn and draw so one of the things you have to start getting used to is the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and this will come more and more as you go into the videos about working with data and the Dom library but when we asked to load an image it's not going to be immediately ready it takes some time for it to go and grab those pixels and load them into memory but p5 and there's ways of using something called a callback which I will get to in a future video but the best way for you to do this right now so use a function called preload and preload is a special function it's kind of like the prequel to set up set up is where everything begins but before setup we have preload and what preload does is it as a place where you can load any media or data assets and make sure they are ready before setup and draw happen so in this case even with no loop that kittens always going to be there and just incidentally while we're here we should note that you know image the image function drawing this particular image which maybe I should be more clear about my variable naming and name it kitten this is exactly like the rectangle I am drawing a rectangle at 00 the only difference is I'm filling that rectangle with the pixels from that image but I can do things like give it a width and a height and you can see I've stretched the kitten this could be these could be variables and you can see now I'm it's gonna resize it's just a rectangle I could do things like say X and have a variable called X and I could say you know X plus plus and now the kitten is slowly moving I couldn't change the Y value so it's just another thing to draw that you can rotate and twist and color and turn and all that and in the next video if you are here if you happen to be watching this as part of this playlist what I'm actually going to show you in the next video you can sort of see it in the thumbnail is to make a whole bunch of objects that are images and animate them around the window okay so I hope help this clarify a little bit about using the p5 web editor with all these other surrounding videos and a55 mmm didn't get it right here you're confused please let me know in the comments and I look forward to seeing you in a future video okay now I just want to look at something I sort of think that also this I doubt is high contrast enough okay so let's look at this and now I want to go to how did I do this I go here how did I get that picker again oh here and then I get the dropper so I want to get I'm gonna get the brightest part of the letter and then the background color is picker here yeah this also fails wait let me we also file this where was I there p5 JJ s web editor and now let me upload this one and then I've got to go all right that looks good okay um I don't know what's being discussed in the chat Oh sook so uh says there's a contrast test in the yeah in the chrome developer tools that's right there's a lot of accessibility testing in the chrome developer tools I don't know how to use that off the top of my head what's disabled I'm just curious so I've got to go that's really all I came on to do I'm gonna hit stop recording in case I also like is this gonna crash this darn thing is gonna crash they didn't crash which is lucky and yeah Mastodon BOTS oh I'm just about ready to release the leases you coding challenge video I still don't have youtube premieres unlock for my account I mention that already and yeah I ever do this like live streaming for like this is literally under a half an hour I think no 31 minutes and 20 seconds and there are apparently 463 people watching do you have to law 8 honest you have to log in to use the uploading feature yes you cannot save Oh super chat is disabled that's interesting I wonder if I disabled that or if it's just disabled on YouTube in general now I'm curious not that I really care settings is the join disabled just curious I didn't put slow mode on interesting I don't know don't really care oh yeah interesting all right anybody have any questions they want to ask before I go and play my new outro music thanks for watching today's episode of the coded rain about the movie 5gs web editor actually I do have a little curiosity thing I would like anybody to test this for me this is totally please turn this off right now if you don't want to feel like someone's selling something to you but I do have a new store that I've been kind of mentioning teespring teespring calm slash stores slash slash coating train let's see how this is working so this are some new tshirts and things that I have available like for example if I click on this one which is one of my favorites I'll refractor this later you can get this and a few different styles are on a mug there's like the onesie and the kids they're supposed to be a women style a fitted shirt and a tank and a hoodie but none of those have shown up and also it's supposed to be like if I go here and you click and I click Buy It Now and I do not live in the United States if I live in the EU for example I don't know what happens if you're in other countries besides the US or Europe and I hit this and I click Add to Cart it should automatically figure out that I'm through my IP address or account or whatever that I am NOT a u.s. person when I go proceed to checkout it's going to give me a nice inexpensive in euros or pounds shipping price and not like twelve dollars in u.s. dollars because it's shipping from the US could you let me know if that we don't have to buy it just get to this step and let me know what shipping price you see and then you can feel free to write to support a teespring which I will cuz I've been kind of asking all day to see if we can get that fixed ok I want to mention that and that's it this dot later this week on coding trade now soon this Friday at 11 a.m. I will have a guess Nabeel Husein who will be very loud who will be here to show you how to train a long shortterm memory network it's a neural network design for sequences and what he's going to do is use a text corpus train the model and then generate new text based on that corpus it's going to run on the spell platform so check that out most recent upload os is a unique style transfer series which is also using the spell platform and tensor flow and ml5 Jas I did a bunch of videos on mastodons yesterday where is oh it's and coming coming out tomorrow morning the Lisa jus coding challenge video I'm just waiting for the captioning to be done 1250 shipping $12 in germany just shipping yes this is not what it's supposed to be so you can actually go to so you can go to teespring stores I think it's like the coating train EU so this is a URL which will take you to a place where it would give you like you shipping let's try this I like this color maybe do I that's a little weird it's also like it's the wrong colors but whatever let's say I do this and then I say I want the large and I do this and then I'm gonna proceed to checkout I don't understand now I got $4.99 for shipping for this one cuz it's from the EU store it's supposed to like Auto figure it out but it doesn't seem to be working so III it's not working I don't know why I got so I don't know what to do about this but if anyway but the stuff is there if you're so interested but I haven't actually like officially launched it yet because I would like it to a I would like to have the fitted and tanks and I would like it to figure out the shipping in a way that's not going to break the bank for people okay um any other questions I think I know it's 542 I've really got to go let's finish my song I'll be back on Friday Friday morning at 11 a.m. with guests Nabil Hussein stay tuned for the Lisa's you coding challenge video make your Lisa shoe patterns and all that stuff and the thing is a very bad idea live control room yeah this spring I want to do more reinforcement learning stuff when I do the nature of code class again build on top of that with tensor flow Jas goodbye see you next week on me on Friday or maybe tomorrow if I do another special box in half an hour livestream
