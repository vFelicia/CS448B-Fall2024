hello welcome to my first video beyond my introductory video about making chatbots and again I am using something called rive script and open source an open source library for chatbots link to the github repository thank you to the creators and maintainer zuv rive script it's a wonderful project I've used it and a lot of things before and I really enjoy using it so I'm gonna try to show you a bit about how it works I am NOT some sort of official representative of the rive script project I'm just a user and fan of write script the idea of Rive script is to is pattern matching is a is it it's basically a chatbot system that uses a technique called pattern matching and retrieval oh those are the right terms let me describe to you what I do the user says something hello that goes into the chatbox brain the brain does something so this is input and then gives a reply hi we could actually make a chat I know it's shocking I know we could program a chat bot that does this anytime the user says ha hello and then I could be typed in or spoken in depending on what sort of what our interactive what our what medium we're we're kind of deploying this chat bot says hello and the reply which the word reply has an L in it guess we're wondering says hi so rive script is the thing that i want to use here i want it to be the brain of the chat bot it's not the only option in the world for programming or creating a chat bot brain but it is one option i am going to start at least by using javascript and p5.js to take my input and display my reply so I'm gonna build a simple chat bot that just runs in the browser program with JavaScript to the p5 just library but I'm gonna have its brain driven by rive script and this brain uses a technique called pattern matching so ultimately there are so many different kinds of things we could put into this brain that are super sophisticated but one thing I could actually do is just say did the users say exactly this word hello or did it say the word hello or hi or howdy can I match one of these possible phrases that the user said and if it said one of these possible phrases then I'm gonna say this exact reply this is the idea of Rive script and so every rive script is really just a markup syntax for configuring different sorts of expected patterns much like a regular expression if you look at my regular expression tutorials that you might expect the user to say and the replies that should come with those patterns so every so the way arrives and rie script is modeled off of something called a I M L artificial intelligence markup language which is an XML like tag based markup thing that is interesting you could also use but rice script has a bit of a simpler syntax so in rice script every single was just a text file every single line in the text file begins with a command symbol so some possible command symbols aren't exclamation point plus minus and pound or hash tag so for example this chat bot that I want to program would look like this hello hi which means the plus means this is the pattern I want to match as the input and the reply that I want to give to that input is the this is the reply now one thing I could do is I could have two possible replies so the first thing I can do in rie script is configure an input that I'm looking for and then give a set of possible replies and rive script will pick one of those randomly there actually isn't even a syntax for waiting these so I could say 90% of the time I want to say hi and 10% of the time I want to say howdy so you know that's a level of detail that I don't think I need right now for what I'm gonna try to demonstrate but that is possible so you might be asking the question okay if that's the basic idea well how do I learn what all the possible thing I could put in here are and and hopefully I'm going to show you some of them I don't actually really I don't have them memorized so I'm gonna have to like learn them and figure them out as I go a bit and and and and how where do I learn that stuff so and and where can I test out so could I test out a brain configuration without having to write my own JavaScript code so yes yes yes all of the above just come over here with me oh look we're over here so this is the rive script website I find if you go to just rise script calm you'll come to the main web page but under here a slash Doc's tutorial this is a wonderful walkthrough of all the possible features and you can see here I'm gonna skip some stuff here about you can say here here is the your first chat bot same thing that I've said exclamation point is a kind of command symbol for like a configuration thing you can actually store variables and different things like that in the chat bot which I will get to so we want to be compatible with version 2.0 of Rive script and I want a plus to say hello bot and a minus to say I want to I want to look for the user saying hello bot and I want the bot say hello human so let's go and actually test this now there's something called the rice grip playground and I'm gonna get rid of this part of it so here is that chat bot in the rice crud playground and I can say well I'm gonna say run so I can down here say hello bot and it says hello to you men and I'm going to say hi hi bot and it says error no match reply no no reply match so here's the first thing I want to do I would like to have something that's a catchall of response for anything I don't know about let's add that so just like in regular expressions where you have meta characters and literal characters and this is what I'm saying here is like I want to match exactly hello bot and notice there's no capitalization here so capitalization and punctuation don't really play a role in the patterns that you're matching you're just looking for the raw text but I can have wildcards so I couldn't say something like Apple I love apples or apples are delicious so now I'm using a wild card so Apple anything after Apple will give you one of these responses so now if I run it Apple you eat question mark apples are delicious Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple I love apples to see we even got one the different one the second time but if I say hello Apple error no reply matched so this is one way you can use a chat bot to kind of just realize that the users kind of brought up a certain topic so for example if you want to say any where the word Apple appears if the user says anything with Apple say like oh let's talk about apples and then I can also use a complete and total just one star as a wildcard to say like I prefer to discuss fruit so now I'm gonna run my chat bot and I'm going to say hello bot hello cumin and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say let's discuss pokemons and then rock group says I prefer to discuss fruit oh I love apples and oh no oh no what happened here so look at this oh I love apples ROG script is saying I prefer to discuss fruit am I still making a video about chat BOTS in this is actually like what I'm talking about oh boy hopefully this is OK here so I think what's going on here is I have Apple space star and maybe if I did Apple star like that then now I could say oh I love apples oh let's talk about apples so that space was actually matching their the Apple space star I needed to have I couldn't you I couldn't match apples okay anyway so do you get the basic idea here this we could see here so this is very little like this is just like all I we've learned so far is I can match something exactly or I can match something with a wild card there are many more things that you can do so let's add a few more things to this chat bot now one thing that I would like to mention is that the the the these are the the plus elements without I've been calling inputs are actually called triggers so the term for that is trigger and you'll actually see in some modern chatbot systems this word called intent so we're trying to match the intention of the user what if which in what is their intention and not what would i if what is it that they want to do and i need to reply accordingly so one thing that you we can do that's nice about these wildcards is we can also use what the person said in the wildcard in the reply so i can say what if the user says my name is star and i could say nice to meet you and then star so i can refer back to what they said by putting star in the the is greater than a less than so i can say my name is coating train now interestingly enough nice to meet you coding train and it didn't keep my capitalization and there's probably some way that i can configure that we could look through the documentation and that's a little bit weird that my name is coding train but so that's one thing you can do we can also have multiple stars so i could do something like my name is star star and then i could change that nice to meet you star i could be like really weird about this star two comma star one so like for example my name is daniel she mon nice to meet you chief man comma daniel because this is a thought who likes to speak very formally so you can see here that you can match the different different stars in a particular order so again there is nothing going there's this is there's no type of learning or training i am configuring precise patterns for the bots to look for with certain replies a question is coming up in the chat which is great which is like well what if you what if the user asks something about the weather and you wanted to say well the web the temperature today is blank so this would be some this is why I want to combine drive script with JavaScript and I'm gonna do this in the next video but this is just essentially the script for the brain but there's no reason if I'm not if I'm using this brain in my own code that I couldn't also inject something like an API call so I will have you know there's no I could write my own program to do a lot if elseis if conditional statements and regular expressions that I don't need rive script for but riah script is a nice syntax for me able to configure a really elaborate set of possible possibilities and then I can combine that with coding to do something much more dynamic so that's really where I'm trying to go with this here so I want to look at a few more features in rai scripts an important feature of Rive script is substitutions because you know you might have something where the the chat bot might say who is there not the chat bot the trigger you're looking for is who is there but the user might say who's there or who is there and so something you can do in Rive script is configure all these different substitutions meaning these are equivalent substitute I'm for I am substitute I'd for I would so you can put I M in your chat bot let's do this right here let's put this here I'm gonna add this as a substitution at the top and now I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm oh I'm just gonna change this to I'm though I am sorry and now I'm gonna run this and I can say I am Dan Schiffman nice to meet you shift in comma Dan or I'm ship I'm Dan Schiffman same thing so now I have a substitution so this is a way that I can have this particular phrase and so one thing that you can actually do that we'll see is that you can have separate files that make up the brain so this thing that I'm talking about all these files can be a can have the dot rive extension and you could have many many many of these so you could have one file that just has a thousand substitutions in it and you could use that as part of the brain you could use that for multiple projects and and it you could just carry that file along with you so once you've made one chatbot or you're using somebody else's chat bar you got an example chat bot you can divide things in different files to kind of keep organized and reuse stuff another key feature is variables so I think there's two more things that I want to talk about one is variables and one is sequencing so how do you do variables so I'm pretty sure that you can just do stuff like var var name equals computer and then I think nice to meet you star and and then so if the if the user says who are you you could say I am name I think this is how this works I'm actually kind of speculating I think you can set up a name and then you can say I am that name so let's see if that works who are you I am blank so that's not right so much for me just making up what rice group does let's look for it in the tutorial okay so I found the spot in the tutorial I apologize you have to if you want to display the value of variable you have to use get as well so what I missed here is I am get name so I'm gonna run this now and I'm gonna say who are you I am undefined how what did I get wrong so it appears that for the variables that you set up at the top you can actually retrieve their values not with get but with the keyword bots get is something that I'm going to show you in a minute that's four variables that you've set in a different way using set so maybe I'm missing a few important details here that I will try to get to but so what I need to do is if I want to retrieve that variable I use bot name so these are like kind of almost like fixed constants or settings for the particular bot so I can say now I can say who are are you and it can said I am computer the reason why this is useful is I could use bot name in all sorts of places in my chat bot and then I if I wanted to change its name later I could just change it at the top so it's a way of setting just like the reason why you might use variables in coding the same reason why you might use now here's the interesting thing sometimes you might want to remember something the user says so for example let's say let's say what you what you though the user says my favorite favorite color is star now one thing I should mention is there ways of setting up specific options only that they're a valid like it has to be a number or it has to be a word or has to be one of these three words then you can have a different reply if it doesn't fit that that but but for right now I'm just gonna say my favorite color is anything and what I want to do is say oh I love and I can do set color equals star something like this too so this is this idea of in addition to displaying back what the user said I could store that in another variable now I might not have gotten this syntax exactly right let's go look at the tutorial so I'm gonna search for the part of the tutorial that's using set so yeah so set Nate I set name equal star so actually what I should do is put this at the beginning and then I can say get if I want to actually use that and I could use that later too so for I did that wrong so let's do this was right set color equals star and then I could say oh I love get color too and let me give myself a bit more room here so that fits in one line I know I'm gonna be standing in front of it but we can see here okay so now what I can do is if the user says my favorite color is blue oh I love blue but I haven't only spent sent something back to the user what I can actually say I am but who are you I am bought name and my favorite color is get color so this is a way now that the bot will always say back the same favorite color that the user has said so now we can say my favorite color is purple which is actually my favorite color and then I can say who are you I am a computer and my favorite color is purple so we can actually use stuff that the user is saying store that information and save it later so you could imagine if you're creating a bot to have a conversation over a period of time that's gonna remember stuff about the user this could be incredibly useful so the important thing here is the difference between bot variables which are the ones you set up at the top and other variables that you're setting during the conversation with set so I have a set of examples that will include front links from this video that mostly pull from that tutorial I'm just going to kind of show you those right now because we could spend forever like showing you each possible configuration but I think once you get the basic idea of how it works you can read through the documentation yourself the key thing here that I want to demonstrate to you is the next step which is actually using this in your own program in JavaScript which is pretty exciting and interesting so this is some of an example that I have so I already talked to you about star which means match anything and you can you can say you could have different stars star 1 star 2 you can have a catchall you can match only a number so if if the if it's not a number you could you could match you could you could say back like oh please give me a number you can match only A to Z characters you can have something optional like if the user says what is your phone number or what is your number optional anything is a nice way to match a topic so if so if the this is sort of us doing this earlier you can see if the user uses the word JavaScript anywhere can you teach me to program in JavaScript you can use in other so if the user says I love purple or I love pink you could say what about red so this is a lot of this you'll notice the syntax is very similar to regular expressions and you can also use an array so I was kind of mentioning this before right you can set up an array of different options and then you can say what if the user says anything that matches anything from that array so there are so many Possible's possible configurations that's just a little bit I'm trying to think if I missed anything else that I wanted to show you in here learning I mentioned in terms of like saving information oh and you can also have conditionals so so this is really great so one thing let's try this actually so let's try to use I think the age is a good except it a number oh yeah this would be a great chat bot where the bot thinks of a number and the user has to like guess the number so maybe actually that's what we'll do when I get to the JavaScript example so let's not worry too much about this right now you can see that if if the if the bot says if the user sorry if the trigger is it's always very confusing I keep saying the wrong thing if the user says and my older than you if the users age that was set up here is greater than 10 say you are I am 10 if the users age is less than or equal to 10 nope I am 10 so this is like saying that the bots age is 10 and incidentally I could make that a bot variable as well or a user set variable because maybe the user says how old the bot is I don't know so there's so many possibilities here I hope this gives you boy this was a really terribly disorganized introduction to Rive script I you know admittedly I was really figuring it out as I went I don't know write script that well but I kind of did this for myself to remind me how it is and what it does and now I want to take that next step and use rive script in a JavaScript program you could and you can use one of the things I love about writing scripts is it's open source it's MIT license and you can use it in a variety of programming languages I'm using in JavaScript so I'll see you in the next video where I'm going to do that
