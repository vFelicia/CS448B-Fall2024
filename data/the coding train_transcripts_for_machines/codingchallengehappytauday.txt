happy holiday everybody take point 2.80 there's no point there six point two eight three one eight five three oh seven one seven nine five okay welcome to a special just me wasting time on the internet but you know it's worth noting the day we i noted pi day and I made a coding challenge which was an approximating PI by using a kind of dart throwing technique let me close all this stuff up we can run the example right here the idea is I'm throwing darts into my processing canvas and the ratio of the number of darts that land outside of the circle versus inside the circle give me the value of pi now one of the comments I got so much on this video was but you're using PI to calculate pi well no I'm not and I want to be clear about this I'm going to comment out all of these lines of code right here and I'm gonna say print line pi so there we go we can see my approximation of pi right here now I am sort of using PI in the sense that probably the value of pi is used where is that ellipse function somewhere in here no wait I thought maybe I use the ellipse function oh I do in where this ellipse function is drama let me comment this out so now I am not using the ellipse function which probably behind the scenes is using PI and I am I am only using the reason why I'm seeing a circle is because I am calculating the distance of each point to the center and checking if it's below a certain amount and if it's below a certain amount it means it's inside a circle let's just look here the only place where I might be calling math.pi is now commented out I was just using that to compare okay so we can see here that this is in fact not using Chi but giving me this meant now why does this work now I already covered this in the previous video so you totally could just go away and do something else right now but if you don't want to go watch the previous video the reason why this works just to talk about it again is if this is a square and this is a circle right the area and this is a value called R the value of the sorry the area of the square is each side of this square is to R so the area of that square is 2 R squared 2 R squared or 4 R the area of the circle as we know maybe from some math class is PI R squared so here I am using the idea of pi but only only because I know that that's the definition of the area of a circle now what if I were to just throw darts at the wall and I would count how many darts landed in the circle versus how many darts landed overall that would be the same so the total darts divided by the circle only should be equal to well this before our squared for R squared divided by PI R squared so now what I want to do is solve for pi well first of all the R squared can be is gone so then I could say 4 times total divided by circle total equals 1 divided by PI ok I just flipped those right so pi equals the circle total divided by 4 times the total total that seems kind of right oops I always get my math wrong okay guess what everybody all right let's do this again okay so now if I reverse these I could say pi divided by four equals the circle and it should say Circle T like the circle total divided by the total now I can just multiply each side by four and I could say four times circle T divided by total equals PI or PI equals this and we go back to my code we have four times the total number that landed in the circle x divided by the total overall so that's there so now what if I want to approximate oh well what is tau tau by the way is okay so what's the circumference of this circle meaning what's the length of the arc all the way around to PI R well that seems like an awkward way of writing it why do I have to have this to here what if I just had a value that instead of being PI was twice the value of pi then I could say the circumference is just that value times R and that's what tau is Oh something it's a Greek letter that I've totally botched let me go look up how to draw that better so here's the Greek letter write uppercase to lowercase towel so I can go back and son so I do the worst job here I guess it yeah that kind of that'll be so I could say it's a tau R and guess what if R is one the circumference of the unit circle is tau the circumference of the unit circle is tau naught 2 pi I don't know people now enjoy the comment section of this video everybody so here's the thing what if I want to approximate tau okay oh boy oh boy okay well the area of the circle is still 4r squared and the area of the fittest I'm sorry the area of the square is still 4 R squared but the area of the circle pie well no no pi divided a Tau what is it with town Town town divided by 2 pi divided by 2 R squared okay so yeah I love this is super nice I gotta say it's tau divided by 2 5 to 2 where do I want the welcome to here to there but let's say I do this then the total weight for R squared or tau divided by 2 R squared so the R's get cancelled out that this becomes an 8 and so now the value of tau guess what you just double it it's just double its how it's just double pi PI is just half towel whatever you want just live your life tau and PI just ate and then this is tau so we now can go and revise my coding job that's really you're still watching this video apparently I'm gonna stop this and we're going to we're gonna make one of these for all of you tau lovers out there this one goes out to all you tau lovers out there from me to you we're gonna change this to record towel we're gonna draw that we don't need to draw that this is unnecessary code just save this before I forget it's approximating towel and I'm just put this on the desktop of my computer this is processing it's Java processing org everybody always asks then I'm going to come down here well I don't need to do so many each frame my formula here is now 8 tau is a and I can now what I want to do is I need to check the record Tao if I get one closest cuz redo the record and then now and this is now Tao and then ah this is just math Tao and math dot tau all right oh and this is record Tao okay we're good I did it I redid my coding on what what Java dot math hmm where are the constants where are the constants hold on math doc hi Java hmm yep pi oh there we go here are the constants e we get e we get PI I don't see tau I don't see towel this video is over forget it done all right fine I'll devote to it anyway anyway but this is so sad this is what I have to do look away everybody look away don't look don't look and now we are now approximating tau happy tile day everybody see ya you
