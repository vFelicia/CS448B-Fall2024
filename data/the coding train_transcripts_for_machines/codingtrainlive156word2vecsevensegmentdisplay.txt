hello happy Friday I thought I would try for an entrance it's actually work we're started with nobody here for a minute and just music playing and then I enter did that happen is my microphone off why are you hiding could you tell I was hiding underneath the air and I slipped that way I guess I could have a computer over there though I start this dream from anyway hello everyone welcome today's Friday which means coding training day hello perhaps to the NYU Tandon student I met at the library yesterday maybe probably unlikely but if you're watching say hello in the chat at Tandon is the school for engineering at New York University in Brooklyn and I'm often there working in the library and every time there's somebody come to expand says hey watch my videos which is kind of amazing because that really doesn't happen to many other places or really any other place frankly alright looks like oh let me get my chat up here hello to the oh I don't think I actually sent a little notification here I'm gonna say Channel I am live now if you're wondering where I am sending this to I there is a slack channel that you can get an invite to by joining the patreon or joining the YouTube thing through the join membership blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so today I will just be saying blah the entire time I had this idea that I wonder if I could do a coding tutorial just through guttural sounds and gesture but maybe today is not the day to try doing that also might not be the most accessible way to do a tutorial so I I'm going to talk about something called word Tyvek today before I get into that let me do some housekeeping not really housekeeping but I'm so unprepared for word to bec but I spent five minutes preparing for this livestream by pulling up a couple links of things I wanted to show so first of all if you are not already aware let's see if this actually works processing Community Day is happening in Los Angeles on January 19th 2019 that is a Saturday I believe it is happening at UCLA and you can get your tickets there early bird tickets are available until October 31st I will be there my kids will be there because we have a new track for families and there's lots of exciting wonderful stuff that's happening that day so I encourage you to come if you can now if you cannot come to the Los Angeles prosecuted a because maybe that is just not a place you can get to reasonably check out PCD worldwide there are at the moment many processing community days in all these cities around the world that is this is kind of unbelievable and I wanted to highlight one the organizers are some of the organizers are alumni of the program ITP where I teach and they are hosting a processing community day in India it looks to me like here they're actually four in India I know it's probably like around midnight is it midnight like India like a half someplace they need a half hour off so either midnight or 1230 in India and I'll show you this one here in Bangalore and February 2nd 2019 organized by these wonderful folks Russia Ali who I believe is probably actually just a couple floors down in this building right now I kind of have a fantasy of going to one of these crossing and community days in India ll see if we can I can make it up and a little difficult to travel that's that time of year so far but who knows all right so that's one thing I want to mention I also wanted to give a shout out to coding trained viewer Eliza I just discovered has a podcast we've kind of like the most awesome name ever unicorns fart pixels and I have to admit I discovered it because somebody mentioned that I was mentioned and I listened to the episode where she talks about coding train amongst other things so there's a little bit of like vanity here and me showing you this podcast but so I did listen to episode five first yesterday which talks about Bob Ross and me and Patricio and coding train and book of shaders and all sorts of other things but I and I'm planning to go back and listen to the other episodes so I encourage you to check out this wonderful podcast about web development and creative coding it's great unlike my frantic frenetic behavior I feel like Eliza has a very nice soothing comforting quality in her voice in this podcast I wanted to mention that I also wanted to mention as a frame for reference that the Cody crane has a website and for every coding challenge that I do I have a page on the website so I'm trying to get this better but you could see so this is by the way something that is an opportunity for the community to contribute to so if you're interested in helping with maintaining this website that's wonderful Neil's Webb did at Neal's Webb on github I think did almost all of the work for building this website out originally and Watsonville have contributed I'll note me I am so me who has made lots of technical improvements that fixes and advised on this and Austin who is also contribute a lot of like the visual design interface stuff but the reason why I'm mentioning this is it's been a little I guess I don't mention this every video and it's been a little light on the community contributions so this is not the simplest system but if you're looking for your first open source contribution you can add a project that you have made based on one of my challenges to this page by following these instructions and involves making a pull request on github there's no content management system for this other than the github repository itself and it's certainly something I could think about incorporating the future but if you're here I can click on this and we can see this is Cole Spears look at this rotate zoom with mouse scroll press space or enter for new leases you Lisa jus Lisa jus shape and check console for 3d leases you table position okay so I can looks like I can rotate around this if I hit the spacebar it starts over well some of the other commands does not remember anything scroll oh yeah scroll I can zoom in and out so this is lovely the scene I love seeing these contributions of projects that people have made and I'd like to if I can remember highlight them on the live streams as well I'll note that there is this new button someone recently made a pull request that I have this button that just takes you right to the code and then if I could manage to remember to port which I already actually did but there is actually already a to p5.js port of this challenge and I believe it's actually linked to right here but this live example should actually take you to it running in the browser but it's not currently so that's something that somebody could add to this page that's missing and there's information on this like see how to contribute stuff all right so I wanted to mention that also I've got all this new design stuff that you might have seen thank you Jason Hagglund new characters and sort of a new little train passenger they're like my friends this is this dot over there so and there's the semicolon the asterisk so I'm oh I love any design ideas or feedback or to incorporate into the site of some of the new materials and I've posted a where is all this stuff it is at github comm slash coding training slash website if I go here under issues yeah like I even posted an issue here new coding terrain banner I gave it the hack Tober fest tag there's this hack tober fest thing going on I'm trying to I guess which is run by digital ocean when waiting for my digital version sponsorship and if you support open source projects you can earn a limited edition tshirt so I've been trying to remember to tag various things that I'm involved with with Oktoberfest alright so I want to mention that now one more thing if anyone while you're watching right now I have a little challenge for you to do while you're watching I was going to do this as part of the live stream but I think it might be more efficient to have somebody do this while I'm doing other stuff and then give me the results so I want to at some point today before I leave train a word to Veck train Network new word Tyvek model with a source text and I thought maybe it would be interesting to see what happens if I use my nature of codebook as the source text it's a pretty decent amount of text it's not huge obviously have a robust model and I know the camera just went off I would need a much larger body of text but this something I think we could work with right now so in order to do this so it's a little bit tricky on this this is the repo you want to be at Schiffman slash the nature of code clone or download this repo you're going to want to go into chapters and then this is all of the raw HTML all of the raw text of the book welcome title page dedication ba ba ba on all the different chapters so what I what I need is to take all of these HTML files strip out maybe using a red regular expression or some kind of like fancy Python thing that you know about strip out all the HTML tags and leave it with just the text the raw text of the book and then concatenate it all into one file so obviously we want one file nature of code dot txt that is just the raw text of the book and I'll use that to train a word to Veck model this also could be useful because I could use it for my on LS TM example that I would hope to make and why by the way it's ok I I do this I don't want to be doing this I don't want to be saying acronyms and having people watching me going I have to leave now this is not for me LST m it is something that actually Nabil Hussain was here last week against presentation on but it's a kind of neural network that can be used for sequence data and for generating text and so we're Tyvek is the thing maybe who never heard about I don't claim to be an expert on word Tyvek and all but I am going to talk about it and show a wonderful tutorial by Allison parish which covers a lot about how word Tyvek works and then try to play around make some examples with worked effect today all right uh yeah so Matthew brawn it made a note in the chat here ignoring the gem file dot lock vulnerability on github yes I did conveniently ignore that I couldn't actually so I now by the way so github when you have a project hosted on github and one of you are packages that your project is dependent on has a security vulnerability and will give you this alert and I was able to I had this alert for all these node packages and I know I do like NPM something on it and you fix that and upgrade stuff and it works able to do that I could not figure out how to fix the gem file dot lock vulnerabilities maybe I would have totally accept a pull request on that if that's a thing I think that's a thing that somebody could do without me being an administrator I don't know enough about ruby stuff and frankly I don't think oh no yeah oh this is for github pages that's why it's in there so anyway please don't fix it O'Neil's webOS say don't fix it Neels web in the chat stop stop all of all all stop training train pulled stop pearl the emergency brake I don't abuse websites don't fix it I was expected by the time I said that there would be more information about why not but that's that for now all right let's see here I think that's that was my introduction to to the fact now I have to start doing some content thing I said I was gonna do word Tyvek and I think I should do work Tyvek today ye but you know I made a mistake because I'm going to talk about word back in my nyu class week a week and a half from now and typically you might think that i have no idea what i'm doing and i never practice and I'm just winging it which is mostly true but I do have a policy especially when I'm trying a new topic I try to actually look at it in my course first where I have students that I can engage with and talk about and get feedback from and ask answer questions and get get tips on and and I try to make a video about it so I really should probably wait a couple weeks but I've already put it as the title of this and I got nothing else I got nothing else besides I could do like a flocking coding challenge which I keep needing to do Oh actually I was thinking of submitting a flock yet something about flocking to Tom Scott's guest thing I mean maybe I should maybe Tom Scott but you'd be anyway I should mention this just cuz this is a cool if you're a youtuber or want to and want to submit a Tom Scott was a wonderful channel um TAS guests for one month anyway I probably that makes sense for me to submit anything I put the wrong person for this but but anyway I'll mention it now all right oh no no this is this is visible yeah I do not want a buzz I did I have my own special by hands yeah I don't want to talk about this this cup over here anymore I won't even mention it Thank You Sahil Khattar II I guess the superjet is back on it was off its back on okay all right ah Neil's web writes breaking news everyone someone make me a breaking news like a custom coding train breaking news sound effect it should have like dignity and then like you can use my voice everyone boom boom boom boom boom breaking news coding train breaking news remix all that into something amazing I'll totally use it all the time a new member on noob of arune thank you welcome a new bob Varun I will be sending out if you're a new member check the community tab for the posts that you can view that have a link to a Google Form to get in the slack channel okay Neil's web rights I have an updated version locally but it's not pull requested yet there is also some really weird stuff where like weird stuff going on with it that completely breaks everything when you try to reinstall the websites dependency it's awesome and I finally got it working locally to toot I I added the toottoot although there is a little like one of those emojis emojis this is the sound for that emoji I think but I have a big tooth to Jabba asks what's going on right now you're watching a person who was desperately procrastinating by randomly talking about nonsense in order not to have to do a tutorial about word Tyvek but I'm gonna stop procrastinating and I'm gonna talk about word Bek deep breathing everyone okay alright so let's get started so I need to pull up some stuff here I want to first go to github.com slash Schiffman /p v word Bek this is an old repo where I'm going to pull some stuff from mostly I wanted to grab this URL then I want to say Alison parish a strange loop but would also recommend this particular there's a way there we go this looks good I wanted to recommend this particular talk from Alison which is really amazing and then I also want to let's see I'm looking for a reference yeah I'm looking for here Oh thud this is like the most roundabout way ever to find this thing that I'm looking for then I'm looking here word vector source then I want to go here okay and then I actually should keep this as well cuz this is another reference that I used to create that I to create this the materials that are in my head that I'm going to work on today and then there's one other place oh yeah glove word Tyvek yeah alright okay so now I have all my references and I can begin okay um hold on just looking here here's a quick spreadsheet for the word to Veck dist in case interesting wonder what that is all right hello India so many viewers from India that's wonderful alright so how am I gonna do this I have no no plan my entire plan is this so just give you some background I made a little p5 module about word Tyvek maybe this was a year ago two years ago something like that a year and a half ago interestingly what is word Tyvek really the I mean is it the training a group of related models that are used to produce word word embeddings interesting all right all right oh sorry I'm over here all right I think I'm just going to begin what I was going to say was I think that today might actually just be largely exploratory and I just try a bunch of things and not actually take the content and make editor tutorial videos out of them else to do it so why not why not just start with Alison's tutorial okay oh glove is not word Tyvek global vectors forward representation yes sorry but it does have so this is a great point that is that Simon is making Simon writes in the chat it is Thank You Metsa for reminding me about the LS TM intros I need to record glove is perhaps using a different algorithm we're Tyvek is a particular algorithm to generate word embeddings or word vectors word to Veck a word to vac model so to speak and glove I guess uses a different particular algorithm but if I'm correct the end result is the same it's a word that is paired with a 300 dimensional vector word embedding is also another way of saying it so maybe I'm let me let me put the glove stuff aside so that that doesn't become a confusing thing but let me just begin all right okay all right here we go hello welcome to a new session from I don't know is it the machine learning course is that the programming with Dex cores I don't know I'm just here I'm just the person who's here and this session which will be a whole bunch of videos is about a topic word Tyvek I ring the bell way too much so first of all I want to mention something very important I known about word Tyvek and I've used it in projects for a little while but I don't think I ever really understood it and I don't even know that I really do understand it but I definitely improved my understanding of it vastly after reading this amazing tutorial by Allison parish it's a post it as a gist on github it's a Python notebook understanding word vectors by Alison parish you know honestly if I find being truthful you should just stop this video right now and read this instead you know a few some people seem to like to listen to me prattle on which is fine you could keep watching if you so choose read this after then at the very least and so this tutorial is a released under Creative Commons by 4.0 license the code itself is the Creative Commons 0 license so you can reuse this material which is what I'm doing right now I don't usually do this again I'm all our stuff is always based on other people's stuff but this this first video I'm really gonna like talk through what's in this tutorial in my own words but if you do the same please reference with attribution according to the license ok so I also want to mention that Alison Parrish has a wonderful talk it's on YouTube I will link to it called experimental creative writing with a vectorized word from a strange loop conference so I also encourage you to take a look at that as inspiration and background for what it is I want to show you my end goal with this tutorial is to get to the point where I have a p5 Java Script sketch in the browser where I can do stuff with word defect what has worked the point of this video that you're watching right now is I'm taking a very long time to start is just to answer the question what is word Tyvek by the end of it I want to use word defect in two projects to make weird stuff happen with text on a webpage all right how are you feeling so all right so let's let me come over here for a second because I've written word to back up here that's gonna help me the idea of word Tyvek and there's the this is a machine learning process similar to other things that I've done that looked at like classification is this image a cat or a dog or a regression analysis what's the what's can you predict the price of this house based on certain properties of that house these are classic machine learning examples word Tyvek is a particular machine learning model that produces something calls a word embedded now what if it's a very very fancy term and what it means is that any given word like Apple can be associated with numbers a vector this we can basically somehow come up with this sort of like numeric mathematical essence of this word as some array of numbers like zero point seven and one point two and negative point zero point 3 4 5 etc etc and there's gonna be some amount of numbers in here this seems like a crazy thing why would I ever want to have a word associated with an array of numbers well one of the things that one can do with arrays of numbers is math linear algebra multiplying subtracting averaging adding so we know we can do that with arrays of numbers and this is the kind of thing that happens in lots of my other tutorials with programming graphics and pixel processing and machine learning but one thing we wouldn't know how to do is how would we say you know Apple plus plus orange but that could be I was trying to like come up with something a good example this is what happens when you don't play on these tutorials in advance but to come up with an example on the fly Apple plus purple with the could this equal plum maybe right like in other words like I'm trying to come up with some it's like pseudo math like let's take these two words and add them together like cat plus cute maybe that equals kitten can I take and like we're not saying about concatenation Apple purple we're saying Apple plus purple could I get those sort of mathematical essence of these words add them together and get a new word well the theory the prompt the idea here that the argument that I that I am making to you is that word Tyvek is a mechanism by which you can do stuff like this right there in your code if I could quantify the word Apple as a series of numbers and I could quantify the word purple as a series of numbers then couldn't I just add all those numbers together I would get a new series of numbers and then I might look and find which word or has a set of numbers that is most close to these set this set of numbers how could I find the similarity I could calculate a similarity score between any two sets of numbers I can find the word that has the most similar to this Plus this and maybe it would be plum why would it be plum is that magic it's because what data that's word defect model was trained on oh yes it's the ladder but and so I want to get to all of that okay this is my sort of like a zoomed out view of why we're doing this let's come over and look at what Allison has in her particular tutorial here which are which is a really nice example if I look at this we can say like well imagine like a really simple case right I was sort of saying over here each word gets a list of maybe a hundred numbers maybe it's three hundred numbers maybe it's a thousand numbers this is up to us to sort of figure out decide based on what we're trying to do but what if we simplify that and here's Allison's example where each word gets essentially two numbers and those numbers are data properties of that word like a cuteness score from 0 to 100 and a size from 0 to 100 so you could say kitten is 95 15 and hamster is 80 comma 8 right there these numbers that's sort of like the label is tied to a set of data point data properties so if that's the case then we can look we could graph all of those and we could say something like oh you know like a horse and the dolphin are kind of like similar in terms of size and in terms of size and cuteness and then we can start to do things but but actually like we could do a mathematic analysis like what is the actual Euclidean distance Euclidean distance means the number of well in this case pixels or units between these two words right here these are very similar because they're physically close to each other and we can also do things you can think of those as and this is a nice demonstration of this idea this is why we talk about it as vectors right I have a whole set of tutorials about vectors describing as describing points in space so for example a vector a velocity vector if I have a particle in a particle system and I wanted to go from here to here this is its velocity its change in location in essence this is basically what I'm doing with an operation like this for example what if I said ok well Apple is over here and then I'm going to add purple to it I'm going to move by purples numbers and over here I now find plum so when we look at this in two dimensions it kind of makes a we can sort of like our brains can understand that two dimensions is like the easiest dimension I mean I have to define two dimension be easier than one dimension one mentions weird sometimes but and we could see here that the relationship between tarantula and hamster is just like chicken and kittens may be close to puppy right and so this I have to pause for a second wow talk about improvising I have no idea if this is making any sense all right oh wow sponge man already made my nature of code dot txt thank you I'll have to look back at that in a little bit all right so what allison is showing here is by moving from let's say one word to another word physically in space we can establish this idea of word relationships chicken is two kitten as tarantula is to hamster now this is all very arbitrary with like hardcoded word vectors so the but this is just for demonstration purposes and in two dimensions so that our brains can kind of process it ultimately if we have a lot more information somehow about all of these words in higher dimensional space in vectors that have a hundred dimensions a hundred numbers we can't visualize that so easily there are interesting techniques for called dimension reduction reduction ality reducing the dimensionality that we could then draw like word clusters and stuff and maybe I'll get to that later but what I'm trying to say here is that we can establish sophisticated complex relationships between words in higher dimensional space but in order to do that it's useful to look at a single example that ties words to numbers in a low dimensional space that we can either visualize or sort of like put into our brains and so I've kind of described to you what word Tyvek is what the model looks like when it's complete I haven't looked at all about the training process right the animals example is hardcoded I'm gonna show you I'm gonna do a port of one of Allison's examples of words associated colors associated with numbers right a color a word red is 255 comma zero comma zero that's a word to a vector and that's going to be from a data set and then the third thing that I'm gonna do is look at what is traditionally thought of as word to Veck these higher dimensional large large dictionaries of words and their associated vectors those word embeddings so that's going to be the journey here I don't know how many videos it's gonna be 3 4 5 471 something like that and then at some point I'll try to also do some projects with that so in the next video I'm going to do a port of Alison's project which you can find all in Python all the code in Python on that tutorial that's linked in the description and I'm gonna do a JavaScript port of it okay so I'll see you there maybe or maybe not go read that page it's excellent ok good bye all right uh so I have a question for those of you viewing at home or wherever you might be had you never heard of word to Veck before and are you a beginner if so hopefully all right okay all right so we're gonna come down to the color idea and I am going to basically do this from scratch but I am going to need to open oh no come back come back xkcd x.x yeah I want a new why is that not opening in a new tab X okay I will just do it manually open in a new tab and close this this I still need you just open up something here on this computer in case I want to use it as a reference this is me right yeah made sense although I was only half listening that's good or bad all right okay github.com slash Roz Vaughn says this was okay and understandable Thank You Roz bond oh yeah sorry I'm opening up I have a repo which has code for doing this and in case I get really stuck it would be useful to have it as a reference if you're looking for it it's ship github slash shipment /p v word Tyvek and i'm looking at the word color vectors but then what I want to get is is the color data come on this is so crazy how it won't control open in a new tab okay so I'm gonna start with this and I'm going I'm not gonna do this in the p5 editor this I think is requires a bit more so then I'm gonna go to the desktop and do word to vac oops it doesn't autofill if it doesn't exist but I'm so used to like Gmail now just like finishes my sentences for me I'm like you know the directory name that I want to make just tab finish it for me all right now and then I want to do p5 G B and what do I wouldn't say a color let's say color vectors oh I didn't I didn't install this NPM G NPM install p5 manager dusty so I use a tool called p5 manager which will spin up all the files I need for a p5 project really quickly and of course that didn't work as I made all these workflow videos setting up all of my settings and I need a like a fresh user on this computer went back to this user and none of the stuff is set up how do I fix that thing again it's fix of course I went over this in my video but I can't remember it fix NPM permissions and this is the way that I like to do it I like to make a directory called NPM global and this set that as the path and then export that and source but I'm using zsh so source z RS r zs r CH c are these our s Pro Z s HRC that's what it is zs HRC there we go and now I should be able to install that apologies that I'm not explaining what I'm doing but I do explain this in my work look let me get back to the chat here whoohoo somebody already made a breaking news sound effect let's all this okay whip sigh have my mute that somebody made a breaking news sound effect which I am throwing caution to the wind I'm just gonna play live right now it's actually pretty good okay that is pretty good all right and Simon is telling me that a glove is faster than we're Tyvek great no thank you okay now p5o you don't had this idea oh I mentioned Tom Scott up my brain needs to stay focused on one thing it does not work that way p5 p5 G B B B I think it's G B color vectors let's try that okay that worked then I want to I'm going to open this up in Visual Studio code let's move over a tiny bit and move over a tiny bit and then let's get here I don't want the libraries because I prefer to just use the CDN and so I have to change the template I'll do that eventually CDN p5.js and let's grab this I want them let's use them unified and put that I don't want to follow the link I just want to put this in here and then I want to put this in here I want to do this copy copy copy copy copy copy copy I don't think I'm gonna use sound so I can get rid of this I don't need all this CSS nonsense and now I am ready I can say no canvas console.log hello color vectors and I can run a server I could run the light then I'm gonna say run my server and now I really should develop something that just spins all this stuff up all at once localhost 8080 which I am amusingly googling instead of oh there we go hello color vectors there we go alright we're ready to start coding now what I need to do is get sorry I want to get where am I looking for here I want this file and I'm gonna put it in where to vak color vector it's xkcd JSON and that's from here go back to here and from here okay all right yes Mathew Braun says copy the CD ends to the templates of your future self will be happy I know but I don't want to waste the time do it now but I won't remember before the next time I come back and you're to tell me again it's a vicious cycle that never ends okay teeth knee Hajduk is it tight teeth knee oh this is gonna be that's gonna be good for some stick later alright I need an eraser which I have here need a marker which I have here okay alright alright part two of my word to vex series your back and I thank you for that hello I'm here to talk about word vectors alright so let me let me mention again well lots of people sorry are lots of people are already doing my nature code thing which is really cool okay hello part two I think I'm on part two of my word Tyvek series I'm talking about word vectors word embeddings words and numbers and how they go together now let me be very clear here this particular section this video is directly based on this wonderful tutorial by Alison parish called understanding word vectors released under the creative commons by 4.0 license if you also use this stuff please attribute it according to the license to allison parish i will include a link to this in the video's tutorial i talked a bit about word vectors in general and about this tutorial and other things that you might look at for inspiration in the previous video and now in this video i'm going to do a direct port of i went too far away ah there we go language with vectors color so a lot of people who are well who are watching this live at the moment we're asking about I don't get it I sort of get that that's like word well word in vectors or word embeddings but like what that made no sense when I would just went on a tangent here so people were asking in the previous video I don't get it like I thought that word vectors are just kind of like about the meaning of the word or the meaning of the word in its context or similarity between words and I don't why what is cuteness I have this example before I've looked at Allison Parrish example with like cuteness and sighs what does that have to do anything so let me be clear my goal is to get to the point where we're talking about this more generalized idea that ends that we get word embeddings words paired with numbers from a machine learning process that generates these numbers according to the way words appear in a very large body of text but we're not doing that yet I just want to look at this idea of a vector space and some of the math associated with it and how that can transfer to text and this is exactly what Allison Parrish does in her tutorial and oh boy that was a mess sorry buddy you know what we should keep that and then someone should make like a little animated a little animated a little animated I kind of get this a little animated thing wait hold on oh oh here's everybody ah this is not this was going well in its own way but it's alright there's somebody talking in the hallway kinda loud can you hear them alright let's try this one more time yes are on my ukulele hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again yeah I guess I will just sort of explain that again I don't even remember what I said so okay all right m'kay demo 88 asks why you always have to click the camera on and off I will refer you to the television program losts from the 19 from the Ox what most los times in the 90s note it's early twothousands whatever I'll refer you to that program where a button had to be pressed lest and that button was not pressed the world would cease to exist and I'll make the case every 30 minutes I'll put ok I'm slowly lost my momentum so what I want to do is do a direct port of this example from Allison parish about language with vectors colors now people were asking in the previous video I kind of looked at Alice's example of like Oh a word like an animal could be paired with data like its size and its cuteness what does that have to do with word vadik embeddings weren't you oh this camera lid off wait this do not go off its cable is loose or its plug is out it's like there we go it's it's a kid it's it's a connection issue ah jeez how many times all right I don't even know where I was so so what I want to do is go through this exact example which is in this tutorial in Python and port it's a JavaScript and what this example is going to do it's going to give us the opportunity to look at the idea of a word paired with a particular is this where I was I'm like oh and I haven't even recording this to disk everything what a mess I can do this I can get past this part where I'm stuck Thank You Siddharth I don't understand why anyone would possibly give me a super chat right now with what's going on in the Prix but I think I'm gonna try to just go from where I walked over there that's yeah thank you for all everything that you do so what I want to do is a direct port of this example from Allison Parrish that looks at language with vectors colors now let me let me be clear about something for a second in the previous video I talked a little bit about this example which was looking at animals in a two dimensional space where the x axis is like their size and the y axis the size of x axes are cuteness and is that word Tyvek well not exactly this these are word embeddings meaning there is a word embedded with some numeric data that's the best way to describe it but it's not exactly what you will find if you look up the term word to Veck word Tyvek is a particular algorithm a machine learning algorithm to take a large body of text and produce these word embeddings high dimensional arrays of numbers based on how the words appear in context in that text I'm gonna get to that a little bit later so sort of in theory the theory of it is we'll end up with this essence of the word and words that are similar in meaning or context or what if that's a big question mark are going to live close to each other in that 100 or 300 or a thousand dimensional space but I'm making the case and this is really from Allison parish's tutorial that we can maybe understand this concept or practice this concept in a simpler way to start and that simpler way will be to use a data set so for example this is a data set from the ER the color survey results from X xkcd so who in the rainbow can draw the line where the violent tint ends and the orange tint begins it's distinctly we see the difference of the colors but where exactly does one first blending enter into the other so with sanity and insanity how apt okay this got some bad language on it come back family friendly friendly coding Channel I want to use this data set it's the xkcd color set it's the 954 most common RGB monitor monitor colors as defined by hundreds of thousand participants in a color name survey you can see more information about that survey here so anyway but the data set itself is over here on in the darius because that means open source project corpora which has a lot of interesting JSON data sets so i have downloaded that data set and i have it right here so the question is can we turn this into a word to Veck like scenario and what kind of strange outcomes can happen if we could pair each one of these words or sets of words like cloudy blue with a set of numbers all right so let's write some code to do this Oh internet I'll a to Internet which means I love you and I hate you I late you internet I love you alright let's write some code okay so first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to add to this preload function and I am going to just create a data set I'm going to say data equals low JSON xkcd JSON and then I'm gonna say here in setup console dot log data so let's make sure this works I'm going to go to the browser where I have my code running and kind of set a setting network I'm looking for Network disable cache there we go okay so we can see here that I have now loaded into that variable that array of 949 colors each one is an object with a label cloudy blue under the color property and an actual hex value so my goal right now is to turn that into a list that looks more like this the label with a number apologies for a second here need a tissue okay so all right so let me first write a little bit of code to kind of process that data so I am going to let's write a function up you know process data put in a separate function and I'm gonna create a variable call it vectors it's going to be an object and in this in this object I first want to go through everything in data and actually everything that's in data is in data colors so I'm going to say let colors equal data dot colors then I'm gonna say colors dot length Oh audio fill autocomplete you do not complete me colors and then I'm going to get an individual color is colors index I and then what I want to do is say vectors create I'm gonna used create vector so this is what's kind of interesting about this I forgot why I was doing this all right so here's the thing right now the data the data from that data file is just in a big array and the array has a bunch of objects in it color you know blue comma RGB I forget what it is and then like the hexadecimal you know value like this it looks like this I want this to be in a associative array a dictionary but I'm just gonna use a JavaScript object for that so just an object where the color blue is the property name and the value of that property and originally in my head I was like oh I just need to convert this into numbers and then I could make a little array like zero comma zero 255 but guess what I want to do vector math my vector is three dimensional because there's an RG and a B there happens to be in p5 itself a class called p5 vector I can make an instance of it with the create vector function so even though eventually later if I'm gonna be doing vector math on a hundred dimensional vector an array with a hundred numbers in it this create vector won't work it's a nice coincidence that RGB has three components just like a three dimensional space plates look coordinate XYZ at three dimensional vector so I can put in here that p5 vector create vector 0 comma 0 comma 255 so that's what I'm trying to write the code to do so I can say vectors I so I'm going to say I'm actually say label equals colors index eye color and then RGB equals colors index I dot and what what is it in here it is hex it's under hex and actually I'm pretty sure that in p5 if I have a string like let s equal zero zero zero this is a the hexadecimal code for red I can say color s and it will give me a color object that has the RGB values in it so what I'm gonna do is a little confusing because everything is called color so there's the colors inside of the JSON file and each element of the colors array has a color label and now there's a p5 color function so there's a lot of stuff called color it's all different but I'm gonna say RGB equals the color function with the hex thing passed through it and then I can say RGB our RGB gbg RGB B so now I'm gonna and then the vectors with that label there we go so this is just a little bit of data cleanup to a format that I want to have it I don't know if it really matters so much but I think this is gonna help I create an empty object they look at all the stuff the data the weights in the JSON file and then one at a time I make a p5 vector out of the RGB values and then I should I'm gonna say a return vectors and I suppose that it would be nice to like pass in this argument and I could say let vectors and then I'm going to say vectors equals and maybe I'll call this like color vectors ok that did not work can't read property lengths of undefined sketch such as line 13 let's console.log data it must have been confused oh boy I'm doing this in the wrong place ha the whole point of preload is that it's a function that you call to make sure that data is ready before you get to set up because it's loading data loading our text file loading of media files asynchronous in JavaScript and I'm trying to simplify that this needs to be in set up and now I should go to say this here as well okay here we go there we go now oh yeah okay hold on weird what's going on oh oh there's a set up down here too many setups motes are too many setups okay here we go this is gonna be right eventually there we go now I have basically a dictionary where every single one of these colors is paired with a p5 vector with these XY and Z values no that's not right that is not right at all a lot of zeros in there let's see so there is no dot RG or dot B property of a p5 color I made that up completely red it can call the red function and pass in the color green blue this should work now just make it up stuff that doesn't work okay r is not defined this is RGB there we go and there we go now this is looking right right and algae is lives in the vector space 84 comma 172 time a 104 all right everybody I could just like have this view of the comments right here where everybody is saying all right all right okay okay thinking about this oh don't go away computer screen come back how am i doing timewise I've got about an hour left out of hydration that's bad all right where's my eraser now that I have this data set we can begin to imagine a physical space a threedimensional space where all of these colors live all right so there's an xaxis yaxis an x axis and z axis which is actually coming out from the wall here and one color might be over here and another color might be here one might be off in the distance one might be very close up right so you could imagine this I'm trying to draw this 3dimensional space on a twodimensional surface but you could imagine now that I could do certain things by what if I just did a random walk what if I did a random walk throughout this space what colors would I find let's actually try let's try that oh why not excellent starting point okay so let's say where I'm going to start is I am going to have a position and in setup I'm gonna say position equals create vector random 255 random 255 random 255 now what I want to do basically is what if I pick a random random space in that random vector in that three dimensional space let me find the word the color that is closest to that so I'm gonna write a new function which was I'm going to say call a find nearest and this function is going to take in a vector will call it V and what it's going to do is it is going to I'm gonna I probably need to do this I'm gonna just get all of the keys out of this array right this is a way in JavaScript I think I could do a for of loop let's try that right or for in loop I think I can do a for I think with an op write this the reason I'm stumbling here is this is this looks like an array because it's a whole list of all the colors but it's not an array it's an object where each each color name is the key and the value is the vector so I need to iterate through all that stuff I can't just use a regular loop but I think in JavaScript I can say for let keyin vectors and then I can say let and let's I guess I'm gonna con I can't think of another name for let Veck equals vectors ki then let's find the distance between oh you know what though guess what what I want to do is actually it would be kind of useful to what I want to do is I want to create a list of all the distances and then sort it that's gonna be that's gonna be nice to do so actually let me get this let me get this list of keys key of keys and sorry there's like a someone talking for a second it's for of no for of is for an array hey there's a new video from stand up mass which is called vector my why am i looking at my notifications right now just see something here all right I have a better way of doing this yeah sorry I just looked up my code for each room so me to use look at my code let me actually go back Matt yeah I don't think that's suit to interesting me like going back and forth with all the different ways of the four of loop because let me just go back alright so the first thing that I want to do is I want to get a list of all of those colors into an array so it's important to note that it looks like I have an array of all these things but this is actually an object where the key every all the keys of the object are the names of the colors paired with the value which is the vector but what if I could sort this list by proximity to that other vector well I needed an array to be able to do that and so oh quick way I can get an array is I can say keys equals object keys from vectors this gives me if I just console.log this and I say find nearest you can see now I just have an array of all the keys but I can sort this I can say Keys dot sort and now guess what if I call a sort function I can always sort by an array by my own arbitrary comparison of the two elements so I'm going to use the arrow syntax here and I'm going to write a function that compares two arbitrary elements a and B if you're not familiar with this arrow notation it's like declaring if it's a new way to declare a function in es6 not so new and I'll refer you to my video about the arrow function but what I'm going to do now is I want to say the distance one distance one is the distance between the distance between I'm going to pretend I have a distance function for a second vectors key a and vectors key be oh no no no I'm sorry the distance between V and vectors oh my goodness yeah yeah between hey yeah sorry I got confused for a second remember I'm trying to tell the array which one is closer to V so I somehow need to compute the distance between that and my random Walker right V and either A or B which one is closer and then I can return D 1 minus D 2 because what sorting will do is sorting will take the closest one up sorry what's what sorting will do sorting when you have two elements if you return a negative number it puts a before be a positive number puts be before a let me the other way around but can't remember and if it returns zero then they're the same it doesn't need to swap them so you're just telling the sorting algorithm which one goes before the other one so I'm gonna get a negative number by comparing these two values now of course I need to have a distance function so I need to have a distance function that can take a vector and two vectors V 1 V 1 and V 2 and I could just say return p5 dot vector dot distance this is a little silly v1 v2 so I really just rat am wrapping there is a distance full function already function distance that will take to p5 vectors and I can get the distance between them with p5 Becker not dist but here but here I'm but I just want a and I'm doing that exactly here so I think let's look at this now I should be able to look here so let's look at this again and find nearest cannot read property dist of undefined all right so hold on a second let's make sure I have a vector here let me actually call find nearest from the code oh I have to call it with something okay no wonder was undefined you can't just call the whole point of you calling fine nearest with a particular vector who are you okay so this now does this look sorted to you let me actually unfold it there's a lot of things there's a lot of colors in here greenish blue teal ish greenish teal green blue aquamarine see right doesn't that I picked some arbitrary spot now what is that color actually so here's the thing did I sort it in the correct order that would be a question so let's console.log V and then console.log also vectors sorry vectors keys index zero this would be the first one so in theory these should be two very similar values let's see well I'm console logging V in too many places 64 78 to 52 53 69 84 so that makes sense it's pretty close you know 172 money right so this looks right if I sorted it the other way I just I could never remember which way the sorting works so I just try it both ways if I sort it the other way you'll see I'm getting the furthest thing the color that's the most different okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm gonna add a draw loop and now this function I want it to return keys index zero I just want to get the closest one and so what I'm going to do is I in draw I'm gonna say fine nearest and then I'm going to create a div with that color in it I'm gonna say call it color name so I don't want to override the color variable color name and then I'm going to say ha I'm gonna I'm gonna say let V rant R equal P 5 dot vector random it's a random 3d that gives me a random vector I think random 3d will give me a random vector and then I will say pause add R so this is random walk I'm just going to randomly change that vector and create a div for a new color name and let's change the frame rate to like five to like one so it does this once per second let's take a look so look at it this is my random walk you can see that it's not getting very far away it started with sepia so I should probably take a bigger step right the step is so small that it's mostly wandering around the same color there aren't that many colors so I'm gonna say r dot multiply by 10 so I'm gonna make that step much bigger boy let's try this one more time let's make it much bigger we can go a little faster there we go so we can see now I'm walking around there should be like each one of these steps is this fairly similar color to the previous one so this is the idea I am performing a mathematical operation in vector space walking around a 3d vector I'm finding the word that it's most closely associated with that one by Euclidean distance and then I am rendering that word on the screen so this is pretty good I think there are some more probably some more interesting things we could try to do let me take up a break for a second and let me try to do one more example with this data set just to show you a bit more about like analogies and vector math and then after that we'll move to the actual an actual word to Vectren model why should I use the absolute value okay so why should I use the absolute value oh you know what past zero zero zero for testing that's an interesting idea let's do that so let's start with I mean I do need to constrain it because I don't think there's there's no negative numbers in this data set whoops right so this was starting with zero zero zero all right um actually let me come back let me let me not finish that video over a second before I move on let's actually just test something like let's say for example I want to instead of because it's random just to make sure this is really doing what we think let me start with like blue so I am going to start with not color sorry create vector I'm going to start with blue and let's see what we get primary blue pure blue true blue pure blue blue primary blue now one thing one thing that's an issue is I shouldn't I really can't allow negative numbers because if I'm wandering off to negative land there's no negative numbers in my data set so probably to make this a bit more accurate in terms of this random walk where do I have that in draw it's right here I probably want to say paws dot X there's probably a more thoughtful way of doing this equals oh I could I see this I could equals I need to stay in sort of positive lands so constrain paws dot X between 0 and 255 or I could do like an absolute value or something of the vector that would be weird but let's just let's just do this as like a sort of a quick solution so this will keep me in that space and let's run this again all it'll keep me it'll keep me in that space and let's run this again and we can see now eventually after enough time we're gonna walk away from primary blue and end up sour and Barbie pink Barney neon pink strong pink and if you go back to Allison's tutorial which all this is based on let me see if I have that here oops you can see Alison has a wonderful example which does the following sorry that I don't have this sorry if you go back to Allison's example if you go back to Alison parish's tutorial she has an example which does something kind of like this which starts with a little poem roses are red and violets are blue and then randomly walks around and then you see it by the end we have roses are brown orange violets are peacock blue so you could imagine what is a creative project you could do that takes this idea and expands on it as an exercise you might even just try to take my code and make it do exactly what Allison's example does in the tutorial and so I feel like I want to do one more I'm not one more example with this data set I think before I go and look at the larger context of the word to vac machine learning system that will train a model Oh set the text of that color where can i okay I'm gonna go back and record all of this stuff right let me go back to where after that if I finish the constrain so even though I start with primary blue you can see I've started walking around and getting more I'm gonna I'm gonna end up somewhere else eventually but these colors are related as I'm going okay so this is working pretty well the way I imagined it and of course Steve and me I am to me both you chatter like Hello set the text of that color so let's do that just to just to say that I think will be more interesting so where I create the div where do I do that I create the div here and I'm gonna say let div equal creative and I'm just gonna use the p5 Dom library and say style background color Oh background color now too bad I didn't keep that hex code cuz I got the hex code I could put it right there let's keep the hex code so where I do that where I process the data let me add in vectors label oh it's not an object hmm it's fine I'll just use RGB I'm just gonna use I could just say I'm use a template literal RGB what is it the vector is that the vector is vectors color name because I just returned I just returned I just returned the key so I probably should I could have returned the whole vector so many ways you could do this and now RGB video VIX okay this is easy this is fine way to do it V dot this is like the CSS syntax V dot Y V Z alright let's try this and that should do the trick alright here we go oh I put the background color alright I meant to set the text color but how do I set the text color font no textcolor know CSS color she's probably just color there we go okay so now we can see really how it's all so we can see how this is a random walk through a color space and I would love to let this go for a little while and end up somewhere okay so Alison Parrish in her tutorial actually does something very similar to this and I might as an exercise suggest doing this she actually takes this poem this idea of a poem roses are red violets are blue and walks through the color space for each of these I've done just a little piece of that so what kind of creative idea can you do visualizing this threedimensional color space through words through color through a random walk I I think I should do one more I'm not sure yeah I think when I try to do one more demonstration with this data set and I'll do that in a separate video and then I will come back and actually finally go to the point where we look at what does it mean to take a pre train set of word embeddings that's actually used the word to vecna Xin learning model training process okay see you there background color is better real background color worked pretty well yeah all right there was a super chat I think with a question which I I think I should try to answer can we draw a circle of color variations with it yes so I could use a canvas you know there's lots of things I could do like for example if I write here if I said create canvas 100 comma 100 I could also do a fill feed well in the draw function separate from the divs I could say background you know zero fill why is it doing that fill and I need to do it with V V X V Y V dot Z and then draw an ellipse which is at 5050 you know 100 100 hundred so that if I go back to my sketch unexpected token there's an extra parenthesis there for no reason you can see I'm always now as this is going down the circle no so I probably could do something where I get a dot next to each one of these or something but you see the idea and I could also in this case maybe it would make sense do not create a new div but just like replace the previous div so for example I could do let div equal here and then I could say and set up a div equals creative with nothing in it and then I could say a div instead here like div dot HTML color name and there we go so this is kind of interesting where I could do it this way where I'm just walking through it and then drawing it okay let me go back to the bottom of the chat doesn't the word as a CSS style work oh that's interesting do it just yes some but do all of these these this isn't the list of all the CSS words that would be another data set that I could use I don't think macaroni and cheese is a CSS word okay all right now I'm Allison has another demonstration on this on her tutorial all right which you could do like the average color of a text I'm reading this synonyms I mean maybe this is really maybe that's enough I mean I shouldn't do another one maybe I'm kind of done with this actually let's try doing something I have the nature of code text so let's try it let me find one of these nature of code texts so there's this one from sponge man okay nature of code text raw download call this an NOC txt and desktop work Tyvek whoops you'll see txt how big a file is this it's only 550 this is the whole book yeah makes sense all right so what I want to do is let's test out this idea first for a sec um let's get rid of all this stuff and draw what I want to figure out is how many make a sonnet with color make it act visualize it in 3d all these are great suggestions what I want to do is let me do let NOC and I'm going to say and I'm gonna say NOC equals join lines join lines and then console dot log and OC dolly so I'm just testing just checking something here I want to see whoops not there because desktop this is supposed to be in there so there okay definitely got the whole text of the book what else on my console logging that I don't need so one thing I want to do is I just want to do something like let me find like so let me just see we're NRC dot split this could be better but split by all words oh but there could be some of the colors are two words but that's fine and then I want to say if well actually I could use a regular I'm trying to just trying to figure out if any of how many of the words in xkcd show up in so because I was say if vectors words index I console.log words index I so I'm basically going through I could user I maybe using a regular expression would make more sense but let's let me just do this for a sec so black/white grass gray constructor constructor is a color in the xkcd set that's weird that doesn't make any sense Oh constructor is a Oh the how they get you and what is it is own property I think I have to use his own property I'm sorry I'm just figuring this out myself right now I think there might be a better way to do this actually I should be looking at the chat is own property words index I let's see this has owned property has owned property yes so right okay great so these are all the words that I use in nature of code but this isn't great because I'm missing things that are two words so another way I could do this would be to another way that I could do this would be to all the and then create a regular expression out of that key and then let's try key match you know NOC console.log NOC match projects and how do I add the flag like this gee I think that's how I do it let's see what this does not so new reg XP that's right why did that give me that error 21 Oh reg that's Ajit that's supposed to be G okay sorry about that right okay so red match to Brazilian times gray so this works rose rust cream t.t i say t o because no no it's got to match it with a word boundary right t is probably in a lot of words but not as its own word so how would I do that equals with a word boundary like this so let me just see let me do this matches if matches console.log matches I don't want to print out all the null it's got to match something this must not be right string includes would be better index of yeah index uh but uh I don't know what I'm doing here I this is sort of pointless I think what I just want to do is get a small section of the book so and I'm not gonna like let me just get a paragraph like uh uh here I'm gonna do something different this will be good rainbow Wikipedia okay let's rename this to a rainbow so this definitely has the cut the word red in it and let's let's actually I'm just curious see what this gives me oh yeah definitely where's red didn't match red why not oh I know why I probably need to do this right yeah there we go that's what I needed to do so this is an annoying thing if you back slash it's an escape character but I actually want the back slash I need to like escape the escape character thank you very much okay so sky sky violet violet okay so what I'm gonna do this is fine okay I have an idea now have an idea I'm not gonna use regular expressions anyway but I have an idea okay okay okay I have an idea this is great I'm gonna okay okay coating challenge now just is the tutorial it's fine all right so let me it's fine okay I'm sorry what time is it oh I can do this all right okay okay the word defect video number three now I'm still not into the actual word to Veck model itself yet I'm still just playing around with this idea of words being associated with numbers and the example scenario that I'm using is a color red blue steel which is a word associated with numbers like it's red value it's green value it's blue value in RGB space okay so and all this is based off of Allison parish's tutorial understanding word vectors which is here under the creative comments 4x4 BY 4.0 license please make sure your if you're using this stuff also you attribute it this that I have a breaking news track alright hello and welcome to word to vector tutorial number three I am not yet actually to the part where I'm going to use the word to Veck algorithm model itself I'm still just in a place where I'm looking at okay well I have words and I have numbers what does that mean what kind of things can I do with that and the scenario that I'm using which is from Allison parish's excellent understanding word vectors tutorial available under the Creative Commons 4.0 license please if you're basing stuff off of what I'm doing also attribute this in the scenario that we're looking at is colors colors so and you can find you could find that down here so what I have is I have a p5 sketch which is loading this color database of the 904 most common RGB monitor colors from an xkcd survey and I have did a previous tutorial so here here's my idea this is what I would do in this video I am going to take some text from the rainbow Wikipedia page and I'm gonna say let's sprinkle some red on it or sprinkle some blue or sprinkle some of this color what does it mean to add some color to it and how Tech's change so I our everything the tiny bit of code here basically nothing I introduced from the previous video I introduced a variable called lines I'm loading this text file where I just copypaste the Wikipedia content into you can think of a different way of doing this and then now what I'm gonna do in setup is I have a global variable called rainbow I'm gonna say rainbow equals join when you load a text file in p5 with load strings it gives you an array where every line is on a different is in a different element of the array so I'm going to say join lines and I'm gonna give it a delimiter like the BR tag and then I'm just gonna in I'm gonna now add said I'm going to say create pr8 books create PE rainbow so right now we should have if I go here is we should see and I'm gonna say no canvas although I might wanna actually use the canvas a little later we can see here I have all that text now what I want to do actually is I want to highlight and color anything in the text that appears in the X in the data in the color database so I think actually what I want to do is first split this up into words so I'm gonna use rainbow dot split and you could check out my tutorials about regular expressions and word weird counting and all that stuff where I do this a lot I could definitely come up with a better regular expression but I'm just gonna split by anything that's not a character that's a through Z or 1 through 0 through 9 so I'm gonna do this then I'm going to say I equals 0 I is less than words dot length I plus plus and I'm gonna say create span words index I this is gonna the BR stuff is going to mess up I'm gonna say this or the BR pull this work oh boy didn't like that did it I'm not gonna worry about that though the BR stuff is gonna mess that up so I'm just gonna make that a space instead and now if i refresh this page there we can see all the words whoops all the words are together in one line need to put spaces between them this is kind of a terrible idea but I'll just do this and now okay so here's the thing so now here's the text what if that word what if one of those words appears in the color database so let's look I'm gonna say let me just say and actually another way that I could do this I can use a for of loop let word of words and then it's just a little bit nicer to do it this way if vectors word if it exists then what do I want to do I want to make I want to get the color is I want to say let color equals that vectors word and then I want to say I'm going to say let span equals create span and I'm gonna say span dot background style and I'm using once again the p5 Dom library background color I wish I'd save my code from the previous video to write exactly the same thing RGB and then I'm going to take sorry uh CX CY and C Z Z dot y and C dot Z so let's see if now we can see some of those highlighted there great so anything that was in that database I am now highlighting sky sky red violet Rina now the other thing I might as well do is I might as well store those things so let me keep track of color spans as an array and I'm gonna add span into this array and now I can start doing stuff so what might I want to do first of all one thing I could do which is kind of interesting is let me just get the average color of all those things so what if I say my calluses say let keys equal keys I'm also gonna save all of those sorry time out for a second there's a really loud noise I don't think you guys can hear this where my 415 oh I had to escape the slash right keys I'm gonna say Keys dot push the word so let's just take a look I'm just curious here console.log keys so we can see these are these are the only things in this text that matched and again I should have checked for two or two pairs of words and things I'm missing a lot of steps here but you can improve my code that would be wonderful make your own version of this but let's at least get the average color here so let's see what the average color is so now I can say average equals create vector zero zero zero so any math that you can do with numbers you can now do with those words because now I can say let key of keys and I can say Vee is vectors that's associated with that key average dot add and then at the end I can say average dot divide the length of all those keys then all I need to do is get nearest find nearest that particular vector and then console.log nearest purplish so the average color of this text and this is directly again from Allison's tutorial she has something very similar in it is purplish and if I wanted to now I could create a canvas you know very small 150 comma 50 and then I could say background average X average Y average dot Z and we would see there it is so that's the average color and its label is purplish now what if what I wanted to do was actually add add some color or subtract some color and change the text so let's let's try to do this dynamically this will be this is gonna be hard but this will be extra fun so I'm going to create three sliders our equals our slider our slider gee slider B slider and I'm gonna hope that one of you watches this video and gets inspired to make a really interesting wonderful interface I'm gonna completely ignore anything about interface design here and just kind of do this raw our slider equals create slider between 0 and 255 and starting with zero and I'm gonna do the same thing and I'm again these are p5 functions too and I could obviously just write write these down relevance into the HTML directly but now I have three sliders and what I want to do is anytime I change any of these sliders so I'm gonna say our slider input slider changed I'm going to call this same function if any of the sliders are changed so I'm going to assign this slider changed event to all of these and then I'm going to write this function slider changed and now I need to get the values R equals our slider value G equals G slider value and B equals B slider value now let me just make sure this is working console.log RGB okay so let me run this and now as I move these sliders you can see anytime I move the slider any of these sliders I'm getting this color value now I'm gonna take that color value and add it to these colors and then have the words change with the new color matting I probably should be listed I should make it so I could subtract color too so let's actually make it let's just make it make it so I can add or subtract some amount between negative 100 and 100 negative 100 and 100 an egg ative 100 and 100 okay so now in this slider change what I'm going to do is I'm going to go through all of the spans and keys I guess III need to I could probably more thoughtful Laurie factor this later but men make these global variables and I'm going to go through all of the spans let's pan of color spans and I'm going to get the key the the word is the HTML of that span actually don't have to look it up otherwise then the vector is the vector associated with that word then I'm going to say vector add RGB I think this will work right this up this takes that vector and adds these amounts to it then I need to say nearest equals find nearest oh I need to make a copy of it so I don't actually want to change that vector I need to make a copy of it so I'm gonna say copy because I'm pulling just a reference to the vector that's in that object and you don't want to adjust it that's the actual vectors associate of the word I want a copy of it that I'm gonna mess with and then I want to find nearest to that and then I'm gonna say span HTML that word so look at this these are let's take a look at this these are all the color words let me add some more red to them this doesn't seem to be working oh I'm so excited to see this work what did I do wrong fine V span each Jim Oh nearest nearest nearest right word is the original word nearest is the new one after I added that color I think this is gonna work this is very exciting so I need more space ready here we go uh add a lot of red and I got bright red and bright magenta let's add a lot of green I got white already and a lot of offwhite white right if I add I take away what subtract color I subtract color now I've got black everything is black so look at this you could take you could take a whole text any novel you like and you could say let's just rewrite it with a little bit more red and find any instance of any time of color as reference and guess what when we do this with a more generalized word to vex system we could actually add start to add this idea of a dread to words that aren't actually colors we might have a corpus that includes way more than just these you know 496 whatever that number is color values so hopefully you're starting to see the idea here is that with the idea of word embeddings with words associated with vectors with text associated with numbers that if I could do math to the numbers I can go translate back into words I can always translate those words as the numbers to more math and translate back and do all sorts of strange transformations like this so make a better version of this think about what texture using fix that problem for me where I look also for like pairs of words that match make a nice interface I don't know think about the way you design this there's so many possibilities I look forward to seeing what you make with this and see you in the next video where I actually now go to look at the ml 5 library which has a builtin class a builtin basically feature that allows you to work with word Tyvek without having to write all the math yourself which is what I'm mostly doing in this particular video ok good bye Oh change the background as well wait stop hold the presses ah I totally forgot data I must also change change this as well V V X V dot Y V dot Z okay here comes now as I'm adding the colors it's also changing it's also changing what's actually the background color as well so we can see we can see that that's actually changing it alone which is a nicer way of looking at it okay now I'm really going goodbye Wow all right ray Jackson at Daniel sponsors can't as well I'm not sure what that is referencing a Wikipedia link to repo Oh can't post links yeah I guess you have to be a moderator Oh is there a Lippo project that's like this does Allison reference that and I'm just completely forgotten it whoops blue Lippo colors oh I don't know interesting alright everyone so this is it for today basically I have a tiny bit more time I don't want to launch into the next piece of this I'm going to continue the word to vex stuff next week but what could I do in 30 minutes I can do this probably like 15 minutes right no problem definitely want to do this well I don't know what these are I don't know what generator sorry you gotta learn that that's pretty oh no this hurts my brain come back down I like this one though octahedron you know we should do all right we're gonna do something I really liked this video that Tom Scott put out not this one not this one not this one not this one not this one yes this one no it's just you I think it's just you alright so how this has got to be easy right okay all right co2 challenge Oh some thank you Kraken you so you could use something like this to make a matching algorithm based off of user inputs interesting interesting sierpinski triangle that's a good one haven't I done that already though YouTube chat bot no no alright do this what kind of shape is at seven segments one two three four five six seven eight why is it why is it encoded I thought there was something about there being eight possibilities like a zero you could have a zero or one you have seven bits for seven segments why is there eight is anybody watch this video I don't feel like watching it right now it's too long I won't have time to do the challenge i watch the whole video I guess I could watch it on a double speed Oh decimal point that's why it's eight okay coding challenge I watched this video from Tom Scott the other day which was something about seven seconds displays and what's the longest word you can write with seven segment displays and there's actually some code for how to do this at the end and I thought yeah let's make this in the P 5 web editor boy I'm not ready for this login its coding train so the first thing that I need to do I think is I need to actually make a 7 segment display this is gonna be super awkward because I'm gonna do this in a terrible way but it's the only way that I could think of to do it right now and I've only got 30 minutes before I have to go but now if you look at the how long this video is even though I don't know how long it's gonna be I expected me at least 471 commits because this is gonna run into a lot of problems but let's write a function let's call it 7 segments and let's call that function with like some sort of like XY offset and so I'm gonna say push I'm gonna say pop and now I'm going to draw like so what's one of those one of those segments is one of those segments looks I guess each segment looks kind of like this right it's like sort of like a rectangle with two triangles on the end and then there's like another one here here here here here here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and then there's 1/8 there's a decimal point option so I'm just gonna I'm gonna be lazy and just make these rectangles right now and then we would get if I have time I'll make it nicer you'll make a much nicer version of it so let's make let's make these rectangles so let's add a so first let me say translate to that x + y and then I'm going to say let's draw it from mooners let's draw it from the top down it's a little bit weird below just consider the top center I'm just a wreck mode Center I'm going to say rekt pecs why and 100 comma 10 let's do this and I'm gonna say fill zero oh let's not put the background here let's okay let's put this I forgot what I was doing in here oh no we're gonna go 200 200 what's going on why is it down there can't miss is 400 you're there you should be here what's going on only rectangles so disappointed hold on can I start this challenge over wait what did I do here Oh cuz I put the X I'm the worst of the worst I'm hoarse I want to start this challenge over cuz now I know what I'm doing okay I got 30 minutes here we go I mean how hard could it be to make this nicerlooking this thing would have a good idea for me okay wait hold on I'm gonna I'm gonna cycle the camera let's let me give give me one mulligan on this because I preferred this not to have any edits and where's my eraser and there's gonna be fun this is so totally random I'm gonna do it anyway hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna attempt to make a seven segment display and then I'm going to write the longest word you can write with a seven segment display now this is clearly based off of this Tom Scott video I watched the other day that's kind of interesting take a little bit of code in it it talks about the history of 7segment displays and what they can and cannot display watch that video if you like I'm gonna attempt to remake it in the P 5 editor within about 30 minutes cuz I got somewhere to be and let's see how this goes I'm sure if you go and actually look how long this video is it's longer than 30 minutes I'm sure I'm gonna run into a lot of problems but here's a p5 sketch if you've never seen p5 before it's a JavaScript library you can create JavaScript animations and drawings and things right there and the browser also by using the p5 editor lots of more stuff about that and other places on my channel I'm sure okay so first I want to write a function called like seven segments and let's think about this so a 7 segment display has seven segments and each one is kind of like I'll shape like this you know a little rectangle with two triangles I might just do this as a rectangle to start so there's one two three four five six seven and then an eighth option which is a dot so I need to brought write a function that can basically render all of these and either fill them in or not and fill the dot in or not so it was really ridiculous to kind of do this in JavaScript the canvas but why not it'll be fun I mean I'm having fun are you having fun so let's start by saying let me use translate so I'm going to add a push and pop so that everything that happens in this function is kind of selfcontained I'm going to allow give it an x and y and so the first thing I'm going to do is translate to this x and y and then hmm what if we have so many different ways to do this I don't know let's say rectangle 0 0 100 comma 10 fill 0 and then I'm going to call 7segment and let's just put this at like 100 comma 100 so there we go it's here's my 7 scalars one segment of my seven second segment display over there no it's probably should be like a little thicker than that and obviously I'd want to use variables for all these things but now if I add a second one I can say where would this go negative 50 comma 0 20 100 oh that's not the right place at all 20 okay let's move it over 25 yeah there it goes oh because I didn't use rec mode Center interesting yeah that's fine let's not use rec mode Center and let's push it down a tiny bit there we go well this is doing a horrible job let's do this and do it at 190 oops I mean 90 there we go oh it's 20 80 80 mmhmm maybe this should be 10 a little little day little space there no no not that this should be this should be 20 no no no 30 there we go perfect oh that's exactly how I always dreamed it would be oh this is wasting a lot of time yeah this is like so so this is like very cringe coating okay 100 120 120 Oh beautiful 130 140 there we go perfect oh my goodness look at those segments this is beautiful then now we just need this again but we need to just go down quite a bit further so like 170 170 and 240 270 280 and now let's draw this at like 10 and 10 and so now in theory that's what I want to do is say no stroke no stroke oh no no I wants a stroke zero a no fill so why why oh because and the fill is there so let me put this in here and let's so there we go this is now my horribly designed sevensecond just like I can't wait for people to redo this and actually make it the proper 7segment display design but let's see here's the thing now what I want to do is give it a number like all I need to do is give it a value and so I couldn't give it an array maybe I should give it an array like zero with that has zeros and ones but technically speaking I just if I want this to be somewhat pure and related to the original 7segment display the idea is that I just give it a number an 8bit number separate out all the bits and then apply the fills according to what those bits are let's try it so let's say how do I do this bit stuff in JavaScript bit masking maybe bit shifting I could do bit shifting or masking bit masking JavaScript let me explain what I mean by this oh boy okay so what I mean by bit masking for example is let's say I have some binary number that's 8 bits 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 what if I just want to know is this number a 0 or a 1 well I could do some kind of like an operation like what if I did an and operation with all one's right if I did an and operation with all ones well no no no no sorry and and operation with zeros everywhere except for the one bit that I'm looking at then all of these will end up being zeros and this will either be a 0 or a 1 so I could kind of test the value that way I could also shift all the bits so that this one always just ends up over here and then I could do something and then I could basically do an and operation with just one something like that right I'm leaving left shift or an bitwise operators oh it's a nice way to do it sorry I'm looking at this tutorial here I can use or ampersand so let's try all right so let's assume we get this value and I'm gonna I'm gonna say no loop here and what I want to do is let's say say I'm gonna say console actually let's just look in let's play around in the console for a second this is a nice way to figure out JavaScript code like if I say let's say I say the number 100 people are producing all sorts of stuff with the chat for me and I say shift by 1 does that make sense I get 50 it's like divided by 2 think about that that's crazy 100 in binary is there a nice look at this this is 100 in binary if I shift this over by 2 I have 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 what if I say 50 in binary look get that right yes yes but that's the same exact number but shifted over fascinating amazing so what I want to do is let's go back to here and I used to do this stuff all the time and no one ever has to do it anymore so it's hard to like figure out on the fly it really should plan this out in advance ok so let's say first shift first I don't want to shift at all so I just want to know what is the value of that last bit so if I do this I get a I get a 0 if I do this I get a 1 right so and and with a 1 will always give me the last value of the bit so I should be able to do this might be a I'm in some other code this code is irrelevant from a different tutorial what I can do is I can basically say Val so I want to say what is I'm gonna say let result basically I want to say let's do color mode color mode RGB one so I just want to get a 0 or a 1 so I am going to say fill the value shift no shift ampersand 1 so that's filling it it's a 0 so if I pass in one it's filling it a pass in a 2 its 0 3 a 4 so I shifted everything over 1 and then masked it now I could say for this one and I'm sure there's a nice way to do this in a loop shift that over then I could just do it by 2 by 3 by 4 and I probably don't have the order right so by 1 by 2 by 3 whoops by 3 by 4 by 5 by 6 there we go so now if I say pass it in 100 I get this 200 I get this so whatever that theoretically that value all I need to know is what number corresponds to which letter okay so this is good now we need some kind of dictionary to show me all the letters and how their what their corresponding number is or a big array boy how am I gonna do that does that even exist I don't have to Google this for a little bit and come back 7segment display dictionary or how about like specs specification No oh here we go 128 states I'm not using the convention but could I adjust mind to the convention easily right 0 1 2 you need to label your segments correctly but yes you should be able to get them I wasn't kidding when I started to go at 5 oh I forgot out the dot but the dots the easy part I'm just like staring at this as if that's gonna help oh I could have done it like this ah here we go alright I found what I was looking for you can just change the order easily yep alright ABCDEF alright I'm back I found exactly what I'm looking for which is the hexadecimal encoding for the displaying of the digits 0 through F this will help me right because there's 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 so on on on on on on is the number 0 which should be this this in hexadecimal could you just give me the non accessible version of this but I think I could probably just do this so if I go back to my code right and I'm gonna pass this in okay that clearly didn't work but you can see that this gates gives me 1 2 3 everything on but this one so I think the order is different so I'm my order is oh yeah my order is like so ridiculous it's top left right middle the bottom left bottom left bottom right box so I should really change the order of mine really cockamamie way of doing this so the next segment is the one that's on the right so let me write some comments here top top left top no that's not right yeah top right middle bottom left I think this is right I don't know if this is right bottom right whoops bottom right and then this one should be hopefully the bottom and now let's just make sure I'm right top oops yep left yep right yep middle no oops uhoh this goes here middle and bottom left okay I'm pretty confident the rest is right okay so the first one is the top so I think it's backwards actually hold on okay so all right so with zero if I go back to Wikipedia zero is on and on and on and on off so the middle is the last one okay you go back here so the middle should be the last one where is that one middle that should be the last bit and then middle is here oh no no no the middle is the first one because it's the only one that's different middle okay and then what is this I don't know what's next let's move them all down this is a boy I really messed this one up okay all right so that's a zero and by the way I should really design this but all right so let's see so let's see that right trial and error is your friend a 1 a 1 interesting oh yeah oh these are the two that these are the only two a one is just these two so this one's right this needs to switch a map of the letters to the segments look up the Wikipedia are they hold on we got to do this more methodically all right what I want what I want is not this right I want to know which one of these write clearly G this last one is the middle which for me is the first one and then like if I look at this the the middle is the last one then the second two are the the last see ah this is driving this is gonna drive me totally crazy I don't want the hexadecimal it's further up the page further yeah further up the page you don't see it though this oh this this is showing me all the bits this image look up the top of the wiki this is the order abcdefg oh but they were numbered how am I supposed to do that hey you know I'm back you didn't have to watch that the chat is full of rage apparently because right in front of my face abcdefg okay I just didn't recognize that because they're letters and I'm thinking about them as numbers okay so this the top it goes and actually this is similar to how I thought of it so if I go back to my code here it should be but I think I'm doing it backwards so I think the top rectangle is the last one well let's let's try it let's try it this way top so it should be oh yeah so it should be top is the first one is the top one which is this one then to the right is still is a is a tall one this is to the left oh I screwed this up let me go back to let me go back to like the actual so this is now I think I so hold on Matt's here I'm gonna we're gonna go back and edit again yeah all the comments are out of step that's why I'm going back top top left right it all bottomleft okay I think this is right now oh thank you nobody in the slack chat now chat cuz I can look at that thank you for posting that for me okay label them ABCD and not top bottom left ya think okay okay the chat is full of rage they're all telling me it's there it's there on the page it's there on the page I am blind and so focused on the numeric indices that I didn't realize that this is it right here ABCD efg it's that order and then of course there's also this last one here so I should go back to my comments my lovely comments and I should say a and then top left is F and top right is B the middle is G and the bottom left is e C and then what's letter do I have left D and now I can just put them in order ABCD efg hijk LMNOP qrs yes you're watching a person singing the alphabet song while coding it's very soothing okay so this is good now I just need to fix this vowel shift one shift to shift three shift four shift five shift six and then this should be good let's try putting in some things that we should get let's go back down to here and let's see what we get here oh if I I might have done it in Reverse which is fine I could just use this number if I did reverse let's find out okay so now let's put in here there we go No ah that didn't work it didn't work it's five o'clock I have to go comments on the lines themselves would be metre yeah let's hold on yeah oh yeah I'm missing the bit for the decimal point so let's add that this doesn't look right but let's at least add the bit for the decimal point decimal point and then shift seven and then I think this it's all going to become clear we draw an ellipse at like a hundred four hundred ten ten where's that ellipse four hundred two hundred trial and error is my friend there we go a little smaller beautiful a little bit up okay so now let's say shift from seven to one so I think actually this should be the first one is shift by seven well this actually work do I have to put these shift by seven six five four three two one and then this no shift hmm all right what did I do wrong oh so close so close the decimal is the first bit right so that should be right why is this yeah the middle maybe this must not be the order right this must not actually be the order I think this is telling me the order middle this is actually the order zero one two three four five six seven eight yeah this is the order to be honest it is the order is actually the middle thing is first or last in my case so that mess this misled me the ABCB the actual thing that's first is the is the is is G it goes G f GF a B well it's so confusing g g fa b f whoops whoops come back no come back cut paste and now shift by seven shift by six shift by five shift by four now shift by is this right three two one and then the and then zero okay so let's see here this is right the question is is this it keep going a be no then it is this one this one this one this one this one that's so then the order is a EDC decimal point I think EDC decimal point maybe as an EDC or CDE let's try II D okay so zero is right now let's try some other ones oh go tom I hope you've never watched this video let's try one so let's try one gfa be EDC decimal point the hora yeah no kidding of horizontal segments are too wide those pins on the led it isn't the order no f GF a B EDC DP but it wasn't the other order either it certainly was the first one was this one alright hold on I'm gonna trust the chat I should do this again GF a be EDC DP I remember G hold on let's do something fun let's do one for each segment let's do function no a a seven as is a I should really do this I should really do this in a loop and these should be objects and I could order them in any way that I want it was the other order the table is seven bit hex it may be one bit out the abcdefg you had before is perfect alright let's go back to it abcdefg so what so this is right why is it not showing me a zero what's wrong and now gfa be EDC is that correct G F a b e e d c decimal place and we've got half an hour past and now we've got whoops and now we've got 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 and decimal place ok that's a zero now let's try a 1 all right that's what I had before that was wrong oh that's just the link to what I'm doing you weren't actually giving me a correct answer okay hold on Matt's here we're gonna make a crate we're gonna go we're gonna go way back and edit people watching the version of this the final version of this will never know the horror when they will know the horror oops no no no all right and back to this so what you're telling me okay me I am semion yours you're shifting the for the for the dot also seven which you want to do zero I would think right dinga dinga ding but how would i I see so why is that wrong well so if I do eight in the middle I lost the YouTube chat you should honestly redo this later and use a loop or something no kidding the DP is seven started six so is this also correct like this the decimal place is really first or last right this is correct yes is this correct I kind of want just over from scratch yeah I think this is right I think I got it right not technically why not I have to go I'm gonna come back and do this again in like an hour I'm gonna start over well let's try one except I really should do it the other way around like yeah close enough that the issue you're telling me is that it's not right because the where is the decimal place like which bit is the decimal place okay the question is how can I make this into something that Mattia can follow so I'm gonna go back to I'm just gonna start over I just this I should just do this again right I don't know what to do I'm lost it's a matter if you put the decimal place bit on the left or right of the other bits I don't know that there's a standard for that right right I'm not gonna worry about the decimal place right now and it make people want to make it read all right I have the question is now I think I've gone too crazy that I'm just gonna do this again I had some practice I mean I might as well just start over right okay all right let's do it again I have to go but I'm not going to okay alright consider Opie all right here we go whoops No all right everybody here we go we're gonna make this happen oh right hello welcome to a coding challenge I'm very excited about this one and this is a second try by the way the first try it's been about got really like things went haywire they will go a wire again but I'm going to give myself about 30 minutes here late for have to be to try to create a seven segment display now I got this idea for watching this Tom Scott video about seven segment displays and Tom Scott talks a little bit about how they work and looks at like what kind of letters and numbers they can display and uses a regular expression to try to find the longest word you can write with seven segments displays so I mean this video I just want to make I just want to make a visualization of a seven segment display which is in javascript in the browser in canvas which is admittedly kind of a ridiculous thing to do but I feel like if I can make one then you the viewer can take what I've done and make a bigger display then you can display different words you could implement Tom Scott's code with the data files and actually visualize that there's so many possibilities all right so let's talk about the seven segments the seven segments of a seven segment display are like this one there's seven three four five six seven now of course there's they're like a nicer design but this sort of looks like this they're kind of tilted so I'm gonna make a very crude version of it probably just with rectangles and I'm not even gonna use an array you could do this in an objectoriented way to keep track of each one of these as an individual object then you get an array of object at each one these things there's a lot I'm gonna just do it in the crudest way possible so first let me try to draw this pattern and one thing that's gonna be important is I do this it's a good thing I'm on the second try cuz I really botched this the first time is if I go down here this order is super important ABCDE gee and decimal place and okay so I want to draw them in this order so let me go back to my code let me write a function called 7 7 segment and then I'm going to say at the beginning I'm gonna use push and pop to kind of convey the ideas this function I could make an object I kind of would like to make an object yeah whatever this function is going to draw all of the segments relative to some point so I could probably might make sense to draw it relative to here it might make sense of drought relative let's try drawing it relative to here right now so the first rectangle will be and I'm gonna this is very gonna be very hard coded I admittedly let's say it's going to be a rectangle and it's going to be let's let's go 10 pixels in 10 pixels down 100 pixels wide 10 pixels high and let's say fill 0 quick messaging me whoops fill 0 I know the chat is gonna be full of rage again it's just bound to happen oh I got to call the function I've really lost my sense of how to code call the function there it is let's make it a little fatter and let's put it 20 pixels in in 20 pixels down and let's actually put it 40 pixels in because the next one I want to do B I'm going to put at it should start at like a hundred and forty pixels 40 pixels down then it should be a 20 pixels wide 100 and I could have rotated it but basically I want to do that then I'm going to do the one on the left no no what's next then further down again so everything's the same each length is 100 plus there's a buffer of like 20 so I need to make this one 60 I think there we go and then what's next D and I should put some comments here right this is a this is B this is seen of course I could create an algorithm write a loop I'm gonna use translate rotate so many possibilities I'm not doing it that way there's seven I could do well seven adi is at the bottom d is actually really a but just a lot further down like 220 it's just guess there we go 260 up whoops no no no that's right now what's after D a b c d e yes he is actually like see he is very similar to C but with the X values of a right which is 40 and the Y value that's why is it huh what did I do here oh maybe this one is real hold on hold on everybody yeah that's right this one this one is a little bit off it's got to go oh it's gonna be oh ah actually if these have to be a little bit smaller I forgot about the Buffalo buffer so this is actually a little bit shorter like this there we go that's kind of right and then the first one also should be that most fun I've had coding it looked nice just like hard code rec it's like it's like that first it's like the first week of learning to program in p5 it's just like hard coding shapes I love it F which one's F F is up higher it's like B but over so let's start with B yeah start with B but move it to here there we go and then this is f then G is the middle whoo this is exciting G is most is like a it's like a but it's halfway down so like 140 yeah look at that my seven segment display part one of this now I'm just keep going okay so here we go good excellent okay now what I want to do is I'm gonna say stroke zero and I'm gonna say no fill okay whew I don't like how that looks a little more can I get a like a what if I just do like all of these like a little bit less like 78 18 whoo I'm starting to like this 18 oh come on just bear with me you don't mind me doing this just go make yourself a cup of tea I'll be done in a second there's sometimes just like hard coding stuff it's just like the loveliest nicest thing to do I don't keep the chat is full of rage the chat needs to relax take a deep breath fine this is soothing okay okay oh I like it it's weird but I like it okay so this is like nonsense what I've done you are gonna make your own be much nicer version of this with little triangles and all sorts of stuff like that I really botched it here but what I'm gonna do now is I need to figure out a way to turn each one of these on or off I don't know where this pink marker come came from but I love you pink marker so how am I going to do that so the idea of a 7segment display is that each one of these is a scientist by the way a decimal point here which is why they're eight is assigned a bit in an 8bit number so you could think of an array of zeros and ones that has eight in it 0 0 2 3 4 5 so that's 9 right where I would go 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 and then the decimal place I think sometimes the decimal places may be the first or the last bit I'm not entirely sure trying to look up the documentation for this so something that I could do those instead of having an array what if I had any generic number 256 so I can use something called bit shifting or bit masking so I can do a bitwise operation oh this is I'm so happy to do a bitwise operation you very rarely in programming anymore especially JavaScript actually shift the bits right that's usually you're doing in a matter of like glory level place so let's say I have this actually as a binary number and what I want to do is I want to figure out which one of the if this particular digit let's say is on or off well if I do it at what's called an and operation with one right answer but the wrong number of things here but you know whatever if I do an and operation with one all of these will always end up zero and then if a one is here if a one sorry if a one is here I will get a one if a zero is here 0 and a 1 is a zero so I can if I can shift the bits over and then and with one I just have to not shift to check this one shift by one shift by two shift by three shift by four shift by five supposed to throw etc so and in order to do this in JavaScript this is shift the bits to the right shift the bits to the left and then this is and I think also to an or if I wanted to do an or operation so in other words if I say for now here's the thing I've kind of gone I went around in circles so this one's trying this earlier I want I need to do something to test so in other words if I look down here this is you can see this is if the encoding is ABCD efg I don't know which one I'm doing G right then that's 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 then on on on on on on on off so to get a 0 presumably I pass this in and what I'm gonna do and thank you to be I am sue me for making this suggestion I'm gonna pass in a value and what I'm gonna do first is just shift it by 1 because I got to get rid of the thing for the decimal place so I'm actually just going to shift it by one before I come in here and I didn't actually do the decimal place I'll let you do the decimal place maybe your version so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say fill valve I 6 or 7 or 1 I don't know now I'm lost I need to shift these all I think I think the first I think if it's ABCD efg yep I want to shift by six yes and then ampersand it bitwise with one right this is what I'm talking about and then I also probably now this is no good I want to do color mode I also need to do color mode RGB one so in other words what I want is to get a zero a zero means black and a one means white so this now if I shift shift by five shift by four shift by three I totally did this wrong I've done it wrong again but let's just get this out of here shift by two shift by one and shift by zero oh so close that doesn't look right what did I do don't maybe I need to shift the other way here hold on let's do this there we go yeah I don't know why I got confused so this is actually right I don't know I was thinking I had to shift the bit out of the place but actually I just start with six here right if I shift the bit out of the place oh sorry out of the way then I need to start with seven here I think that didn't work anyway I had it right good enough okay that's a zero tip of the fact that I kind of want it up highlighted to be I kind of want it to be inverted so I actually should say let me write a function get color and the value and the amount of shift and what I'm going to do is return so I'm going to say oh the red value people I think warming in the chat they're saying I want me to make it red the red value is the value with the amount of shifting and ampersand one and let's forget about this color thing and let's actually say a Matt let's let's do this multiply this by 255 and say G be it actually this is silly these can just be zero I'm only doing the red value and then I'm gonna say fill get color get color and shift by six with that value a return color RGB and here we go alright this is very exciting I'm just gonna sit here and copypaste this calmly smoothly little by little four and by the way if you were wondering why I'm not using a loop here it's only because I want to drive you crazy and I've lost my semicolons a four three six five four three two one zero all right so what's going on 250 times as value shift oh boy this has to be in parentheses there we go oh but it's backwards so 255 minus R minus R no no no that was right actually it was right and then it shouldn't be zero it should be actually I should really let the alpha be this and then if the Alpha is zero here we go zero okay so now look at this let's say let no equal so now if I go here and I say this is zero zero oops no go away zero lots of copypasting you can speed this up somebody one two three four five five six yes you're watching a person copy paste these hexadecimal things one at a time six seven can we put some like music or some animation and postproduction here speed this up I don't know anything creative to make this look like a good watch seven eight I don't know ten nine I lost count nine okay now set numbs index index let index equals zero and then I'm gonna say frame rate one index plus plus zero one two three four five six and error okay so now we can say index plus plus index equals index plus one modulus nut noms length and I'm gonna make the frame rate five and I'm gonna zoom in on this and here we go oh that's way too fast for me I can't handle it let's put on some music and thank you very much there's your 7segment display counting through the hexadecimal values for 0th row so now here's the thing I've got an exercise for you could you make a clock out of this could you make a big make this objectoriented refine the code make the design actually look like a nice seven segment display being about colored make a rainbow seven segment display so many possibilities and also go back to this video and if I scan here towards the end this is the longest word apparently that you can display on a 7 segment display so follow Tom's code it's a node but there's no reason why instead of using like refile sync you can just use load strings in p5 get that same database and you can add this code in and do something fun with it share with me I mean share it with Tom Tom Scott this is not endorsed by just did this on my own but I think it could be some fun possibilities of things you can make during the p5 web editor share it on the coding train comm website seven segment displays somewhere share it with me on Twitter at Schiffman or all those kind of other places Mastodon whatever your true dot space and I'll see you in a future that was painful to white right watch what joke you should have x20 this is going far better than before all right everybody I hope you enjoyed that there I just made my guest video for Tom Scott's channel a Matt chick we edit this by October 15th and I'll just submit it I've got to go I am half an hour late for this meeting I was gonna go too but I stayed here because I love you the viewers of the coding train and I'm gonna save this now I'm so incidentally you can get going with the code right now someone could paste this into the YouTube chat and I will be back in a future coding challenge I'm gonna continue the word to vex stuff next Friday that's probably the plan so that's my tentative plan is continue word to Veck with and I'm gonna use ml 5 and use the Jensen Python package and do more stuff with that ok thanks for watching everybody today and add a round border to your rectangle that's what I should have done anyway I don't gonna change this stuff now you're all much better than me and I'll see you there ok Oh Nathan growl you're super chat come on unnoticed okay hold on no that's send a super time where do I find them it doesn't there's no way if it goes by without me seeing it oh wait wait a solar liner is that you Nathan growl who wouldn't have to you have the rainbows in it that's amazing thank you solar liner rainbow super chat made me so happy dark background oh yeah hold on or how about I think actually it looks best with this and then alright I'm gonna do the quick quick let me what are some other like small refinements and maybe I'll just do a quick intro the rounded rectangle ooh I like this there we go this looks better right okay okay I know I know I'm just trying to think of like what's 20 25 would be better what okay how interesting there that's even better okay well maybe Austin okay okay what you are about to watch is a coding challenge in a moment I'm going to say hello welcome to the coding challenge I apologize of the zapping twice but I just wanted to show you what it is at the at the beginning and because I also made some refinements thanks to things that people in the chat suggested after I finished the coding challenge so what I am tempted to make here is ace what's called a seven segment display this is based off a Tom Scott video that I'll reference in a second and you can see here here is the final result and the things that I've added after the coding challenge finish we're a little bit of nicer colors and rounded rectangles so it's a little bit nicer so I hope you make something fun with this and enjoy this coding challenge where I do this in kind of a way that's gonna make you want to complain about my coding abilities but that's fine complain away I'm here for it in the comments at me all that stuff enjoy and then one other option might be alright I know that coding I know that coding challenge seems like it just ended but I people in the chat had some additional suggestions that I was tinkering so I want to just show you these quick suggestions which are for example I added rounded rectangles which you could see makes it look kind of nice and then also what I did is I said of a stroke I gave the off segments like a little bit of alpha so it's almost as if they're appearing it feels more like an actual lit seven segment display but I think you are gonna be even more creative in what you end up making with this so I just wanted to show you those little quick defense goodbye so I will I will let Mathieu figure out whether it makes sense to have an extra intro or an extra thing at the end or neither and then I have to do one III really is going to shut this off and record these but I think what I'm going to do is just do it with you guys watching so where's a good spot here but I'm gonna go ahead and get through trying to find a nice thumbnail or something II spot to pause no this is good I'm standing in front of Nabil this is actually it's weird that he's like frozen here alright never mind I'll just start with his outline this is better like it's there okay okay oh and I haven't been recording any of this to disk oh it's fine we can take it down from YouTube hello welcome to another okay hello welcome to a tutorial about long short term memory networks neural networks machine learning with a guest Nabil Husein so what you're about to watch is an edited version of a live stream that happened a couple weeks ago with Nabil Husein who is a brooklynbased artist and educator a little bit a lot more information about Nabil in this video's description that you can check out Nabil is going to show you how to train a neural network to learn about let me let me do this again I forgot what I was doing here and I have to mention spell dot run okay hello welcome to a video tutorial this video tutorial is part of the spell series so this is sponsored by spell thanks very much go to spell dot run slash coding trained to sign up for an account before you fall along with this tutorial if you want and ok so what are you about to watch this is an edited version of a live stream that happened a couple weeks ago with guest Nabil Husein Nabil has seen is a brooklynbased artist and educator he has lots of super wonderful interesting work and things that they've done that you can learn more about on his website which will be linked to in this video's description I'm just going to show you here is how to take a corpus of text and train a machine learning system this machine learning system will use something called an LS TM it's a neural network architecture that deals really well that's really good for sequences like sequences of words or characters or musical notes so he's going to train an LC I'm a model off off a corpus of text he's going to train that in the cloud using the spell platform in tensorflow then he's going to download the Train model and use it in javascript in the browser with ml5 to generate new text in the style of the original corpus on which it was trained so that's what you're gonna watch from end and beginning to end a full tutorial it's going to use you're gonna want to have a Python environment set up know a little bit about spell and Knoll and also have like a code editor so you can write some JavaScript and code with HTML so notifications go away notifications um so hope you enjoy this video maybe Matt you just do a little edit there since this is just be professional so before you begin you're gonna want to so before you begin if you've never watched any of my videos before you might want to take a look at the workflow videos because you're gonna need a code editor and a Python environment I have videos about how to set that stuff up as well as probably look at just my intro to spell video to understand how the cloud computing platform works button to be able to show you all that stuff stepbystep through this video as well so hope you enjoy it please if you make something if you make your own a train your own model make your own project with this share it with me at Schiffman on twitter share in the comments here I would love to hear about it ok enjoy it and thank you so much Nabil and thank you so much spelled out run alright that's done that's done what about an outro I don't think I need an outro maybe I need one just in case yeah let's see let's go to the end of this video alright is it alright thank you so much Nabil thank you to spell I hope you enjoyed this video and again if you make something if you if you train the model and make your own project please share it with me in the comments below I'd love to hear about it ok enjoy it I'll see you in a future coding train video ok so that's fine so I think that'll have to be good enough always good to do these things at the end and now I'm really gonna go save ok goodbye everybody see you next Friday I don't know the exact time yet but I will post it hopefully by Wednesday or Thursday subscribe quickly alarm bell you'll get a notification all that sort of stuff and I will see you more videos to come there's so many things in the backlog of being edited and uploaded so hopefully you'll catch those and leave a comment and all that sort of stuff thank you there were too many people talking in the background really look it was loud all right one more time just in case I'm basically just missing this meeting anyway at this point which is fine I'm not I'm not I'm not crucial to it I just wanted to go to it okay it was fine someone in that in the slack channel could you let me know if I really need to do that again of course they'll just take me two seconds you all right I could always redo it on Monday anyway I'm gonna just do it one more time just in case cuz it's literally gonna take me less than a minute and Matt's yeah and I'm also gonna record I didn't wasn't recording to disk so let me do that too it's fine sorry wait go do something else now I'm I'm streaming this bubsley is like a backup hello welcome to a video tutorial that's what happens on this channel I guess um so this is this is sponsored by spell thank you so much to spell for the sponsorship what you're about to watch is an edited version of a livestream that happened a couple weeks ago with a guest educator and artist fork Linnaeus educator artist Nabil Hussain I recommend that you check out his website linked in this video's description to learn more about his background and his current work and all sorts of wonderful stuff that he is up to so what you're gonna see from beginning to end in this video is the process for taking a corpus of text training a machine learning model this particular model is called LST and long shirt shortterm memory neural network maybe we'll explain that a bit more in the video and offer you some resources to learn about it train a model to learn about that text train it in the cloud on spell you can go to spell dot run slash coding train if you want to sign up for that service and follow along with the tutorial and then download the train model then bring that train model into the browser in the JavaScript generate new text in the style of the original text that the model is trained on so you're gonna see the full process for this tutorial probably if you've never watched any of my videos before you're new to coding you might want to watch some of my workflow videos that show you how to like set up your environment you're gonna need maybe a you're gonna need a Python environment you're going to need it a code editor and know how to run a web page in your browser that you're developing locally on your computer but I have videos that show all that stuff I also a video that introduces the spell platform and give you some background about how that works alright so I hope you enjoyed this video if you make something with this please share it with me I would love to see what kind of crazy and interesting and wacky and original and fun and playful projects you are inspired to make by learning how to do this thank you again to the Biel for being here to have to make this tutorial and for spell for the sponsorship okay byebye okay the only noises was off yeah it's ro who's on the outro well I made an extra one just in case alright thank you so much to be all for this wonderful tutorial again thank you to spell for the sponsorship if you make something with this please share it with me I would really love to know about it and I'll see you in a future tutorial many more machine learning ml five Python EE tensorflow EE things to come I hope goodbye alright alright so anyway alright now I am really really going thank you for being here today I don't know why vows having this like week of just feeling like oh what am i doing I don't know it I know my brain doesn't work anymore none of my tutorials makes sense anymore what am i doing I know effect just felt like that all week and I feel a little bit reenergized I like doing this on Friday too because I feel like work week is over I'm gonna go home good have a beer relax and spend time with family this weekend and catch up on a lot of work on Monday so I hope you also have a good weekend get to spend time with friends family whoever internet friends reallife friends all those types of things and I'm gonna go check out the end of this meeting send me your feedback makes a mastadon box take a break from code for a while and all that stuff okay here we go goodbye
