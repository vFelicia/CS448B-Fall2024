today I am going to tackle a p5js simulation of the artistic process known as paper marbling I'm going to consider my P5 JZ canvas as a tray of water then am going to drop a circular blob of ink into that water if I were to pour another drop of ink over here one will push the other one out of the way my challenge to you is how much you think about choosing a color palette for your drops of ink how might you place the drops of ink in a regular or geometric pattern as well as apply the Tim lines in a particular pattern you might even then move Beyond abstract geometry and apply this technique to photographic images or realtime video If you make something based on this mathematical marbling coating challenge share it with me in the passenger showcase thanks for watching this coating Challenge and see you next time
