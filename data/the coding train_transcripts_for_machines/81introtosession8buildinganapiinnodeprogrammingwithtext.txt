hello and welcome to session 8 of programming from A to Z in this session I want to talk about and look at more deeply how to build an API using nodes so this whole course has focused on working with text reading text analyzing text generating text and most of the stuff almost everything that I've shown you happens in clientside JavaScript so let's talk about a little bit just generally what the difference is so if you have a laptop that you're working on and it has a web browser in it you might be running your p5.js sketch right there in the browser itself so this is going to get you very far there is so much you can do with just this as we've seen now you can do word counting and Markov chains and all sorts of projects but there are some limitations here so for example let's just go back and think about word counting so one of the things we did is okay so you have some text document and you want to count how many times each word appears in that text document and visualize it in some way with your p5.js sketch this will work just fine all clientside unless and unless a couple of things one is where is this data coming from if you have a little text file that you can put on your server great but what if this is instead of one text file what if this is 1,000 or 100,000 or 1 million fun I need that like Austin Powers music 1 million text files you know it's going to be kind of unreasonable to expect the client side just your p5.js guests in the browser to sit there and churn through millions of text files for 10 minutes a half an hour and then produce the result this is where serverside programming can come in and now the platform that I'm going to use for serverside programming is note is no dot J's of course they're a variety of ways you can approach serverside programming so okay so there's a lot of pieces to this so one thing that we've established is if you have a really large data set perhaps serverside programming is going to help you here's another thing what if you have users entering in their favorite words and you're there you have your mad libs application and they're entering words nouns adjectives to generate stories what if you want every time the user comes back to be able to see what they entered before or what if you want when a user comes comes to the page we'll see what everybody has entered this is also so large these are some reasons for serverside programming is large data set another one is persistence and I don't know how to spell that persistence meaning saving data and there's a variety of ways you can save data but with clientside JavaScript only while you can download data to that users local computer there's no way to save data across multiple sessions using a particular web application so this server is a place where if we could send data to the server it could be saved on the server in you know what's known as a database so these are some pieces to why you need serverside programming now here's another reason what if you want to expose everything your data or your algorithm or the thing you're working on to other users as an API this is another reason why you might want serverside programming and this is mostly what I'm going to focus on in this particular week 8 set of session 8 however I'm going to kind of look at all of these pieces by the time I get to the end of it but this idea of maybe you have a this wonderful spreadsheet of all of this information about flowers and you want to allow other people to make queries go to flower API comm slash chrysanthemum or flower API comm slash sunflower and receive JSON back with all this information about flowers this is something you're going to want serverside programming for as well and this is going to be the focus here it was one of the thing on my mind and I'm trying to kind of come up with it API persistent large dataset aha I thought of it I'm gonna say I'm gonna just say scraping but um and with persistence by the way could be kind of like user accounts and all that sort of stuff but I'm kind of staying away mostly from like traditional web development here and looking at kinds of creative applications of this stuff but I'm saying scraping because one thing you might have noticed is in p5.js if you try to do the bane of your existence might be this this is this thing called cores or you might see it as like xml httprequest error you might have tried to load image from some URL or load strings or load JSON you get this error I can't do it security crossorigin resources sharing not allowed inaccessible stopstopstop so there's a lot of times where the clientside for security very good security reasons is not allowed to reach to another server and request data but your serverside program is allowed to do that so your surfers from so for web scraping for example if you want to look at a webpage download all of its HTML parse it out pull out some things you want you can do that from server side and pass that to the client side so these are kind of four reasons why you might want to use serverside programming number three being make your own API this is where in many ways I want to start okay so what are the pieces of this the first thing that I want so I'm going to make a bunch of videos and then we'll eventually be here on YouTube for you to watch or I don't know what the platform of the future is when YouTube goes away but hopefully the videos will still exist number one I'm going to talk about what I have a bunch of videos that I will link to in this playlist of kind of what is node and what is NPM for node package manager so you need to install node and get up and running with something called NPM first and I already have the videos made for that which I will reference and link to somehow but here I'm going to start with a node package called Express which makes building a web server which is what you're going to need the score the web servers the thing that's going to pass information to but your client your p5.js sketch or somebody else is making an API query so we need to look at Express I want to look at saving data and I got like a secret you which is one of the easiest way I'm sure someone Gavin get struck by lightning for doing it this way but to add it a really easy way to have a database it's just save a JSON file say the text file to the hard drive of the computer and then load it every time the server run so I'm going to look at the simplest way you can have a database and then some other more complex ways maybe using a database system like couchdb or MongoDB and then something called firebase which is a Google product that allows you to just send them information they say before you can request it later I want to look at some point at scraping other web pages so how could you grab an image and then pass that to p5.js or an HTML page and pass that to p5.js there's a lot of topics here about making an API there's this thing called rest I don't even know what that is try to figure it out together there's the thing called cores crossorigin resource sharing which I think I dunno what it is and then I want to look at a bunch of different examples mostly around working with text to follow the theme of this course so what if you what if you had the sort of Big Data scenario where you need to load massive amounts of text and you want to pass to a user word counting it for you want to pass to make an API for word counting information so that's something that I look at as well as I want to build an API for sentiment analysis using this a fin 111 a list of words I'm gonna have a couple of examples that use that use a node package called node natural which is another text analysis natural language processing node package which has a lot of great features and I'll show you a couple of them here so I'm gonna get started in the first next video you know this isn't the order that I'm going to go and I'm really going to focus on working with Express setting up this idea of an API and then see if I can transition that into a simple sentiment analysis intimate analysis API and we will see how that goes okay see you next video
