so do so do do so check hello everyone i will be starting in approximately two minutes and 30 seconds let me turn down the music for when i'm talking that's probably a slightly better balance and i'll be back in a moment do do do hello happy friday and welcome to a live episode of what's the name of this thing again the coding train is it okay if i change the name of the channel at some point in the future i probably won't but i'm just wondering oh remember what i used to call it coding something that i won't say right now i suppose um hello everyone it's so nice to see all of you um saying hello in the chat um hello to everyone around the world who i know watches the coding train i know there are quite a few viewers in india and i hope everyone there is staying safe and healthy um i'm really thinking of everybody around the world who is struggling through so many different kinds of challenges right now whether it be the global pandemic or um otherwise so i hope that this stream uh wherever you are whatever time it is that you're watching can bring you something positive today whether it's uh watching me just struggle through two hours of trying to use a computer or maybe you might learn something or find a little humor or laughter or a friendly face that's what i hope my face is as i try to clean my glasses um but let's get started uh first up i would like to thank today's sponsor of the live stream um that is my friends over at brilliant i like to make video tutorials to teach interesting concepts in math and science and graphics and computers and all sorts of related things but if you would like to also learn those things through interactive lessons through puzzling it out yourself through a community of people also learning you can sign up and do that for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um there are also a whole set of courses that you can unlock it's a premium member of brilliant and if you sign up through that link the first 200 people to do so will receive 20 off so i'll come back a little later in the stream and look more at brilliant website but um i wanted to just uh start off by thanking brilliant now i don't have a plan for today um i am looking at the chat i'm seeing some great suggestions so here's the thing we are entering we being me you and uh whoever else is part of this engine um are entering a new phase in the life of the coding train because for me the summer is a very different time of year than the academic school year because i happen to have this fulltime day job that i really should probably be working on right now um which is teaching at um new york university um there are two programs there our graduate program called itp an undergraduate program called ima most of the sequence tutorials that are on the channel are tutorials that i create for the courses that i teach there and then i also spend some time doing these live streams and other stuff here on the channel but the summer is approaching which means my daytoday commitments lighten up quite a bit now i do like any of you i would expect also would like to enjoy the summer the beautiful weather i see the sun shining outside there's a cool breeze there's the the blooming plants are out i like to spend some time in my little garden here in brooklyn i like to go for a jog every once in a while so i have some children we've got a little league game tonight go rip tides um but um so while there might be some times over the summer i will take a break from this thing that i do here i also would like to just invest really in the coding trade community in making more videos and i think i really think what i need to get back to is the coding challenges it is probably the most watched the most requested the most if anything is beloved in any way shape or form it certainly is uh the most um enjoyed content that i produce so but interestingly enough so i today is a little bit of me trying to press the reset button a little bit i have no plan get organized i have a lot of lingering just projects that are just you know just twisting in the wind i think is really the expression one of which is the live poll software web application that i would like to revisit um and i'm looking at the chat and seeing all of your lovely messages thank you k weekman for um um uh compiling some of the suggestions and bringing them into the member discord um let's see here though but i do want to uh talk about something to one thing here a live bug report on the coding train website um this is not the latest video so the coding train website by the way which is going to have a relaunch that's a whole other topic to talk about which i will not but not for today for the future stay tuned uh i owe some people some emails back if any of you that i owe an email to about the relaunch of the website are watching i know i owe you that email it's after may 1st we were supposed to get started soon um so the website is supposed to um one of the things that i really struggle with is that i um you know i greatly benefit and appreciate youtube as a platform i don't think i'd be able to do what i'm doing right now without youtube or something in that vein there are many issues and criticisms that i have about youtube as a platform google perhaps as a company um you know um i'm still you can see here i'm using the chrome browser i'm i'm not perfect here i have not been able to extricate myself from just everything i use being google products but all that said one of the things that i really struggle with with youtube and just to pull up the channel here for a second is uh it's not a great place to organize a lot of sequence tutorial content so the website's goal is to do that so if you're new here by the way i just want to highlight this this is where you should begin if you want to learn code for the first time if you think that the p5.js javascript library could be the right framework and platform for you the coding trained videos appeal to your sensibility you're not severely irritated by me which you know some percentage of the audience is i i see you in the comments being severely irritated by my gestures and tangents and all that i get it i get it other people like it some people don't it's the way the world works um this is where you would want to start uh but live bug report here i don't know if we can fix this in real time if any of the uh managers of the website yeah uh managers of the website are um watching this should actually um show the most recent video which is uh this machine learning and the computer mouse so one of the things i want to mention about this video and i'm not going to uh play it for you uh let me know in the chat if you have not seen this video already i'm kind of curious how many people tune into the live streams found their way but don't necessarily watch some of the produced content that appears but this video is completely different than anything i ever made before i can just sort of scan through it you can see that it is more produced with some animations and i actually i'm reading from a script and various uh topics it was actually created for a conference called the computer mouse conference so one thing i am curious i wouldn't mind if i can get my live poll thing going to throw up a poll throw up a poll sounds a little bit odd to uh post a friendly poll for you to select your choice um if you appreciate it and like this style would like to see me make more videos like this or should i get back more to my roots which is ultimately kind of what i'm doing right now but just i press the button record i type of the code i make the mistakes and then eventually uh i press stop and then you watch it later at some point anyway i'm kind of curious about that i'm seeing i'm reading the chat here differential growth is a great suggestion hari uh says i haven't seen it yet um uh corey says i've been watching coding challenge but i haven't seen the most recent video um and luis says for me it's the opposite i barely catch a stream yeah that's um certainly i would say more um typical um null pointer says i prefer the organic nature of your videos to that scripted one but i still enjoyed it a lot yeah so i think my kind of um point of view about this at present is i really loved making this it was a tremendous amount of work and expense frankly um but um and so i would like to continue doing things like that but that's more of a once i mean at a maximum that's like a once a month kind of project um and i would like to keep going with the um it's not that i want to do a a quantity over quality but i think that i have a system for making what i hope is high quality low production value light editing uh videos so um yes and kobe is saying that the mouse conference got a separate tab under more and so the home page of the website uh has some code involved where i think it only pulls videos that are from the coding challenges coding cabana so that would be something we would have to fix but it's right here and you can see actually i need to embed the video on this page but all the code but one of the things that i really wanted to show you and let me just switch just to um i'm going to take myself out of the picture here i'm going to open up this um oh now i've lost it um i thought it was this but no this is the actual video but not the final one where did i put this on my mess of a desktop here uh yes this is what i'm looking for no so what i wanted to just quickly i'm just going to quickly play this for you then i might talk through some of it this is a quick um this is a quick behindthescenes um little 30second video that uh matia who does all the editing for the coding train helped put together to show how we created the effect of the desktop kind of living in the garden with me walking behind it and back in front of it although it doesn't actually show that walking behind it thing but you'll get the idea here all right so let me just uh play this for you so i don't know if that was uh selfexplanatory enough but basically what this is is it's not a it's not me standing in front of a green screen i am actually standing outside um in the this garden space and you can see the raw footage of the garden looks like this but this is a particular technology from a company that i refer to quite often i'm an advisor to this company was founded by some alums of the program where i teach called runwayml and runwayml has some ai driven video tools one of which is called a green screen and so what green screen allows you to do and it doesn't have to be just for people most of the demos show people but it allows you to take a particular video click various key points so that's me kind of like click well i'm not actually doing this mateo was doing this clicking key points on the body and you could see the ai then tries to recognize the object now it didn't recognize the music stand but we also want to key out the music stance so one of the things that's wonderful about this tool is you can then click on that item and it's going to uh generate and then it generates a mask and then so we're able to generate a mask much like a green screen and not you know you can you can see there's some rough edges some slight imperfections but for having this in terms of if any of you have ever done any manual rotoscoping the amount of time it would take to do this at this level of quality even uh would be a tremendous amount of time i don't got this marvel uh uh visual effects department budget over here so um once we have that um i record screen recorded a lot of visual imagery um on as a just screen recording the desktop but left the desktop background the sort of perfect green color so that could be keyed out as a layer over the garden video and then after that you can see here like we can then take the masked version of me and layer that over so what's wonderful about this is even though there are some slight imperfections in the key when there's something else behind it like because it's the actual footage the uh there's no imperfection here because this is actually just the real footage it's the garden and me so um i'm seeing a lot of nobody seems to be responding to what i'm talking about in the chat but uh i hopefully you find this somewhat interesting and um you you can check out this tool yourself i'm going to runwayml.com so i wanted to mention that i wanted to encourage you to check out the mouse conference video also uh just to be uh frank here you should uh you really shouldn't watch my video what you should do is go to computermouseconference.net i want to click on this page here so it's complicating the complicatingthecomputermouse.net archived here this is the full um video of the conference with all the talks so i would really just kind of just scan through them oh this is me often just so ridiculous composed of rubber binded too so i really would recommend all of the archive of this conference um the panels were amazing there's this really cool chat system that you can read back over here it's just like it has all this wonderful ascii art in it so um i really um i really would encourage you to check out complicated computer mouse conference i try to really really be selective about participating in conferences because it creates a tremendous amount of stress for me and it takes up a huge amount of time and uh yeah i'd frankly just like to be making videos and teaching my classes so but the computer mouse conference is such a wonderful event i was so honored to be invited i also just want to mention that um nedo bomani an artist created uh did a live stream on the coding train making a zine um and if you missed that i'm just gonna there's no audio here i'll just play this for you really quickly this is i haven't released this anywhere yet but this is just a quick um uh timelapse video of the entire um zine making process it's about a minute and 30 seconds so um neda created basically a page in the scene for every talk of course by coincidence as if as if this was planned um we had a a technology issue during the time when she was making the page for my talk so you won't see that appear but there's a page for every other um um every other um speaker and panelist i believe at the conference um and um i'm going i don't know we'll put this somewhere on social media where you can sort of see this whole process um is really kind of incredible uh definitely something that i aspire to to think about what kinds of creative live streaming can i do um that's not just you know typing code and software um and this was really amazing i want to let this full thing play out for a second we'll just i don't have any music to play so enjoy the silence for a moment i can't let the silence go a lot of the things that neta was printing and cutting out were submissions by people who are watching the live stream um i just the end is my favorite and there you go look at this beautiful that's the look at this beautiful like beautiful beautiful object that was created over seven or eight hours during the course of the conference that's just all in a minute and a half okay um so um what's happening now i've got to get to something here let's i've seen so many wonderful suggestions in the chat before um i start to look at the um putting up a poll and trying to start maybe programming one of those suggestions i want to do two things i want to revisit my rainbow topics repository um there's wonderful suggestions of different things to look at here and what i would actually like to do is go here i believe at the what i've been doing is at the beginning of every kind of academic term like i'm sort of dividing the year up into fall 2020 spring 2021 now we're out to summer 2021. i would like to look at this markdown file and i'm just going to click edit i'm going to grab all of the text for it i'll leave that intact and i'm going to now make a new file whoops we're going to call it oops nope call it summer 2021 dot mark down and i'm just going to paste in what i had there before so let's start to look and eliminate things that i've already done now i have to one thing that's kind of unfortunate and i this is all on me is there's a huge backlog of things that i've done that i haven't actually published as videos so good news for all of you i suppose um if i if it once i get my act together and hopefully that's gonna happen this month especially now that the semester is winding down and that conference is over there's five uh videos for nature of code three videos for intro to programming with p5 and one coding challenge all of which yet to be released on the channel so if i math there's close to 10 videos that have yet to be released um and um i'm getting a great suggestion and body simulation that's really not something i've done before but let's let me look through this and i'm the summer is not the time for me to focus on the sequenced tutorials that's really the academic year stuff for me although it would be nice to make some progress to have them ready but i believe i did and anyone on the uh uh any i don't i believe i did and maybe some of the members who have tuned in for some of my recording sessions ah blender 3d that's also oh i gotta like uh i really want to learn blender my son is like a whiz at photoshop and video editing i discovered like i was trying to do and like i feel like he would really take to blender um and so um don't worry matthew you're not gonna be out of work yet he's pretty good at video editing but i think we can still need you um um but i i i did 2.1 to 2.5 so i'm gonna take that out i did uh all of chapter three i can take that out um chapter four i have done chapter five i have done but there could be more um the these i do need to do machine learning this is very important to me this is very important i guess i haven't done this as a video uh never got around to these express stop videos that's another i recorded a pilot of this idea of like a short uh one one to two minute video explaining a concept i suppose i should just be on tick tock now doing that so these all oh and i did um template literals is what i did um i guess uh i guess i could do this kind of just to indicate that discord bot i never finished those so those that should still be there uh coding challenges um yeah so this is what should go at the top here i did update this this library but i never did it in a video but i'm gonna that's gonna uh just go away uh i really wanna start working with uh vinyl cutting and a plotter uh learn a blender i did see a comment um from something about learn learning unity you know i'm it's a little silly for me to say this given a lot of the commercial tools that i do use uh on a daily basis and also in my videos but i prefer if at all possible to use um open source free uh tools and unity i suppose is kind of on the borderline there it's not open source i don't know what extent it's free but blender feels to me like in the spirit of p5 and processing um okay um so uh so let's go back up here coding challenges um i saw some good uh good ones that i will just like kind of roll out here right now so um i i think i'm not going to differentiate what's a coding challenge versus a cabana video fractal flame is like my number one you know the white whale so to speak for me right now um people are saying um uh tower of hanoi a tetris is one i've always wanted to do we could do that this summer sometime let's make a list uh aunt colony um do i i have langston's aunt already um so um if that's what it's called uh i'm looking at image to ascii it's a great idea image to ascii that's a fun one lava lamp coding challenges c sound um uh yeah so i guess i could do it as a coding challenge like basic like simple queue learning table like nondeep learning that feels like that could be a good coding challenge um slime mold simulation uh sebastian lag um uh react to make a gui for p5 sketches if that's really wanted by the audience i kind of want to get back to just the here's an interesting algorithm here's how it makes a pretty picture please go make it prettier make it interactive do do with it what you will so i'm a little bit more interested in that right now than some of the more utilitarian content but i'm not opposed to that langdon's aunt did i say langston p5 glitch library would be interesting to explore uh for sure um okay 2d platformer game shaders shaders shaders by the way there is an incredible live stream um uh by uh i don't know if she's still watching the coding train but she was uh i would see her in the chat here and there eliza sj um i know that shar styles has been appearing as a guest and maybe eliza sj has a does anybody know what i'm talking about this shader streaming on twitch uh for your transform with deep learning mandelbrot set ray marching ascii rotating cube forward circles i don't know what that is 2d platformer i mean a 2d platformer i sort of have i not done anything like that falling sand i like that uh open simplex noise i have a video i mean i have a video where i use it in p5 flutter yeah that's another not so not so interested right now uh freya homer has a lot of stuff on shaders grain graphics and similar stuff thank you for that next excellent um uh asteroids game i do have one already a connect five well i do want to do connect four also i saw that um um stand up maths had um something about spot it which is maybe called like doppel in the uk but um that could be fun to do um uh i don't um um five okay run one it's a 3d platformer okay that's interesting run one okay um math equation to graph all right i think i've got a good list here of some things that came up um let me also just go over to uh issues because one of the things that i do so you can post ideas here um with the read with the relaunch of the website maybe part of that will be a new tool to take suggestions but one of the things oh sudoku yeah i really um sudoku i would love to do whether it's just generate puzzles and or solve them that i would love to do but um one of the things that i do is i will often um assign them to myself if i see it as something interesting so um wave function collapse i remember that as being a thing uh wave function collapse slide puzzle i love that idea that's a oh auto encoder is something i really want to learn how to do mathematical marbling sure why not i don't remember what that was but that sounds cool uh pie challenge i gave marching squares marching cubes i did that derom curve um where i lost where i am durham curve i should be linking to these but that's okay fibonacci spiral spacex pie music these are a lot of pie things quad trees load bites these are old things that i think i'm fractal flame though i really want to do that ulum spiral i don't know why this like i'm um ascii art generator has always been one okay i've got a good list here i'm just taking a peek at the chat uh chess 3dl system trees with procedural i did 2048 already do have a whole video series about that um dobbles that's what it's called yes spot it uh dobble yeah so okay um all right so this is good i'm gonna hit save on this this is a nice kind of set of goals for the summer i really want my focus to be this kind of content um we'll see how i do um but that's that's that all right what's next uh i would like to look at some community contributions because i haven't done that for a while and i do have my community contributions theme song yes that's right you the viewers of the coding train periodically watch the videos and make your own projects based on the content that i make because i create content i create the content the content is created by me that is what i love to think of myself as a content creator that's the worst term ever everybody hates it can we come up with something else um so is this music too loud so let's go to so what what am i talking about here if i go to any one of my recent videos we can see here things that people have made related to the particular video and i could click on challenges just oh let's uh let's get a random number let's do it let's do it this way let's get a random number if only i had some way of getting random numbers right ah if only i had some way of getting random numbers between 1 and 161 uh allow allow allow here we go now i can't by the way i've lost my book i have no idea where it is it's somewhere in this house i don't know where it is so i don't have it today i do have the bell 69 i hate the universe the universe is the worst 85 that'll be edited out later let's go to coding challenge 85. the internet why internet what's 85 i used to do so many of these here we go oh game of life this is a good one this is a good one all right now whoa we've got a lot of great ones all right all right everybody all right so this is one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirty forty fifteen sixteen the seventeen if i counted that correctly let's give us a random number between one and seventeen number four one two three four the greg of life oh this is kind of awesome first of all greg brilliant title i love that this is called the greg of life that's totally amazing everybody should have their own the your first name of life or whatever name you so choose okay um whoa this must be greg i assume with a bunch of different expressions and then i can do gender step forward i actually have not seen this one this is so brilliant oh that is amazing oh greg uh i could just watch this all day this is so fun and bizarre now am i right that it's different expressions or am i imagining that let's zoom in on this again let's do pause like look here yeah these are definitely different i don't know how many there are but these are distinctly different expressions great job greg it's pretty awesome um all right let's look for one more on this page number 16 is well if i counted correctly would be this one simple game of life by unoriginal pun click where you want to activate or deactivate cells c to swap one oh cool oh i love that so this is really cool there's something in the game of life there are various repeating patterns so first of all if you don't know what the game of life is boy do i have good news for you i've got a whole video about it you can take a look at it it's probably about 45 minutes long um it is a cellular automata system it's a cellular automaton and what that means is there is a system of cells each cell has a state in this case just on or off white or black and its new state is based on um what its neighbor state um what its neighbor state are so states are so um and um there are some wellknown patterns one of which is called a glider and it looks like um through key presses i can kind of add gliders to this simulation and watch it uh play out great work i love that c to swap color oh interesting i kind of like it this way it was uh kind of a big glare there so great work um terrific um great work all right let's go for um i want to i'm giving myself till like just like five more minutes so let's go back to uh what was the maximum coding challenge again it was like 183 um 161 i don't know where i got 183 from my brain is completely nonfunctional these days uh let's try this again coding challenge number 12. oh that's going to be an oldie oh throwback time uh let's go to coding challenge number one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten ten 10 10 11 12. ooh the lorenz attractor all right let's take a look at this to the challenge we go and we've got three we've got three two by one carlos i'm surprised by the way that this coding challenge only has three contributions associated with it because this is quite a um i think uh quite ripe for the reinvention for the for putting your own uh twist on it so i i feel a little silly uh picking a random between one and three let's just look at all three of these um so here we have whoa okay that is cool so these are particles moving along the path there is a whole there uh so this is just the lorenz attractor pattern which presumably if i when i made that video i created this um but i did not do it in such a way with thinking about color and putting particles to move along it now these i guess if i uncheck this now i don't see the particles this is also a nice 3d scene that i can rotate around that is really amazing oh so pretty let's put the particles back what's compared to ah oh compare draws the lorenz attractor like sort of expands it out as a path that is really cool and i could take the particles out oh but there's compare there's are there two going on here i thought i saw two no maybe not so i don't know what's the what is the um rule by which the color changes ah yeah there are two so they're slightly different i see so they're slightly different initial conditions the initial conditions here there you know there's these three variables one is 2.00 one is 2.05 so this is kind of the theory of a chaotic system this socalled butterfly effect uh tiny changes in initial conditions result in large global changes um so i can hit randomize i see and then we get ah it's just randomized i try different initial conditions this is really cool uh preset is what it started as uh butterflies um oh it just has butterflies like going along the path i love that that is really wild this is amazing open controls uh curve animate curve butterflies uh preset i lost the um let me just refresh the page oh wow is it like using local storage to remember ah that's kind of nuts um and can i change these parameters at all guess not i don't know what's going on here um i don't know what to do oh i went to a different page for the butterflies that's why it was a different page for the butterflies got it okay this is amazing i could play with this all day um i am super impressed uh thank you to juan carlos for this amazing contribution um and i think we just actually saw the third one which is the lorenz attractor with butterflies by the way just to look at like what is the actual code from the challenge the code from the challenge is just this um i i guess i have the um the orbit controls or something and this is actually i think i did this in processing so this port is thank you to whoever did this port um but you can see um that the code to the actual challenge is quite simple it's is much simpler it's just the basic pattern okay let's look at alejo cortinas lorenz attractor resolume arena plugin i have no idea what that means let's click on it to see so this is the repository of a resolume arena plugin using processing and the lorenz attractor i don't know what this plugin is does anybody know so this is um what is this it's like a media server oh interesting for like vj software interesting that's really cool so maybe this is some way of getting your processing visualization into this other software that you can use to sort vj a concert or a party pretty interesting um gjk collision detection algorithm um is a is a suggestion that's coming oh wolfram so i do want to do a video on the wolfram elementary ca um that is vj software thank you to um joss in the chat more ideas from stig okay i got i'm gonna add more ideas um later let me move on i have one minute left in my community contributions section on let's this probably needs an update but let me go over to discord real quick we're going to get one more in i am going to type in the bot command wheel and that's going to bring me the reason why i didn't go to this first is i feel like this hasn't been updated in a while but this is actually a wheel and i can spin this wheel a wheel of contribution that i should get one is called look here and look here is also by uh jay ponce uh i already looked at one of jay ponce's contributions uh so in a way i feel like i should pick another one but uh i have seen this one this is really cool so i have a video about purlin noise loops uh and making these sort of blobby patterns with them i remember seeing this one now okay let's try to get one more let's spin this wheel again kotch and i know it's not pronounced koch but that's just how i have to say it right now uh ah unrog is that a rock watching uh anurag is a regular viewer of the coding train uh let's see uh we've got the uh and we've got again i should probably learn uh how to use this wonderful.gui javascript library which allows a lot of just a quick way to create an interface to play with a lot of parameters in a visualization algorithm okay everyone i can close all these out and we are going to move on to our next segment which is where you the viewer vote on the thing that i will do in the second half of this live stream to launch the summer the summer of the coding challenge oh this is going smashingly well today all right so so i'm looking here i have this uh project that i began on a live stream many moons ago um and uh various contributors have if i go here and look uh at the history here various contributors have added a whole bunch of things and features and visual ideas and the idea for this is that it is a system by which i can spin up a poll i can uh send the link out of the poll to the chat and then i can watch the results come in live as an overlay on my live stream so let's and i haven't looked at this probably in about six months uh january february march april may you know five months four months four or five months so i already have it um cloned here onto my desktop let me run npm uh can i just say npm start is that how you do it so now i've got the uh poll running and all right so what i would like to do now whoops is create a poll okay but we're going to attempt this summer all right we're going to do may what's today's date 7th may 7th 2021 live all right so let's pull a few of the options from uh of something and something that i might begin to explore so today it's just this is just a trial run an experiment an exploration if you will um so if i go back to um uh rainbow topics and i go to my summer 2021 file and let's see like one of these um so this i could definitely begin to explore today fractal flame um i could begin to explore the idea of doing tetris today i like this image to ascii uh uh the slime old simulation i'm interested in i'm just picking a bunch uh i'm getting uh shaders not today 2d platformer not today falling sand connect4 again i'm um let's oh can i not have more options i only get five options okay that's a feature i need well simon's gonna be very upset if i don't put generator functions in here let's put uh generator functions um and let me let's hit create and see what happens here all right so now here's my poll and uh i'm going to switch over here for a second and i'm going to see if i can um get this as an overlay so i want to know what is my local ip now i realize that i have to figure out a way for all of you to vote i've got a plan don't worry um oh and body simulation would have been a good one for me to um to add uh all right so hold on this is this is not science this is this is just figuring out the live poll this is not the final poll this is just seeing if the poll this is like a metapol a trial run of the poll itself so i am going to my system preferences and i am looking for my ip address i don't think it matters if anybody sees it but i'm just looking for my local ip keyboard number two here oh it's loud okay thank you um real serious stuff i'm doing here oh wait okay hold on hold on i know what i need to do here oh 196. no wonder this site can't provide a secure connection uh all right let's not do it this way um um don't worry everyone things are gonna happen you're gonna see got it got it got it got it got it got it um i'm working on something here um okay great okay here we go i know the music left but everything's going to be fine all right i'm getting there okay why is the background not a transparent toggle overlay mode but i can't interact with it i can't interact with this page in obs so this has a whole like interface but um all right we're gonna do it this way um uh transform reset transform no no you silly not of the camera oh i messed up this thing transform uh reset transform there we go uh let's uh how's this for live streaming entertainment um crop this out here i can't click on that in obs so i need a way of so this i'm now realizing some features that i need okay so in a moment i'm going to give you the place to vote um i am going to somebody could so it is a poll so i want to go to the vote link okay hold on everyone uh wait where did i post that did it get deleted no i wanted it there did someone delete my message thinking that i didn't want to put it there i want to put it there because i need it that's how i go back and forth between the computers you're all welcome to it in the members channel now i lost it i have to get it again i don't want to post it in links yet i'm not ready for that this is we're trying this trial run okay now we're going to get this url and go to vote instead no oh uh vote okay now what you are seeing here is the page and this link can now if anybody wants to put it i want it to vote first i'll vote for fractal flame got one vote and if i go back to here there we go so at the moment what should happen is as soon as i post this link for people to vote and you're looking for the discord link here it is i'll post it in discord and somebody can so the place by the way if you're not in the coding train discord you should join right now um and i'm gonna post here in the links uh channel the place where you can vote oops it needs to be not poll vote so i'm pretty sure that this is now the url for you to click on and if i go back here the votes should start coming in um if somebody could crosspost this it was a moderator into the youtube chat that would be great and we'll see if the internet is friendly to me today or if people decide to like destroy everything that i worked so hard for fractal flame is really winning out here i'm ready for the votes to come in wrong link all right everybody whoops all right what's going wrong everybody why why can you not vote okay so i'm gonna go back to me here this is go to vote uh well i've already voted maybe that's why it should be that i just change let's go to an incognito window huh so what am i missing here everybody i was able to vote does it only take one vote is there some kind of uh pull yeah why is it redirecting to the poll link um i'm reading the chat here uh coding challenge fix yeah yeah i'm using ngrok just to host it because i don't feel like deploying it right now and i don't understand why um it's not allowing me to go to the vote go to vote let's go to this one yeah this one see how if you go to the vote and the id so sing let's hit yes and then if i go back to vote yeah once i voted i can never get there again why is that all right we're gonna have to i guess debug this no the point of this is this has to work this this has to be a project that gets finished that i can use regularly i guess i could just work on it and test it um outside of live streaming because now it is noon and i have completely failed um but i don't understand why uh why this is happening and i guess i could look at the code um let's let's look at what's going on here all right uh let's see here um like there should be a vote route where is create newest oh i can always go to newest i forgot about that pull pull id vote pull id ah if i have voted uh redirect to this all right that's i guess to like keep you only voting once but it's not working yeah why is engroc is the problem interesting so this protection to keep you from only voting once is an issue because everyone it thinks everyone is the same person because i'm using ngrok so really i should deploy this i think i have this deployed to glitch i just was trying not to uh use it there all right okay let's try this again um let's uh let me go to my glitch account here and just switch over here for a second um to get to a live poll okay so now i'm coming back so i'm gonna um i'm going to uh kill ngrok so ngrok is like my favorite thing which is a way of just like spinning up a open to the public web server from my laptop on whatever port i'm running my node application it's so useful for testing and i just find it to be delightfully wonderful but uh i think yeah everybody's but i uh and i know that things like straw poll exists and all these other services that do exactly this the point is i want my own i work i want to use my own um so let's go to um glitch here and um i am going to um it's not um see if this will wake itself up here's a lot of people who contributed to this uh this is not i haven't boosted this one maybe i should boost this project so that it wakes up um because i do have a pro account um let me check that out here um and i'm going to uh what should i unboost i need to unboost something oh i can unboost this and boost this so the live poll is now being boosted and okay great great now the question is uh i'm just checking something here got it oh no wrong website aha okay hold on everyone hold on i'm going to do something quite radical which is a live pull i know you can't see what i'm doing this makes for really amazing live streaming uh all right so what i'm doing here is i am grabbing this particular github repo which is the full project i am going over to and i just need to make sure the environment yeah does not show up great i'm going to go over to the glitch project which is here i'm going to tools import the import from github going to paste this in so i'm now just like wiping this and bringing in the full project uh and uh i'm going to uh fix something really quick it's gonna go to the readme i'm gonna go back to my camera i'm going to put a little passwordy thingy in it which is going to be highly secure and now i'm going to go back to here everything's going to work everything's going to be great now we're going to show in a new window all right so now we everyone should be able to go to live dash poll dash coding dash train dot glitch dot me um you won't see anything there yet on this shirt by the way is foreshadowing a future live stream that i need to do this month because i'm work i have a special project which is all about artificial intelligence and pineapples so i got to come back um why is this not waking up no no um working says philippe all right let's look at tools logs okay it was installing everything the server is running okay great so i should be able to um there we go now here we go we're really really gonna get this to go right now now um enter question here may 7th 2021 question mark yeah so you the the sign in is only required for creating the poll so uh i am going to be able to create the poll by signing in you will be able to vote once i've created the poll without signing in so and um i will uh quickly do something here um i am now updating the password because it was a default password that is probably very easy for all of you to guess um can i restart everything that's fine um okay so create a poll uh may 7th 2021 end body uh i forgot already uh well fractal flame this is just a test of the pole it's not the real pole what did i have in that pole uh connect image to ascii image to ascii uh auto encoder no no no no 2d platformer no no p5 glitch i love to look at p5 glitch actually right now uh p5 glitch what is a generator function in js okay create this poll all right so now this should be the link for voting okay so i am going to pick fractal flame that's my one vote now what i need to do and i think if if if nobody didn't like can i just go to like latest no what was the route there's a route that's like um i think it's in the readme actually um create newest newest so i'm gonna go to newest that didn't work oh just like this great awesome okay oh i forgot to add tetris sorry everybody this is not the real poll this is a test of a poll now i'm going to go to here and this should always be uh this particular link i'm gonna have to redo the design because the whole point was it for it to be kind of transparent paste and now if i say newest i knew i was hacked i knew i was hacked oh you were all so mean to me why do you have to be so mean i changed the password does it still not work redirects back to once one person votes this is going so well ladies and gentlemen and everyone else please test your software before you deploy it live on a stream i don't think anybody's watching this anymore [Laughter] at least i was hacked and i do need to eat lunch after this so this is a good sign all right i'm gonna um uh let's go here pizza i have a question wait where's my pole hold on i'm i'm doing something here people create a poll um hold on everyone uh may 7th tetris n body fractal flame pizza generator function all right pull voting link try going to and i'm going to put this in discord try going here i put a link in discord uh and now let's see can i refresh this page how do i refresh the page if i just go back and forth how do i force obs to refresh newest i'm gonna cry same poll redirecting it's the same as before but i'm not even getting uh the pull to come up i boosted this app it should be fast you should be responding fast i could just get rid of that thing in the code and let everybody vote as many times as possible let's do that uh so here we are let's go to um uh where is it uh server web.js let us change and not um so this is in the vote let's not redirect so i'm taking that out so that redirect is now gone which will allow everybody to vote as many times as you want which i'm sure what could possibly go wrong there okay so i'm now gonna go to go to vote um this is going remarkably well whoa oh my god help stop please everybody why delete why why did you i can't i what did not oh everybody found packed my thing okay i've got an idea you're all i'm gonna pull this car over right now and we're not getting pizza no pizza all right it's time for me to take a break this was a big failure i will get a fiveminute break you all did this to yourself or one of you did it to everybody else um yeah each time you go to newest there's a new poll because guess what so i could it's fine only i was supposed to be able to i did change my password for whatever reason it's like the like local storage um and it is nice that it's very wholesome what everybody is uh uh posting there as the polls but um this this is i'm sorry everyone we will we will we will we will just go and use straw poll or something else or during the break i will i'm gonna reset the app with a new password and start again but while you're all here it's time for me thank goodness for having friends in the world who want to support the coding train because it allows me to take a moment away from the failure that is this live poll project and talk to you about something called um brilliant so i um i said before at the top of this stream that um you're here because presumably uh you're interested in learning very little learning has been going on would you like some actual learning maybe you want to learn something new in stem maybe computer science math and logic maybe you just want to learn about how the world works what is it that you should do well you could watch educational live streams on youtube but you can see very little learning going on so i i i'm i'm kind of using the this the sort of prepared remarks about brilliant but what i really want to say is that like actually for me the best way uh the way that i discover new algorithms and new concepts and learn uh concepts that i've maybe heard about but didn't have a chance to explore um is by uh is through interactivity um and so brilliant is a website and app that's built off this very this very principle about learning while doing solving in real time um you can see here that that you know if you want if you're interested in coding this is brilliant's course about learning to code with python um this is actually um one of one of my favorite courses that they have about geometry fundamentals so you can see here through explanations through interactive diagrams you can learn about um the pythagorean theorem so and it really like brilliant has something for everybody so basics of math science computer science there's even topics on cryptocurrency and neural networks um so if you would like to join me and a community of 8 million learners and educators today just go and you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um and if you would like to unlock the premium subscription you will get 20 off or at least the first 200 people to do so by um using that link so um well i actually want to go and take a look at that geometry fundamentals course because it's one of the ones that they sent me um to to take a look at so let me pull away the banner let me not go to my uh and let me go to brilliant.org i'm going to go here to courses and oh beautiful geometry well that sound these are courses that i've worked on recently so you can see what i'm taking this is one that i would really recommend this infinity course if i'm gonna look at fractal flames um lots of related stuff between but i wanted to look for the geometry fundamentals one um if anyone sees it you can see there's just so many courses let's look for geometry fundamentals so let's take a look and let's this is not a course that i've started yet so i'm going to just start it right now and see what up see what happens okay geometry is a way of thinking by looking at the world in shapes and angles we can combine reason with our knack for spotting by the way you can use brilliant on your own you don't need to listen to a person like me just read it to you but um so unfolding sliding rearranging and cutting let's get started look at this beautiful so just at a minimum like i always i love the brilliant uh courses because i see these amazing animations and i think how would i program those in p5 so let's at least do the first one okay it's tempting to search for a relevant formula and calculate until an answer emerges but this course will be looking for ways to jump directly so we're kind of using our intuition so just using my intuition in the shape below i mean it doesn't say that but is there more yellow or more white so i'm gonna kind of assume that it's the same just by like the way the the question was phrased but um let's let's try to like puzzle this out so i can see very clearly that there's four squares of yellow and i can see that there's one square here of white but this and this makes up a second one so two this plus this was uh i think they're only like one two three ah there's four squares of white because there's these if i if i kind of zoom in so i can like point to it um so one uh two three four oh i need a bigger field of view for my camera um so let's just say they're equal hit submit and i'm correct um and if we look here oh um and by the way it's ah it's gonna look at this beautiful so i just wanna make nice like animations like this with p5 so um and um this is actually really cool because one of the things for me that is a big uh that's part of my life is um working with my kids who are in fourth and sixth grade um on their math homework i'm like the goto help with your math homework dad um and um actually like i'm seeing so many uh relationships between these fundamentals courses on brilliant and the kind of stuff they're doing in their math homework so this is actually a lot of fun um for me to do with them um as well so um i hope you will consider um brilliant i'm trying to just check here if there's anything else i wanted to say about it um there also is an app that you can use and i'll just remind you that you can go to brilliant.org codingtrain i'm going to take a short few minute break to see if i can figure out what to do about the live poll situation and if you have nothing to do during this time um go ahead and sign up all right uh i will be right back in about five minutes for the roll rest of this live stream i'll be going to about 1pm try to do some actual coding here okay be right back do so do do so and we're back well i don't know am i doing this live streaming thing right i think i'm definitely not i've got a little bit of time i'm gonna just let's let's june june is gonna be my month right june is busting out all over it will be uh the image to ascii is quite um is really quite taking off here which i love the idea of exploring that right now so that's looking good i can give this maybe a little bit longer here to see what happens it's interesting as i was kind of imagining this would like live sort based on um uh what has the most votes but it does not appear to be doing that i like this exploring image to ascii kind of and i'm glad one person got my carousel reference all right we're at 100 votes image to ascii with the 40 close to 40 percent um it sorts on refresh all right there we go nice little refresh there uh image to ascii oh things are changing what is an auto encoder great question so an auto encoder is a particular kind of neural network architecture that receives an input and attempts to produce an output that matches the input now wouldn't that be that would be the easiest thing in the world to do if you maintained all of the information throughout the neural network but the an autoencoder takes the inputs and passes them through layers that have fewer units fewer nodes than the amount of inputs there were so in a way it's very similar to a kind of compression algorithm it's taking information compressing it into smaller sets of numbers and then decompressing it back out and it is kind of the foundational um it's a foundational i in my view example for how different kinds of generative deep learning based systems work so if you want to look at a generative adversarial network gan or other kinds of neural network architectures that are used for synthetic media i feel like an auto encoder is a great place to start and look how many people are voting for it now all right i think this is um i think this is pretty good i think we've i think we've seen uh enough here and um all right so here's what i hope um here's what i hope i'm gonna put this away here's what i hope will come out of this um i'm going to work on some ideas for how i might explore making um um ascii art essentially out of an image i've got about a half an hour right now to explore that um what i hope then is that this will be the beginnings of what i would take to a um an edited produced video that would kind of walk through building a image to ascii art generator so this is just a small exploration to um explore say the word explored so many times where i'm going with this all right i think it makes sense to do this in p5 oh i'm exhausted this live stream streaming stuff is exhausting okay i gotta i gotta i need to rethink my life here what am i doing i gotta make this something about this isn't is i'm off my game got a june june june is going to be coming up soon all right so how are we into this first let's get an image something high contrast something cute let's start with a kitten um let us go to um an image that is in creative commons license this looks like it will be good let's uh grab this image um let's say let's put this on the desktop as a kitten let us now upload okay save uh upload this file whoa look at this no i'm limited to twitter i've uploaded all i can upload all right well let me just move over to here for a second and uh also get rid of this uh let me just check out i'm sure i can remove uh from my account very easily i'm going to my assets here i just i'm afraid of what might pop up not that i use the p5 web editor for any nefarious business but there must be like some particularly large files can i sort by size no okay um but i'm gonna start deleting some files here oh weird what's that thumbnail pixel yeah this i can get rid of this is always a good idea to just randomly start deleting files to do this more methodically later this i don't need i'm looking for files that are in megabytes um zoom annotations copy all right did i i'm still at 101 percent i could just use a different account what is this uh let's delete this file am i under hit refresh i'm at 98 everybody look look what i have done i got myself down to 98 so i could upload the kitten again uh let's see okay this is going so well okay uh okay now let's upload the kitten upload upload upload file uh where is that uh downloads maybe is this the kitten no desktop kitten okay great i'm now going to add preload i would like to see the size of this image um 284 177. it's an interesting uh size for an image okay things are looking up i finally have a kitten i have some code how will i turn this into ascii art so one thing that i could do is i could sort of have i mean there's different ways of doing this and a simple approach which isn't a great one is that um i could just sort of think about the relative brightness of every pixel and i could draw a corresponding character that um that corresponds corresponds to the bright that that ha that that has a kind of brightness to it so in other words um let's think about this um like what if i can what if i have uh what if i loop through every character and evaluate its brightness i mean just just as a just as a quick demonstration of what i mean let's get at least something going here where um i am going to let me let me make a um canvas that is four times as big let me put a background on it uh i would like to and actually this image i would like to down sample it i don't have to do a lot of um manual math in the code right now so let me down sample this to 100 by 62. and i'm going to just call this kitten100 and upload this one maybe something like this already exists a table of like uh ascii characters to corresponding brightness values but i will show you what i mean and then i want to do um let's just do times 10 i really should do it down you know what am i doing here let's down sample it even more let's go to like um 48 oh i'm doing percent no i want pixels oh of course it's 48 because okay let's go to 48 call this kitten 48. and let's upload this one upload this file and uh let's say 48 and i'm going to have a variable i'm going to call it uh the scale i don't want to use the word scale because that's a p5 function um i could say like dim for dimensions let's say 10 so i'm going to create a canvas that is kitten width times some dimension kit and height times that dimension which is 10. uh and now i think i can move this over here this over here and there we go all right so this this is kind of making sense now what i would like to do then is say four let i equal zero i is less than kitten dot and let me just get these into some variables um because i don't have to type kitten.with over and over again with and height um let's do a nice little nested loop and just let's draw a rectangle i'm going to say no fill and this should be j and x is i times the the dimension but whoops y is j times the dimension then i'm going to draw a rectangle at x y of that size uh stroke zero so now i should at least see a grid that matches that image and i need another okay so i've got a grid that matches that image and this i also think is too small so i want to do a just sort of double the size there we go i don't have a tremendous amount of room for both the code and the visual but that's okay this will do so now let's just make sure i can kind of access the brightness of every pixel that's a way that i could start so i would like to say um let's say a kitten load pixels and honestly i'm let's i'm going to make this sort of static right now i don't need to have an animation so i'm going to put this all just in setup make sure this still works and then the pixel index is i plus j times the width times 4 this is for um i wonder actually if it would make sense to just use the p5 get function but i'm going to do this in the manual way i'm going to get the red value is then kitten dot pixels index i'm gonna need the green value and the blue value so this is index plus zero the next one is green the next one is blue you might be wondering like what are you even doing well what i'm doing here is has to do with loading the image and looking at every pixel individually and unpacking each pixel's color all of those colors are in a giant array that goes rgb alpha rgb alpha rgb alpha the alpha doesn't matter to me right now there's no transparency but and in theory if i do this we should see there's a low resolution blown up version of that kitten pretty pretty pretty good now what i would like to look at is the brightness so the um the brightness is r plus g plus b divided by three and i'm going to say if the brightness is greater than some threshold and maybe we'll make that threshold right now i'm going to just say 127 to sort of be halfway fill 0 or maybe like to make it brighter otherwise fill uh zero let's see if we can find a reasonable you know i could i could attach this to a slider now oh i want it to be maybe a higher threshold but but this is how i like to work there we go can you kind of see can you see that kitten there there's that kitten oh it's so cute so now i want to try something let's say text font courier i want to use a fixed width font and i'm going to say text zero x y and let me and then otherwise no tech no no text so what will this do here getting somewhere getting somewhere making some ascii art here okay i'm seeing some suggestions in the chat for each pixel write three different ascii characters depending on rgb values but using a blend mode oh i like that idea um so let's try uh text size uh dimension so there's my ascii art kitten um fete is saying this is a very basic list of cars i use but obviously the font matters from lowest to highest out lower to highest alpha all right let's try this oh and yes jupa is saying shouldn't rgb be weighted for a brightness calculation yes so that's definitely an improvement i could make darth k does kind of look like darth kitten so hold on i need these characters i'm taking these characters and i'm putting them into the discord uh oh whoops a wrong keyboard um let's try this um let's try this suggestion from um from feta i believe and i put that into discord here let me try getting these characters from lightness to dark i think um and so now if i go into the code and i think one thing i should do is crop the kitten so just to like give myself some more space here so let me um pull up this kitten 48 and let's see if i can crop it around oh the width was it's the height is 30. so let's do 36 by 30. oops so let's call this kitten 36. and i i you know the probably the potential to do this at slightly higher resolution is there so this should help me fit everything there we go now i've got a lot more room see that kitten there so let me go back and get uh these characters so this is interesting this is from i forgot that chat message i assumed right i should do background black and the text white that i could definitely do this looks to me like it is characters that go from uh that i can try using from brightest to darkest or darkest to brightest if they're white i wanted to do this with dom elements ultimately because i think it'll be much more interesting to select it but let's that'll be a separate step um let's try this suggestion of having the background be zero and i'm gonna put on the auto refresh throw caution to the wind here um and then change this to um here to be fill 255. there we go now what i would like to do is i want to get an index so the brightness index is map brightness which goes from 0 to 255 to go from 0 to what is this called cars.length i'm going to call this text and then call this text and then so what i'm doing is i'm just trying to like whatever the brightness might be go and pull a character from that array um and i need to floor this but i'll say the the character the car the ch is uh text index oh dot car at floor the brightness index and then now i don't need to worry about the threshold uh do we see the kitten there now i do kind of like the idea of keeping the so this is pretty interesting here i sort of feel like i probably should have a um wow so this image is kind of an interesting one to pick where i'm not getting any uh like i definitely want to like put in a space but like i can do a lot of this is sort of like sort of like a way of thresholding it just by adding more spaces so that's kind of interesting um so this is pretty good actually it looks more like an owl i agree let's take out one more now you know i think there's i think we this this list of characters is somewhat uh questionable um oh yeah and maybe these weren't meant to be here yeah yeah i don't think those are really meant to be there um is it interesting to have so i think this makes the image harder to read i mean obviously a lot has to do with this particular image but i like this as a kind of arbitrary way of thresholding it yeah all right that's pretty good that's pretty good okay now i would like this to actually be a dom elements so that i could um select this and copy paste it somewhere so let's see how i could do that um so the first thing that i want to do is go into the css and um let's just uh let's enforce a background color actually let's let's keep it i'm going to do it i'm going to invert it for the css because i feel like most text environments that's not necessarily true at terminal all right let's let's keep it so now what i need to do is create a div and ultimately let's change this to i kind of i think it might be helpful for me to see both for a moment so let's do let me see if i can create a div above the canvas i don't think no it's always going to be um so i need that how do you do how do you set a font color in css is it this or is it text color no text color i don't know css color ah there we go uh font size oh font family okay a font size okay let's try that for right now okay and let's just keep it at 16. so now what i would like to do is um let's make uh let's call it ascii div i don't need all these global variables because i'm not using an animation loop so this is kind of silly so let's do this um i just i think it makes sense to just have this all be one function because ultimately so i'm just kind of cleaning this up here okay so now i have this ascii div and so what i would like to do is create a big string i think this makes sense i mean i probably should use like the pre tag or something using a monospace func okay um okay so let's make a um let's make a string i'll call it output is an empty string and here output plus equals that character but after every oh i'm going down this has to be the inside loop still the same output plus every character and then in the outer loop output plus equals a line break although a line break won't actually show up and then i want to say ascii div dot html that output whoops oh okay so this is all of the characters but i need to use a nonbreaking space and then i think this has to be like this right if it's going to end up showing up on an html page okay that makes sense and then i should be saying um if character is a space um then is it this like nonbreaking space like that ah oh look at that oh and it made it skinnier okay so now i can do no canvas because i don't i kind of don't want the canvas i can comment it out um and so so this is all just canvas stuff so is a threshold is no longer relevant and so is that so if i i'm just commenting the canvas stuff out in case we want to put it back in and i think it would make more sense for this to be an array but then i could have the nonbreaking space in it okay css line height to make it a square how do i do that um how do i make a css line height okay i don't know the line height line height that's better right i don't know what the i don't know what it's supposed to be but let's try 14. does that look like a kitten to you and in theory like i could copy paste this and then go to discord and paste it into discord so this is cool because we could make like a discord bot that you give it an image and it returns you back to ascii art the thing about this though people who make ascii art generally they're like cleverly like contouring the image so like i could do edge detection and put like slashes around it so i think um i think there could be like a different way of doing this that might be a bit more effective but this is kind of good so now now the question is like what like what happens when i start using other images lower resolution images or higher resolution images but i think i would leave that for all of you to sort of like sort out because it's almost one o'clock well so this would so so here's the question for you i used to do stuff like this during my live streams in a more performative way knowing that i was going to then edit that out and make it into a standalone video the coding challenge would be like ascii from image but now the question is oh oh doing making this an oh whoa whoa hold your horses everybody duplicate i mean what is wrong with me shiffman uh video uh video equals create capture create video capture i can't remember how this works create capture video is that how it works um so yep okay so now video dot size uh 36 by 20 24 probably okay video video well i don't need i think this makes more sense oh but i'm not in draw anymore okay hold on um this is gonna be cool if i can get this to work um um uh remove child no canvas what what did i miss oh boy this is bad um oh no canvas should not be here there we go that's pretty wild and this is by the way this is a dom element this is not canvas i should be able to select that that is pretty cool um the thresh holding use 80 columns so um does it make sense to just well that's just well this was fun this was a good little mini project that you could take with you today uh here is oh wait i kind of messed this up like what's um like i could do this like a lot more wait let's just make it confused oh the dimensions is sort of not really doing anything right now because the the size of the font um all right i'm gonna i'm gonna just i forget that am i using dimensions anymore no this is no longer relevant i was just using that for when i had a canvas so really like how big could i get this uh too big oh but the video height sorry doesn't make any sense just want to see sort of performance wise ooh what did i do oh no that's it's just too big it can't and it's like wrapping the text okay too big i just wanna like what's a kind of reasonable like if i go now to um share and go to uh full okay i messed up something something is off in my uh math oh this is so okay i am a really annoying person who has made quite an error in judgment in the way that i have named my variables oh i don't need this anymore what is wrong with me okay here we go stop there we go but that also i'm not really getting the ascii effect there that's still to let's go um 80 by 60 i think probably makes more sense i also want to say video dot hide there we go and look at me decrease the number of spaces people are saying yeah maybe that makes sense in this one yeah there we go now i'm getting much more detail look at the pineapples people look at the pineapples and what's cool about this i just want to show you is i'm going to say no loop oh wait why oh okay and i'm going to grab this and i'm going to go to discord my message is over 2000 characters well okay let's just get let's just get part of it still it's over 2000 characters how many characters is this the top of my head there we go there's the top of my head now in discord but you get the idea uh can i put this in like a gist here i am folks look that's a that's a pineapple right there pretty wild right i could use marching squares to add an ascii border with the slashes that's a super fun idea anyway so here's this is my question i'm wrapping up the stream now that it's 106. um and um the question i have is what should i do should i make now uh um should i make a um i could do this as a coding challenge so i could do this i've done it already now but i could kind of like walk through the building of it and kind of maybe there's some ideas of improvements um mallory brothers is asking for the code um oh andreas justin's ascii playground okay great thank you so two things here one is this is the code for um this i'm gonna put this into uh the discord channel so um here if you wanna grab this code oh anna salko anna salko has joined the passengers of the coding train welcome anna right on time i don't even know if you're watching this right now or that message just happened but you are here make sure you look for the special link to a google form so that you can get your stickers in the mail also you are in need of your very own random number stay tuned the next live stream we will be premiering uh kobe one uh discord manager st plays on discord has um rebuilt um along with the help also i believe from um david um this uh a new features to the choo choo bot to be able to assign random numbers generate random walk path pat patterns and those will be etched onto train whistles the summer of coding train is coming um welcome aboard anna oh you are there anna so um please come and join the discord and we'll get in touch for um in terms of how to get you your member rewards and all that kind of stuff and the discord by the way is open to everyone there are just some member channels for those of you who are able to join and support in that way i super appreciate it now back to what i was doing was so this is the code uh for that this particular sketch now let me go to and let me name this uh ascii video example and then let me also open i believe i had the one that was just the kitten um and this is the uh ascii kitten let's just make sure this is the right one right here's the ascii kin no computational mama first of all computational mama you might have what is possibly the best youtube username on the entire internet thank you for joining the coding train what you get is your very own random number i lost my random number book what do i do without my random number book come and join the discord we will get you your random number um uh assigned to you um and i know it's been some of you especially those of you who are at the um conductor level um ascii fractal flame is a brilliant idea um those of you who are at the conductor level have been waiting possibly uh up to at least two years for your custom train whistle that is next that is the num one of the the number one priorities to get to the bot the discord bot generating the random walk patterns was the first step uh jason hegland uh who makes all the merchandise designs and does all the coding train illustrated characters has been setting up with a laser etcher in uh in the support organ department um and so all of that is coming edge detection and the slashes is a wonderful uh next step so what was it that i was supposed to look at that was stig suggestion um ascii art andreas something like this um um i don't know if this is the right let's look at these two links under creativeapplications.net o is not a letter it's a circle uh is this what i'm looking for whatever this is it's going to be amazing whoa what is this even that's very loud cool uh digital art ascii and i should have jason browser race live coding playground stunning imagers with text okay i think this is what i'm looking for whoa okay interesting density oh look this is another set of characters i could use in reverse order just very very briefly let's go to think of all you could do with just like you can make a whole game now this way let's just try out of curiosity this and now i'm going to change this from txt to and i want to make sure i give credit to this um where is this uh from there and so now instead of getting it from txt it's from density now this is with it um density so that's interesting to see now this is inverted um so i could actually say density.length down to zero which would do it the other way around and then my instinct is to add a bunch of spaces but just to kind of like you know kind of doing what i did before just to sort of threshold it so we can see there's you know again the image that you pick how you choose to have this array of brightness characters i um is is pretty um interesting to think about but here's just like another another list of characters um awesome so all right so uh edge detection is exactly what i want to do um thank you everybody for tuning in thank you for the two new members did i paste this example into the into discord i did not so kitten i would love if any of you uh take this and do anything with it share it with me i would like to turn this into an actual um coding challenge video maybe i can refer to some of these other um artworks i do have to go it is 1 15. um there will be at least one more lot well there will be at least two more live streams in may because one will be and i can tell you the date of it the itp um let's look um let's go to itp.nyu.edu show um i will be doing in the evening of may 18th a live stream of the show itself it's all an online show so you shouldn't tune into the live stream you should actually just go and participate in the show itself let me put this link also in uh discord if you want to take a look at it um but there will be a live stream there will also be at least one more of these friday live streams in may um where i will be continuing to sort of get myself organized for the summer of coding challenges differentiate the rgb channel and use color text that is a great idea um sarvagya is asking about the holiday pins so all the holiday pins were sent out there were a couple that got returned because of address issues um and i believe that we've been in touch with you if that was the case but um send a message to the um to the moderation team on discord or write an email to merch at thecodingtrain.com if you were one of the holiday pin folks and there's an issue and you didn't get it so i do want to make sure everybody got their holiday pins a digit clock is a great idea so many possibilities thank you for tuning in um let me just play this goodbye song here while i have five percent of uh ipad battery left um and i will answer any questions that i see in the next uh two and a half minutes while i close out some of these links um let's see i'm looking to see if there's any questions um please make sure that you um take a look at the computer mouse conference um all the archives of all the talks and you could watch obviously the video the computer mouse video that i made on the coding train channel itself uh there's a little trolling going on asking me to prove the riemann hypothesis that won't be happening in the next uh what two minutes of this stream um how do you find the algorithm for any coding challenges challenge says coding with 3dv well not to be a i i am reminded now that i should give a quick thank you to the uh sponsor of today's live stream but brilliant.org codingtrain it's a wonderful interactive a website of lessons in education materials that you can sign up for and find a lot of algorithms to explore but another thing that i would highly recommend is something called the algorithm archive which is a project by um james schloss or there's a youtube channel lee ios leo s um and actually um um yeah there's this is just a wonderful collection of different kinds of algorithms with written texts and explanations this is just an amazing project so oh um and maybe um some of these computational geometry algorithms uh could be quite useful for this ascii art idea as well does itb have any international student program exchange so you should contact itp.inquiries i believe at nyu.edu i think that the address is on the website um there's lots of programs there's lots of international students there's a summer camp that you can actually join that's all online that's very reasonably priced so um but yeah contact the department directly um for that would you ever consider making a larger collaborative project yeah i consider all wonderful ideas thank you for that oh this is uh signing off now thank you for tuning in um see you next time on the coding train i really appreciate all of you uh goodbye as always i always forget that this dot this stock is this dot i'm going to do this this star this dot this star to this dot song never forget the this dot i'm going to say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids the kittens kittens and the kittens the kittens the kittens kids kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot there other bye everybody have a wonderful weekend see you soon
