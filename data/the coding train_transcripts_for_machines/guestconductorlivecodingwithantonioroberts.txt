so good morning this is a quick audio check uh let me know how my audio is um you're also hearing some music in the background we will be starting in about three or four minutes um and today is a very special uh live stream of the coding train with a guest antonio roberts i encourage you to read all about antonio in the video description right now if you want to learn more and we'll be back i'll be back in just a few minutes to say a more proper hello do do do do hi everyone we'll begin in about two minutes so one of these days i will have a countdown timer that appears in the preshow animation but not today as always hello good afternoon everyone welcome to the coding train now whenever i have a guest video i always feel more ridiculous about using the train whistle because i feel like i'm revealing something about myself even though i do it all the time and all of the people who are watching now watch but i know that there's a really wonderful person waiting in the wings to come and present today so i feel a little conscious selfconscious okay um i want to get i know that i tend to do a lot of rambling at the top um and you know if i'm doing a coding session on the coding train it'll be like 45 minutes before i actually get started with anything but i just want to so i want to try to get started with the main content of today's live stream as soon as possible at the same time i want to make sure that everything is working okay that you can kind of hear me and see me and and all of that stuff so um so how is it how's it going um so while i'm waiting to hear any quick messages in the chat um let me quickly just give you set some expectations for today so this will be um somewhere in the range of one hour to 90 minutes one to one and a half hours so here i see myself in all my preview places okay everything's fine people will tell me if the stream went down it's so strange um um so the bulk of today's live stream will be a guest a presentation from antonio roberts as well as a recording of a live coding performance that i am so excited to play for you um uh you'll be able to watch that performance afterwards we'll have a link to just that video alone as well um and um well so that is going to be the bulk of the time today and um so there'll be a presentation a lot a recording of a live performance and then a little time for q a afterwards um how's everything going everybody says my my discord chat is so quiet i just see no messages at all which makes me a little worried but i'm pretty sure everything is fine like myself uh sound is good says coding my life uh lizzie says hello cat food is this the lizzy that's going to make an appearance um uh it is that's very exciting oh okay everybody's here i gotta get moving let me switch over to start doing some introductions um oh actually so this is what i want to say a little coding train news uh breaking news it's not breaking news a little coding train news um just before i begin i i have to play this weird sound effect okay um so um there i have a backlog of about 10 to 15 video tutorials that are currently being edited and produced all of those are from the nature of code series and they will all be coming out over the next few weeks um live streams from today for about three weeks are going on hiatus so you won't see any live streams from me until mid april so i just wanted to let everybody know that but stay tuned to future coding training that's going to be you know it's possible that we'll have like one uh uh oh i muted the breaking news sound effect darn i forgot it's okay it's fine uh nobody i heard that in my ears and it was just delightful um but um so stay tuned stay tuned to the channel there's going to be lots of new tutorials coming out over the next few weeks but what are we here for today let me get back um to minimizing this and i'm going to switch over to um my laptop view here um and um so this is antonio roberts's website um please check it out but i also wanted to say um in addition to um the guest presentation that we're having today today's live streams is a fundraiser for a wonderful organization um called um coders of color so coders of color is an organization aimed at empowering and enabling young underrepresented people of color to pursue a career in tech by providing them with a safe space for them to learn explore and grow so they do this primarily by running free coding workshops for young people it's an organization that i have been following online through twitter they're based in the uk they have a very handson approach to support they believe that all their attendees should leave each of the events with the ability to do something new and they are there for them if further support is required so far coders of color has supported over 750 young people through workshops and programs out of the young people they have supported some have continued studies in computer science up to undergraduate level and others have secured their first job in tech with their help and support so um um they're currently um donating spare laptops to young people in need of them across the uk they've also had requests from people based in new orleans and here in the united states morocco and nigeria if you're based in any of these cities or countries and have a spare laptop please reach out um all the the links to the coders of color website um and their twitter account or the where you can see get in touch here is um is all there so antonio's um going to speak a little bit more about coders of color and and and his relationship to them um later in his presentation as well i just want to point you to the fundraiser that we set up um for this fundraiser page for this particular live stream now ordinarily i love to try to integrate the fundraising with youtube's builtin giving network but they're a ukbased organization so i wasn't able to do that but you can donate through this page your name will pop up here at the bottom i'm just gonna refresh if you're uh if you make a donation i'll come back to hopefully thank you at the end of the live stream um i did notice i wasn't able to disable the youtube super chat feature so i would like to say like um that super chat feature i would encourage you to donate um to coders of color through this website that's my preferred uh advice to you and i see we already got another ten dollar attempt sorry ten pound i'm very uh us focused here ten pound donation since i last started speaking which uh is from anonymous thank you anonymous you're one of my favorite people anonymous uh so thank you for that donation that's wonderful already to see one coming through but i will um if you so don't use necessarily the super chat feature but i guess if you do um i will uh uh assuming that i assume that i can do this in my analytics go back and look at all the super chats that were uh done during this live stream and i will um read i will redonate that money uh through the fundraiser uh myself so um but um so this is this page all right um so uh now i am very excited to introduce to you it says here that i'm talking look at this the talking daniel schiffman but soon in a moment um antonio's gonna be talking um let me read this um let me go back to his website and read a short introduction for you and i i'm really i just want to say like i'm so excited about this because and by the way i know you can hear my children screaming in the background there's nothing i can do about that sorry sorry everyone quiet down down there soon i get to mute myself um so i live coding has been something that i've never done myself but it's something that i've followed and experienced the algo rave scene different new environments for live coding coding in terms of performance it's really exciting and an engaging way to express yourself and use the tools of coding and so i've always wanted to be able to help provide the coding trained audience with some information about live coding and so i'm really thrilled that antonio is here to do that so antonio roberts is an artist and create a curator based in birmingham uk he's coming all the way from the uk uh today uh working primarily with video code and sound he is critically engaged with the themes surrounding network culture and in his practice explores how technology continues to shape ideas of creation ownership and authorship as a performing visual artist and musician he utilizes live coding techniques to demystify technology and reveal its design decisions limitations and creative potential so andonia has shown at many galleries and festivals all of which are listed in the video's description he's curated a lot of exhibitions and projects also listed in this exhibition but i would encourage you there's links to his website instagram twitter youtube vimeo soundcloud and github all also in the video subscription so you can check out um all of those so i'm gonna awkwardly now attempt to transition over to antonio um you know i'm i'm i'm i'm getting better at this every single time in terms of like figuring out all of the logistics like technology for live streaming but in case there's an audio glitch of antonio's muted or i pressed the wrong button to play the wrong video at the wrong time you know blame me please send your vent your frustrations to i should set up like complaints at thecodingtrain.com it's not an email that exists yet but right after today i will set that up so first i'm gonna um antonio you're about to appear let me actually just i'm gonna unmute antonio say hello hello so hopefully everybody just heard antonio's voice i am now moving over to you're seeing antonio's slides here and i'm going to click this button which should bring up his video he's waving i'm going to make that a little bit larger and i'm also going to um uh turn on the uh live captioning that i have here hooked up through um zoom system so we have some live captions for antonio's um presentation there are also live captions through uh youtube itself but um i find that these um captions are a little bit higher quality okay uh hi antonia how are you how did i do with my introduction that was great thank you this is uh it's always weird hearing my own biography set back at me i'm like did i do all those things um yeah i'm doing great and it's really an honor to be here and yeah i'm looking forward to talking to you at you at the internet and seeing what happens wonderful so um the next step for this is i'm going to make myself disappear in the bottom left corner here and mute my audio um and let you take it away i just want to say to the audience that we will have a little time like maybe 10 to 15 minutes for q a after if you want to write your questions in the chat i am going to i have a little notebook here and a pencil if you can if you if you know about this kind of fancy technology i'm going to try to make a note of um some of the questions i see that psy coding train community manager is also in the chat and so let me just click a little button here to add moderator um so psy and other coding train um discord members can help uh collect any questions and repost those um in the live chat and i'll come back and ask those at the end so um i think we could get started take it away antonio yay brilliant thanks very much for all that hey all right so um where do i start so today and so firstly my name as said is antonia roberts and i'm an also an artist and curator i'm in the uk in a city called birmingham and i do a lot of things within my practice um you've heard that long list but today really i want to focus on how artists and musicians are using programming to make art and music and through live coding so firstly just a little bit about who i am myself if you want to go check out my work here's my website hellocatfood.com uh because i like cats and you can i occasionally write blog posts about my work uh tutorials and all of that stuff so please do check that out so for the last 10 or so years i've been making primarily digital video artworks and that look a little bit like this these are some screenshots from them and these are exhibited and in places like galleries they're streamed online they're projected on to the size of buildings occasionally and and the way that i make all of these artworks are using mostly open source tools and tools that you might expect from a digital artist so your 3d modeling software video editors and image editors and what have you but um one thing that i do which a i guess a grown number of people are doing especially those who are watching this channel is i'm using um programming to make my artwork so um this here is the screenshot of some code that i wrote in a programming language called image magic and this this is available on my github by the way and this particular piece of this particular script um makes very nice kind of glitchy patterns based on jpeg compression and they look a bit like this and when you run the script each time it generates a new static image file that looks a bit glitchy like this and when you run it the output of it is um like a still image but depending on how you set it up you can also like see and the image being made like through all the silver images and it looks a little bit like this so you can see like it gets glitchier and glitchier so you know and that's just a very small um script without comments it's probably only like 30 lines um when i wrote this many years ago um another small script which i um you have made recently in fact was this script to basically make wavy glitchy looking gifs so if you every time you run it it generates a random wavy looking gif um which i pretty much like um and you know these um scripts they have several uses sometimes the programming that i use in my artwork is the artwork in itself so the results of it are exhibited just from whatever the program may uh makes or sometimes um the these images these gifs are used as like part of a wider larger piece um but yeah so yeah that's kind of like what i do my work there but i also have a performative practice i am a live performer and what i'm doing which is where the live coding comes into it is that um i'm using programming live on stage to make artwork in a process called surprisingly live coding and we do just live coding primarily at events called algorithes so what's an algorithm well the algorithm name the word is a portmanteau a combination of two different words algorithm and rave put them together you get algorithm and algorithms are parties where people uh dance to music and visuals primarily made with algorithms programming and uh yeah they they look a little bit like this so here's a few pictures of people performing uh with their laptops um at different events these are mostly ones around the uk because that's where i'm i live that's where i'm based so yeah just these are a few pictures i'll explain a little bit what's happening in some of these as well uh as we get forward but first just wanna show you what they what's happening uh so yeah that's what they look like are still pictures but maybe you wanna see uh what they look like and maybe you wanna see and hear what one of them sounds like so maybe we could have the first video which is a video of uh the uh an algorithm that happened at the british library in the uk cool so that and in that video you saw myself and my friend sean carter all performing in a library which you know there's another place to do but there you go that's what happens uh the next video is an example of a live stream featuring lizzie who i think is in the chat so lizzy goes by the name digital cell so we'll see a live stream of her now um the next video um i'll show you is a performance by myself and a collaborator mario vitek we perform under the name bad circulation and this performance is from iclc conference happened two years ago cool and uh the next video is from alfalfa i hope i pronounced that right he's a parisbased musician and this is another example of a live stream and for the last video i want to show you a video of alex mclean and matthew matthew yee king performing under the name knute cool thanks for showing those videos for controlling that then um so hopefully from all those videos you saw that like there's a range of things that can be done with algorithms we definitely have a lot of live streams happening um for many years uh you see people collaborating with people using different instruments different hardware technology and so it's quite a versatile practice and incorporates many different things um so as i've mentioned there have been a lot of algorithms all over the world of course i'm based in the uk so those are the ones i know most but um just wanted to share with you a few posters from ones that happen in different places so you have here excuse me on the left we performed at south by southwest a couple of years ago um and then on the right there's a very um vibrant live coding scene in new york city uh so this is a person with one of their events uh again on the left here's an event that happened in birmingham in the uk which i organized and on the right a another recent live stream which had all of these artists we've actually done many live streams recently where sometimes it lasted a week long and you know you can you can have 24 hours of live coding seven days a week it's great and on the left again we have another live stream which happened on a cyber yacht uh yep yachts exist in cyberspace uh and on the right so you know you can see the date of this algorithm was actually 2015. so this is you know we've been partying for a while now um and then the last set of processes i'll show you an event that happened on the in new york on the left and a big festival that happened in sheffield in the uk uh on variety so yeah we we have performed all over the place and places that i haven't even mentioned here um so cable so you hopefully you've now kind of got a bit of an idea of what an algorithm looks like what it sounds like um but i just want to talk a little bit more about what happens at an algorithm and a very important part of um algorithms is to share your screen is to show what it is you're doing and so and this is usually done as you can see here like for a projector you can see and the code that the person is writing being projected behind them or somewhere else in the room and i think doing this has three effects and three important things that happen that kind of affects the performance and potentially the audience i think firstly showing the code helps to build a connection with the audience that's watching so um if you think back for example if you've ever seen gone to a a concert where there's a an electronic musician performing using a laptop right so they're on the stage with a laptop and really all you can see is like the back of their laptop and you know don't get me wrong when people are performing when electronic musicians are performing with like midi controllers with their laptops and so on there's definitely a skill to that that's like something that takes years of training to to perfect and so you know those musicians deserve respect but it's unfortunate that as you you as an audience member can't really appreciate and appreciate what they're doing because you know it's behind the laptop it's behind the screen and so some of that connection is lost a little bit if you compare it to say like percussive instruments like a drum or if you think of a guitar as well even if you don't understand how to play guitar or how to play drums at least when you see um you know the drummer hit the drum or the guitar strum you can see that in in them manipulating their instrument and then playing it differently different sounds occur so you you build that sort of connection to what's happening and um by showing the code even if you don't understand the code you know not everyone here is a programmer at least when you see a person writing some code you can see like other changed uh the instrument from like a bass drum to a an electronic drum or something at least when you see the code changing you can go you can also hear what's happening at the same time so it helps to build sources like that um relationship with the audience and show and show exactly what's happening behind the computer so the second effect that it does um is more like i guess a social commentary i don't believe that i like what i think and it helps to demystify how computers are working or at least demystify how art and music are made of computers if you look in the popular media today or you know over the last several years especially when it comes to things like artificial intelligence and machine learning there's there's always there's always this like kind of um idea that uh rogue our rooms are gonna take over the world and it's gonna be like terminated too and you know it's gonna gonna take over um and you know but that kind of thinking i think kind of forget it it forgets that behind all of this computing there's a human there's a human that made it and there's a human that understands how it's working and we can we if we're able if we're able to like you know rip apart the black box of the computer if we can understand it as well and so you know and by again with algorithms and live coding through showing this codes through showing how um a performance unfolds and changes we can hopefully learn that you know these computers that we have that we own are things which we can understand they are living up where they are within our comprehension yeah so and with that actually so with it being within your comprehension you probably now want to learn a little bit about what light of what where to learn live coding what tools do you have what what what tools am i using what tools are other people using so you could you could uh go on the internet and look for this there's and what you might find is a really massive long list of different software so this is just one screenshot from the awesome live coding uh github page which lists um a lot of different live coding languages ones for um you know all different operating systems down from the web and yeah they come in various flavors you might be a person who likes python you might be doing haskell c plus plus javascript you know there's going to be um most of these software are open source as well so um yeah most of them are and um yeah so no matter what kind of programming language you're familiar with there's probably gonna be a live coding language for visuals or music just to suit your tastes um but yeah you this list as i said this is only a screenshot of the list so you'll see like i don't know how it is on there but i'm going to say around 50. um so i've got i've picked out um and made of some videos showing uh some of the live coding tools which i've come across over my like five years of live coding so i think the ones that i'll show first will be music focused um live coding tools so i guess yeah could we have the first one which should be tidal cycles video please cool so so that programming language that you saw there at least with the blue text that's a programming language called tidal cycles which is created by axel mclean who's also the guy who i'm calling the term algorithm and it's a programming language based in haskell for um kind of it's for programming patterns of music he does a better explanation of it than i do and you also saw me vera actually as well that was a um recording from a performance that we did last year um but yeah so the main text the blue text was tidal cycles so that's one programming language which you might see quite a lot of the next programming language is quite different actually in how it operates and this one is called orca and it's made by a group called hundred rabbits so if orca please so great so yeah that that one is quite different in how it operates and it can produce some awesome things so yeah please check out orca if you want to learn a completely different way and the language of making uh life coding music so the last one which i'll show you at least for the audio side of things is a programming language called supercollider and this programming language dates back to i think 1996 and it's used by quite a lot of people and it's more based around i think c plus plus or maybe it's just c so in this video you're going to see a musician called shelly knots from a performance demonstrating how it works so if you could have sheddy not playing superglider please cool so yeah so that's super collider um which is used actually in quite a lot of different software so like tidal cycles uses it for example as it's like sound engine but yeah um so if if you fancy yourself to be a c programmer don't wanna wanna learn that then yeah so please do so these are only just three of the um audio live coding software that's available there's so much more but i want to move on to showing you some of the visual side of things so i primarily when i've been at live coding events i've been making visuals um i've only recently like last two three years moved into music but yeah there's also just as much live coding software for visuals and uh yeah so australia's movement uh the first one i want to show you is um a piece of software called hydra and this is made by olivia jack so if you could have hydro please oh sorry yeah before you go to that video i just want to say um there is audio in these videos but the audio wasn't made by the software but i just put the audio in to kind of like help the demonstration so yeah here we have hydra by olivia jack foreign thank you for that and uh what i really like about hydra is that it's very like textural kind of video synthesis almost reminds me a lot of like hardware video synthesizers so and that um yeah that's browserbased but you can also download which you can use for both audio and for visuals and software called pure data i use it primarily for my visuals because and some of my music because it's how i like to work if you if you ever use something like max msp the interface will be familiar to you but um yeah so let's have pure data then next please cool so yeah pure data i i like how chaotic it all looks um it works like my brain works so it's all quite messy but um yeah so i use pure data and then the last one i want to show you is software called improvise written by a friend of mine guy john and yeah this one it's the syntax is based a little bit on um or it's similar to processing um if you ever use that um but you know it's it's good it's a good piece of software so yeah that's how we improvise then please so those are just um in fact that's why i just say that code um that came from a workshop that i did one of the participants made that code so i can't claim to have made about them coding myself but yeah so hopefully from from that those three videos you see that you know each one of them has sort of like a very different approach to coding the visuals and even the ones before that you know the different approaches to coding music so you know there's something for everyone hopefully um whether that's browserbased desktopbased whether you want to like just create noise or something rhythmic or something structure structured there's going to be things so now you've seen what algorithms look like you've seen what tools we're using um how we're using them where do you go to learn it okay so you've already seen that there's um this live coding them github list which is quite long i'd say um go on to the project websites a lot of them have good documentation and so you can you know learn about um how to how they work and even like learn about live coding as a practice through those websites but i'd say one good resource is going to be the top lap website so that's topblap.org and top lap is like a loosely held organization that just kind of promotes live coding and talks about it so if you go to this website there'll be links to the various different communities that are um that are talking about live coding whether that be local um regional whatever uh there will be research papers because you know this is something which uh academics are researching and talking about in that way so yeah research papers events all of that will be on the top website and that's like a good first start to then find um other people uh then well so that's just like an internet site but one thing you might want to do and especially like when we're actually allowed to kind of like meet people is see if there's any local groups in your area you know i'm based in birmingham in the uk and you know i often find myself traveling to visit other local groups and some of them so on the top website you'll see that in your forward slash nodes uh you know groups or nodes you'll see that there's um groups all over the world of course this presentation has largely had a uk bias because that's where i am but you know have a look at this list already like there's been there there's or there's a live coding groups berlin bogota there's uh north mexico montreal um yorkshire um yeah so wherever you um there might and it might just be a few people it might be a whole group have a whole building but you know go look and see if there's other people who are just um who have the same interest where and hopefully that'll be a better way to learn from you because i find personally myself i learn better when i'm with other people um and also you might want to do is look for workshops especially again once we're able to meet in person but also online i've run plenty of workshops in how to do live coding of visuals friends of mine have done live coding music workshops online and in person and you know they and the people who make the software are often also delivering these workshops and pers and so and they always try and make it as approachable and friendly as possible and working with different skill levels so like myself personally i've taught workshops to you know children as young as five like this photo here this is me and tate britain teaching live coding visuals to well yeah he had like a room full of like 20 kids it somehow worked but yes you know to talk to talk um children as young as that with with their parents and then of course as dan mentioned earlier i also taught taught live coding at coders of color and and i like i really appreciate the work that they're doing and sort of like helping the digital divide and introducing more people of color to programming and showing them that it's something that they can do and yeah so when i was there i taught them how to um do live visuals and demonstrated how um live coding music works and you know hopefully just made it a bit more approachable to show them one of the different creative uses of programming because of course you know as dan does you teach people to kind of get over that hurdle of it being incredibly difficult so yeah and codes of color i i fully support them in what they're doing and uh yeah and then i guess the the last way to and sorry if if all of this has been interesting to you has been of interest and i really hope it has go to an algorithm see if there's no grave happening of course in person they're not really happening just yet but we do live streams pretty much all the time in fact i'm actually performing in like two hours at an event which uh yeah i like to keep busy so you know we we're live streaming and performing all the time and we're always looking for new people to perform you know we we like to break down these hierarchies so like there's not really like just kind of like pro level of um live coders we're all just people really messing around with code and making some some weird music and some weird visuals so yeah and i'm gonna stop there and basically say you know thank you for listening to all that i've been saying and if you want to check out my work these are my links and to check out what i do how i make it occasionally i post tutorials or just snippets of what it is i'm making but again just get involved with the community of people um and hopefully see you on the dance floor uh yeah so if you want to as well stick around till um well in a moment i'll be showing you sharing a video that i made uh performance live coding performance i made specifically for this event and just to say about them i i used tidal cycles for the music and i used pure data for the visuals i wasn't doing both at the same time by the way i don't have like i'm not that good but i stitch it together afterwards so yeah um stick around to watch the video it's about 10 minutes long and i'll be i can be here for questions afterwards but yeah thanks for listening watching and i also try and jump in the chat thanks yeah thank you so much antonio so don't don't leave like this might seem like we're wrapping up but actually we we're saving the best part for right now well all that was terrific it's all equally wonderful but i'm very excited um you know um antonio obviously does this live and i would love to find out the information maybe we can share it about where you're performing in a couple hours of people who want more can tune in but based on the way that i have my setup here it i think would be give you a higher quality experience we had antonio sort of record a performance especially just for this coding train live stream and i'm gonna press a button in open broadcast studio which will play back that recording for you so i've taken like a couple questions down but i mean please just sit back and enjoy the performance but also now's a great time if you have a question or two you want to ask you can pop it into the chat i'll be keeping an eye on that and we'll have just a short you know 10 or 10 minute or so q a with antonio afterwards as well as information for you how you can watch the performance hopefully later today okay so i'm going to um as soon as i press this button it's off and running it's about a 10 minute performance enjoy and we'll circle back afterwards sorry i'm finding the button i found it here it comes me so so so great so so do so so all right i think we are back thank you so much for that wonderful uh performance it's interesting i experienced it all silently because the way i have my setup here i don't have i'm not monitoring the audio so i can't wait to go back and watch it uh later uh with the actual audio to get a sense of how that fits in and just to let everyone know um you know that antonio is posting that video itself as a separate standalone upload and we'll put a link to it in the chat and um uh in the video description or in the comment all the places where things would go along this video you'll find a link to that if you're looking for it oh this is so nice i see so many handclapping emojis in the chat because the chat is like 30 seconds behind me so i'm saying that i'm going to give my own uh oh and i can i can do a like a zoom uh hand clap reaction that's i don't know it didn't show up anywhere okay um so um thank you everybody for all the nice comments in the chat thank you so much for ant to antonio for the uh presentation performance we have a little bit of time um we want to give antonio a little time to rest before his performance later and um uh i um i will um share a link to that as well in a moment but i collected some great questions during and thank you to the coding trained moderators and members of the discord who helped capture some of these questions um that i'd love to if you have a few minutes antonio ask some of them to you great okay so let's see where to start actually so i'm going to start with this question from kevin um which reads are you listening to the music as you code do you take the music as inspiration for the code or are they two standalone parts that come together as separate pieces cool yeah that's a good question um yeah i'm definitely listening to the music for inspiration uh you know i like being on stage with a musician you are responding to what they're doing and and when when the music is really fun thing and like big beats then you what you want that to be reflected in uh the visuals of course because i'm coding all of it in real time like there's a certain i can't respond that quickly sometimes to very sudden changes in music but because of the nature of algorithm in that algorithm music tends to build slowly over time it means i can build my visuals and react to them also quite sturdy over time as well but yeah definitely always listen to their music like even making this video as well like i made the music first and then i played the music back and build the visuals as i was listening and you know just you what you can see me coding frantically typing yeah there's actually a kind of related question about that too from stig which is just sort of about um the feedback loop have you ever thought of it as a feedback loop where the music is sort of affecting the visuals and then it sort of goes back to the music does that kind of structure ever uh emerge or selfregulate or is that um mostly the is that something you've ever considered or thought about yeah so there's definitely like some form of feedback loop because um just through like through familiarity with like when i'm performing with another person for example you know we just know each other after performing together for so long so like i know what they're doing they know what i'm doing so we're just feeding off each other in that way and of course you can on technical level as well send one person's code to another person's computer and have like those two things affecting each other i do i haven't done that that much because obviously it's kind of a complex setup but yeah you can totally on a so on a like kind of relational relationship level you can have feedback loops and then also on a on a technical sending date as usual you can do the same and i've done both right you know it's interesting to me to think about this whole discussion because live coding as a performance is not something i've ever done but on some level what i'm doing constantly on this youtube channel is live coding not as a performance not in real time with music and visuals but try to live code to teach an example or to work out a problem and i guess what's interesting to me about the sort of socalled creative coding and working with processing in p5 is how unlike maybe in more traditional software development where as a programmer might be given a spec sheet and write software to sort of conform to that spec sheet so much of the practice of creative coding is kind of wandering and improvisation and so i guess i'm curious like to what extent do you rehearse or plan in advance and to what extent do you improvise and just let the live coding performance kind of take you wherever it may go oh it's a bit of both really so yeah so four performances like even this video like i this the the videos watch was based off of was based off a sketch that i made uh just over a year ago and so i knew i was going to do that but then that sketch was only like a 10second loop so i had to kind of like improvise how to like build it in and then sometimes just like oh let me change the number let me just change one of these numbers and see what happens and i remember um alex mclean said this in the presentation that like if you make a mistake and when you change some of the code just let it play four times and then you've got a beat i really like that because it's just like okay just see where it takes you and just let it ride out for a bit and see if you like it so yeah um i think and i remember i've also compared it to kind of like um jazz as well at least you know free form jazz you have you or even if not just like in in different types of music you have you know your different scales of music and people will just improvise within that scale so definitely when i'm when i'm performing that there is a uh structure there is an idea and then i'm just kind of like improvising within the idea and seeing what happens and sometimes it's great sometimes it's noisy sometimes it's good noisy but hopefully people stick around to listen to it yeah i think just the way you're describing it and thinking about the practice of jazz music and what's required to sort of like learn to play jazz to practice for a concert and yet to still improvise um is is a really apt um kind of analogy there so that's great thank you for that um um looking through there's a lot of questions that uh that i might sort of like try to combine into one um which really i think all touch on i think the sort of theme of getting started with live coding so there's a question about like you know uh where to showcase um your creation so i would imagine like if i'm a new coder and i want to try live coding like where could i first do it uh try to do a performance as well as i mean you touched on quite a bit this in your presentation but there's some sort of questions about like oh what do you have any recommended tutorials for pure data or some of the other things that you're using so i guess that's i will kind of collect all those into one question which is uh and i guess i'm asking this because i have lots of answers to people are asking the question of where do i begin to learn coding which i think is different from where do i begin to learn the practice of live coding as performance or experiment with it in the same way like a standup comedian might go to some like you know comedy clubs to like try out a set and that kind of thing yeah so like you know one answer would be uh go on youtube but then as i think i alluded to it in in my presentation it's better to learn from other people so on the top black website topblock.org there's also a a chat thing it's not a discord but like this is a kind of like it's a bit like slack so that's chats.hoplap.org and in there there's like different sub forms for each of the different languages and people just kind of like talk and share like what they're doing and as i said people are very friendly a lot of the discussions have now moved on to like separate discord channels so from there you can find links to it because you know discord urls are really long but um you know so you can uh so i'll say you know the top laptop is just kind of like a good place to meet the other people and yeah just just the nature of live coding is that you have to share your code so if you see someone's code copy it paste it change it and see if you like it you know and and and that's that's really a good thing about it about the universe there's no kind of secrecy so one so once you and and and people will help you people if you ask questions people will help you they are quite funny just because again there's not that secrecy so yeah if you go into that black chat then from there you might be pointed into the direction of a particular forum for a particular piece of software but yeah and then just copy and paste some code and see what happens great yeah in a moment i'm gonna um kind of switch out of the zoom and go show some urls like of the performance that you're doing later today so maybe i can pull up the it's top lap like toplap yeah yeah so maybe we can pull that up and just look at it briefly um so oh and thank you to um soren who just posted a link to chat.toplap.org in the chat so people can check that out um so thanks everyone to the questions i guess i have a kind of like wrap up question which is uh to literally tie things a little bit back to the coding train i guess or like the stuff that i work on so i'm trying to think about um and i know that there was a comment i think from stig who sort of said you could you can make an argument that uh you know sort of going along with the sort of in the vein of like what i'm doing in sort of like live coding tutorials is also a performance and some to some extent but i guess i'm curious have you ever uh this was asked by one of the viewers um have you used p5 or processing and i guess though since those languages aren't really sort of like realtime coding environments it's more about write the code run the code edit run again you know have you ever used those tools and how did the i'm just trying to think about if you have any ideas about how to transition from some of the creative coding tools that i use and the viewers use into live coding i know you mentioned one like has a very similar kind of like syntax to processing i don't remember which one that was but yeah but that tool was uh there's uh it's called improvise right yeah so yeah i have to use processing i don't use it that much um not for any particular reason uh and when i do use i'm usually using it like kind of on the desktop for some of my graphic design stuff which you know goes into a prerecorded video or something so yeah so so i haven't used it for live coding there is actually an artist called ted davis did has created like a p5 live coding yes we talked about this the other day yes that's right yes so you know that is possible to do that uh but then yeah certainly you i guess it's when it comes to like can you and the comment that you the person made about like everything as a performance yeah it's just like the the performative way of doing it like having being aware of there being an audience and that you're you know demonstrating your thing and you're doing it for whatever purpose so like you know of course you're doing it for the educational purpose i'm doing it to try and get everyone moving and dancing and it's just like um but then but then also yeah just just um being aware of it so then you're you're you're typing how you're doing it becomes more intentional so you might have seen in the video of my performance but there were times when i was just like not typing just letting it rest for a second so let's because you know i'm aware that people sort of absorb in the music for a second uh and so like i'm very intentional of what i'm doing um yeah so that's how so i think yeah that's why in some ways wonderful uh all right thank you for taking the time to answer a lot of these questions um i just want to so uh there's a comment in the chat saying praxis live i've never heard of that but might be of interest and i i have i am familiar with the p5 live but i got it just escaped me for a moment there so that's hopefully something that i can take a look at and maybe explore in a future video or a future live stream here so i'm going to switch in a moment we're wrapping up and i'm going to switch to show you some of the urls and especially if you're interested in catching um antonio's performance later but i just again want to highlight um if you have more questions or want to learn more about antonio's work we've got hellocatfood.com hello cat food on all the different social media twitter instagram and soundcloud so please feel free to engage and follow and all that stuff there um i'm not entirely sure what's gonna happen right now because i'm going to stay in the meeting the way you are but i'm going to use my like four finger scroll to go back to my browser i guess i could you know what i'm going to do i'm going to go to my own camera view just in case i messed something up uh now here i go okay so now i'm in a browser with um antonio still on zoom here in the corner so i'm going to go back to here so just want to sort of wrap up by showing you a few last links of things that we've talked about as well as um remind you about the coders of color fundraiser and sort of um thank anybody who's been able to donate um during this live stream um okay so ah so this is antoni i don't know that you can see what i'm showing but i'm on that um spacestudios.org dot uk page that you showed me ah friday march 19th 6 30 gmt so that's like isn't that like in an hour that is correct okay we really got to let you go you need a break um no i'm performing i i personally am performing a bit later okay so i'm kind of sitting in front of it so i'm going to remove myself for a second here but you can see here art and tech residency artist algorithm closing party so if you liked this live stream you can see here's the other four uh performing artists in a bit more of a description definitely if somebody could um add a link to this in the chat that would be great otherwise i will certainly try to like add it to the video description after i sign off or put it as a comment or something like that so um there's that um i i just curious to open up very quickly uh toplap.org just to like show people it like to oh wait maybe i top log good thing that is not an actual url because i just wait what is it is it toplapp.org yeah yeah top lap i'm always afraid of opening something while i'm live streaming that i don't know why i'm not yeah i understand great so this is the top lap website so which is i guess um just to show everyone and i'm going to take a look at it a bit more later as a place where if you're new to the live coding scene there's a chat there nodes discussion forum all the things that antonio mentioned um i also just want to remind everyone that we're using this opportunity to raise money for the coders of color fundraiser and phew we definitely had some more donations uh since the beginning of the live stream which is great i always worry and wonder um cody train is making a donation um as part of this stream as well um please look at the codersofcolor.org website especially i would say uh um if you're in the uk new orleans i'm looking for the notes that i took about some of these cities also where they're looking for laptop donations um let me pull this up again uh new orleans morocco and nigeria as well as across the uk um if you have a laptop to donate you can get in touch with coders of color through the get in touch link on their website and um let me just go down here to thank um some of our donors who donated kevin and tom and nick and anonymous and joseph uh thank you like uh uh a bunch of train whistle uh this is who i am i don't know what else how else to be on the internet i i like having somebody just like uh oh i'm hanging out and like uh laughing at my really uh uh embarrassing moments here i think antonio you have to continue to join me in my live stream i'll just put you in a little box in the corner um but yes this is really great um this um this donation um uh page will be up um i think uh at least for the next uh month of course you can always donate to coders of color um later as well but we would love to um encourage you to donate so um with all of that i think that wraps things up for today um and coders of color is there in the chat is there as i kind of like um stall for a bit coders of color if there's anything that i missed that you wanted to say about your organization or any sort of like call to action that you want to mention um please write that in the chat and then i will speak it out so while i'm waiting to see if coders of color has anything else to say um let me just um kind of while i have a captive audience here for a moment again um live streams for the coding train are going to be on hiatus for about a month um and um during that time i will be working on editing and finalizing lots and lots of videos from the nature of code series so that's what's coming out so please stay tuned to that um i always want to encourage you to share your contributions um for this is the pi day video that i recently released and if i go to that page there's a place for you to add versions that you make so i want to encourage you to do that um as always and then i also just want to do a quick plug for the if if everyone will allow me for the computer mouse conference um and i spelled that wrong computer mouse conference 2021 one of the things i'll be doing over the next month is uh working on a video for this particular conference and it has an incredible um i'm looking for the names of all the speakers um psy psyx who is the producer of this guest conductor series um they'll also be um speaking or performing i think maybe at the conference so um put this onto your calendar if you're looking for more interesting live coding adjacent related content so let me look uh here i don't see uh oh i see twirling tech goddess is also in the chat uh uh shout out to twirling tech goddess who was the uh guest conductor uh uh before my again i've mentioned my goal is to have a once a month a guest video or live stream um featured on the coding train um and actually oh i buried the lead here with the computer mouse conference the coding trend will be hosting a live stream which is a performance and zine uh by um neda bomani and that in in some ways whether that's a guest conductor thing or not i have no idea but that's going to be happening on the coding train also in a month in parallel with the conference so um stay tuned for that i'm just checking out the chat um i think that's all of the messages i have to say antonio do you have any last words you don't have to but anything you want to say but i forgot about your work or oh or anything that you want i'm just going to pull up the page for your performance again for this evening yeah i don't think i really have much more to say again just please thank you all for for um for watching i have looked at messages in the chat um i'd say if you have the questions for me find me on twitter um and also please do come for the performance and um yeah thanks thanks to you dan thanks to the audience and uh yeah thank you wonderful okay so i'm going to uh uh i just really need to tell everybody exactly what i'm doing because i'm very afraid of pressing the wrong button i'm going to switch to a sort of outro video put on some music the chat um the youtube chat will be open for another minute or two and tony i should let you know that the way that i've hooked everything up uh you you'll want to mute yourself because the outro music is also in this sort of laptop feed with your audio um but we can we'll catch up and chat with each other you can also leave the zoom meeting anytime you want uh but um just because i i you know i would love to chat and follow up with you um just to sort of like uh also get any feedback about how this was for you okay oh please share the link for the performance in the chat can i make that happen um well i'll do that i'm going to be on the easier time doing that once i'm playing the outro video because i can go on to my laptop and move things around so i will paste the link to this performance that you're seeing right here if somebody doesn't get to it before me um as we go okay goodbye everybody um thank you for tuning in thank you to antonio ask more questions to antonio on twitter at hello cat food um check out codersofcolor.org and the link to the chuff.org fundraiser if you have the ability to make a donation or even if you just want to get in touch with the organization to offer your support in other ways i'm sure they would love to hear from you okay um goodbye everybody and this is the ending francello asks i'm so sorry for angelo is this starting or ending i got some good news bad news bad news is it's ending good news is as soon as it stops you can go back and rewatch the whole thing so see you all later uh i am pressing the buttons goodbye as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop stop i just stopped this dot never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me take it with me it's the polaroid song unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids kids the kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens the kittens and kittens and kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects what else is there unicorns of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and
