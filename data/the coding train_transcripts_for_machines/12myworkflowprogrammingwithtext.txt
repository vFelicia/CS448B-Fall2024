hello welcome to this video in this video I just want to do a short quick tutorial about my workflow for the tutorial videos that you're about to watch as part of this programming from A to Z playlist but also I use this workflow in a lot of my other videos and coding challenges and I'm sure my workflow will change at some point in the future but this is relevant for the time period then it's relevant so let me just come over here and make a short list of some things that I'm using so one thing is you want to make sure if you want to use my exact workflow there are lots of other workflows you want to install something called nodejs and then you want to install and I'm going to show you how to do this a node package called HTTP server this runs a little local web server on your computer that hosts the HTML CSS and JavaScript files that you're programming and working with so that you can see them you know of course you can just double click them and open them in the browser but if you run an actual web server on your computer you're going to mirror the real situation when eventually publish your files to a web server somewhere so I use those I also need a text editor to edit your code and edit the JavaScript files the HTML files all that sort of stuff I'm using a text editor called atom and with this text editor I'm using a package called I think it's called atom a links to all these things will be in this video's description so if I get the name wrong Adam beautify so that's an that's something that I just like that Auto indents my code and that sort of thing and then I should also mention that there are a bunch of I believe there's something called atom live server and there are other packages in adamant will run the server for you that you can use instead of HTTP server if you prefer I should also mention that I'm working with p5.js libraries so you'll see that all of my projects have a bunch of extra javascript files associated with them they come from p5.js and p5.js and eventually soon I a camp later this month if you're watching this in September 2016 there will be a web editor that you can use with a p5 GS for developing sketches and ideas that go along with this course as well and at some point when that is released I'll demonstrate that in a video as well I should also mention that there are lots of other wonderful code editors you can use online code pen is one that I've used it has a wonderful professor mode which allows you to type code and that your students see on their screens the code that you're typing in realtime jsfiddle thimble and I don't know why I can't think of other good ones that I'm forgetting now whoo so I apologize if you make a wonderful code editor online that I'm not thinking of so this is the workflow I'm using let me demonstrate it for you rather quickly you write him over here uh and okay so Adam is something you should download from with Adam dot IO I've already downloaded it so I'm just going to run it here it is a oh it's already opening something so let's when you open it it'll probably look more like this an empty thing I could do command and I have a new file and I can type stuff into it so it's just a text editor any text editor will do oh yes install my update I guess what's gonna happen everything's gonna break oh please work okay so okay so this is Adam that's what it looks like packages you can install you can see here this is this beautiful package that I'm using and I'm also using something called Adam key mapping so I set it to beautify to be to command T which is my preference shortcut so maybe I could cover that in another video or a link to how to set up key mappings and Adam in this video's description and you can also see there I do I have the live server somewhere a live server here so you can see this is a live server package which will also start a live server you can install how do you install Adam packages uh I forget uh window I was going to say preferences uh packages yes so and maybe I could timeout pause oh yes no nevermind keep going install so here's a place that I can that you can search for packages or find featured packages to install and add things to Adam okay so then now the other thing you want to install is a node which I'm good which you can find at node s org you can download install node and then from terminal though you can from terminal you can use something called NPM which stands for node package manager and you want to type NPM HTTP oops HTTP server this is installing the web server that I'm using but you can't just install HTTP server you need to say g4 global meaning you're making this a global package which means you can just access it instead of being a packages for one project it's just accessible on your computer until the end of time basically or do you understand node and if you do that you also probably want to say sudo because you might need sudo as a way of saying I'm the administrator of this computer I have permission to install something globally and if I hit enter it's going to ask me for my password and then I already installed it so I don't know what just happened there but oh I said to hold the wrong command Cantera Lee hope you're not npm install HTTP server and now it's going to install it so it's installing it and once I've done that I can I'm running a web server in a bunch of other directories I'm going to stop that I can just anywhere I am on the computer I can just say HTTP server and I can run a web server now where do you want to run the web server from probably from a directory where you have a project that you're working on like I have this load text project I can CD to that directory I can say HTTP server and then I can go to the browser with this particular URL which is just the local host of my computer one 27.0 0.1 colon 8080 and hopes I can go back to the browser and I can paste that URL in and you can see oops refreshed there's the project it was you can see there's nothing there because there's no code in that project but if I were to add some code to that project you would see this project displayed in the page now one other thing i think that i thought of that i wanted to mention about this which i have now completely forgotten oh yes if you don't like port 8080 you can also one thing i'll mention to you is you can say HTTP server p and i can make up a port like what's my favorite number 1 2 3 4 maybe i should of intact i'm going to be higher port numbers are better that you don't mess up something that's already running on your computer so I'm going to say 80 81 and you can see now I'm running that same server on 80 81 so you can't run multiple web servers on the same port but if you need to run multiple web servers on the same time you can use different ports ok so that's a quick just little ditty on my workflow I'm sure I missed something or you have questions about it which you can ask in the comments and now you're ready to go and watch the video tutorials or actually make some stuff using this workflow ok thanks you
