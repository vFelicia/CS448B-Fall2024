okay okay uh good morning or I don't know it's probably not morning for you but it is for me good morning here in this strange place that I am uh okay so um some somehow you found your way here and you're watching this video and um uh I've never done this before I sort of have done this before but I haven't done it in a while and I certainly haven't done it with this new fangled setup that makes that where I'm sort of floating in this strange white space um so uh but babbling is probably not what I should do it's a little it's it's not not it's not the best way to start okay so my name is Daniel nobody ever calls me that though uh you could call me Dan schiffman Dan schiffman any variation of of of those uh I teach at a place called ITP and I'm teaching a class uh in two days uh called the nature of code where we look at programming simulations of natural systems and we use this thing called processing to do so so uh for this year for this semester I'm planning hoping uh and and and and and really really uh thinking about and and I'm going to do it because I'm doing it already right now uh recording a series of videos about uh the topics in the course and the students are going to watch these videos I'm also going to meet with the students answer questions something's going to happen with me and the students in the classroom but these are videos now these videos anybody can watch maybe not cuz I I might never want anyone to watch them but if you are watching them then I guess I did let somebody watch this video so what what what I'm you can skip now you can just turn this one off and go to the next one you probably have already but what what I what I'm going to do in this short video which I've already been going for two minutes I want to try to limit this one this one will be a little bit longer I want my videos to be only about 5 to 7 minutes each this one might be more like 10 to 15 minutes although I might just shut it off at any moment uh I want to introduce the entire course so I want to kind of talk about what are all the topics we're going to look at go through them quickly and look at a few um examples so uh if you're wondering though let's say you came to this video and you have never seen it you have no idea why you're here and what's going on I'm going to give you even a little bit more of an introduction I'm going to demonstrate oh first of all I have this cup of tea which is sitting over here there's a table I'm in a room by the way it's strange cuz I'm by myself talking to a camera I hope the audio is working otherwise we're going to have to throw this one away and there's a cup of tea here and I I don't want to skill it so I'm going to just for a moment move it over here okay it's it's fine everything's fine nobody worry okay and now I'm gonna um I'm gonna do something I'm gonna walk over here over there is another part of the room and I'm going to hit this button and now I'm over here and I I strangely am floating in front of a a a processing window but this is actually just my computer right in front of me here I can lean over and kind of move this screen around um but I can look at it and talk about this so we're going to be looking at some code here but um first let me just open up a browser so okay so this is ITP if you don't know what ITP is I'm in a room walled off there's sort of a window to the hallway there it's kind of strange somebody might knock and we could say hi to them um but I'm uh this is ITP if you're interested in ITP it's a twoyear graduate program we do all sorts of stuff here um you can take a look at the website it. n.edu uh I also want to show you processing processing is the open source like I'm reading this is the open source programming language and environment for people who want to create etc etc etc it's what I'm going to use to demonstrate all these examples this however is not a beginner video series if you've never programmed before you should watch my other video series called I don't know learning processing which doesn't actually exist sort of does there's some draft videos hopefully I'll get to those and publish them as well it's free uh I wanted to say only 9.95 but it's actually just free I it doesn't exist but maybe it'll be free anyway so you should download processing you should take a look there are all sorts of great if you're you know there's a bunch of tutorials here uh you can find a bunch of great books this is uh a really I'm going to duck down underneath this one over here is a really great one to get started with because it's called getting started with processing hopefully I didn't mess up the audio um I would recommend it there's lots of places you can get started with processing now if you're looking for more material text based material to follow along these videos with you can go to the nature code.com wow this is like some weird sales video I going to stop this so this website um you can get the book this book will go along with all these videos um you can also uh get the PDF for free um the book is also just uh if I scroll down here uh and click here um you can see um who and if I shrink it a little bit you can see here's a um table of contents behind me um and you can read the material for the book online as well so there's lots of resources you can get um uh if you're interested in this material that I'm going to just talk about for uh five minute videos over the five minutes and 30 seconds we're pretty good okay so where are we going to start here though uh what is the thing that we're beginning with okay so programming natural systems in processing well one of the things you first do when programming in processing is one of the things you first learn how to do is move a circle across the screen if I had prepared for this I would have an example of a circle moving across the screen to show you right now but I'm just winging it and you can imagine what that would be but um so let's talk about what that is so if you um one of the first things you learn to do is say this xals x + 1 you have some circle you are Circle you're drawing on the screen that's that's what everybody does they make circles on the screen and it has an XY location and it when you say xal X+ 1 if you put that in processing's draw Loop Loop right draw over and over and over again looping looping looping it goes up by one it goes up by one it goes up by one we see it here when we see it here then we see it here the illusion of motion is created that's one of the things you learn maybe if you took an intro processing class if you read one of those books if you looked at the website one of the first topics we're going to do in this I don't know what to call this video series this this this television set program show I don't know anyway uh um is uh learn to formalize that and learn to form it using everything's okay just just dro the cap Oops I did it again I did it again okay is using vectors okay topic number one vectors vectors is nothing other than what you've been doing already you have an arrow it sort of says move this from here what is a vector we're going to look at all that we're going to formalize our understanding of motion into vectors which is allow us going to understand an object's location on the screen as a position which has velocity and perhaps even whoa acceleration which is going to be very exciting the key right there I said this word acceleration acceleration is a vector you can think of oh I accelerate a car might it going faster is it going slower am I turning it what's the next step there well if you uh ever took a physics class which I think I might have there's something that's going to trip me here this is kind of hanging there on the floor don't I'm not going to Spill the te with it okay everything's okay if I spill the te I'll pause the video um okay if you ever took a physics class you might have learned something about Newton's law there's this law Force equals mass time acceleration well you can see there's a relationship between acceleration and force and one of the things we want to do is look at modeling forces we're going to look at modeling forces this is our sort of first simulation of the natural world does that even make sense right there is physics in our world so we're going to begin our simulations of natural systems by looking at essentially custom building our own physics engine you know we're not going to to build a fully fledged super awesome amazing bells and whistles Collision detection crazy physics engine we're going to look at basic physics moving options moving objects around the screen with vectors understanding how forces in the environment can affect their motion well why don't we just walk over here for a moment excuse me and just see what I mean by that I'm going to just um I'm going to just look at a couple examples as we're doing this um so if we want to think about forces one thing here's a nice little uh demon rtion haven't I should have run some of these beforehand but um yeah I'd like to make the size of this bigger but um you can see here that we have some objects falling they experience gravity they hit this liquid they experience some sort of resistance drag liquid resistance air resistance friction like thing viscosity there's all sorts of words there we could use there's formulas we're going to get into all that and see how we can model that in code okay so um where were we I lost my pen it's over here uh forces so you know once we look at the basics of motion we have something moving it has a velocity has acceleration we might want to think also about angular motion how what happens when things spin oscillate all sorts of other types of motion related to trigonometry so we're going to spend a few videos looking at oscillating uh oscillation oscillating motion angular motion anything really that has to do with angles and trigonometry if you wanted to know about s cosine tangent review those topics see how they apply in code see how you can make things spin uh move back and forth think of a guitar string plucking a plucking think of plucking a guitar string do you pluck a guitar string I guess you pluck it anyway or a spring bouncing back and forth we're going to look at all that stuff with oscillation I really hope this is working otherwise this is just good practice I'll just do it again I'll probably have to do this again anyway so we're going to look at that oscillation and um I could go pull up an example but you can imagine that for right now the fourth topic on our list particle systems so essentially we're spending all this time understanding the basics of physics building a physics engine how do we formalize understanding of moving things around the screen to really create Dynamic and exciting animations of motion once we get through that we're all that time we're going to be saying look at our little circle woo it's moving the circle is moving around the screen once we get through all that we're going to say Hey what if we want to make lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of those circles so really uh week four week four video four video 12 who knows what video it will be on week four of semester whatever this topic number four particle systems is going to be all about understanding how to take a single entity that's moving around the screen how to model a single particle within a system of particles and there's lots of topics that will go with that we're going to spend time really diving into the array list which is a Java class that we'll want to use in processing to manage large numbers of objects we're going to spend time looking at uh Advanced objectoriented programming inheritance and polymorphism um polymorphism meaning many forms uh I don't I really need to write this down here because can you even see that you can't see that right because this is it doesn't exist over here I just move over here and I'm gone but there's a room a whole room it's like a physical place that we are that I'm in by myself with some lights and there's a computer over here okay so um it's probably distracting to talk about that okay um getting used to this okay number five particle systems okay uh well okay so I'm gonna maybe move over to the computer in a moment we'll look at some more examples but number five here's the thing what have we done here we spent all this time kind of figuring out how to make a physics engine but you be aware physics engines exist already there are plenty of examples we're going to look at two we're going to look at something called box 2D and we're going to also look at something called toxic Libs and in particular the verlet physics uh package of toxic livs and both of these libraries you know there's you know there are times in life where you just want to make like your circle move around the screen and change some pretty color and like you just that's what you want to do this afternoon you don't really need to pour through box 2D documentation classes figure it out download a library just for that there are times in life where you have these really complicated strangely shaped jaggedy polygons and you want them to all bounce off of each other yeah that's when you need something like box 2D toxic Libs is another it's fantastic Suite of libraries that does so many things but we really want to look at it for I'm getting my phone is vibrating over there with the timer on it it's like a teer ing on the edge about to fall off of where it's standing but I was saying toxic Libs um toxic Libs is uh really great for um doing a connected systems where you have lots and lots of elements all connected together through spring connections you can model cloth string uh Jellyfish all sorts of great things with toxic lips and we'll see some examples of that um just to show you what I mean by box2d I'm going to come over here for a second and I have a very bad feeling so this is what happens when you don't prepare um uh um I don't have the library installed I'm just going to keep going you can see examples of that this video is going on for way too long anyway I'm going to redo it I'm going to upload it if the people can watch it but I'm definitely goingon to have to redo this video because this is just practice okay so you can think of this as kind of part one of a semester maybe in a in a semester if you were taking a class which you're not or maybe you are um something called like a midterm would come here because the first half nature of code part one so to speak is really dedicated to this idea of modeling physics um because we need a core set of building blocks to start with if what we're ultimately looking to do is is uh think about complex systems systems of many elements that have intelligence or limited intelligence or perception of their environment that when they come together achieve some sort of goal or exhibit the property of emergence or evolve or devel have like the brain with connections we want to start looking at all these other Advanced topics um we need a set of building blocks and this physics engine will become our set of building blocks when we look at um all these other topics which I'm about to kind of just rattle off and list um we're going to use the this these these uh examples of modeling motion to um to use them I kind of there's another one here six I don't know maybe six should go up here I'm not really sure uh steering forces definitely going to open up some of these examples to show them to you so so this I think is one of my personal favorites that makes any sense this's a reason why these videos should only be 5 to 7 minutes long because I've already been going for 15 minutes and I I don't know I feel like I wouldn't want to watch this anymore and I'm I don't want to watch any of it because I don't want to look at myself but um okay but it's too late I'm doing this we're gonna um go through the rest of these topics and and you can um skip ahead to the next video that's you don't have to watch this so but if you like it you could just keep watching um fast forward with your click do you have a clicker um okay so um steering forces here's the thing an important thing that I didn't mention about all of this one through five is we are dealing with this scenario let's here's a scenario for you there is a table there is a circle a ball some sort of little soccer ball beach ball basketball sitting on the edge of this table and oh gust of wind blows and the the the circle just sort of pushes off and falls down and bounces and hits a wall and bounces up right that's we're modeling a physics engine there's collisions there's forces there's all sorts of stuff happening let's consider this scenario there is a ball here but it has a little antenna and little tiny feet can you see that you see my beautiful little alien drawing what if this ball living ball chooses and there's a giant Predator here H big teeth and it's going it's coming at this little alien I'm totally losing my mind I was going at this little alien it chooses to leap off and go this way so there's a very different thing between an inanimate object just sitting there in the world responding to forces and this entity that has life that has desires that's hopes and dreams and fears and goals and wants to make a choice something it could do so uh we want to start looking at that this type of model and the way we're going to do that is through the lens of steering behaviors um there's a great book called vehicles by brenberg um which I refer to in my materials I'll talk about later in a video there's the work of Craig Reynolds um who developed all these steering behaviors for autonomous characters for animations um uh that we're going to look at but we want to say what does it mean for an entity to make a choice to seek a Target to flee from a Target to to to to follow a path in a crowd to flock like a flock of birds to swarm like a collection of bees swarming how do we have an entity do that and we're going to do that by understanding how to calculate steering forces the major difference there is that this ball has no understanding of its environment this alien has a perception of an environment it can see that there's an evil Predator coming at it and it can see that there's nothing down here and it needs to jump to get off of there so um just to for a moment to look at some of these examples what I'm what I'm talking about here is under agents um if I just go really quickly to uh I think a nice demonstration of this is a crowd path following which I will open up very briefly and run it so we want to get all the way to understanding systems like this so you can see here there are a lot of little circles and they have they they have only two they're only two principles by which they live principle number one follow the path so we have to understand how do we Define a path how do we have something follow a path principle number two do not Bang into my neighbor I just want to I just want to have my own physical space I don't like anybody getting too close I just that that's the two principles separation path following so we want to look at what are these steering behaviors and how do we model these forces seeking fleeing arriving wandering path following wall hugging obstacle avoidance etc etc then how do we combine them when we combine them we can get complexity and that is really the key to where we're going in the nature of code I kind of want to say I don't know I'm going to say it in like a scary voice but that do that wouldn't make any sense I need sound to effects be really good to have sound effects of buttons all here I can press those sound effects no okay so uh so that's where we're going so this is really part one part two we can think of as complexity and because I'm already going on for way too long um we we talked about combining steering forces simple local interactions of autonomous agents making all sorts of crazy emergent phenomena happen we're going to look at flocking uh we're going to look also at cellular automata which I'm sure I said incorrectly and maybe I'll learn how to pronounce that um before we get there which is uh a complex system where instead of the elements are moving around they're sitting uh on a grid so what does it mean to have a a system of simple elements with local interactions on a grid and how could that really be linked to all this motion stuff that we've been doing so far um we're going to look at fractal patterns fractal systems how do we design a fractal that's really actually a set of elements moving with vectors could we do that uh and then that's really part two BO I'm just racing through it now and then we're going to get all the way to part three which I'm going to call intelligence and we are going to look at um uh two really uh look my phone must have buzzed again it's really about to fall that's not a good place for it mental not to self don't just rest the phone on top of the camera uh during while making the video okay we're going to look at evolution and modeling evolution in software I'm going to set something running over here uh an examp all this is always going to tie to motion and animation so if we go down here to the genetic algorithm examples and I'm actually just going to click on this one evolve flow field I think this one has a bug in it so it actually might crash but um let's run this for a second oh I didn't press the button I'm just talking okay so um here we are and um you can see here oh there's all these entities almost look like flies just like scattering out in the wind these entities have DNA to them they're they're in they have some sort of principles encoded into them that is their DNA and how they do their DNA gets passed on to a Next Generation uh through through a natural selection algorithm they start the the better ones prop the better ones what's a better one it's trying to get to there this target so they're learning how to go around the obstacles they're learning how to find this path through the system through a process of evolution so we want to look at okay we learned how to make a complex system we'll come back and see how they're doing in a second we learned how to make a complex system like a flocking system how could we actually give those systems the the the elements of those systems make them into a population and have them evolve hooray and then uh the very last topic we'll look at although maybe I don't really I don't really like this topic I don't know if I really understand it but I did write some stuff and make some examples so I guess I'll go through those but um we're going to look at neural networks so what does it mean mean to actually not only put DNA into this animated thing that we put on the screen but actually put a brain into it as well and and and is there something about the human brain the way that the human brain works that we might model in software to some sort of interesting effect let's go take a let's take a look at our friends now it's like a cooking show like we you put them in the oven and now we're going to come back check on them right no it's not we're not cooking okay uh let's take a look here and we can see that they are they've gotten quite further along you can see um they've actually learned to get around most of the obstacles it doesn't look like they've made it to the end yet so um this was my introduction uh I have a feeling I'm going to just walk back over here U that didn't work um I have a feeling that I will probably rerecord this video maybe I should make it into smaller Snippets I actually would like to show you example projects of things that people have made with a lot of these topics which I think in a starting video would make sense to kind of get a uh just see get your ideas flowing but um this is a list of stuff that I'm going to go through these videos will never be this long long again this was kind of just practice I wanted to just get this out there I have a list if I could turn the camera I'm out of focus I know anyway but if we could turn the camera over here I have a list of all the videos I want to make for the first day of class um and there's about one two three four five six seven of them they'll be about five minutes each or almost 10 minutes each or somewhere around an hour of content and my goal is to have a place where you can watch them a place where you can ask questions about them a place where you can interact with the code live on the page there's all sorts of possibilities so um that is the plan I think there's a button now that I go to press and I turn this off right I goodbye I enjoyed this awkward pause come over here
