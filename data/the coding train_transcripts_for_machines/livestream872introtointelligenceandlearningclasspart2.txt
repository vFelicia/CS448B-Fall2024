oh ho I'm back I wearing a microphone yes okay I think you know I think's going on here someone is some mystical force of the universe is looking at me and saying oh machine learning like to me this is what felt like happening I was about to say I'm going to unlock all of the mysteries and wonder of machine learning and so I think someone is I think it was like literally saved by the bell there so today is really I have to apologize to all of you viewers now things are really quite messed up for me in terms of my schedule I I was streaming for about seven minutes oops this camera's not on and I think it was over here talking about kind of machine learning in the broad sense and the thing that I was about to do was transition over to my syllabus and start to talk about why I have some of these topics here in the first week and then I was going to show you some examples of those and just kind of give you a landscape of stuff that I plan to start next week and then the fire alarm went off there was no fire as far as I know in fact I really don't even want to admit this but I have to be I have to be true I have to be honest the fire alarm was actually in the building next door so technically speaking the floor that I'm on it's two buildings that are a joint you can walk between the buildings or say hallway but technically the fire alarm was the building next door now it's quite loud and I could hear it you could probably hear it too and so I thought I should leave and you know on my way out I was just stopping by the fourth floor to just sort of check and see if people were leaving there too maybe I'd go out and grab some lunch with some folks and then ones just sitting around with their desks cuz there's no fire going off because I'm on that floor can't there is no walkway between the two buildings so I got confused so maybe the fire alarm is over and I came back upstairs I'm still going off some people said oh you don't have to leave because it's the building next door I don't know then I it was a really loud fire alarm so I'm not gonna just sit around and do this live stream when this fire alarm is going off you know if a fire is in the building next door I think it's still kind of a problem so then I went out for a little bit and and then I got caught in a couple conversations I was maybe to get something to eat which I didn't do so I don't know some time passed and I came back and the fire alarm is not going off anymore and everybody's in this building so it seems like things are okay unfortunately what that has done to my schedule is that you know I was I was hoping to leave about now or a half an hour from now and you know and I don't really have the flexibility right now to first of all so I eaten something but I have a lunch appointment to go to and so I like my energy and my brain is a little bit melted so I'm trying to think I've let's say I'm gonna be here for 15 or 30 minutes let's look let's let me finish up what I was saying about machine learning and which is that and and I probably shouldn't do this because if I'm gonna do any look let me finish up my that thought from before because it's in my head so one of the I know what I was doing when the fire alarm went off oh I think I made the fire alarm go off by doing this let's see if I can do it again cuz here's the thing this is I don't understand these things really but but I'm gonna try to teach them and there's all this new research and I go in I read these web pages of my eyes glaze over and they were all into the back of my head and then I you know I start to get this like pain in my side and the feels like this like this like uncomfortable feeling in my chest you know reading all these papers and stuff about neural networks but oh I said it did the fire is there something going on I feel like when I said neural network had caused the fire to come off it was saving me but this is one of the core this is certainly one of the things that I get asked about the most oh can you do a neural network coding challenge can you explain how a neural network works and I do actually I'm joking around to some extent because I do have some examples already about this idea of this thing called a perceptron which I will build and program from scratch when we get to this week but one of the things about a neural network is and I'm looking for my I'm kind of a little out of whack here where is my eraser here it is so one way of thinking about a neural network is inputs and outputs maybe there are some inputs like maybe there are four inputs like maybe we are going to send in some information about a flower what color is it how many petals how tall does it grow no kind of thing these are sort of values that we're going to send into the neural network and then there might be some output which is or multiple outputs which you know the probability of it being a certain kind of flower whether it's the sunflower or a daisy or a lily whatever kind of flower you might think about and then in between there are all these things that are you know these inputs and then there's neurons and there's information goes here then it goes here then maybe it goes here and it goes here it goes here there's this interconnected web of neurons the information flows this is called a feedforward Network because the information is flowing through it feedforward and all this math happens in here so at some point I'm going to come back and look at this more closely and look at the different pieces of some of the calculations that happen in here and what kinds of things you can feed in what kinds of things you can pull out but the thing that I thought would be useful is kind of like a warmup to the course is looking at graph graph systems so for example a kind of classic computer science algorithm is something called a binary search tree which I could draw like this and the arrows are entirely necessary because it's not anyway so you get the idea of this idea of a tree with a root node that has two children that each have two children a left and right binary because it only has a left and a right you could you know I did some videos on the traveling salesperson problem a while back where maybe you have a bunch of cities and you have to figure out what is the most efficient path to you know make it through all the cities that's the shortest this is also a graph system what if you had a subway map and you want to get from this station to this station and there are all these different possible lines and all these other possible stations and they're all interconnected in strange ways how would you find the shortest or the route that takes the least amount of time I looked at something called a star which is an algorithm for looking at a graph and sort of solving your way through the graph there's Dijkstra's algorithm I hope I'm pronouncing that correctly there's breadthfirst search and depthfirst search so this is where and I wanted to start as a warmup because these are network based there's two reasons one is these are network based systems and if we can program these systems it's going to give us some clues to what kind of concepts we'll need to program a neural network you know replace the subway map with input and output neurons and neurons and connections all in between that's item number one the item number two the reason number two is that I had wrote this word called illusion I think this might be it for me everybody no longer is thinking about things in a way that makes sense that I can explain it's about illusion correctly I guess spelling isn't the worst thing to get wrong I ll us IO n pretty sure that's right this kind of illusion of intelligence so what if you think about some of my examples about autonomous agents you have this vehicle that's moving around the screen maybe it's seeking a target what if it learns to traverse a binary tree or what if it learns the try the almost efficient solution to the traveling salesperson problem so can we create this appearance of software simulated creatures that move about a two or three dimensional space and that are in any other neural network might be a good way to train it to like not hit obstacles and this is something called there's a technique called reinforcement learning and cue acute learning algorithm that I hope to look at later but even just in a sort of basic way what if we had a lot of nodes and the agency to steer around those nodes so this is kind of where I'm starting the chat and see if anybody is listening to me okay so I so I think I'm just going to talk about this briefly so I'm gonna clone this repo and I've started doing some work on some simple examples let me go to terminal here and we go to the desktop and git clone so for those of you who might not be familiar with github github is a website where you can store repositories of information most people use it to store repositories of source code and cloning is the act of downloading the information from github and I could have just I could have just gone here to do download zip or there's also like a desktop application but I'm gonna use the command line to paste the URL for this repo and then I'm going to go into the repo and I am going to open the repo in Adam so I can look at some of the code and I'm also going to run oops I'm going to what's that command okay maybe that's it command K clears the terminal my whole life has now changed I'm going to run a local server and let's take a look at some of the examples so this is the stuff I'm going to do some of these as coding challenges and been working on these examples this week I haven't gotten very far but for example let me just a lot of these are wrong there's mistakes in them but let me look at this for a second oh so this is this is actually Oh where's my crop so this is actually a JavaScript version of an example from this book called rocking algorithms an illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people by Aditya our Bhargava and so my slack chat is disconnected I don't know why it is sorry everybody in slack I that computer's disconnected so if you're listening so this this particular scenario is a doing a search to find let me let me actually there is a look at this this computer lost its internet connection I'm gonna have to deal with that in a little bit a second okay so if I go to the code for a second and I go to this one what I've done in this particular example I'm going to come back and actually program some of these next week as coding challenges or sooner the next week if I can and these names are I'm using these names because I want to emphasize that this particular the code doesn't come from this book but I wrote the code while reading the chapter of this book even though I have some mistakes in the code that I've since realized so ok so I'm only looking at the YouTube chat right now just for everybody's reference so okay so what you can see here is that I'm creating a bunch of notes you Bob Alice Claire uh nourish so these are nodes like this you Bob Claire right and then these nodes have various connections for example I can connect myself to Alice Bob and Claire so if I come back you know what I really need is I need a data set of Kevin Bacon movies that's what I need for this so U is B is connected to Claire it's connected to Alice I can't remember if I was connected to Bob but you get the idea here maybe Bob is connected to a new and I'm connected to Bob and inertia is connected to so named Tom and Claire is connected to Tom so the idea here is let's say this was a social network and these connections were whether your friends on Facebook or you follow each other on Twitter how could you find the degrees of separation how could you find the shortest path if each step is one step and we could plainly see if I want to get from myself to Tom here that the shortest path is you me I should just write me me declare to time I could get there by going from me to Bob to an urge to Tom but the shortest path this only requires two steps so the this is that business you know in my mind in the broadest sense artificial intelligence a computer algorithm is solving a problem in an intelligent manner to come up with some optimal solution and so this is where the class is going to start this also has the has the advantage of a couple things one is there some interesting visual outcomes nap spaces maze spaces that steering ages can move around and the example that I'm using is using breadthfirst search although I think I might have had an error in the code and might have made it more depth first search by accident so I'm gonna look at all this stuff and this is what I'm coming back next week to don't get more closely okay let's see all right so that's one example here's another let's look at some of these other examples and this by the way that one thing that's okay so anybody wants to come by the way first of all I would be thrilled for the world that's out there watching to contribute to this repository so these examples are in progress here's a major issue with this example I picked them I'm doing a visualization of all these connections I just put them all at random locations which is kind of terrible like they really should maybe be in some sort of order that would be make it easy to look at and see and I could do a force directed graph that's kind of a big complicated thing but even just kind of having rows so that's that's a little challenge or visualize in a different way if anyone wants to kind of help out with some of these examples let's go this is incorrect I should fix this right now thank you to me I am so me let me try to get this other computer's internet working again maybe it's the NYU turn WiFi off turn WiFi on let's see if that does anything Oh what is the repository called I don't know if anyone can post this into the it came back if anyone could know attorney ins okay so this is the repository Schiffman slash all this nonsense up here screenshot that or someone can post it who can post links in the chat okay so here's something this is called this isn't a demonstration of what's supposed to be breath breadthfirst search trying to get from this Green Dot to this Green Dot and every time i refresh ah there we go it got there it finds in the shortest path the fewest number of steps and which things are connected in this grid or random so we can see it try to solve and it solved that one and we can see this now here's the thing one of the key fundamental pieces of a breadthfirst search is this idea of a queue I've got this queue a line the queue is if I were to demonstrate it with just myself I'm going to queue up to ring the bell yay my turns over so now the next person comes up rings the bell so who the first person in line is the first person who rings the bell and then the last person in line has to wait until they become the first person to line so what what is what it's just like lining up to buy tickets for something which is the opposite of a stack which is this thing that you pile things on and then you pull things off so the last thing in so in a queue the first thing in I could diagram this but anyway the whole point of this it needs a cute let's go look at the source code and I'm gonna go to this one that's BFS grid animate and the algorithm is here in this draw function and look at this it's saying Q dot length is greater than zero node equals Q dot pop now here's the thing I just I I made up a variable called Q because I want it to be a data structure of a cube but what is it actually it's just an array so I didn't actually implement kind of queue data structure and an array I should an array so here's the data structure we want this is the queue right so if I add something to the queue it goes here at the end and if I take something out of the queue then it goes there it's taken from the beginning so pop pull something out push put something at the end but an array in JavaScript if I just use the default if I use push push the push function adds an element to the end and the pop function takes an element off that end but what I want to do is add to the end and put you out here and I believe the correct JavaScript array function wladis shift so let's actually fix that in the algorithm Q dot shift and now let's take a look at what it looks like again there we go this looks much more correct and breadthfirst search so it's trying and see how it's going sort of down and down and checking every possibility eventually it gets there haha so much better okay okay so these are the kinds of things I want to dive into these a bit more deeply next week I'll just show you a couple more examples here's one that I was attempting to while it's running through and let's actually fix the let me go fix it in here also change a pop to shift so this is what I'm talking about let me try to make this bigger with this idea of creating an agent that appears intelligent like it's trying to figure out the path but really it just looks like a cursor going to the like current node so I'm looking for creative possibilities of how do we use some of these algorithms that solve certain problems intelligent way and then visualize them in a creative fashion where the elements on the screen appear to be solving these prop figuring these out on their own it's just asking okay so and then these are from though this is not nothing to see here yet this is something that I did a coding challenge of quite a while ago this is using depthfirst search to create a maze pattern and this is an astar algorithm to solve a path through a maze but this is just not a mazes where the wrong word for this this is just a random grid with some some things being walls if something's not being walls so that's what I want to do is also one of my goals for an example for next week is to have a steering agent move throughout a maze solving it with a star so anybody who wants to help me I am subby is pointing out that I didn't make the the the connections bidirectional which is an issue so anybody who wants to you a couple things you can you could just file a pull request you can do a github issue this is what I hope to have finished and want to say by next week I really mean by Tuesdays when the class meets here at NYU and the next Friday is when I'm coming to do my live session okay so that's kind of other things I'm gonna do is talk about genetic algorithms although I mostly have a lot of videos on that already I have a couple new scenarios in mind that I'm gonna do look at some classification and prediction algorithms neural networks and then some applications of neural networks that are kind of new research in the last few years so if you're not aware neural networks are a concept that was developed in the mid twentieth century I don't know the exact date 40s and 50s and there was a lot of excitement and wonder and amazement at the possibilities what neural networks could do and then Marvin Minsky and other researchers kind of looked at basic simple neural networks in rise there's so many problems they just can't solve for example a simple perceptron cannot solve something called XOR and then that some other research came along to do this other kind of multilayer network blah blah blah but there was a lot of excitement around neural networks but the I guess it's often informally referred to us like the AI winter there wasn't a lot of research that got very far for a long time until quite recently with some of these new advents in deep learning what is deep learning so this is stuff that I want to get into and that's going to come towards more towards the end of the course so I'm getting questions in the chat do you think you'll be back later today for a streaming session or is your schedule pretty much shot until next week so I am going to commit to coming back for at least one hour at some point this afternoon I lost about an hour for that because I lost about an hour with the fire issue and two things that I haven't done right now is I guess I kind of talked about the machine learning syllabus I didn't get to show these examples of work from the community so I want to be able to show those and I wanted to do who I felt like after this sort of crazy week that I've had I wanted to do do some sort of simple and fun coding challenges binary tree I put on there because it's kind of a nice entry point to some of the graph system stuff that I want to do next week but I've always asked for pong and I feel like pong can I bring back bunch of people from the last week have asked me to bring back the timer I think that probably not the core audience of my channel but there's some the casuals who just kind of watched snake video the Purple Rain video I have these two videos that had a timer going and a coding challenge it actually could be done and somewhere between 15 and 30 minutes so I might where is this what's this March 10 thing alka that you keep posting about oh it says March 10th here thank you today is March 17th so I was thinking about doing that so fire day yeah so I'm sorry everybody this has been a bit of a fail for this morning I hope that discussion of neural networks I mean sorry that discussion of machine machine learning that discussion of and I'm very specifically my syllabus it does not say machine learning it does not say AI it just says intelligence and learning so that's my core topic and there's some pieces of it which I hope that we'll be able to program from scratch and understand how it works and some of it will actually be like can we just get the thing to compile and that's kind of Mona be my point of view and I'm this is all new to me I'm slightly terrified but I do enjoy this kind of learning with you as I try stuff on the channel so so that's that so I don't know what time this will be let me look at it now my I would like to say that I'm gonna come back at around two o'clock for one hour that's what I'm sort of hoping to do I guess stay tuned to the livestream page that's a place where I can update the time and I'll also tweet and post a note in the chat all right let me see if I can take five minutes of any just random questions from the chat okay and reading the YouTube chat which we're looking at the slack shot look at these interesting camera went off don't show processing work or is mine just not good enough I don't um so though I take the work from people who are in the patron group which is a slack channel for viewers who have chosen to help fund some of the efforts that I'm doing through patreon calm but I'm happy to show work what kind of hair products I use what kind of I'm happy to show work from other people best way would be to tweet me and I can I can I love to show stuff from processing what time is it where you are it is a 1225 p.m. East Coast time do you ever do stuff other than Jay s such as Python or other web stuff like HTML and CSS I definitely do use HTML and CSS and a lot of my tutorials and but I have not done any tutorials in Python I do have a plan one thing I am thinking about is looking at tensorflow as as a framework to do something to implement some of these machine learning algorithms and tensorflow one way to use tend to flows through Python and I'm thinking about creating a simple Python server that runs the tensorflow stuff and then I can query it from a processing sketch or a p5.js web page to visualize so you know the one hand you don't need that other aspect of it if p5 are processing but that's something anybody wants to help with that I have a couple links I need to find where did I put those out let me find those because I'm gonna open that as an issue so one place that you might also look at is machine learning coding trade let's just see what comes up if I google that look at this fourth link so this is a repository from the community of just a ton a ton of links that are relevant to machine learning and Ida link that I'm looking for right now is oh no it's not here it was the reason why I thought it might be here is because it was a couple links that Patrick Hebron sent to me and Patrick Hebron is actually a researcher here at NYU and has written a book called machine learning for designers which I highly recommend and also has an accompanying webcast so if you want to go watch something about somebody who knows about this stuff go check out Patrick stuff but I'll have to find those I'm gonna add those I'm just gonna make it an issue right now issues oh look at this all these issues already oh I need just signin oh dear pick a username no no I sign in no idea what my password I just did a whole like redo of all my passwords it's all coming from one password I have all done 2step verified on everything now so can somebody for me I'm gonna log in can somebody for me go to Schiffman slash NOC as this repository issues and file an issue that says prepare simple flask server that serves tensorflow data to processing and/or p5 thank you very much I'm looking for any other questions what path did you learn to take what path did you take to learn to code this is from Cody fuller oh and ADA asks book recommendations these are good questions so I've actually I kind of would throw this okay so for a path that I took to learn to code well I'll tell you my first experience with coding was probably I'm trying to guess the year let's see I think it was about somewhere between third and fourth grade this would be like 1981 1982 someone asked a fact chest FAQ fact check I was born in 1973 for those of you who are asking what my age is and so the first computer that I programmed on was an Apple 2 plus and I programmed it basic and I actually did a science fair project on perception where I wrote a basic program to flash things on the screen and like flash a word and leave it on only for a certain amount of time and to test whether people could see it and then type the word back in hey that would be a great coding challenge so it's a redo AHA straight let's do my old third fourth grade science fair project in JavaScript somebody add that to the rainbow topic suggestions they'll come to that this afternoon so but then I don't think I did any programming again until I believe in middle or high school I did some more basic and perhaps some logo and even a little assembly language in like a computer class then I never did any programming again until after I graduated from college at some point I took an evening class on C++ like oh maybe I should try some of that I did not like it at all terrible class I couldn't figure anything out gave that up then in 2001 I came as a student to ITP which is the program where I teach right now and I took a class called introduction to computational media and it was taught using the lingo programming language from Macromedia director and just the sort of interactive animation quality of that kind of hook to be and I rediscovered a lot of my interest in math and science and logic and numbers through programming and the kind of then I found processing sort of range towards prosthetics there so I mostly learn I learned I would say mostly as being an ITP student and I would say the primary way that I learned to program was trying to figure out processing which was a new thing at the time and trying to like write tutorials and stuff and JT Nimoy did a workshop on processing at ITP which was the first time that it came to ITP and where I heard about it and also I mean guitar ooh taught a class at ITP that used processing both before I started using processing at ITP okay okay all right everybody I'm sorry about this botched livestream for today I hope you got something out of it or at least it was nice to see each other it is 1230 I am going to attempt to come back stay tuned at some point for one hour I'm what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna do I'm gonna put up a Twitter poll I don't know which to I don't know I don't know if there maybe I'll just run my spinning this is I gotta figure what am I gonna do in that one hour people maybe I don't know it's not gonna be Chrome extensions look could be actually it could be any of these things so I'm gonna come back and do one or two of these things in an hour later show work from the community and that's that all so uh stay tuned I will release you might have small you guys seeing this live last week but the edited versions are now ready if I go to my youtube channel look I'm live now this I published 19 hours ago the coding challenge 60 4.1 forward kinematics all of the other followups are actually available if you just go to the coding show they're unlisted because I kind of released them one a day but if you go to the coding challenges playlist and go to the bottom you'll see they're all here so if you're looking for something to watch and of interest forward kinematics inverse kinematics inverse kinematics with a fixed point and then multiple tentacle thingamabob errs okay thank you everyone 10minute pong challenge I really like to do that too you know why it would be good because what we can do later is we can make an AI system that plays pong so that I think maybe I'll do that pong challenge can I really do it in ten minutes maybe what I'll even do I was talking about this earlier is I'll do it in processing but then I'll do I'll do it twice I'll do it in processing but they're not doing it in JavaScript but instead of doing it in a canvas I'll use like Dom elements like divs and text boxes and things to like be the be the palm alright thank you everybody ten minutes is probably unrealistic she probably saved twenty minutes that more real especially cuz I talk too much but maybe that's what I'll do this afternoon okay so if you're interested in that apologies for a little bit of the confusion around the machine learning stuff as you see next week I'm gonna look at graph systems I'm looking anybody wants to help me with that just chime in on github open github issues I let's help make those examples great oh boy did I really just say that I in a way that may be very uncomfortable and see you guys okay I'm gonna hit stop now hey I'm back did I actually work somebody said you forgot about the book recommendations does this actually work am i back let's see here book recommendations I don't actually have book recommendations but I just started reading a book called it's by hold on let me go to Amazon this is a book that I'm looking at make your own neural network there is my logged in under my account no I'm not so this is a book that I just got it's I think it's it's if you have Kindle limited it's free it's four dollars for the online version so I'm necessary recommending I'm recommending this in the sense that I've just started reading it maybe I'm like three or four pages in and it looked like what I was looking for something that I could follow that didn't have code and in processing or JavaScript and I could sort of follow it and try to reimplemented sin the book so this I think I'm going to use as a basis so that was one recommendation and the other recommendation I have is under books here ah Patrick Hebron what's this reinforcement learning book you know what I'm going to do is go to the library today did you know that you can go there's this place it's called the library and it's books and you can go find any book you want and take it with you you just have to bring it back later after you've finished it's amazing so maybe I'll go to the library so I would love anybody who has any book recommendations in particular on that are accessible friendly and for machine learning artificial intelligence topics please feel free to add to this repository Cody train / machine learning and then of course there's the classic the other book that I always used as a reference I mean it's got to come up why am i blanking on the authors if I just search for artificial intelligence book it's the seminal book at least how I think of it there's oh yeah there's the end this one artificial intelligence a modern approach Norvig and Russell so this is a book that I often use also as a kind of reference is this someone is saying is this link down this one look it's there maybe there's a different one this one oh yeah this is a book I have looked at this I haven't actually read it yet oh yeah I guess it's just an error I think there's some extra stray characters in that link because this is the book that's also been recommended I should probably you know what the thing is oh this is have a print version yet my issue is I'm a little bit weird I I don't I don't do very well reading books I've on a computer Kindle great print book great but I have trouble reading so this one I think is only available as an ebook in PDF format so I think that's I kind of that was that's why I didn't bother to get out though I guess I could print it out okay sorry now I'm going again and I will see you guys later this afternoon accompany pong let's just celebrate happy Friday and a spring break it's freezing there was like a foot of snow this week thank you Spring Break let's come back with the do palm later today and just have a good time okay and then next we we'll do some harder stuff I don't feel like doing anything hard today maybe god I got to go to lunch okay goodbye now
