so so so do foreign so hello i am testing my microphone i'm going to get started in just a few minutes let me come over here and say hi i don't know how the balance is between my mic that i'm wearing here as well as um the music that's playing but the music is going to go off soon this is a new i'm in a new studio that's the same studio just did some renovations in here i streamed on twitch earlier this week so some of you might have caught that if you didn't though this is the first uh youtube stream i've got a little setup here that i'm gonna work on today we'll see how it goes but i'll talk about that in a minute i'm still getting set up let me just come over here oh do do all right hello everyone uh welcome to a uh coding train live stream ah where is i have all new equipment and new things oh and i forgot to even turn this light on uh i'm using some new fancy uh echo reduction and noise suppression technology which is hopefully making my audio come in loud and clear to you i see some familiar names in the chat of people that i know either in person or online or through the internet and it's just delightful and wonderful to see all of you it makes me so happy i think this is the button i press to fade out that sound so this is a bit of an unusual stream uh mostly to do with this setup that i have over here which is uh i was saying in the coding train discord earlier that it might turn into a sort of like al capone's vault reveal because i have my childhood computer boxed up in boxes around this room uh 19 i don't actually don't know the exact year probably 1982 apple ii plus computer i'm going to attempt to plug all the pieces together and turn it on i have other things i could do if that totally doesn't work but that's my plan for today uh if you are a new viewer uh welcome this is the coding train it is uh what i would like to say is a regular weekly live stream on a youtube thing where there are also uh many different sequenced video tutorials that you could follow along if you've never coded before and would like to learn to code there are also some project videos called coding challenges that are kind of standalone projects that you could follow along and maybe make a creative project be inspired to make a creative project from most of those probably re no i don't say require but uh if you've never coded before you'll want to watch the start learning here i should show you all this because i have a whole computer and everything but anyway i'm just talking how are you all doing how was your friday there was a big storm last night i'm in the hudson valley up uh now i don't know if it really counts as upstate but uh in between new york city and the top of new york state is where i am uh it was a huge storm last night uh trees were flailing and branches were flying the power went off the power went on so i was wondering if the internet and the power would comply today um but it seems like it is i feel like there are important announcements and things i should talk about but i kind of just want to get started um and let me just take i'm just going to take a quick peek at the chat to see if there's any important questions is this the garage yes so i have i'm in a garage it's wonderful to have a space that i i've never had my own space like this before we'll see uh how long it lasts but it's been pretty great um yeah i could talk forever about that but that's where i am i'm going to hopefully do a little bit of a um studio tour kind of video or documentation at some point it's been a while since i've done one of those uh ten print high yeah um uh um let's look at it fasten your seat belt yeah um i uh anand says i fall in love with coding six months ago um it's never too late you know i i mean i didn't start coding well this is good this is appropriate for me to talk about actually so i'm going to come over here uh first of all before i before i start working on the computer i want to show you something i showed this on my twitch stream earlier this week but i have to bring it up again this is uh um a 1964 copy of scientific american uh i did a video coding challenge about this particular prime number pattern often referred to as the prime spiral or the ulam spiral i did not have this magazine but the original when i did the video but i went and ordered it did you know you can order basically any scientific american magazine from the past just just deliver it right to your door i think it was like 20 bucks i mean that's my hardearned coding train adsense money there this is where it's going to people um i mean it's you know we'll talk yeah so many things to talk about let me find this though because um the article i also want to get the one that martin gardner who is an author uh who wrote many different articles about different mathematical uh things um here is the page uh about the cover and then it's going to say page 122. so i want to find the article i really should have i should get my overhead camera set up so i could show you this more um specifically but here uh with a sort of better actually you know what i think if i come over here strangely enough uh whoops wrong button i think this will actually be a better view of this i'm so look over here and see oh it's way too bright but um you can see um the uh article about mathematical games the remarkable lore of prime numbers i'll just read a little bit of this to you from scientific americans 1964 issue march 60 cents for this thing i mean boy that's appreciated well i think i spent 20 bucks on this uh the remarkable lore of prime numbers by martin gardner no branch of number theory is more saturated with mystery and elegance than the study of prime numbers those exasperating unruly integers that refuse to be divided evenly by any integers except themselves and one some problems concerning primes are so simple that a child could understand them and yet so deep and far from solved that many mathematicians now suspect they have no solution perhaps they're undecidable perhaps number theory like quantum mechanics has its own uncertainty principle that makes it necessary in certain areas to abandon exactness for probabilistic formulations okay i could read this all day the other thing that's really amazing about this are the ads uh let's see i think if i i i clearly this is a new setup for me so i haven't really worked this out but um we can come over here and see let's see ah there we go look at these ads uh the remarkable um digital guidance computers use titan ii and titan three nasa saturn one from ibm here two more from hoffman's complete line of cryogenic equipment did you know that the coding train is sponsored by hoffman laboratories inc the complete line of cryogenic equipment no lost transfer hoses flexible sturdy made of highstrength bronze transfers liquid oxygen nitrogen okay okay you get the idea um all right so i wanted to show that to you um i'm still in the market if anybody can find one on the internet this will cost quite a bit more of my hardearned uh coding trained funds uh this is a reprint of my favorite book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal dv it's from the rand corporation anybody out there watching knows where you can i can find an original print please let me know um all right uh hello uh chat folks okay um so let's get this going let's just start because i don't know how this is going to go i don't have a huge amount of time all right so uh somebody in the chat and i've already forgotten had mentioned oh you know i'm just starting to learn to code now is it too late for me or um so first of all i didn't begin uh programming in earnest i would say until i was about 28 or 29 i can't remember the exact date somewhere around there learned to code with macromedia director uh not to be confirmed with uh confused with uh macro data refinement which is another topic we'll see if we get to today uh those of you who know you know um and look at this beautiful rainbow apple by the way can you see that oh i know i'm distracted easily that looks kind of heavy i'm sorry i have the focus but look at that rainbow apple logo come on get get with the program people bring that back um so um i didn't really program until um then and i learned with macro media director i found processing i've sort of talked about this before many a time probably but when i was younger i was into the computer this was actually this computer had my i suppose this button was turned on and off by my probably 10 year old self um my family purchased it i'm guessing i couldn't tell you 1982 would be a good guess i was born in 1973. um and so i did a little bit of basic programming on it in elementary school it wasn't a thing that i spent a lot of time and i sort of did it and then moved on to other things i remember specifically playing a game called monaco gp which i had to load from a tape which i believe there's a box that i have yet to even open so i'm unboxing i my parents i went to visit them i got all the stuff from the attic i brought it here uh just put the monitor here because it's the nicest looking uh piece one of the things that i wanted to show which is really amazing is you know i have some very meticulously organized parents because this is the original box that came in the record of sale like shipping label thing is still encased in the plastic here record of sale award or lease of monochrome monitor as required by federal regulation 21 cfr subchapter j this is model number a3m0039 this card must be filled in duplicate by transformer at the time of sale to final consumer so this is this label here it looks like it was shipped to balanced computer and i realized the focus is not i should probably put on the autofocus balance computer corporation balanced computer center 109 beaver court cockeysville maryland that can only assume that's where this was purchased um and this is the original box look at that all right now for some other equipment that's not in the original box let's go actually there is some equipment that is in the original box but i will i will get to that i have to find it okay where is the box with the computer in it don't tell me i've lost it already oh no i found it okay so let's start with this oh and this table i'm a little bit worried that this table is not big enough i have another table over there um but here we go unfortunately i also can't really see the chat right now you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna bring this um ipad i have here um and all right so let me just let me just address the severance references because i see that shy 100 so first of all please nobody spoil this wonderful television program for other folks but um i've been kind of really just sort of into recently retro technology i've got a whole bunch of other old computers over there i'll show you a fun one that i just bought off of ebay not too long ago um quite a bit more modern than that one this is uh this is i don't know at one point this was a property of auburn university at montgomery but this is a one of those old apple clam shell computers but um uh this the severance tv show which is a show that i've been really enjoying i was on a podcast you can check that out i'll put a link to it and stuff like that about it um it's uh they use all these um older props which i um are i think data general computers i can pull it up on my laptop later to show you um which are dumb terminals um they're not dumb terminals it's kind of i don't i don't love that name for it calling it a dumb terminal but dumb terminals were you know monochrome usually monochrome monitors terminals that didn't have that hooked up to you know before everybody had their own personal computer you had to hook your terminal up to a mainframe so that multiple people could do access that computing power all at once anyway i want to get one of those but all right so uh let's see here um i've got the box here everything is kind of like attached so it's a little bit here's the actual it's falling apart okay you know what um let me just get this other table it's going to make life easier bear with me people um i should have set this up i know you can't see me i have another table here oh you know what i have a folding table let me just grab this folding card table this will be easier there's a toaster let's see this is the very professional uh outfit i'm running here okay all right so it's gonna fit through the door yeah i think so okay all right so i'm bringing another table in here because you need some more room let's put the box on it i will point the camera at it don't you worry oh my god there's a a nickel inside the computer that's not a good sign okay all right so the computer's in here let's try to very very carefully lift it out now it's got a bunch of things attached so i'm going to bring all these things with it this is how it was stored some disk drives and a joystick oh my god okay let's put it over here get rid of the box maybe i'll switch the camera to autofocus and let's put it on this table to the left here so i can have some more space i'm probably going to need a chair and i was meaning to look at the chat which i can kind of see here okay so uh uh i'm gonna come later today if there's time i'm gonna show you this macro data refinement program that i've been using i love working on you can find it on my github if you're looking for a wonderful podcast about the show severance uh check out post show recaps severance podcast uh episode 8 feedback was the one that i was a guest on but um yeah so you can check that out for those who are asking um yeah this joystick is wild right look at this um so let me see here now the next box that i need to get we move these precious things out of the way you can see uh i think the ipad is really ruining the vibe here let me put it back over here um okay now i have another box that i'm gonna get which i have yet to look inside i have no idea what's going to be in here this says first of all i love that this is a washington apples to find the world's finest apples let's do something here so you can see more of what i'm doing i'm going to switch to autofocus which i think will hopefully help things here oops everybody relax i know how to operate this equipment loosen there we go okay there we go this should be good um and now let me do uh continuous autofocus so hopefully that's going to help things okay i believe i'm on no it just says manual focus hold on uh focus mode continuous autofocus there we go okay all right everyone uh let me get this light here a little bit better positioned you can't see me i'm gonna get a chair i don't usually i'm not used to sitting in a chair when i'm streaming i have a little stool maybe i should get the uh this is good this is actually uh uh speaking of it's funny how this chair is for my grandmother bella minnell who is one of the fir first women phd in mathematics you can you can look her up uh bella manel if you uh the nature of code book is dedicated to her um this is kind of fun oh okay great all right so uh next up let's move this to the side let's open this box because i i don't i need to need some power cords and things i'm hoping everything is here okay we're gonna find out what's in the box craft precision joystick patented proven gimbal mechanism switch selectable spring returning centering test it to over 1 million cycles i don't even want to open this look at this beauty look at that still with the bubble wrap on it beautiful is the focus working i don't know if it is i um you know what let's i have multiple lights this light is for my computing setup my laptop setup which i have now just knocked but there's no reason why lift it turn it and make things brighter in front of the camera sorry everybody there we go oh my god life is hard okay don't fall over don't break okay that should help i just gave myself some more light might be too much light yeah now now when i bring things closer to the camera you'll be able to see them better assuming the autofocus works it wants to focus on my face so i think if i put this here all right so we found this joystick i'm not going to use that right now it's going to go over on the table here i'm looking for like a power cord um oh look at this okay this is promising what is this system saver kensington i guess i could sit in a chair i don't know what to do um i got a beep which makes me worry that the um that was somebody in the discord uh um messaging me lighting is dark when you're close to the camera okay i think i think i have that um okay so this is the um system saver line surge suppression filtering of line noise quiet cooling fan dual auxiliary outlets okay that's interesting i think this goes into the back has a fan in it and it goes into the back of the computer i'm sorry that like my face is totally cut off and uh here's the plug so let's put that here we're gonna need that that we're gonna need for sure uh got a box of floppy disks here i'm gonna sit down what is this oh this is like this is this is like some serious um hightech stuff npes database files 592. interesting this is like a proper usb interesting um another joystick this looks like a lock for it computer security products no one's no one's stealing this from me uh i'm just i'm gonna keep my eye on the um discord chat okay no all right sorry that i'm not really let me let me let me bring this ah now i have an idea if i put this here uh i mean you can see it i would prefer that not to show up in the shot not that that really matters put it here okay now i'm able to see the chat okay all right what else some more a lot more floppies uh files apple 2 plus disassembly removed from let's just oh look at this suggested retail price list effective march 1st 1981. so that's maybe a clue as to when this computer was purchased uh oh whoa this was expensive oh oh no no that's the business manager system but still this is a 2000 apple two blue plus system 32 32k ram amazing disc to floppy disk and interface uh two thousand seventy five dollars but also that's like nineteen two thousand seventy five dollars in 1981 which somebody will tell me what uh that is uh you know accounting for inflation um i'm hearing a noise it's probably gloria um okay that's pretty cool to see look at these original discs dos 3.3 system master i mean this has really been well maintained and saved microsoft typing tutor can you survive the snapper the hobbit user's guide this is for like welcome to middle earth this is the world of bilbao the hobbit of thorin and gandalf of dwarves and trolls and wizards this is the magical and mysterious land of j.r.r tokens the hobbit wow um so this must have been a game 19 uh 1985. beagle basic all right this i'm going to need because this is this is what i want to code in nibble the reference for aponal apple computing it's magazine ooh wow um okay software notes these are some files that my super text whoa what is this okay this is some the printer which i also i by the way have the original epson dot matrix printer that this came with so that's coming put that there um what's in this bag it's a bag uh integrated circuits screw look at this there's a little like film canister that says screw for epson fx 80. so this is a screw save for the printer that i'm gonna like and kept in this little bag um okay i can go through more of this stuff later i really want to get the thing on but i the the thing that i need is i need the power oh no i have the power for the monitor i need to figure out what the video out is so i have the power for the computer um oh look at this oh man this is awesome typing tutor this is a cassette tape did you know that you used to load your software onto a computer via cassette 8 micro computer games planet miners 1980 perfect condition okay now the question is do i have the cassette all right this looks like what is this okay somebody tell me what this is i have no idea what this is what are these they're like little dials are these little like controllers this is good for macro data refining wouldn't you think they use a trackball in severance which isn't something you would have found with a 1977 data general d2 computer uh it would have just had a keyboard interface no mouse no trackball for sure um this looks like odd oh video right this has got to be this has got to be the video go this is right is this a video cable this is a video cable it's an analog video cable this is another power cord but i would assume that this is the power cord that goes with it because it's like a whole big box um game paddles like atari 2600 okay uh accounting for inflation says matthew rice the apple ii was around five thousand dollars in today's dollars okay um let's see what else we got here some more discs some notebooks table of contents wow oh my goodness this is amazing i mean my my father kept incredible notes on various things related to the computer um which i would love to go through and sort of like learn everything okay um basic programming reference manual we're gonna need this dos manual we've got the epson users manual the apple soft tutorial the apple ii reference manual okay jackpot everybody jackpot okay uh pro modem oh it's got a 1200 300 baud intelligent modem they can get video term 80 column display okay there's a lot of things in here but i want to get a move on trying to get this thing hooked up this is another like video possibly video cable okay so let's look at the um uh not the apple so i want the apple ii reference manual there we go okay then we're going to need this the apple ii uh reference manual so uh let's let's look at how uh we turn it on the power supply page two approaching your apple chapter one the power supply okay yep main board all right let's take a look here can you see the beauty that's inside this thing main board power supply speaker there is no this oh yeah there's the speaker um so apologies um uh you know i could set up i do have like an overhead camera but let's just see how far i can get just with what the setup i have um the metal box on the left side of the interior is the power supply it supplies four voltages 5 volts negative 5.2 v plus a high frequency okay a photo to the back of okay keyboard talking to your apple your link to your apple is at your fingertips most programs and languages that are used with the apple expect you to talk to them through the apple's keyboard hello hello are you there it looks like a normal typewriter keyboard except for some minor rearrangement and a few special keys for a quick review of the keyboard see pages 6 through 12 in the apple ii basic programming manual since you're talking with your fingers you might as well be hearing with your eyes the apple will tell you what it is doing by displaying letters numbers symbols and sometimes colored blocks and lines on a black and white or color television set but i've got a monitor here let's all right i'm going to unplug these disk drives which are really kind of in my way i think which i believe i can just take these what is this no um so i have these two disk drives drive one drive two um let's leave them plugged in what is going on over here okay let's move stuff i don't need out of the way this joystick is this joystick actually attached right now is that i certainly don't need and that could be a little extra space for me what is this ah this is the video out why is it like this this worries me but i'm assuming this is video out but it is oh but there also is there why is this just loose well okay so we're gonna start by um put the chat on the floor sorry chat you're on the floor now i'm going to start by let's try to clean this up what is this attached to let's clean all these i'm cleaning all these cables up so that it's not so messy these are quite tangled let's see this is these are extra things move these ah look at this this must be the video out okay why what's this cable this is oh my goodness modem found the modem let's unplug that little telephone cord it's all tied up so i'm just trying to unplug some things i know i don't need right now like i don't think i don't have a landline phone so there's not really a way i can make use of that okay um all right phone cord do not need put this off to the side this drive number one this drive number two i don't like the way these cables are tangled i think this is better now let's try to find where untangle this joystick uh okay untangle this joystick yes i can leave it plugged in no harm no foul the joystick is plugged in i could undo it i just want to understand why there's this extra loose kind of video out but and why this is so don't worry about that okay so now oh i see this has been probably tied up to be stored so if i untie it this is there we go just want to remove this which is in my way this is the joystick which is now not plugged in so that's okay leave that to the side and now this must be the video out cable i hope the chat isn't all yelling at me like you're doing it wrong i'm pretty sure i'm doing it right yeah there we go okay now let's plug in ah this is one of no this is just an extra this must be for the printer this must be for the printer this one i'm guessing so let's put that off to the side all right we're ready for the power supply now so this is going to go in here i'm going to check the chat in a second to make sure there's nobody yelling at me like you're about to set everything on fire um okay uh okay i'm just looking at the chat here thank you uh put this off to the side now now this needs to be i need an extension cord again this is going to be very anticlimactic when i can't get anything to turn on or work but that's okay i'll go off and do something else with my day you will too you will too okay all right this actually has quite a bit of uh slack on it uh that light is plugged in through an extension cord let me find another extension cord okay where where where went to my local hardware store bought a couple these are these are uh 2000 circa 2022 era extension cords someday my children will be unpacking a box and be like look at this twoyearold extension core you're like what is this strange macbook pro machine uh all right is this gonna be long enough this is a very short extension cord what was i thinking let's get along is it where's let's get a longer one um i actually have some in a box over here previously here's a really long here this is probably a uh circa i'm guessing 2021 era extension cord much longer very dramatic here as i i made such a mess in this room i just i really shouldn't stream i should just spend my whole day cleaning and in fact that's is all i ever want to do is clean clean up organize can i just do that for the rest of my life i'd be so happy all right now we gotta find a place to plug this in where i won't trip over it where is the nearest power outlet uh not over there all right all right this is not the greatest you know what i'm gonna bring it over here okay uh if everything i'm about to plug this in if everything goes off it's because i've shortcircuited my entire setup and blown several fuses okay it is plugged in it is now plugged in now i would also like to plug in this monitor that i believe the power cord should be able to reach but that's what a short extension cord is for where did i put that short extension cord people it's somewhere around here i had it in my hands a moment ago i walked over here to find a different extension cord oh there it is okay i'm sorry i don't have like a wide shot or anything i should have thought about this more but it it's kind of an impulse stream decided to do this today so now i'm plugging in the monitor this is going to go into hmm i need a three prong okay wait hold on this should okay the light's gonna go off but i don't think that matters uh now this should be able to go plug in like oh my god seriously there we go ah no don't fall over okay there we go the monitor should be plugged in ready everyone i'm gonna turn this and press this button okay it's on i don't see it i don't see anything happening the computer's not on nor is the computer plugged in okay where's the analog video cable that i found i put it somewhere oh it's over here so let's look at the back of this one probably just maybe it just needs to warm up video in okay this is going into the video in now this there's a lot of things like there's this this must be the video out i'm guessing but there's also this video i'm gonna just try this and what's the chance that this thing actually turns on and something shows up here seems very very unlikely i'm going to take a look at the chat just to see if anyone's got any tips for me or important bits of information um okay tetris would be fun okay uh maybe plug in the signal to see the signal i don't know what that means but that sounds like a very smart suggestion am i blocking your view with this it's terrible terrible um put this down here contrast is all the way up oh hilariously the switch is on i didn't check that so let me turn it off that's weird yeah i have i this is what i was expecting would happen nothing and scene thank you for tuning in to today's coding train live stream i'm going to spend all weekend getting this thing to work i'll probably have to repair it and look up read stuff but let's see let's see if i can get any further just even in today ah it would help for this to be on okay let's turn this off this one ah there we go that's something maybe that's the wrong way oh there we go yeah can you see this power light here i don't know if that makes it through oh my goodness it's on can you see that i have to see i've just checked my monitor here on that yeah you can see that all right this is promising now it said the apple wants me to talk to it through the keyboard computer play minecraft it didn't seem to work well this was at least something happened let's play with this contrast yeah look at that wow turn it all the way up all right what do people think do i need what's in these disk drives one drive two reset whoa something changed there what happens if i turn it off and on again what maybe that'll work turn it off and on again look at the chat here uh uh do you have i think people are suggesting uh various other perhaps youtube uh personalities or technology experts who might actually be able to help me get this thing working um what i see on the screen tells me stuff is powered up but i'm not convinced it's doing anything productive check all the boards are seated push the reset key okay press the reset key let's be more aggressive and turn it off and i am going to have to start to check to see if all the boards are in place and what might be needed oh it's definitely trying to load something from this disk oh apple ii it says apple ii do you see that it says apple ii it's a black screen with apple ii at the top and it tried this disk drive went like it wanted to load a disk from it let's see what disks i have like do i need to load dos oh look at this oh my god people this is not my handwriting this is my handwriting i think i think that's my handwriting what autofocus on it pretty sure that's my handwriting but this is definitely my dad's handwriting here um assembler supertext by the way handle like never forget handle like glass don't keep them comfortable don't jam them into our slots so do i try one of these discs just as apple ii there uh holding down control while pressing and releasing reset then releasing control called doing a control reset will send you into applesoft without having to boot a disk okay holding down control while pressing and releasing um reset okay here we go i have a dos prompt keyboard doesn't seem to be connected but no i did control reset that's interesting i've gotten a dos prompt now um yes my father is still with us ask the chat um so let's see what other discs i have that's not a dos product okay excuse me it's been a little it's been about 40 years since i took a look at this these are just blanked as hardball is that a game wave that's my brother's handwriting wavy navy backup what is wavy navy joust side two can you have this is a doublesided disc side one chivalry side two joust oh my god so i really want to get this analog this is going to be the one thing that i'm really thrilled about is this analog video is working so there's no reason why i couldn't get the analog out and pass it you know convert it to hdmi and then pass it into my capture card so i could be at my uh sort of like live streaming the actual display out although it might just be more fun to have a a nice camera trained right on the monitor itself by the coding train is from now on just an apple 2 plus coding channel summer games oh i remember this game i remember this game i feel like i was i would get in trouble for look at this okay i think i drew that this is so weird but kind of delightful i'm sorry that thank you for indulging this bit of nostalgia from me but this here that's my handwriting says summer games and then i think this is me drawing the like olympic torch and those are like the steps up to the torch i think i just remember this game where to run you had to like press the arrow keys back and forth and i feel like i was always like break the computer these two arrow keys here so i think i should try to load a disk but these aren't do these things just boo these aren't bootable right i'm looking for like uh apple tosses thing but key control oh i okay so i want to look for like a boot disk pascal copy a fort fort two side one big mac assembler side two task compiler zoom graphics fort one ascii express beagle basic i remember this is this something that will just look requires apple 2e or 2 or 2 plus with ram card we put this in do this very carefully it's in closed now do i just turn the thing off and on again i hate doing this i don't want to most apple discs have an os on them just put it in and turn it on okay do you hear that i have noise reduction on that doesn't sound good do you hear that i'm putting the mic up to the disk drive i stuck my mic oh i'm typing ah syntax error all right all right wait everybody okay we're somewhere now and um i have so many cameras okay everyone what let's just take a moment here and let me do a little cleanup because i've made a total and my excitement i've made a total mess of this area and i want to clean it up a little bit i can move the camera so that you can see what's on the screen better so i could put some music on or something if you want but i'm probably just going to do this in silence and let me let me just organize this area a bit okay take this box over here because i just started like unboxing everything and going crazy and i just i want to be really careful with all this stuff especially now that it is i mean this now that it's working so i'm just off to the side talk amongst yourselves and i'm just going to move things that i'm not using i mean i think it would be nice to actually set this up properly the whole point is that this goes over it so let's see if i can get that let's see if i can make this work um type catalog okay i can't resist where's the where's the delete button ah not reset how do i go back there's no delete oh arrow no why am i typing data you said catalog catalog whoa the the some of these the c is not working the c is not working that's a bad oh no i got to work just had to bang on it a few times t a l o come on o come on o needs to wake up there just used to wake up g i think that sound is awful i owe error okay let me keep organizing myself here because i think everyone's going to be happier including myself if i can just get this set up in a way that it doesn't look so messy and that everybody can see it better and enjoy uh enjoy uh helping me along to try to get this thing going it's 1 30. i also i i as much as i would love to do this all day i don't know how realistic that is so this is probably going to wrap up relatively soon but this is only the beginning my friends only the beginning let me tell you okay uh this looks like i brought my lunch with me this is like this is like a 40 year old brown paper bag unbelievable it could be older than that uh this this is extraordinary finding these uh cassette tape games because i remember we would wait like 20 minutes to load these like let's play the game okay let's put the set in 20 minutes later um so again i need to set up a whole shelf system but i'm going to go through these discs so we can try some other ones but let's try to get this actually set up in a way now those of you watching i'm so kind of used to the idea that i can just turn off a computer and turn it back on as often as i like is there an issue with me doing that like should i be typing in some command like turn off i don't think that's the right command um let me move these oh i made myself this lovely coffee and i didn't even open it okay um move these things so i'm gonna put the put the top on let me just check if anybody's saying anything in the chat maybe you should type run before catalog to load the embedded dos no just turn it off you can turn the apple on and off with the switch this was before shutdown so yeah that's how i feel too okay so i'm gonna turn it off i'm gonna unplug it i feel like i need two disk drives but i guess i have them i would like now i'm gonna unplug the video cord come on put these on top this here this out of the way temporarily side looking good looking good everybody everybody okay you all doing all right over there that goes there this goes here slide it out a little bit there we go now this is okay you know what's amazing about this that fan which is blowing lovely cool air here all of my here a bunch of disks i will put here this card table and now okay just a little there we go everything's fine it's gonna go back out of the way now i have this stool here with adjustable height so i can sit here now let's figure out what i'm going to do with this camera so it is plugged into a lot of things but i'm going to attempt to move it here give you all a good shot there we go this looks promising and then if i sit here i could talk to you about my apple 2 plus computer look at this it's like i professionally designed the studio to work like this although i'm in front of some of the most beautiful parts okay so we need to plug things back in again so this has to put this on top of the disk drive that's what i would like to do and then this goes oh where's the plug there i don't know what i'm showing you right now my the back of my sweater so come on where are you okay i'm gonna have to just pull this table out so i can see the back for a second here this gets plugged in here okay that's plugged in i'm very surprised that i actually even got anything working today and then now i need the video cable the analog video cable which is coming out of the monitor here one angled up there we go and this goes into this okay now one question i have is can i just leave this i wonder if i can leave the switch on on the back of the computer and use this as my switch to turn the computer on we're gonna find out okay the monitor is on there's a disk in here beagle brothers dos and i'm going to turn it on apple ii how's your view of this let me get my the chat over here the fan hangs on the back yeah i think that's right but i don't i'm not really set up to easily attach stuff right now okay i can see the chat on the side it's supposed to go through the slots on the side of the apple but you could hang on the stand seems like it's not the worst thing to have it right here although i guess what i could do this light is a little bit in the way i can move everything over and there's plenty of room for them both to have their own little spot okay auto start rom was introduced by apple 2 plus in 1978 so turn on the computer with a bootable floppy inside rom will scan port to find 0x80 bootable sequence okay um can't you plug the monitor into the system saver and then they would both turn on at the same time ah great point i could do that um all right the view is good says everybody um but i'm not seeing anything um okay so let me look through the stack of floppy disks gorgon pacman and other games well let's try these one at a time olympic decathlon let's try this ah okay look at this look at this backup copy games disk volume 254. hello pacman gorg start star castle a rescue hood roll what do i do run this keyboard needs ah i don't where here start over run ah no two ends ugh run space come on space come on space bar can i just do this yeah okay run low shoot oh so close so sad b run i return oh wait wait okay file not found shoot h e l l o air duster to clean the keyboard contacts so i should go to the hardware i don't have one i'm going to go to the hardware store definitely you're absolutely right i need that b run so i need b run like basic run oh there we go okay so run hello reloads this uh prompt so do we think i need to say b run let's just try run with pacman come on p come on p it needs to be cleaned okay p a c dash m a n b run only for binary like a gorgon yeah so for the things that are b like that's binary so i probably need a b run for pacman let's see file type mismatch yep b run ah there's no way the space doesn't work b b b r u n ah that n key always gets me each time yeah i know it's not found b b b r u okay everybody one n we're gonna get one n i'm gonna i've got my magic quick fingers and i am going to just get this one in i be run p p a c dash m a n come on come on return there we go i think it's running pacman people loading where is the loading bar and animation i want to know i'm worried this light's gonna fall off but i think it's okay uh hook up the usb keyboard yeah i might need to do that to be honest at some point um i'd have to figure out how to do that okay the light of the disk drive went off but nothing is happening what do we think is going to happen uh people want me to zoom in i do not have a zoom lens but i could absolutely bring it closer there's a usb adapter you could buy the disc was making noise but it stopped and i am just left with nothing let me bring the camera in a bit closer for those of you who are asking for that my face is very loved um okay so try another one yep let's try another one so off goes the computer uh i mean i could have tried a different program but let's just try a different disc i mean i kind of want to work with beagle basic big mac assembler daniel schiff oh yeah so this is my science project so i did a science project in like fourth grade uh which was about i remember i don't really remember exactly it said summer it said summer games on it and then it's crossed out then it says daniel shiffman typing tutor perception because i made a program well let's see if this i remember writing a program in basic that was like doing an experiment around people's perception so we're putting this in we're turning it on apple ii okay look at this typing tutor start typing tutor hello perception.c this is amazing to me i don't know di can i like catalog can i just do like yeah so catalog will give me what's on the disk can you i wish i should i'm going to turn the noise suppression off it'll be very echoy here but i feel like you want to hear the hear the disk drive whirring but um all right so how can i look at i want to type cat like where's the dot this is i assume this is like apple dos right so there must be a thing for i must be able to look at that perception.c file somehow like i would type cat and then i'd hit start typing p and then i'd hit tab the bar doesn't work good thing the right arrow does this is not going to work that's why i couldn't can't even type anything close to what's right syntax error um fortran c yeah uh print list plus print your text catalog if i type catalog and then the name of the file it'll list it i don't know who this 8bit person is that everyone's referring to but i'll have to n key the return key seems to work one out of every maybe like three or four times syntax error list then list load load file name thanks everybody the sound of the keyboard is just lovely come on period oops no don't do another one okay i loaded it then lift nano yeah these numbers are scary that's for sure i really wish the return key would work a bit better look there's my program oh look at that that's code that i wrote like fourth grade i mean i think i wrote it i i mean i'm sure i had help i i have no memory i mean i have a memory of it a loose memory get s i print s i incorrect go to 180 print press any key so how do i run this oh i'm running at what level i don't what is this program that i wrote this is crazy okay what level one okay what did i see i didn't see anything it was too fast i saw i'll just make a guess zero nope i think there's a bug everybody there's a bug in my code control c there's no reset escape this isn't the fi the fire department's not going to come this isn't like directly wired to like some emergency line i guess i've just turned off the computer now uh yeah i can refactor i guess i'm just have to turn this off well that was fun another disc to look at she's going through these i really want to look at this beagle basic but um i guess i'll come back to that see what else ascii express super text 1989 super text files what is super school backup i'm a little bit afraid to look at that yeah look at this this is my weird childhood cursive handwriting i'm pretty sure um daniel schiffman december 4th 1982 i would be nine years old then i believe v30 let's see what's on this there we go daniel schiffman december 4th 1982 press return to go on this is like some real stranger thing style weird i think i inhaled a lot of dust hopefully i'll be okay file not found break in 90. this must be some other i need to get some water tunnels of terror sound effects ronald reagan's space odyssey apple vision viper dice typing tutor whoa windshield wiper so a lot of the perception which is dance the entertainer what the oh strange what are all these files load dice okay this looks like a program that let's see if we can understand this can you can you read the text it's hard for me to see yeah it looks like you can i'm looking at a preview okay print one two three four five six four i equals one to one hundred go sub 500 so for a hundred times go to 500 which pits picks makes a variable d which is the integer version of six times random of one plus one boy this surprisingly it looks like code that we would write right now um return so then they go back return so go sub tells you to go down here then you hit return we come back here n d equals nd plus one now what is all this doing oh this is this must be v tab three h tab six this is like setting a spot on the monitor let's run it it did i make this this is wild it's rolling a die a virtual die 100 times and keeping track of how many times it rolled each number it rolled the 5 23 times should be able to understand this now yeah look at this this is this is this is like the greatest day of my life [Laughter] uh i'm reading the chat now which is kind of fun it's a delay so i understand this is picking the right random number then n but where is n initialized like where did i allocate the memory for n does it just happen automatically like this is like oh we're gonna make an array with index one two three four five or this like is that a function that's like count so uh i need my computer to look up basic here and try to understand i want to write i mean like i mean i want to i want to write this code again and like learn how to do it i think some more names in the chat that i recognize how do i edit it no don't fall off my chair here you don't need to allocate small arrays says copper france wow this is quite amazing variables are dynamically allocated and initialized to zero it's basic don't worry about memory allocation yeah so how do i edit this i want to run it again it's too much fun see the pseudo random number generator those add up to 100 right 42 52 54 64 68 78 84 100 yep edit by typing a number and replacing that line of code retype a whole line oh okay okay let's see so where is the delay uh oh let's try okay let's try this for i equal shift key is a problem so i think one of the things i'm going to need to do is get um an air compressor to clean this i mean i would love to be typing on it directly but i could also probably get a different keyboard and kind of hook it up somehow i'm never going to get that equals is there a caps lock both shifts yeah no all right so this line how do i cancel now i don't want to mess with this line let's do this um for uh yeah yeah there is no delay basic on a one megahertz machine is just slow try the other shift key i certainly did all right um v tab four let's just try changing that 132 v tap v stupid the space and the shift are oh good how do i what is rept this this is very frustrating try one more time one three two v t a b b d b space so let's try v tab eight now let's list oh i edited it my code change let's be tab eight and i can run it now look it's down here now i wrote some new basic code today on an apple two plus computer is that what you thought you'd be seeing today live on youtube okay a working keyboard would make for a nice start yeah our ept goes repeat the keys do not auto repeat um uh line 500 is a function um okay all right let's um let's see what else we got on this computing machine anybody want to see what ronald reagan space odyssey is my goodness what is that draw a pencil we gotta look at what draw a pencil is tunnels of terror sound effects dice is what we're just looking at help apple vision star destroyer anybody had any requests let's look at um let's see what music is remember to git commit says ronyettes okay i think the keyboard is kind of loosening up here all right what what what okay select from the following list play piece on disk enter new piece exit from program let's try one okay i'm going to load the entertainer must have been music right enter name of peace from the list below the space enter tay there's a speaker in it bum it's going again is it gonna stop or am i gonna have to turn the computer off all right enter a new piece let's try that how many beats per minute people 120 select major key signature all right how about c do you want instructions no i don't need instructions i'm sorry but you're going to have to pause a little bit faster enter the value of the note or rest w is whole note you know it's amazing how little patience i think i have i have just like developed the quick gratification like instant gratification internet like click use way of being and this is like driving me crazy like i can't possibly read all these instructions and slowly figure out how to interact with this but i can um enter the type of note apple will then play the note the note is correct play return okay any key to continue what's a key that i know tends to work there we go good luck enter section one ah oh i love that i'm trying to enter like a deer a female deer i'm assuming x means i'm done how do i get out of this you can't hear it have you not been able to hit the music is my is my uh mic off or just like you can't hear the sound uh yeah all right um i don't think i've had to type in x yet i don't know how to get out of this i guess we'll be turning this computer off you hear a tiny bit remove the noise suppression okay let me go shut that off people one second okay the noise removal and room echo removal is off now so and let's see it's quite loud so i think you can hear that now i bet right control c exits a basic program let's try so i just don't know whether like the shift wasn't working so i have a bad feeling that control probably isn't working did you did you hear the entertainer did you not hear the entertainer i got to play you the entertainer all right i think i'm gonna have to just reboot this machine use bye i don't think that's gonna work escape control c all right i'm gonna have to just power this off control reset i guess i could have tried that um all right let's move on to another disc though i mean all right let's see what else we got here side one volume 31 comp let's see what this is school backup all right let's look at this disc every floppy disk is like a little basket of surprises oh it's two o'clock i'm gonna have to go soon i would say by the way you were saying bye and like my mind was just like thinking about that as a key sequence and uh now i realize it's spell spy uh lesson five lesson eight lesson nine flying saucers ski trek the guesses design the experiment comp so we look at what lesson five is oh there's like a little menu here how do i go down oh look at this this disc has like a nice little menu loaded with a menu so let's go to lesson five run what is your name do you have a computer uh apple two hold on print what is your name input t do you have a computer a print t why did it not stop at that so let's see yeah okay do you have a computer dan what kind um i don't know uh iphone you heard it here first coding trade audience the iphone is a good computer all right i think this is going to work so by the way i have a project i want to do with this computer um there's a streaming service called nebula that i participate in and i'm going to work on some videos for it i'll be doing stuff for the coding train with it as well but um this is a good start um so i think now how can i write let's try writing a new program um how do i create something new ah there's nothing okay so 10 home 20 print oh shoot i really wish the space bar would work will it oh and the shift doesn't work yeah i think my desire to oh wait i got a quote i got that quote can i get it back frustrated uh there's my program which is definitely not gonna work oh didn't need the quotes create file name okay hit the any key hold on i must be able to do save right oops is it trying to write on the disk bang on the shift key not the two key that's a good point okay what did it save it as lesson 24 calories what is that the experiment conversation hebrew quote camera mix smoke research perception b perception 3 george space space 2 what are all these things and where did it save it save choo choo okay oops um is it going to be what did i call it choo choo anybody see it and there it is that's the new computer program i wrote today is it still loaded okay 10 10 print chew is it gonna just let me do it without the quotes no oh that was whoops i overwrote the wrong line oh there we go look at my basic program that i have written everybody oh i just knocked the camera it's all right let's run it here we go okay um i don't know if there's any moderators looks like there's some nonsense coming into the chat am i able to moderate myself from the ipad doesn't look like it that's annoying all right let's try i i gotta get going here um and this uh my ipad that i'm monitoring the chat on only has six percent uh batteries left um thank you mia oh me i am samia's there um so uh yeah next stream is exactly definitely what i'm going to do michael kemp uh append choo choo all right do a ten do ten print okay fernando all right fernando you had the best idea ever okay 10 home homer so now 20 can i do a equals the shift is working now people r and d shoot one or can i do like r and d two 30 print a okay ah look at that it gives me a floating point random number so now we need to change that to change that to oh just have to uh 20 a equals equals r and d shoot equals rnd i think it can't give it an argument i assume it's just a function times a 2 which should give me a 0 or a 1. oops uhoh syntax error oh i have to type retype the whole thing does it need an argument or is the is this not right okay here we go now can i do an if like what's an if in basic i don't see a backslash i only see a forward slash it's gonna be a problem uh also that key doesn't work let's just do that it's going to be a variation on 10 print are there no if statements in basic uh well i'm getting a lot of good comments here um oh i need to change it to an int yeah and let's just see let's just at least see if i can do so if i want to add a line i could do 15 and i could say 4i how do i do a loop 4 i what's the chance that's right no i think you need it then oh then did you all hear that that was a very bad sound and there's smoke i'd shut it off oh this is bad okay let's unplug everything safety first people oh no this is the one and only time i'm ever gonna get to do this unplugged everything oh it's a bad smell i'm gonna open a window over here let's back the camera up people i'm sure someone's gonna clip that little moment there the thing is everything was i don't know what what started to um i'm hoping it's just the power supply that's a that can be remedied this was fun while it lasted let's move this over here okay um that smell is awful i think it's i the it's the power supply oh it's still smoking okay i'm going to examine this later on my own time i'm going to first unplug this from the extension cord i wonder i mean i don't feel still smoking it doesn't feel super hot maybe switch to an apple ii emulator yeah um all right uh let me just come back over here for a moment um that was a little bit uh freaky uh oop here i am all right uh the light is not on me right now so it's a little bit dark um i'm very sad it was fun while it lasted oh that smell is terrible just looking at the chat um okay all right everyone i don't know if there's still people here watching i think i'm gonna call it a day but i've got a few things maybe that i can briefly mention or discuss let's turn to reset up the setup again at least get the lighting back the way it's supposed to be okay sorry everyone i'm okay um whoa that smell i cannot tell you how strong it is i mean it's like burning rubber or something um all right so uh thank you all for tuning in to today's live stream i'm not entirely sure what the purpose of it was i was having a grand old time until i heard that sound and started to see smoke on that apple two plus computer i hope this is not the only time that i am ever able to uh work with this machine or stream from it or so i'm gonna work on giving it a permanent home somewhere and kind of investigate it in more detail in my own time if anybody is watching happens to be an expert or have some tips for me or wants to put me in touch with someone that could help me restore the computer to its former glory i would love to hear that um psu capacitor pops you can purchase replacements says robbie in the chat hi robbie all right that's great to know some money from galvey to go to a recap service on my apple ii plus tends to be a lot of plastic in those old things so i can imagine the smell smell says eric typical apple device all right so i just want to briefly since i'm here and there are some small number of you watching i couldn't tell you how many um um i just want to briefly mention um um thank you chris uh get it recapped professionally what does what does that mean exactly uh because by golly i would love to have a professional come and restore this machine um but um i guess so while i'm here um i might as well mention this sort of goofy project that i'm working on related to the well it's related to the television show severance but the way i was putting that sounded like like i have some official thing that i'm doing which i don't at all um let's get going here and uh let's show you up the at the computer and i i'm a little bit brain dead right now i'm going to go to github.com lumen industries so um i'm just just a massive fan of the show which had the finale last night um and uh so first of all if you're i'm not gonna spoil anything from it please chat uh be on your best behavior um i would um so but i am gonna show this little project which is based on a piece of software that runs in the show with uh on one of these computers i don't think they're actually using one of these computers it's a prop um data general dasher d2 not a t200 so um i showed this on twitch earlier this week but so this is the computer that uh i believe is in the show um and i'm not going to search um uh but like i think if i search like macro data refinement and do like an image search you'll see there's this um there's this software that the characters of the show are working with so i've been slowly over time building my own version of this software um and i'm going to show it to you now uh if you go and i was going to work on it today but i've run out of steam so if people are really interested in this tweet at me at shiffman uh and are like i'm gonna talk join the coding train discord i'll i'll talk about how you can get involved if you're interested in helping with this so this is the github repository for this project um if i go here and click on lumenindustries.com um you'll see this is my version actually somebody submitted a pull request adjusting the colors of it which was really good but it has some um has some issues with it so basically the idea here is that i need to find the scary numbers and bin them properly and then and i'm going to do a little hack here which is that if i just go into the console and overwrite the goal variable and set it to ten oh first of all it's gonna set me at 75 percent immediately benjamin durgo came for the and now i'm at a hundred percent so this is what i'm most proud of i created this share button which when you click it it copies your the address of the data that you just refined and a little message that you can share on social media so if i go to twitter.com mdr lumen um you can see here people are posting their data that they refined a la wordle and nothing is bringing me more happiness than seeing this right now but it needs a lot more work and guess what severance was renewed for a season two i don't know what i'm going to do for the next year i'm going to work on this i'm going to get back to coding train tutorials and things i would love especially if any of you are fans of the show to participate we can create a channel in the coding train discord i've been tracking um issues of things that i want to add to it here uh the ver the kind of first thing that i think i'd really like to do which i think would be quick is include the amount of time it took to refine the data um so that at least when you're posting a report to twitter it's a little bit more like it took you one minute 30 seconds i'm sure there's some clever language we could come up with um there are also uh there's an ebook that the apple tv put out and that you can find which has like these are the actual rewards you're supposed to get at ten percent twentyfive percent seventyfive i have the seventyfive percent i mean that could be improved and 100 reward so um if any of you are interested in helping to develop this piece of software um by the way i'm just curious i'm gonna i know i'm he's changing subjects every five seconds here but i'm going to just quickly turn on the um noise removal uh and just sort of see i just quickly turn that on and i'm just curious if the sound i mean obviously when i was working with the apple ii plus we wanted to hear those noises but is the sound better worse the same i'm just curious to hear from you so i've been sort of tracking issues and things this is the pull request that um somebody graciously added but it has some conflicts in it i think uh adjusting the colors oh i would love to put in a um um i'd love to put in a like um i bet you we could do like a crt shader filter on the canvas that's probably something that i could learn how to do right just adding just adding issues i don't know does anybody have any questions about this any interest in it um i would love to hear from you um i also want to give a plug since i'm uh a plug here oh god that smell i'm very sensitive to certain kinds of smells like a bleach smell i can't be in the room get very sick and the smell is having that effect on me which i think is why i'm really struggling to continue this stream so sound is way better with the noise removal and the echo is completely gone yeah um yeah it actually and i only put it on 75 so this is using um my graphics card on this streaming machine the nvidia rtx broadcast software i mean i should sound treat the room that would be the proper way to do it but um i'm just curious uh i could i'm just also curious like while i'm here to turn it way up like um like i'm gonna turn it uh all the way up now i did open the door uh the thing about the garage fishy in the chat and thank you fishy uh fishy has created uh more uh this wonderful i don't um uh uh has been working on here it is has been working on a visualization for um what happens when you reach 100 for this little like animated sequence that happens in the show um so this is a fun uh based off of i think the pearl and noise terrain so there's a lot of potential there um so i'm going to turn it all the way up i'm just curious so now i'm at a hundred percent of noise removal and echo uh removal i'm just curious if better or worse i mean it's like you're at the eye doctor now um so anyway there's lots of things on this list i uh would love any contributions anybody wants to work on this with me uh i mean i do need to put this to the side and like kind of get back to some things i've totally made a mess of this room i don't know why i'm feeling so discouraged all of a sudden but uh using an ai filter on the graphics card is more on brand than physically sound which is very true thank you chris so um yeah so i guess i could keep talking about this i could come back and do another stream about it and like sort of work on this more if there's interest you can check let me just ah if you're really interested in this i'm sorry i will tell you what to do if you go to the youtube channel called coding train twitch archive um this is where i uh archive any streams that i'm doing on twitch and write so many important things to mention okay okay important coding train news announcements i i i kind of was setting up a new sound board that's an interesting noise bumper that i don't have all these bumpers from old times um okay what is this okay sorry sorry having fun over here all right um okay uh what was i going to say yes all right announcements there is a survey let's see if we can find it on uh on uh it's been shared via coding train social media ah yes here we go here it is thank you everyone has filled out the survey we are expecting it we are extending the deadline to april 4th ah that deadline is officially today april 8th today is the la i mean you can fill out the survey after the deadline but i need to next week i will i mean i was going to do it today is there a way i could do it today i'm going to figure out how to do this live without giving out any of these information but i want to i'll document somehow how we are picking the the uh to send the stickers but this is a survey just for feedback i'm kind of planning the rest of the year thinking about what i want to do one of the items on the survey is whether you prefer to watch live streams on youtube or twitch i can tell you right now spoiler alert the overwhelming response is about 75 25 on youtube but that's mostly because i've been posting the survey through check through various um uh channels i'm not a communication channels that are people are finding because they know about the youtube channel so i'm a little worried it's heavily biased there so again i said this on twitch earlier i don't want to put my thumb on the scale but if you're excited about um kind of bouncing a bit back and forth between twitch and youtube i would love to hear from you and what the sort of benefits of one platform versus the other are my kind of plan although there's no evidence that i'm putting this into motion is that twitch is more of a place for some sort of informal casual streams and youtube is the place where my properly planned and professionally produced it doesn't really exist but that's sort of an idea thank you me i am so me for posting the survey so um one of the things on the survey you don't it's an anonymous survey but if you want to be entered to win some coding train stickers you can put your email in there so that's important item number one um item number two oh in my head i was like oh i have three or four announcements and i started talking about the survey well there's a new website coming i really should be working i shouldn't be live streaming i should be working on that website i got to get back to recording coding challenges i've got tutorial i've got so much to do um all right let's talk about um let's talk about uh then so if you've missed the twitch streams you can find the archive of them here and in particular there's a whole stream i did about the macro data basically uh refinement program and i would be glad for you to check that out and contribute uh participate in the issues file any pull requests hit me up on discord on twitter et cetera et cetera at least just play the game share your results let's bring macro data refinement to the to the masses people uh and then i mean this is the la i'm just also going to shout out uh because i've gotten so obsessed with the show i've been listening to a podcast where some neuroscientists and psychologists are talking about various elements of the show and you can find that i would highly recommend if you just watch the full season i happen to be uh uh very poorly giving some of my takes in a very inelegant way on this particular episode eight feedback but i'm sure the new uh recaps of the finale will be posted soon so check that out it's a wonderful community of people who enjoy analyzing talking and discussing uh various um television shows i haven't gotten into a show like this in i don't know i can't remember when since when maybe lost many years ago i tried to get my kids to watch lost their kindling not interested i mean i think the um severance is is not appropriate for them but uh so if you're very young it's fine there's nothing really terribly uh it's it's it's dark it's a dark dark show so you know proceed with caution um duo q life says thank you that's a nice comment i i sometimes i feel like i shouldn't read the like complimentary comments like back to you because it's very selfaggrandizing but i do appreciate your kind feedback i think i got to be done today um um and simon i'm reading your feedback simon's giving me some feedback in the discord about me i also used to do these memberonly streams i was doing really well like 2022 i was shot out of a cannon and i was streaming every week i was making coding challenges like like january and even some of february i was just like i had all this steam and i went away and there's been a lot of stuff going on and uh life gets in the way um but i think now i have a couple m i have a big project i'm working on that's gonna kind of get in my way a little bit the next couple weeks but i'm hoping to get back into the routine of things um and thank you oh i should see halt and catch fire okay yeah i mean lost don't get me started on like the last season i just mean like at its prime right lori thank you for your feedback and it's prime you know what was that i was thinking about numbers then um uh francella i am on sabbatical yes and and i have to say i mean surely i miss teaching i miss it more than i thought i would and also it's not the thing that's in the way of me being sort of like productive and doing all the things i want to do i mean it's definitely it keeps me i'm my own worst enemy i think when it comes to um trying to develop a sort of regular routine of of of making videos and working through i get i get very distracted and i get really obsessed with weird little things and get stuck on little technical problems so i don't know anyway um it's been a lot to try to set up this new studio and um i just want to make sure there's no smoke still i just don't want anything to be like i do have a smoke detector over there it didn't go off so i don't think it was that bad if you're just tuning in what you missed is the glorious glorious moment like this was like a one of the highlights of my entire life was setting up this old apple 2 plus computer from my childhood i was running my old basic programs from elementary school and then it made some horrible sounds smoke started coming out of it and i don't know what to do now i need i need help like as much as i want to be the person who could fix this myself that's not i'm not really a i'm not really a hardware person maybe i can give it a try but if you're out there you know somebody who's out there who can help me restore this um yeah especially if you're in the new york area within like a three or four hour drive of like poughkeepsie like please come over get me up come over like very soon because i need to i'm planning to use this for a project later this month but anyway maybe i'll have to postpone that we'll see um but i would like to hear from you uh all right um coming back over here i i can't i can't go uh hi nicole uh my shader expert nicole i see you in the chat uh lifelong learner thank you um i'm sorry i'm read this chat is fun to read sometimes uh hcf an amazing team of drama yeah somebody was telling me actually on the podcast um the show devs was recommended to me and in fact maybe related to some of the um themes that are also in severance so anyway the severance community on twitter it's it's popping come and say hello there uh there are youtubers who do those fixes yeah uh seb can i get seb lee delisle to fly fly in from the uk somebody asked um to give you some help like seb is always was restoring something yesterday on his channel um adrian's digital basement okay thank you i'm gonna need all of these told to me again this scientific american at least did not catch on fire all right let's ah all right so we looked at the apple plus i talked about the survey i talked about my obsession with the show severance and macro data refinement here's a question for you what would you think and i probably shouldn't do this because it'll take an enormous amount of time away from other things that maybe are i should be spending my time on but if i did something that was like a video essay style short 10 minute video maybe narrating um kind of describing some of the technology or this you know science fiction technology that's in the show severance and giving some sort of thoughts and opinions about what's what could be real what wouldn't be real um how it might work um it's not the kind of video i make on the coding train at all would that be of interest let me know and then silicon valley yeah i don't i never got into that um but um i could give that a try for sure um ah all right and then here's what i want to look at i need to keep tr i need to spin the wheel i need to pick a coding challenge to do next week because i i got to get back to that so i've already forgotten how in the world where in the world this list that i'm keeping is but let's see if i can find it um desktop backup okay i think this should give me to me okay all right uh okay this would be appropriate right to do as a coding chat oh you don't see the screen i'm sorry everybody um sorry everybody um uh this is my list of things i had some things that i wanted to add to it and i'm waiting for the chat to catch up to me so let's see what do what's what have i already done i did the mandelbulb remove i did the ulam spiral remove did the nbody problem remove now people have been giving me some really good ideas and i would like to add to them let me just do a little screenshot of this but i don't have an easy way to edit and add things to this app that i created so let's just let's just keep this as my list right now um let's let's let's keep this as my list let's spin it and see what we get some of these i don't feel so great about others i would be thrilled if it landed on and there were some really good ideas that people have been suggesting recently and i'm not doing a good job of keeping track of them let's just um i think one of my uh things i really like to develop in dream to do as simon will tell you anytime i make one of these markdown files there's a list of something i never go back to it um but i do feel like there were some really uh there were some good ones recently that i wanted to work work on but i guess i'm just gonna spin this let's just do it all right let's just do it wave function collapse algorithm that is what i'm rooting for if i'm being honest with you this is what i'm rooting for i'm spinning it i'm gonna stop it i don't think i have a drum roll here yes i do let's see what we get so i have a lot of videos doing neat like algorithms oh these are bo i'm okay k means image stippling would be i'm fine oh come on wave collapse function you're so close nope uh image stippling i'll take it i don't know image stippling it is thank you all i really appreciate all of you who watch the coding train and support me and and just by watching frankly uh by giving me your feedback um and uh i'm we you could out vote i mean i could put it to a poll it's close uh you know you're obviously the core audience the most dedicated audience of the coding train right now the wheel needs a nudge button uh you know let's put some other i can i do more polls i can only do one poll at a time now i just want to keep doing polls i'll do some twitter polls i really can't believe that the apple ii plus like caught on fire i mean i don't know if caught on fire is too strong i need to eat i didn't eat lunch it's three o'clock my kids are gonna be home from school it's gonna be the weekend it's a beautiful sunny out i should go i should go i've already played the sound effect thank you for watching um i'm going to wow uh you know wave function collapse is just taking it by maybe i shouldn't use a wheel i should just use a pole i could pick a few things that i'm interested in put them in the poll um why why do i need this wheel what does that be picked randomly wave function collapse let's do that next week people it'll be make for a wonderful video um oh great oh simon you are so great simon offered me the list towers of hanoi koningsberg bridge problem ray marching sdf rendering sudoku petrus sokoban all right i'm in the market for a web application i mean i should make this myself i should just do a stream where i make it where web applications will help me keep track of this stuff but until then thank you so much i appreciate all of you i hope you enjoyed this the smell is quite strong i'm gonna clean this up and put it to the side um let's put this camera back like where it normally this would be the whiteboard shot and uh i'm gonna put the camera back just back to sort of more of a wide shot um and so uh i hope i hope you enjoyed today's stream um you can follow me on twitter at shiffman um you can check me out on episode 8 of the post show recaps severance feedback show but don't listen to that episode listen to all the other ones nothing would make me happier than people being like oh i found the second podcast from the coding train and those communities colliding in some way i don't know um um next week i'll be back with some live streams uh and more content making some videos um and i hope to continue to be here with all of you on the internet in the way that i am now wherever i can't see the chat anymore cause i have a new did somebody join teemo i'm making this happen no no no no no unlimited try i don't have unlimited tracks can i delete one import files no browse uh i started setting up a new sound board i don't have i don't have the help thank you you're a new passenger on the coding trade i don't have my train whistle it's in a box somewhere but i i appreciate you and welcome there's a thing where i give people random numbers it never went anywhere but i'm getting back into it i love you all we're gonna end uh timo make sure make sure you uh join the discord and you sync your discord with your youtube account and you can join us in the uh member uh channels there a lovely friendly community that will chat with you and answer your code questions this is the musical dance experience you've all been promised and i'll see you all next time on the coding train goodbye is there any music i could possibly play see you next time thank you epidemic sound for the music tracks that i'm playing for you all and uh see you all you
