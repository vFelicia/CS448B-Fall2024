oh shoot alright this is my test to determine if YouTube is lying to me or not because very briefly before I started livestreaming I was poking around this audio library which browse and download free music for your project attribution not required of course I don't mind using music where attribution is required and I went to dark and I went to classical and I found Beethoven's fifth symphony there's all sorts of other stuff I could try as I feel like I need something for the 4th dimension because this is the coding train live episode where we will enter dimension that's how I said let's try this one where we will enter to mention all right anyway let me get a move on here I've got lots of time where do I got nowhere to be nothing to do so what you're seeing here by the way is what you're seeing here is a processing sketch that I made this morning let me correct the weird nonsense that I was playing with here messing around with it should be cosine negative sine sine cosine cosine negative sine cosine negative sine sine cosine okay so this should be if I've done everything correctly a spinning 3d cube with perspective but the renderer is the P 2d engine and this is my last piece of space melon it erases whatever is on my body revealing what is behind it will provide me with the energy that I need also must hope this camera is off erase this whiteboard I'm going to draw some diagrams and I'm just gonna get started this I feel remarkably ready to tackle this problem having done what I did this morning as much of a disasters that was I think I don't know I don't know about this white board eraser thingy that I've purchased from the internet is working a little bit better okay so just in case you didn't tune in this morning I did about a twohour live stream programming this and the idea for me was I wanted to learn how do three end and the most basic level how do 3d engines work how does it work to create the illusion of threedimensional perspective on a twodimensional surface and the answer it deal is has to do with matrices projection matrices rotation matrices and there's much more to it than that but I did the basics and hopefully this will and let me just move to the slack channel here um let me just see move this out of the way I'm alright no no I'm Superboy oh okay hello wake up we go this is really like the free copyright music there aren't a lot of choices you have to pick like the most obvious famous classical music piece I'd love to do something more obscure a little mall or maybe I don't know it would be good for 14 inches I also made it like much louder is it way too loud now oh tesseract is in the chat from the fourth dimension to our dimension okay I'm gonna turn this back down okay so let's do the phone trying to think about this I think we're gonna leave to start with this code like dare start I think I want to start from scratch is the thing I mean I definitely need this matrix oh you know what though this is why I probably shouldn't have I'm gonna have to add some code to this okay yes Simon I have seen that video before thank you for posting it for me I try to not have too many things in the chat here that have a that open up a big thing is I have the font very large so I could see it and so okay so let's see trying to think here trying to think here how do I want to do this alright I want to make a video where somebody could mostly program the tesseract from scratch so I think what I want to do is I'm going to end up redoing some of my code so I am erasing all this I'm gonna end up rewriting a lot of this code now I feel silly but I think I want to start over from scratch and the tesseract okay you know what I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave some bits in here let me see what bits can I leave in here okay so I'm going to leave the points for a cube I'm gonna leave this angle variable I'm going to leave the take this out I'm in P 3d now o p 3d and I'll leave this connect function okay I think this should do the trick mmm oh and I need to do scale I'm just thinking here I'll just do scale I forgot the scale affects the stroke wait here it's a little better oh and this has to be okay and then so this is annoying so I'm not gonna do it this way I'm gonna leave this the noise never it's you know it's always so quiet in here when I'm not livestreaming and since I started livestreaming there's always like right out in the hallway just right outside the door there's some construction and push them like furniture that has no wheels down this down the hallway make a loud scratching noise alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say and then I'm just gonna use the scaled oh this is so silly what I'm doing oh this is so silly what I'm doing I have a better idea jammer goes off of course Jamie asks in the chat why is processing chosen for today's video do most people not prefer to follow along at p5 GS or is that just me you know I kind of go back and forth one of the reasons why I'm choosing to use processing right now is because I want to make use of its 3d rendering engine and I'm just much more confident using the 3d rendering engine of processing than the WebGL rendering engine of p5 which is to say one is better than the other it's just my own personal comfort level ok so I made all these points we're drawing stroke stroke weight 16 points connect them why do I not see my cube where's the cube everybody let's go scale 100 is still in there okay oh that was messing stuff up all right there we go now we can say rotate X by angle or something or rotate Y maybe all right alko writes I can make a fake tesseract without using actual 4d math yeah I was thinking of doing that that's where I that's what I started doing and then I was like jumping through so many hoops and I felt like I wanted to learn and think about the fourth dimension in a way that I hadn't thought about before and so that's why I'm going this route but that is a very good point all right so I think we are going to get started all right I need a marker alright how's everyone feeling this looks like this needs some triage ok ok alright I have to wake up I didn't I I was drinking a non caffeinated beverage this morning and then I just said the heck with that I thing is I don't know if it reads because I'm kind of tired at the end the day it's a Friday but I'm so excited to do this I hope that this becomes a video that is a good one Oh Marshall says I'm so excited get my coding train stickers I did a whole someone helped me with this today but a whole mailing of stickers went out today so if you signed up to be a member before August 1st your stickers are actually in the mail right now to you I'm so be on the lookout for those again I don't keep saying this someone's gonna actually like volunteer in the slack Channel I would love someone to help me spruce up the membership stuff so I want to add a whole bunch of emojis and icons and I'm thinking of maybe some additional rewards if that's of interest but if you would love to volunteer to help with that please let me know you should try Expo wet erase markers yeah that's what I got that's what these are I ordered them someone recommended these to me these are Expo wet erase markers I think right right isn't that what these are I have another one I got a pack of 2 I don't know where the second one went somebody tweeted is that me last week and I ordered them instantly from a company that rhymes with flam is on because I have a full I'm that runs his fly membership oh you know what something else about flam is on I guess I can mention flam is on now because I was working I had like I was kind of sitting somewhere where like I had to wait tonight there's nothing for me to do which very rarely happens and so I actually took a little time to work on amazon.com slash shop slash coding Train I think is the URL I have one of these new coding train slash shop maybe the coding train slash shop alright I know how to get to it if I go to YouTube the coding train and I click on I'm gonna get started coding soon Amazon here yes I don't know amazon.com slash shop slash the coding train I started organizing things into categories here of like stuff that I use and you could I mean this is really just a moneymaking thing you know hopefully this is like a helpful thing to you cause like you were looking for that book that I referenced it's here but this Amazon is set this kind of stuff up so that I can get a commission which is helpful I'm not gonna turn it down but uh really I recommend you check out this nice list because here's where you can get your own copy of a million random digits or the same exact train whistle that I use this is a unicorn floaty III I could not I actually have one of these and I couldn't stay on it so I know if I recommend it this is a train hat that's really that's what I look for but it has I have some other other stuff in here too and if you have ideas for things that you think I should include or things that I mentioned periodically I would love to include them in here alright that's the Amazon shop alright so now where am I what what happened to all my windows oh wait maybe that's fine okay okay this I don't need the audio library right now I'm not gonna worry about this I'm not gonna worry about this this is what I'm gonna worry about and this is also is there any way I can get this video this page to pop up let's then go here this is what I'll do I want this page to pop up without playing the video and just that the thumbnail but I guess that's not a thing that YouTube does woo wow this is super helpful to the four oh look why all these people make these nice animations and like that's just not me I'm gonna have to draw on the whiteboard okay include the spaceman yeah fill the cube for fun oh hello Denmark random numbers good and Todd good evening everybody alright so I think I'm ready to go to get going nobody can help me with this huh how can I make this show I turned off autoplay speed normal annotations quality how I want to show this page with the thumbnail nobody nobody will tell nobody will help me because it must not be possible I just know I've gotten to I have my expectations are too high I just think I can mention something the chat will tell me how to do it as my own personal technical support I need to be my own technical support I need to learn new things like visualizing a 4d tesseract okay so that's fine I'm just gonna find I'm going to do what I said I was gonna do before which is find a nice there we go a nice screen shot there we go hi be like why is fortnight recommended for you oh I am in one of my alternative universe YouTube accounts that my children use but what I'm trying to do by watching my educational videos in there is is embed embed the recommendation engine with some new stuff for them to watch ya autoplay is autoplaying the next video it's fine it's fine everything's good but let me let me login as myself which I'm always afraid to do but I think this is going to be better it ruined me it really knows that I like Tessa rocks okay so I'm gonna move here this is pretty good come on okay that's good that's good okay yes that's the image correct all right that's a very good me I'm Studios making an interesting solution I think I'm gonna live with this being visible can't resist I can't resist that suggestion hold on let me at least copy video URL to current time I mean I just can't resist this suggestion nope alright this is gonna do just fine tesseract okay and I have my code so this is minimize this is minimized this is up and running then I have my code so far okay too many nines indeed all right we're gonna get started I'm gonna get started let me cycle the cameras okay okay here we go where's the train whistle my lucky train whistle where did it go ah there this Oh welcome to a coding challenge where I will enter the fourth dimension well I don't really time I expected some dramatic moment to happen with the music there which didn't happen but all right so this is a coding challenge I'm so crazily excited about this if this actually works I think that I don't know what's gonna happen stuff just like smoke and brain matter will start just like leaking out of my nostrils I don't even know wait till the end of this video to see now what I'm starting with here looks like a plain old spinning cube and actually that's what it is what I want to do is not just make a plain old spinning cube in three dimensions I want to make a hypercube spinning in the fourth dimension so I want to make something that looks like this alright so this is a hypercube otherwise known as a tesseract and I'm gonna before I start coding any of this I'm gonna explain to you what that is exactly so let me come over here so I I think my favorite dimension is one dimension oh no zero let's pick let's start with zero dimensions a point is a shape that exists in zero D that's a zero now a line which is bound by two points is something that exists in one dimensional space this is one dimensional space a rectangle a square a plane which is bound by one two three four lines exists in twodimensional space now notice a pattern here this is bound by two lines this is bound by four I'm sorry this is bound by two points this is bound by four lines now if I create two planes and then connect all the edges I have what is commonly referred to as a cube this is something that exists in three dimensions are that the number of dimensions that we live in on this planet where we live and it is bound by six planes so you can see a pattern here I was gonna say you double it but this is not bound by anything I guess so that sort of makes sense this is bound by zero things this is the beginning now what does it mean then to have four dimensions well I'm not really gonna be able to draw this too easily but we could make the case right if I'm following this pattern that four dimensions is bound by eight cubes and this is mathematically true this is accurate the problem is I'm gonna sit here I'm gonna visualize this in my head are you doing this with me I cannot do it at all human beings are not we did not evolve to understand the world in any dimensions higher than three there's a there's a there's any way I can keep going on about this but since this is a mathematical truth why isn't there a way that we could somehow unlock it and see this on a computer screen in some way and in fact there is so this is how how do we even see this how do we even see this 3d shape on a 2d computer screen well the way we do that is by writing code like this one that I've done right here now the truth of the matter is in processing which is the programming language environment I'm using right now I could just say box and I would get that because I'm in the P 3d render and the P 3d render knows how to take the mathematics of a 3d shape and project it into a 2d canvas to create the illusion of the third dimension and it totally makes sense to our brain because we're so used to 3d we can imagine we can see the 2d version of it and imagine it in three dimensions so and I did a a a you don't have to have watch that video to watch this one I did a whole previous coding challenge where I made exactly this but only using the P 2d renderer so I did the math of taking 3d points and projecting them into 2d so if I can do that why can't I take create the math for a 4d shape do the projection into 3d and render it with the P 3d render truth of the matter is I could then project it into 2d and render it with the P 2d renderer too but I'm lazy I'm just gonna do one projection and if this is true there's no reason why I couldn't create a 5d shape and a 60 shape and a 70 shape and I project 17 to 16 and divide D into 40 and then into 3d and visualize it so this is what I'm going to attempt to do in this video it is going to require matrices there are ways to do it without it or to create the visual illusion of it but I'm going to be using matrices and the matrices are going to be used for a couple things I need a projection matrix this is a matrix that takes a 4d point and turns it into a 3d point and I'm going to also need a rotation matrix I don't need the rotation matrix but the rotation matrix is what's gonna make this fun because I can start to rotate around weird axes to see crazy things happen so this is good this is kind of like optional but this is what's gonna make the visualization here so I'm gonna do the most basic wireframe version of this and hopefully you are then going to make beautiful interesting weird things about this it's somebody watching this lets who can go to the highest dimension possible in processing I would like to see that as a challenge only one thing I forgot to mention I really should have mentioned it at the top of this video but and I could record a new introduction once I have it finished mmhmm I guess I could just reference it now is fine okay okay nothing nobody's complained yet anywhere I'm getting a youtube notification that the ukulele channels that I watch as a new video out oh sorry I'm just gonna go and learn to play the song with ukulele okay if you are getting a ukulele notification right now that means we watch the same ukulele channel alright so I think it's probably fine for me to just reference this video now I meant to reference this at the top but that's fine so let me come back alright now if you want to learn more or CS sort of like condensed version of the explanation of what the tesseract is and how this works I would highly recommend this for me that's I'm making this coding challenge because of this particular video from how do you pronounce that anybody know how you say this what's the chance let me that's the chance that hold on lay OS o at layoffs OS I supremum Leo's Leos OS yes Leo's OS okay hello a rom well I lost the channel I'm in the wrong place lay Oz OS lay Oz OS lay Oz OS is that correct Alka why am i recording this again don't you have no the time just disappear just do the same thing over and over and over again lay Oz OS alright alka is typing oh I'm just guessing Oh may i oh yes all right Leo's OS all right I just have to guess I actually just messaged him to ask how to pronounce is gentle but I don't think I ever reply yet okay Leo's OS okay Leah Leah Leo's all right all right all right all right all right I've got to move on okay that's Tim Tim that's very funny Tim right there Android OS okay okay okay figure out how to pronounce it I'm gonna guess lay offs OS but there's a wonderful wonderful YouTube channel with many excellent explanatory videos and this one about understanding 40 the tesseract is excellent so you can pause this go watch that come back later all the above okay alright so now I think we're good we're good I minimize the browser and here I am okay all right now ah what do I need the first thing I need to do if I'm going to make something 4d to do something in 3d I make heavy use of this idea of a P vector which is a data structure that holds an X Y and a Z I need something that could hold an X Y to Z and W for that fourth dimension so I'm gonna make a new tab and I'm gonna call it P for vector and I'm gonna say class P P for vector and I'm going to say it has an X Y Z and W and it needs a constructor and it can get an X a Y as E and a W and then I'm gonna say X equal this dot X this is it fun when you have to use the Vista in Java cuz it's like so rare and then every once in a while you do Z W X Y Z W so now this is my P fourvector all right P for vector there we go and now I am going to make this cube this very cube all the points of the cube and actually one thing I want to do just just I'll leave it right now I'm gonna make it in 4000 0 0 the fourth dimension and then while I'm adding the fourth dimension I got to change these P for vector okay then I've got to change this P for vector P for vector P for vector and now okay this stuff I'm going to worry about later and let's see we're gonna watch it's gonna be four dimensions now everybody here comes four dimensions look away oh oh so this is the same exact cube right it's the same is that four dimensions oh I'm so confused huh well how are you gonna see this fourth dimensional first of all I all the points are on zero so what you can think about it is it's flat I took a four dimensional shape and flattened it flattened it you know we say flat cuz usually taking a three dimensional shape and flattening it into 2d so a cube if you flatten it would just be a square so I took this hypercube and flattened it and I just have the cube so I need to make the hypercube okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make mmm all right oh boy oh boy you know what I'm gonna guess my better judgment I'm just gonna extend this array to have 16 points right a hypercube is made up of 16 vertices because it's basically two cubes with all the points connected so I am going to I was gonna make like a cube object and hypercube is two cubes but I'm gonna just keep going so I'm gonna say 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and then I'm actually going to put this in 4d so all of these zeros right these should all be 100 these should all be 100 and then I'm gonna put the rest of them at negative 1 ER I know I'm doing this highly in a highly manual way but first of all I find it kind of relaxing sometimes just a CEREC copypaste the same thing over and over again you should try it it's very soothing and then also I can always refactor it later but just to like really know that it's working okay so I've got 16 fourdimensional points I am going to now draw again okay so it just looks like those points what's missing here well I'm not actually doing the projection so now it's time for me like I'm just taking the 4d point ignoring that VW part and then doing a projection so really what I need to do right now is think about how I do the projection so we have this idea of a projection matrix now I'm not going to go too much into detail of this you can watch my previous video where I made the 3d projected into 2d but basically the idea here is that if I have a four dimensional point X Y and I'm drawing that way too high did the camera get lower at some point like I don't know I'll leave the camera there cuz probably did i just mess up the focus just good I have I'm gonna try out what I was saying now I'm gonna create a projection matrix for a 4d point so this is the point x y wz the projection matrix to take a 4d point and turn it into a weight X Y Z W and project it into something that I can draw into 3d X Y Z the idea is like I want to look at the shadow of the 4d object in 3d just like I might look at the shadow of a 3d object in 2d so to do that I need a matrix that has four columns and 3 rows so the typical way to do that would be like this Z 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 I think I got everything the idea here if I actually use this matrix and perform matrix multiplication which link to two videos where I go through that or detail this actually gives me literally this it's like just chopping off the W so let's actually put this in our code and see what happens so I'm going to create up sudden okay so I'm gonna create a matrix now one thing I didn't mention is I'm working with a help set of helper functions and I work these functions out as a separate video if you're interested but it's not too much to wait too much to be in this video that has actually the matrix multiplication math in it as well as some helper stuff to do matrix multiplication with the matrix and a vector I'm gonna have to change this to P for vector I'm just realizing that but that's no problem okay so what I first want to do is create that projection matrix so I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm just gonna do it right here as a local variable and it'll make it a little bit later will sort of make sense why so I'm gonna say afloat projection equals so I need to make that matrix which is or an array of arrays so there are three rows 0 1 0 0 and then 0 1 0 0 1 0 this is the equivalent of orthographic projection if you've heard that term before okay so now we've done that then what I'm gonna say is P for vector P for actually P vector I don't need it to be a P for vector I'm taking the 3d point P vector projected equals matrix multiplication the projection times V okay so now it's telling me it doesn't know how to do matrix multiplication with a projection matrix and V which is a P for vector which is strange because if I go in here it as a function with a two matrix multiply a two dimensional array and a P vector but I need this to be a vector matrix ah doesn't know how to make a P for vector so I'm just going to change these functions to two to deal with 3d 4d sorry m3 equals B W so again if you want to see where I have a separate video where I wrote all this code and now I'm just adjusting it to add this fourth dimension and then matrix to Veck and us matrix to Veck is going to be yeah you know what I'm gonna always be doing this you know this is fine this stays the same so that stays the same because I still want what I'm gonna get is a 3d vector inside a matrix I don't want to turn into a P vector so let's see so nobody's complaining at me and and now I want to look at the projected points projected projected projected here we go oh what's wrong here vector matrix array index out of bounds exception where I have an error somewhere where is this called here oh this has to be a four this has to be a four so I forget that I'm in Java and I really have to specify types and lengths of things so that has to be a four is there anywhere else where I need to do that we'll find out soon enough okay let's try this one more time we're entering the fourth dimension why there are eight points in four dimensions well guess what if I took a cube and I showed it to you an orthographic projection facing the camera basically it would look like just four points the four points on the back of the cube would be sitting right exactly behind the four points of the front and you wouldn't see that as different same thing is going on here so what I actually need is not orthographic projection I need stereographic projection I need to create that perspective and the way to do that is with moving a sort of thinking of a light source that has a certain distance from the object that I'm casting a shadow so I'm going to create a variable did since and this is going to be you know one thing I really should do is I'm gonna take all these 100's and make them just the number one so I'm going to normalize my shape to just have all ones this looks like a completely insane person wrote this code and in fact a completely insane person did write that code so that way so I'm gonna think of the camera as to give sort of units away and then the projection W is one divided by that distance minus V V dot W this is a sort of triedandtrue formula for creating perspective projection and then I can put that W in here and now let's see what happens oh I'm so close I'm so close so I forgot that all my numbers are 1 so I'm just gonna scale there's so far i two ways i could scale things up but i'm just gonna do it right here so i multiply by 100 and now what kind of looks like sort of looks like that tesseract thing wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a sec oh this is crazy oh I gotta connect the lines so first of all I need more I guess I should make this smaller let's make this 50 do you see it that's that tesseract looking thing the fourth event so what kind of what is uh so if brains can't do this I'm connecting it will help I'm gonna connect all the lines let's do that so I'm gonna so I had a function that connects all the edges I think I did this in the video where I was just making a cube and these are p4 vectors now or no they're not they're still P vectors and so but I need to connect the oh I need to make all right I really everything's gonna be ok everybody I'm gonna make an array P vector projected projected 3d which is an array is a new P vector also with 16 points in it and I'm just gonna take projected 3d index I there's no index I'm gonna add an index cuz I'm not amusing this enhanced loop I probably should just make it a four loop let's make it a four loop I got time to do that you'll watch me do this for int I equals zero I is less than point length I plus plus and then P for vector V equals points index I so I'm manually iterating through it because now I can have this index and then with this index here I can say I equals that projected V projected and then I can I could still draw these here but now I can say projected 3d so I want to connect the various points there and so now I should see oh that's just one oh right because I got to do this twice oh no I got to do this all the way oh this is confusing I got to use the second half of the array which would be from like 8 to 12 I don't know oh I equals 8 that's not right 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 4 because if I want all the Obagi lists oh modulus 4 plus 8 oh I'm really I've made a I made a horror show out of this ok I went out of bounds stop the presses I have to I have to rethink this before I do the connection stuff is like I should do that from scratch let me take the connection stuff out I think that's gonna be way too confusing mmm and I can go back although let me just go back here so this worked right if I just had to separate I should just make two separate arrays turn anything what's the best way to explain this oh I just had one off okay okay let me stop here let me go from here okay I now realized that I'd not to do this I try to have my videos to be very selfcontained and there's a you know there's a few things that you might have to watch a previous video for but it's worth explaining this just for a second so basically what I did in this connect function is this is a connect function to just take two of the points and draw a line between them and to draw a cube right normally I might just say box or begin shape and shape and it's gonna sort of like make all these connections for me but what I'm doing what I'm doing is I basically have points 0 1 2 3 4 5 actually it's 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so that function is basically saying connect 0 and 1 connect 1 and to connect 2 & 3 connects 3 and 0 connect 4 & 5 connect 5 & 6 connect 6 & 7 connect 7 & 4 and then connect 0 & 4 1 & 5 2 & 6 3 & 7 that's what that function is doing and so now I have two of them if I have another one basically you know it's it's along the fourdimensional axis I don't even know where to draw that so first of all all of its points start at eight nine ten eleven twelve and this is not one somebody watching this will give me a some nice adjust about a completely refactor this in a better way but you can see now I just need to connect these so well the way that I think I'm gonna approach that is by I'm gonna add another I think if I just add like an offset like I can add an offset this is kind of silly here and then that offset could be 0 and then that offset could be could be 7 right because then I just want to do this and so this would just be I plus offset J plus offset so if I do this twice and again I could do this in one loop right I could add an offset that's 8 is it 8 I think it's eight there we go so now you can see I've connected both cubes so now interestingly enough where what's the fourth dimension with this kind of perspective the fourth dimension is actually like is w W is expressed as kind of a distance between these cubes I mean again we can only think about it I can only describe it to you in three dimensional terms so for example you see this here like if I were to put one of these points like at negative 5 look it's all the way out there so this hypercube isn't perfectly symmetrical one of the points it's W location is all the way out along that axis and I could make that it's a variable and I could slide it around and do stuff like that but I'm not going to do that what I want to do next so one thing is I really want to make all the connections so the nice thing is the lat hook I'm trippin I really want to make all the connections so the nice thing is the last set of connections is pretty easy whoops ah a William Wester says I've never once seen a good tesseract representation everyone gets the occlusion wrong am I getting the occlusion wrong so I'm just doing whatever else does oh boy everybody's giving me suggestions okay okay all right okay all right I really want I threw out what I was I'm gonna try to back up even though that's probably unnecessary all right what I really want to do is I want to I want to see all the connections it's gonna be I want the the edges of one bounding cube need to be connected to the other bound like you've they're not really bound to get oh it's so confusing I want all right I haven't actually finished the connections though because what I want here is I need to connect all these points to those points for the visualization to be fully complete that's actually gonna be pretty easy because all I'm doing it my array of 16 points zero connect to eight one connect to nine four connect to twelve five connect to three so that's actually easy that's just a another loop all the way through all the points and I'm gonna have with an offset of zero I connected to I plus eight so this should do that last set of connections whoops no something's wrong here oh no no only I need to go through half the points cuz the first half of connect to the second one all right is this right this looks right to me oh why is it going towards the center something is wrong here okay something is wrong let me think about this I goes to I plus eight and I do them in the same order pretty sure that I did this is the problem you do things manually what's wrong something is wrong here let's take out these connections and these connections maybe that'll help us see it yeah what's wrong here anybody have any idea you connected 0 to 13 to 212 0 to 8 1 to 9 opposite vertices oh oh yeah yeah loop through every vertex and calculate distance to the other vertices and connect the ones with distance of 1 oh that's it oh that's really smart oh that's really smart what an awesome idea I'm connecting the furthest corner so what is it is it like like 16 I or something plus 1 no no minus 1 I mean which will be 15 no whoo that's not right that's closer all right let's just let's figure out so zero let's connect from so 0 to 8 is there oh yeah so that should be 0 to 4 no no not 0 to 4 that's 0 to 12 0 to 6 to 15 is that right no 0 to 11 I'm guessing vertices oh my god I'm losing my mind you see your zero connects to that one which is which one is it robear can you see my solutions use the nearest neighbor idea it's really a cool idea 16 minus I minus 2 15 minus I 0 to 13 everyone's giving me excellent suggestions draw index as text on vertices that's such a cool idea all right let's try that text I always get stuck with these little things all right okay hold on let's not draw the points or Elbe let's do rotate you billboard them whoops okis oops that's the rotations in the wrong place sorry there we go okay and let me make the text size and fill 255 I can make it bigger okay all right so this I'm gonna match here this will be a part where I'll come back into the video yeah at some point it'll get cut and I'll come back to here because I think this is a good because I can see it's eight two six nine two seven ten to four fourteen to zero I mean I could just do the distance of one thing which kind of makes sense but yeah zero to fourteen 115 five to eleven yeah it's a weird it's like a weird formula alright okay so I was debugging that for a little while and I was making me crazy and so someone in the chat suggests to just draw the points as numbers so you can see I did this here I actually added a little code to draw the index I um and so now I can look at this and I can see okay zero should be connected to 14 1 to 15 5 to 11 4 to 10 3 to 13 2 to 12 but there's definitely a pattern there but but but but I think actually a nut someone else in the chat I wish I could remember the chat scrolling back so fast the name suggested you you know what you just want to connect every vertices every vertex that has a distance of 1 so actually this is a great idea I can actually eliminate this entire nonsense loop basically and I'm gonna I'm gonna do that let's try that right so what I'm gonna say is for every I'm gonna I'm gonna do it a nested loop for every I equals 0 I is less than points at length I plus plus then I'm gonna start with I plus 1 because I don't need to check a point against itself J is less than point points dot length J plus plus now what I need to do is calculate the distance between those points so I'm going to say float distance equal distance for D between and let's just put those in P for vector a equals P for vector a equals points index I P for vector B equals points index B so I am now going to calculate the distance for D between a and B oh guess what there's no distance for D function I will make one I'm gonna put it here on my helper function page I'm gonna say float distance for D I get a P for vector P for P for vector a this actually would make more sense on the P for vector tab so let's write this here and I could obviously make it a function that's a part of the class but P for vector B and so now what I need to do is I need to do D X equals ax minus B X dy equals a dot y minus B dot y I'm going to do this pretty manually just the difference between all the dimensions that's a W this is just Euclidean distance but in four dimensions then I need to say return the square root of DX times DX plus dy times dy plus DZ times DZ and you know forget the fact that this is kind of inefficient there's probably ways I could optimize this it's gonna work so now if if if T equals one then connect and this function is so silly I don't need the offset anymore shouldn't need that offset then connect I I and J points and these are not points these are not the points at all these are the projected 3d ones oh wait a second no no I want the distance between the points huh and then but I I'm checking the distance between those points but I'm connecting the corresponding ones in the projected 3d array so this is the BP fourvector no no this is pvector oh it's so confusing points J project dead 3d okay right I'm looking at the piece the 4d values seeing their distance then connecting the corresponding ones let's see Hey look it's all numbers uh hold on a sec everybody I must have made a mistake somewhere so let me let me get rid of all this let me put this back to just the points I want to believe that it's gonna work okay so the points are there I'm not seeing any of the cannot seeing any of the connections yes I can pre calculate the connections in setup that is a very good point let's see what kind of distance values am I getting is it doing some sort of rounding thing where it's not actually equal to one okay so first of all I think I meant to say two distances too because I they're actually like the the distance is two because I'm from the center the each along each axis I'm extruding by one both directions the distance is two not one there we go because I'm drawing them flipped yeah I didn't work who's gonna get this whole swabs are gonna get edited out and I guess I could just manually do the what why I was really thinking it would be so easy to connect our negative and inverted row bears like said there's like 15 times the brothers this chat scrolls by very fast so unless I could capture somebody can capture something and put it into the smaller slack channel because I can't catch it so they're inverted I'm gonna try to scroll back its 32 edges so it should be like the opposite one I should just made it 2 and I need to look at the projection the projection point you're using is making the negative ones get projected to the opposite side of the zero point so could I actually change that in the projection like you know some weird thing like this or something yeah I can scroll that's a good point just go back to the old message using 16 minus I minus 2 and 3 perhaps the points are value are correct what they're represented rotated okay I'm gonna try to figure this out myself all right that was a nice digression and was interesting to solve but didn't actually do anything let me just comment this out for right now wait I need my connections back I need my connections back I deleted them I was so confident so hold on let me put this somewhere else just to save this this was a digression that I maybe I'm gonna go back track and I'm gonna go back stop I'm gonna go back to where I just had the numbers let's see how far processing will let me undo not very far huh okay all right I'm back to this so okay let me just allow myself to control this completely I'm gonna write these down isn't the distance between connection from between all zero for two every time somebody will figure this out somebody much smarter than me we'll figure this out I look forward to that day okay let's see I'm going all the way back to where I was just explaining about the text so you can just cut out huge amounts of stuff hi oh it's a weird edit point probably cuz I mean like I just spent and if you want to watch I'll link to the live stream where I just probably spent like a half an hour trying to figure out a pattern here and I'm sure there is one and somebody watching this video will come up with one but what I did to debug this I think I'll make our lives a little easier is first I just decided to write instead of drawing points for all those points I'm just drawing the index value of the array using the text function and translate into that projected location and then I also just made the angle the mouse X so I could control this so I can actually write this down I'm gonna get a piece of paper or I could put it as notes in my code but I feel like a piece of paper would really be just like an exciting moment here on the coding train but I have like a whiteboard or something to write this stuff down okay so now let's look at this nine connects to seven ten connects to four I should really start with one or zero where zero let's let's go and order zero connects to 14 that makes sense one connects to 15 that makes sense where's that 11 no no that's one two connects to 12 the pattern is going to come up I expect three connects to 13 for connects to 10 then we could speed this up I guess this part up connects five connects to eleven five goes to 11 six connects to eight and seven connects to what's the only one left should be nine right nine okay guess what here's a way to write this code now guess what to do connect zero I still need that offset thing right zero 0 14 projected 3d oh this is lovely oh this is so beautiful this code 0 14 115 212 yes I'm doing this 3/3 I'm not looking at the chat I don't want it I don't want it I don't want to hear it you don't want to hear it 6 8 I'm starting to see the pattern is coming into my head 7 9 and now this looks good this looks good let's put those points back in let's take out this text I'm gonna leave that in there just like comment it in the code and let's put this back in I'm gonna just let it rotate automatically now and we are entering the fourth dimension okay we're finally ready for something exciting sort of alright so what's what's the deal here no look at this how am i rotating that how the shape is spinning in 3d I want to do 4d rotations 4d rotations so this is now the moment we're going to start to get something pretty interesting visually going on where I now want to create not a projection matrix but a rotation matrix so here's the thing in 2d a 2d I I want to draw up here but I don't think you can see it I'm gonna draw it here if we go and and I'm gonna go to a Wikipedia page rotation matrix we're gonna see that a rotation matrix looks something like this and I'm gonna write this down duplicate this over here because we're gonna want to memorize this it's cosine of the angle a negative sine of the angle and then I already forgot it's sine of the angle cosine in a way of course and if we were to take this rotation matrix and multiply it by an XY point this is basically doing regular plane rotation in twodimensional space based on an angle and that's what happens when you've just in P 2d you just call rotate it's applying a rotation matrix like this so if I scroll down further onto this page we can start to see oh look at this wrote I mean it's going on look at this these are like 3d rotations around the xaxis we put a 1 in the first spot and then we have that sort of like four rotation values in the bottom right because it is rotating around the x axis using the y and z axes this is rotating around the y axis using the using the x and z so this is the idea that I need to extrapolate to four dimensions so now if I want to rotate in four dimensions I would just put cosine theta negative sine theta zero zero sine theta cosine theta 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 this is the idea this is now a rotation matrix that will rotate you can see well rotate around the X using the XY axes x and y no Z no W so this should look sort of familiar to us if we apply this in the code so let's go to the code and I'm going to this is this is the important part right this is where I'm doing the projection now I want to rotate before I project so I'm going to create a p4 vector oh boy we're gonna need some more vector math stuff rotated equals matrix multiplication a rotation matrix times V and my rotation matrix I'm gonna copy paste this and I'm gonna make a rotation matrix it's going to have a cosine of the angle negative sine of the angle sine of the angle cosine of the angle a 1 and then a 1 this is I'm sticking with 4 dimensions here right so this should give me a 4d point out of it I'm just rotating that 4d point according to the XY axis all right the problem is my nice beautiful mat mol function doesn't know how to we stop for a second I can't overload this I want this to be matrix to Veck for the rejection is missing the brackets and it makes me sad the 4th rotation is wrong okay all right hold on I'm to work out the matrix multiplication but everybody's blaring at me that I have mistakes in my code separate from that so let's fix those this is wrong thank you this needs to be a zero and then in the projection something is wrong in the projection your projection is missing the brackets and it made me sad where where yeah zero zero zero zero zero zero one all right I fixed that zero zero one thing you guys are so far behind me in time me I am so Mia's typing W equals 1 divided by distance oh that's been wrong all along parentheses we call those parentheses for 45 point I just fixed this mistake and then I was like sitting here and I think this is like a major error I don't know how it happened to work that those parentheses need to be there this formula has been wrong for a very long time in this video it's fixed now let me for a second then just get rid of the rotation and just make sure everything still looks kind of normal ish okay that's what was messing up those connections could that really be true I'll have to go way back in time is interesting that digression though to like debug it in that way it was useful don't mind me I'm just over here checking something just ignore me just over here checking something [Laughter] if I could turn back okay okay this is a good thing because the actual finished version of this video there was a point so here's the thing in fear I'm gonna you know I'm gonna just go back I'm gonna take this out is we're nice interesting digressions I hate to lose them but I'm losing them I'm gonna put this mistake back in so this is actually this is the point I need to go back to oh do the to distance thing so now I could do the to distance thing this is actually the point I can go back to don't go back I'm not going back really I'm just gonna excise all that out of the final edited version of this coding challenge which would be sad I guess and I could do the nearest neighbors yes I know I could do the nearest neighbor stuff I will mention that oh oh boy all right oh hell oh no not I can do the Olo thing that's too much of a cliche we're gonna do this this will work well okay so that was like a very abrupt edit I will link to the live stream where I am currently right now live doing this coding challenge you just I've just probably edited out about 45 minutes of doing all sorts of crazy debugging I was doing some stuff I was putting numbers where they were trying to figure out the connections and there was actually just a bug which you may have already noticed and been typing in the comments or shouting at me or maybe just singing it to me in a lovely friendly way this was a mistake this here this formula for doing the aah this here this formula for doing the perspective projection needs to have parentheses here because I'm saying 1 divided by the distance from the camera minus the actual W point not 1 divided by distance the W point that's the actual formula you can go watch that any other material about the that you'll find that formula ok so now if I do that now this looks like I expected it to look like and in fact up during that time I also tried a different solution which I would recommend doing as an exercise to yourself one thing that was pointed out by the chat whoops let me just oh nice I was afk for 45 minutes you know what since the camera went off and I all tabbed into this page that I didn't mean to alt tab into one more one once more with feeling once more with feeling okay so abrupt edit you're watching if you're watching this not watching this live you're watching a recorded version just spent about 45 minutes trying to debug a problem when I went off completely in the wrong direction well it was a really interesting that's interesting tangents like courage I'll link to the time code of the livestream where you either watch that whole part but I was trying to figure out why these points aren't connecting properly and I started doing things like drawing numbers where all the points were and also stuff but actually the mistake which you may have already seen and been singing to me about it perhaps um is right here there needs to be parentheses here the formula for the perspective projection requires one minus one divided by the distance minus the actual W point as soon as I put that in now all of the points are in the right place and those connections are doing what they should do I though the actual drawn points are a little bit too large for my taste right now I'm gonna take this to eight and this looks better now okay so there we can see there's our hypercube in 3d sort of okay gonna take a deep breath here cuz there's a lot of stuff and I got to figure out where I am Oh oh yes rotation okay pause for a second nurse somebody actually sponsored this Thank You Alec bear off so here's the thing oh yeah so okay before I get to rotation actually let me just mention one more thing about this it was pointed out in the chat by many people that instead of like trying to write some kind of kooky nonsensical crazy person algorithm like I did here to figure out where all the connections are that you could actually just test for unit distance between the points right because you think about a square right you don't connect the diagonals because they're not distance they'd have a different distance so if I look at the distance between all the points I'll find all the connections there so that's an interesting side project for any of you as an exercise to do while you're watching this but I want to talk about rotation now while I was debugging I can't talk about it again so there's some stuff the white porcupine ever go race it pause oh this cameras off so I think I have to do the rotation explanation again because I don't see any other way of approaching it there's now that I have it fixed I mean we could edit out of order time sequence wise but this is gonna be a big project good thing I'm going away by the way I'm going away for like three weeks but still have a lot of time to edit this I also could just start over and do it again but I think this this coding challenge so what was in here before it was just the it was just the yeah it was the projection matrix okay great okay okay here we are alright so how is this even rotating in the first place how is it rotating in the first place tonight so I like that thing where I move to point out yeah it made sense okay I think that's in there sorry all right okay so how is this rotation even happening in the first place I'm rotating in the third dimension which is not really what I want to do I want to rotate in the fourth dimension then project that down to the third dimension so let's let's try to back up let's try to create exactly this by rotating in the fourth dimension and then projecting back down to the third dimension the reason why I'm not actually doing the rotation in the fourth dimension is because the rotation is happening right here with the builtin native rotate Y function that means rotating around the y axis so how does rotation actually happen well rotation happens with a rotation matrix so here I am on the wikipedia page and you can see this rotation matrix right here so let's come back over here and let's think about that so this is a rotation matrix cosine of theta negative sine of the sine of theta cosine of theta did I get that right looks like I did alright so this is a 2d rotation matrix if I were to take this rotation matrix and do matrix multiplication with any given 2d point this is exactly the math behind rotate in processing bike data this is exactly that so then what is the math behind rotate Y or rotate X or rotate Z and in fact it is indeed also a rotation matrix only it's 3x3 rotation matrix and in fact if I come over here on this Wikipedia page about rotation matrices and keep scrolling keep scrolling and keep scrolling and scrolling there we go here it is this is the rotation matrix for around the y axis and you can see a pattern here right that's that 2d rotation but it's here within the y&z which is rotating on the x axis same pattern but between the X and the Z between the X and the y that's how I get all those different rotations but I want to do this in four dimensions so what I need to do rotation in four dimensions is the following I need to pick which axes I want and I need a four by four matrix and in this case the axes that I want I'm going to use the x and y axes and I'm gonna say cosine theta negative sine theta sine theta cosine theta so this is o and this has to be a 1 apologies and this has to be a 1 right because it's the identity matrix for y&z basically the identity being heard just a 1 in those in those areas so I don't know if that's actually the right way to phrase it back away so this is the rotation matrix I'm going to call this 4 4 D this is rotation X Y so let's and actually what I was doing rotate Y would be XZ but anyway let's come back and now try to add that in so what I'm going to do now go back to my code I'm gonna comment out the rotate Y and instead oh look it's already in there take that out so I forgot I did this earlier hold on I'm gonna go back to my code and I'm gonna comment out this rotate Y so now there is no rotation for free from processing I'm just seeing the hypercube the 4d hypercube projected into 3d I am going to create whoops this just shouldn't be here what I was feeling okay come back to the computer I'm going to comment out rotate Y so now there's no rotation and actually I'm going to start with just to be clear I'm gonna start with rotate X no rotate Z I think that'll be the simplest so I'm gonna start with rotate Z so I'm gonna recreate exactly this this doesn't look super interesting because of how flat it is but I'm that's what I'm gonna start with so let me because I think that'll be the easiest one to do I want to recreate that with a matrix so the first thing I have to do is before I do the projection I have to create a rotation matrix and I'm going to call this XY rotation and that is going to equal a matrix that has I forgot already cosine of the angle negative sine of the angle 0 0 sine of the angle cosine of the angle 0 0 and then 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 so this is my rotation X Y matrix autoformat there we go rotation X Y matrix now I want to say you know what I can do here actually so I'm thinking I'm thinking Oh layoffs OS Thank You Laelius OS is in the chat eyes right mispronounced earn the name of your channel earlier apologies for that then we could dub that in or if I end up doing another intro to this ok ok so now what I need to do is I need to say P for vector right I want to get a rotated point which is the rotation which is the matrix multiplication result of the rotation matrix XY with V that point V now this is telling me it doesn't know how to do this so I have member I have all those helper functions the helper functions do these matrix multiplication operations well I do have a helper function that does alright does look at this it does I was like oh look it does this a matrix times a p4 vector I have that but look at it it returns a P vector because I have the one to give me a 3 3 P vector back I should probably just leave everything as p4 vectors would make our life so much easier there's not really any reason for me to use P vector at this point because I can always but I'm gonna iii've done what I've done I mean we can think about refactoring it later which is like a little bit of my mantra and I'm going to say this still works so I want to say if so this is matrix Tyvek I need another one of these which does I'm just gonna write this function I don't think I need this anymore because it's always gonna have three dimensions that was sort of an extra thing just to simplify this I'm gonna make another function that's going to be called matrix to Veck 4 and I make a pee 4 vector and then I'm gonna say V dot W is this so I made a different function and this returns a p4 vector P 4 vector so I just made a helper function that takes 8 oh I don't have that up 0 0 0 0 that basically takes a takes a matrix that has one column right this is what it is it's a matrix with one column in four rows and turns this into a p4 vector I need that because down here I now want to say I'm gonna say result equals mat mole a and M and then I'm going to say if result dot length so how many rows do I have four rows are not equals four then return oh no wait I can't return two different types I just have to do this ah Java is a weird place right I can't return something of a different type so I'm gonna just pass a boolean in I'm gonna pass I'm gonna pass our dimensions like int dim so I don't even need to figure it out if dimensions equal 4 oh no it's the same problem oh oh I can oh no I could just overload it all right I'm gonna overload sorry everybody so this is sorry for this digressions making this video extra long this is what it was before right returning a a matrix to Veck oh no return sorry sorry everybody this there this is what it was before now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to just this is very awkward but I'm gonna add I'm gonna say a boolean or forth this is sort of silly and now I'm just gonna say matrix Tyvek 4 and it returns a P 4 vector ok so I made two versions of this function this is very silly I should just made it but but it is what it is ok can we get back to what we were doing which was important so now I'm gonna say Matt mole rotation X Y true so this should return a 4d vector then now I want to get the W of the rotated vector right because I'm about to calculate the projection matrix I don't want to use the original point I want to use the point that's been calculated after the rotation and now we should see no wait sine of angle angle hmm P for vector what did I do wrong aha I projected V again so this down here needs to be rotated also there we go I have now created exactly zero tation with my own rotation matrix oh we're getting really close everybody this is very exciting so now now I have a rotation XY just to prove a point let's do rotation what was the one we saw with it's spinning like this let's do rotation X Z meaning a zero goes here meaning a one goes here the zero goes here this is how I like now let's look at this is this right I think this is rotation with X and Z 1 in the Y and 1 in the W so let's now change that to XZ here and look there we go I have it just rotating around what looks like the y axis okay what if I want to apply more than one rotation so here I've rotated by XZ now I can just rotate again by rotating by X Y what's wrong here multiply rotation X Y by rotated true oh so I don't want to read eclair the variable and here we go now we see both rotation okay but everything still feels very much like all I did was make two 3d cubes and connect the corners so that's what you're seeing right because that's the shadow of what the four dimensional shape in our only way our brains can process 3d but let's really try to stretch our brains for a second what if I include this is really where things are gonna go nuts what if I include the W axis what does it mean to rotate around the W axis think about that for a second okay rotate around the Y rotate around the X right eight around the z move can't even that W axis that was kind of like extruder who knows what that's even gonna be let's see what that looks like we are now really about to enter the fourth dimension okay let's try what do I want XW I don't know what's a good one to start with let's try X W so I'm gonna make a rotation matrix X W okay here we go so X then a zero goes here then that stays the same then this should be in the bottom and a zero goes here get rid of this comma get rid of this zero and then the one goes here so let's actually just for I'm afraid to add too many rotations so X Z let's do X W and then let's comment these out so I am only using rotation around the X W access this isn't right something is wrong there did something interesting though all right what's it that oh you know what most people do I think actually is uh not ZW so let's do the W let's put this here and then these go away I mean I just want to see that I'm doing this correctly and then this would be 1 0 0 1 so let's try ZW let's see what this does okay this is actually correct now it looks really weird but I think I think I'm gonna be able to fix this I'm just gonna do something really quickly just as a test I just wanna like rotate it on its side mmm I'm gonna be this side no something is still wrong I've done something wrong all right I'm looking at the chat why do I be rotated a bit around yeah I've done something wrong cosine negative sine sine cosine rotation ZW you know I just this really shouldn't matter but I just want to check something real quick oh boy I just changed every number 1 that was a bad idea don't do that hold on I just broke too many things cuz if I'm worried about that I could just make this this what have I done wrong projection yes so let me let me do what what is typically seen would be this now it's not right though it's interesting unless I actually and don't like to take this off now something is off let me look at this other example I made the other day I'm not sure about my virtus I'm not sure about anything who asking are you sure about rotate X negative PI over 2 oh I just was looking at it from the wrong direction weird Thank You mr. Wiggles XZ is wrong so now I've got it order matters Oh order matters I mean I should just do this in one rotation matrix yeah same thing interesting 964 you still have a V well it's working now I just don't understand oh no no that's right so the first rotation the first rotation is off of V and then I just continue to rotate yeah so it's actually it's just I'm looking at it wasn't this wasn't what I saw when I originally did it though was it when I originally did it seamless no oh I have lost track of where I was I mean don't get me wrong I was just gonna do all the rotations XY XZ ZW we could just keep going with craziness well now I'm gonna wait til the sound dies down color the points and lines that would be nice no I'm just just noise in the hallway what time is it it's only 6 o'clock I'm just trying to think of where I should go back to mmm because there was the point where I would I want to go back to is when I thought I did the fourth dimension the first time oh maybe that was just this weird yeah I'm definitely want to make the rotation interactive and everything I'm just trying to think I don't know where I I don't remember where I where I was cuz I could go back on you look good someone go back like ten minutes in the wolf livestream I was trying to do XY and Z W right when I did XY and z w wasn't that where I said I'm entering the fourth dimension and then that I tried then did I try to and it was that but then did I do this we're trying to find though the place where it like looked oh yeah yeah this is where I was okay yeah I just went to the wrong side got it alright okay it's just a viewing angle yeah okay okay so guess what this is actually correct I just had the wrong viewing angle so like basically what we're doing right now if I if I just do the two rotations the at sorry there's something over here that noise is so distracting give me a second people so okay yeah but sir I'm just waiting for the sound to die down which might be a lost cause let me take a look outside okay that's a while Scott let's do B they'll be sound in the video that's the problem okay why this was a hard problem now I understand why people who make youtube videos they like script things and practice they dig like a whole week to make something someday okay so I'm back again I was trying to figure out why this is wrong and then I realized oh this is actually right it's I just I'm used to seeing a certain pattern and I've just got the viewing angle slightly wrong or slightly different so basically let me comment this line rotate Y out the two rotations that I'm doing right now are X Y Z W and if we do that without just natively the way that I drew the cube you sort of see the Z rotation and that W rotation that in in the projection of the 3d world is like kind of coming in and out almost looks like breathing and so what I actually want to do is just rotate it on the x axis to put things on the side and I could do that with a rotation matrix because I have a full 3d renderer I'm going to say rotate X negative pi divided by 2 and there we go now this should look like the tesseract visualization that you're used to seeing this is that W rotation like rotating and by the way we have now entered you know there's a little bit anticlimactic I guess but here we're done this coding challenge is complete and I just want to stop I'm not gonna do any more because I'm gonna leave this for you let's think about let's think about all the kinds of things you could do to this to make this more beautiful or interesting or weird first of all you know what are all sorts of other rotation matrices you can apply like what's like a three axis rotation you could certainly do that right what multi how many this is a double rotation cuz you do a triple or quadruple what if you try a bunch of different other axes with the W axis you know I'm just drawing these little points and connecting them with lines there are probably so many other ways you could think to visualize the pattern of the tesseract you can now enter the fourth dimension projected into the third dimension and see a result I will try to make a JavaScript version of this with the p5.js library has a WebGL renderer so that will be released also with this uncoding challenge and there was something else that I just thought of a second ago Oh I will try to make a JavaScript version I will make up jobs I will also make a JavaScript version of this using the p5 just library which has a WebGL renderer although in theory I don't even need a 3d renderer because I could project the 4d points to 3d and then project the 3d points to do t 2d if you really want a hard problem try doing that ah but really I ask you how many how what dimension can you can you project down into three dimensions and visualize can you get up to five six seven what happens so I encourage you I challenge you to try all sorts of weird stuff to make some beautiful art and enjoy spending time in the fourth dimension okay that music better not get me a copyright violation it says from a YouTube website that that's music you can use let's go double check let's find it otherwise I'm gonna redo this coding challenge again which actually would be fun to do now that I know all the mistakes that I made not you might tell me he I have to redo it which I would totally understand no not here not here not here not here where where did I did I closed that out oh no wait where is it no it's on the history audio library free music what did I do genre cinematic mood dark it's this one you're free to use this song and monetize your video all right oh you heard it here okay well I said I was gonna make a tesseract I made a test right now the question is let's just I need some I need a thumbnail let's make sure we have a good thumbnail I'm sure there was something in there but I just want to make it a little bigger let's do full screen P 3d and then I'm going to when I scale it up just do with / let's see what happens when you do that whoo what did I do oh no it's not sorry false the function is fullscreen okay that's not good let's try with / for that's close to what I was sort of hoping to see with divided by eight okay that looks good now what do I want too let's slow the angle down a little bit let's make the stroke wait for and the stroke wait like 16 let's try this okay there we go and maybe we should make this is it is it actually better without the points I just don't see what it looks like like I don't need to draw the points necessarily right yeah what do you think visually do you like it with the points there without the points misterwiggles what did I miss different color lines see I'm just curious what's this do here for a second that's kind of interesting all right III can't get I'm gonna let you be creative with color Oh strokeweight with distance to the camera meaning distance to the W okay I think I liked it better actually thin with some points this should be done here that's ugly what if I give these like some alpha does that what happens well it's kind of interesting okay uh all right so whatever that's fine visually I kind of want to add like another rotation I'm just curious just curious okay let me just add one more rotation like so if this is X y and this is Z W why don't I try Y W oh yeah there we go that's crazy just take out the if I just take out the CW now interesting so many possibilities all right all right all right all right right nothing's happening now I got tired and I started like distracting myself with but I'm gonna I'm gonna again the world is a much more creative place than me go back to here and I'm gonna do a little intro so how how long would you say has been the total amount of time I spent building this in the livestream and how do I say lay how do I say it again that the YouTube channel from James layoffs OS layoffs OS lay us OS okay okay all right so I don't know if this is necessary but Matthew you can use it if you want hello this coding challenge that you were about to watch this is the final result it is a 4d tesseract visualized in 3d also 40 tries again hello this coding challenge you're about to watch right here this is the final result it is a fourdimensional hypercube also known as a tesseract visualized in three dimensions but really in two dimensions on this twodimensional screen that you're watching this now so I just completed this coding challenge in a livestream the livestream was about 73 hours look full of debugging the coding challenge itself is much shorter it is kind of long but less stuff is edited out of like going off on debugging tangents if you're interested in seeing all those debugging 10 tangents you could check this video's description into a link to the live stream where I did this but also I just want to briefly mention thank you to what I'm gonna read it this introduction saying way too long layoffs OS I'm gonna try this one more time hello you are about to watch be careful a coding challenge for I where I make this this is a fourdimensional hypercube I mean not really but it is a four it mathematically it's a fourdimensional hypercube projected into 3d and then processing this computer program thing is taking that 3d math and then projecting it into 2d so you could look at it and see it anyway if you watch the whole coding challenge that what I just said there might actually make sense to you so um it took me a very long time to do this I had lots of problems what you're about to watch is still long but edited down if you want to see the full livestream which is three thousand four hundred and twenty two hours long you can find a link to that in this video's description also a big thank you to lay us OS the YouTube channel where there's a wonderful video about what is forty the hypercube I will link to that in this video description as well I mentioned also a coding challenge but I wanted to mention it right up front okay hope you enjoyed this coding challenging make it all the way to the end and you make your own version of this please share it with me goodbye I'll be not goodbye but goodbye right now for me and I'm gonna keep going okay I guess okay alright I am tired I need a moment I need a moment I'm gonna put on some music for you all I don't know what this one is some other free music I downloaded I'm gonna really build out my soundboard and I'm just gonna check I'm gonna check just some things to see what how much time I have if there's any emergencies I'm just checkin just checking a few things making sure there's no urgent messages for me from any of my other lives oh there was a message that I missed what time is that message I can't see here is this relaxing you this music I know where I put my phone Oh what message was from over an hour ago okay but I did reply to it all right I'm trying to decide if I have the stamina or energy to do anything else today let's take a look at some ml5 let's consider some other ml5 stuff I don't have my ukulele otherwise I did my ukulele tuner the feature extractor is too much for me to take on right now I think I probably should call it a night I think I have I mean pose net would be fun to do this is pose net by the way if you haven't seen this what's the natural what not the natural what's the sort of progression here if I think about if I think about what I've done in terms of these ml5 videos so I did intro to ml 5 wherever that is image classification and web can I at least can make a list of what are the things I intend to do so a work Tyvek that's gonna be in the fall now let's make a list here and to do the convolutional Network just trying to think here so did image classification you know anything I might do classify this I did plane image classification I did a miss class with webcam you do the feature extractor to make a classifier and do a regression think those are both kind of interesting LS TM text style transfer pics to pics these are all the things I could do pose net Yolo and word to Beck so weird to Beck that's gonna come in the fall so I'm gonna do that in my atoz course pics the pics and style transfer I have some plans for those but it's gonna involve a guest so that's also gonna be fall so these these are the options right now if I was gonna do more Alice T Anna's also I'm planning to do that later so I think I'll hold off on that because that's also for my fall class so the feature extractor opposed net and Yolo are the three things Yolo is really slow right now so I don't know to what extent let's run the example it's worth doing that as a video oh the camera is off person that's pretty cool cell phone cell phone is there a bell in Yolo person what about like a pencil sofa really things are cell phones and people okay I think I'm too exhausted from the 40 to do anything else I think I might so all right let's talk about time and schedule for a second I am I saw something like Tetris strawpoll it sees a hand holding something and thinks it's a cell phone that's super interesting that's a very good point so that's really at such a good point on alka makes in the chat and thinking about machine learning alright so I am going on vacation I will be away at a secret location with very little internet for almost three weeks there's other things going on in that time my vacation is in exactly three weeks but I will be not livestreaming next week the week after or the week after it's today August so this counts as a live stream but to live streams in August I will be back Tetris is not happening right now that's the lovely idea 600 615 I mean I just like I need to I need a fresh start so I won't be back so right now the edited versions of these videos will come out slowly over the next few weeks there's a good chance that I'm gonna be able to come back and do just like one more line when it's try to produce a little bit more content for a while I'm away tomorrow afternoon Saturday so I'm gonna try to stop by is gonna be around here in the neighborhood going from here to there and I'm able to stop in for a couple hours and I could do I think it would actually doing the feature extractor stuff it's sort of a big topic but it would be worth it I'm just trying the site is that the thing like the machine learning so I've gotta like work up slowly but I think actually feature the feature extractor is kind of the next thing so the question is the game of code writes in the chat Tetris doesn't take long to make it's pretty straightforward so the question is I mean I'm just sort of curious I will do a straw poll I'm not gonna do any of the topics right now but I could do something a bit more substantial tomorrow whoa is this the same thing I've always been using and they just like change this design or this is what I've been using yes that's what I always been using there's like straw pulled on me next topic so this is hard because it's gonna kind of need a runoff cuz really it's like I want to say it's like ml5 allow multiple options oh so you can vote for more than one thing I might allow that so you can kind of vote for like a cup or than one ml5 feature extractor so what the feature extractor is it allows you to basically do what's called transfer learning so take the mobile net model and say like hey you don't know about what a pencil is I'm gonna show you a lot of pencils and add that as a label to something you can recognize it's but there's a bit more to it than that obviously in terms of the limitations of what you can do ml5 pose net and Yolo another option would be tetris nor something else oh the doodle classifier and this is without ml5 with TF KS directly that would be doing convolutional neural net neural networks and I kind of wanted to make a bunch of processing sketches that show how the pieces network work but that would be part of that to you all right I don't so I think I just allowed people to check more than one which is a little bit silly because but if you're like really interested in ml so I don't know you guys can game try to game the system but here is the URL for the straw poll right I should have made you choose one this multiple I kind of wanted to make it you could only pick two but I guess can you see the results if I don't show them like I'm gonna go over here view results yeah anybody can see the results Oh what got interesting hopes you enjoy Tetris hey I'm not saying I'm gonna do what you vote for I'm just curious to know and I can't capably I'll put Tetris on there what have a steak sodoku salt over okay I mean the link someone can post it in the chat but there it is you should have put four rune I know I I almost feel like for a Tetris I can handle more than Goro annoying people are interested in that doodle classifier interesting it's pretty interesting results here but it's like Tetris just everybody's second choice but really if I only gave you one choice it would all pick this one that's what I was sort of planning to do well how to code Tetris code it yourself Tetris programming from scratch so I could just thirty six minutes so watch this guy it's gonna take me 17 hours learn how to create a game Tetris in six minutes and yet the video is four minutes interesting meth meth method to this this is I mean meth meth methods videos are excellent I mean I'm sure these videos are excellent too I just haven't watched them out of these channels simple tetris clone written in java oh yeah this is good it's gonna be multipart for sure right no way to not do it as a multipart thing tetris requirements a leftright key a hard drop key or rotation key a preview piece oh I'm not doing the preview piece full set of all seven kinds of shapes I'm not doing the preview piece it's definitely not happen these are like 1d Tetris of 2d that I could do here's a JavaScript under JavaScript see tetris JavaScript oh yeah this is like very little code I could do this drawing some stuff rotating some stuff oh god this is gonna be so painful this is gonna be so painful for me because I'm really gonna do this without having done in advance so you're gonna see you're gonna see a mess there of me let's refresh the results oh boy not getting any better is it I might have to do the feature I'm just warning you let's say it came down to hmm there's ballot stuffing going on isn't there I think there's some ballot something going on alright everybody thank you for tuning in I could answer a few questions make the preview piece no preview no Tetris do pong again the preview part is easy I guess so if I make the drop then if I make the drop button the preview is just showing where the drop button is gonna put it right so yeah I can make the preview all right I'll make the preview hmm just only use a few pieces like to thank you Tetris is so boring compared to the ML stuff for de Tetris well I don't know what to do I would say the people have spoken but ultimately I am the decider pretty you need to use single transferable vote really what does that mean 1d Tetris oh there is a 1d treacherous but this is like needs to run flash okay allow oh yeah this is 1d Tetris this is awesome this is really brilliant this is the same one yeah 1d Tetris everybody that's pretty brilliant would it be crazy to actually do 1d Tetris first alright so I definitely like the idea of doing Tetris with only a few different pieces what if I did Tetris with just one Pete one one tile pieces and then I would incorporate tile that might that might I'm trying to give the order to do this like what could I do in a single video Tetris with all the pieces are just a single cell and then as part two I could add more complex pieces and rotation would that make sense oh oh that's a good idea lei ah so as to saying hey I can work with you on 4d Tetris wouldn't actually I do 3d Tetris first 1d Tetris on April Fool's that's a really good job that's a really good idea I'll try to remember that yeah we could do a 4d tetrode we I'm I would love to do a collaboration with Leia so s so like some kind of like 40 Tetris thing would be really fun so maybe we could think about two so one D Tetris than 2d then 3d yeah I'm really exhausted how many hours of live streaming have I done today like four hours so I think I better go before I get talked into doing something else right again I can't believe what's nice is this hasn't crashed I don't know why I was crashing so much earlier and so yeah alright everybody let me let me let me let me go I think I mean that no guarantee is here but I'm gonna attempt to come back tomorrow it probably should continue the machine learning stuff because that's kind of the track that I'm on the tesseract was a break from that now you're asking me to do Tetris my fault for putting that in mr. choices I think I can't do Tetris tomorrow like this like desired you like one more little thing right now this is a terrible idea 630 feels early because I'm always running so late okay this is probably never gonna happen just kids were wondering would I do a sign why did this Barnsley fern I gotta close some of these I did this this is sort of did I did this I keep meaning to do this have I done this that's a good like winter themed one I really want to do tictactoe and then that what's that like min/max algorithm or something tictactoe might be better than tetris tictactoe with neural network you can have it like play itself and learn you are not a polling expert the vote for the ml stuff got dived among multiple videos yeah I agree I agree I'm reading about single transferable vote now snake I have done the snake okay tictactoe with min Max is pretty easy but so satisfying and fun for d tictactoe Tetris Kinect for with machine learning that would be fun to connect for I like Kinect for that's a fun game maybe I should just do 1d Tetris right now if I do 1d Tetris right now will you all be satisfied and I cannot do Tetris tomorrow this okay options for the pull alright fine it's gonna make the only option yes I'm voting for my I'm voting for yes all right it's been decided I can do 1d Tetris right now I like that for April Fool's though I could save it we can just I can do it now but not release it until April Fool's now nobody has the URL nobody can see this URL if you can catch it fast oh it's here Oh Oh uhhuh this is exciting this is looking good Connect four for your Italian followers uh Oh Oh things are gone things are going south fast oh boy this is bad news everybody what if I read you some random numbers if you do what I I got to start with like one deeds to get to 2d to get to 3d oh this is very confusing bad help me out people I kind of I'm just gonna read a little my book here 53,000 so I'm so into you I'm so tired somehow I make my own voting system fractals are cool but I'm nothing to do with Tetris rockpaperscissors oh I love that but the the best rockpaperscissor strategy is to be completely random pure randomness why this is really why this is like very polarizing I'm just seeing her refresh those I'm sorry I'm so I don't think I should do the 1d tetris thing now Hey fortunately no seems to be the answer go home it's dinner time go and receive okay I think we're done with this poll this is no consents there's no consensus here there's no consensus hmm oh look at that but I don't think I code this in this video all right everybody let's look at the tesseract somewhere it's interested it's nice to sort of hear what people are interested in which is helpful to me I am going to be going how long is this live streaming going on over two hours right yeah thank you for tuning in sorry that I just wasted like a half an hour of your time there and I'm gonna look into some of these ideas and think about it I might be back tomorrow I can work that out otherwise you won't actually see me in a live stream until the very end of the month like August 28th or 27th or 29 is the 25th of Friday or 25th of Saturday the 27th whatever that Monday is I think the 27th would be the earliest yeah 2 hours and 30 minutes yeah so I said well I said set out what I meant to accomplish today which was to program a tesseract I will take a few minutes to answer any questions I will take a few minutes to answer any questions huh one thing is that I'm working on capturing a lot of my videos I kind of haven't been keeping up with that if you are interested in submitting captions sometimes well mentions I mean who's watching anymore now but I would you can go to there's a link that I can share let me share it in the chat I'm really interested in getting English language and other languages as well but often it's nice if a video does have any English language captions to get that first because it makes translations easier I'm just gonna post a link in the chat to here is a place where you can where's our live chat going on here's a place Oh Matt Graham I just saw that question this is a link did that just go in yes that's a link where you can submit captions so if anybody has time or interest in doing that please do Matt Graham asks when do we receive the slack invite via email well guess what you could receive it right now I don't see you in here though oh right okay so Matt Graham you need to go to the community so this I have a slack channel which is for members and also patrons you you if you want to join that you can click the join button or the go click over to patreon you have to then go to the community tab there's no slack YouTube integration so you have to go to the community tab and then there's a post there with a link to a Google Form which you can enter in your email and your YouTube username so I can match it up and then I will send you an invite so if you do that in the next minute I will do that Thank You Ryan a nice comment to hear that you Oh you start computer science at University this September that's one of a good luck do I speak Spanish I do not speak Spanish no I'm good I cube ik asks I'm going to take a class next week where I will learn about AI and m/l using the Python tensorflow library do you have any tips for me um have fun don't feel like you're the only one who doesn't understand stuff because everybody else also doesn't understand stuff but everybody's afraid to say it and be critical and think about the data that you're that's being used in a project and it's applications those would be my pieces of advice can you talk a bit Nabil asking talk a bit about pics pics so if you're interested in pics to pics I'll refer you to the work of yunying she and the ml5 library I believe I'm gonna go find this easily but you Ning she picks two pics I feel like hopefully she has a blog post about it but anyway I have a plan in the future to do I thought there was a blog post maybe about her work with pics depicts an ml5 but I'm gonna save that for another time are you more of a Java or a JavaScript kind of kind of person Java what is pan man asked what is feature extraction classifier oh come on I should do that tomorrow that's gonna trust me Jeep you know the feature extractor stuff is so powerful and interesting I should definitely do that tomorrow thank you for asking that totally makes sense but what just happened here all right started over was about 37 seconds in second favorite programming language after Java JavaScript would that be third favorite programming language I don't have what is Udacity ml course good no idea maybe will you ever do deep Q learning boy I should really only pick out the questions that I have too quick to answer I don't know Oh mr. moose addict let me answer this question in the slack channel directly asking about this project from a while ago I will answer that I'd rather not discuss do you recommend to an engineer to use JavaScript for data science so yeah as you might be aware if you've watched this channel before I basically I really try to stay away of recommending tools or particular programming languages for me you know the right programming language to use is the programming language that's in front of you right now and you know everything has its pros and cons and at some point you're gonna find things are like oh gosh this thing that I made in this programming language is kind of a disaster compared to how I'm doing it over here but I don't think there's no easy answers to these questions there's no i this is my project use this so I really can't answer that are you somebody who knows a little JavaScript and is interested in the field of data science tinkering around with tensorflow jess ml5 other JavaScript libraries d3 looking at observable HQ notebooks all these things are possible and worth do his JavaScript language for data science probably not but you know perfectly fine is it true that times 0.5 is faster than / I hear that all the time magnet stop ignoring me I don't know what question I ignored but I didn't see it or ignored it for good reason I'm trying to stick to on topic questions and ones that I can answer is this stream starting in the middle or ending it is ending looking at the chat see more questions thanks everybody for your support just watching as a support being members of support recommending the videos to somebody as support making your own stuff inspired by stuff that I made a support deciding to not watch anymore because you have something else you want to do in your life is support all those things are valid alright did I go to college yes oh the pencil eraser doesn't work it's not capacitive somebody asked what do I get if I would support you as a patreon so first of all honestly if you want to join as a member or as a patron I would say do it because for some reason doing that makes you feel good and you have the means because what you get I don't know I don't know if I have anything really worthwhile for you but I will say that the slack channel is a wonderful community of pretty nice and welcoming people and a lot of experts in there like way better answering questions than me and I'm kind of not in there that off I'm gonna move in there as much as I can I like to be in there but there's lots of people in there who are better equipped to answer your questions so that's probably the main thing you get is kind of joining that particular commune of this community and then you know I will get around to mailing you stickers or a sign book and that kind of thing eventually I just did it does take quite a while for me to do that so again if you want a book I would suggest just buying it but if you are that's that's really why I really don't want to advocate too much for joining the patreon or the YouTube membership it really does help me have the resources and time to make these videos but that that would be that's my answer so I appreciate it and I encourage you if you feel like it's a thing you want to do great but I will love you just as much if you do not join I have some really interesting questions here what did you learn in college okay eight seconds left on the clock I studied in college a long time ago I my major was a mathematics and philosophy I graduated in 1995 and I didn't do any computer programming at all in college not once maybe I did and I just don't remember but if I did it certainly wasn't substantive and then I didn't actually do any computer when graduated college 1995 I didn't do any programming I think I took it actually that's not true I took an evening C++ course a year or two out of colleges to see and it didn't didn't take and then I started as an ITP student in 2001 and that's when I really started doing programming more seriously I've never done it seriously but it didn't spend more time doing it so I really started luck you know to me I was so young then I feel like but late in life comparatively like you know kids nowadays my kids my older son who is 10 probably did his first like coding class and scratch at like the age of 7 maybe um so and I he's done some p5 workshops since mad Nick 45 asks how old are you and I say look only into your own username for my age okay alright so that's it everybody I'm gonna go I feel like I did not I did not do what I wanted to do this week which was generate tons of content to have new stuff on the channel over the next few weeks why on the way know why I'm worrying about this let the channel take a break I will say that my commitment hold on let's do just bear with me I've been meaning to do this accounting so if you don't mind I want to do this accounting I'm gonna go to my channel because I want to figure out like what do i what do I really need to make sure I do I'm gonna go to playlist I'm gonna go to created playlists well I just revealed something about myself does anybody watch this show I only watched season one one but I like I love this show the genius I really want to do coding challenges about the genius if anybody is a fan of the genius I don't know it's it's me I mean I watched it a long time ago and I meant to get the season 2 and I never just got around to it okay uh I'm looking for created playlists yes okay this is why I don't like to be logged into my own account live streams live stream archive there's 160 Jesus oh you oh boy okay so let's look if somebody could do this full accounting for me that would be oh it doesn't give me the dates here oh this is ridiculous okay I don't think I can do this accounting right now because I just want I just want to see the dates of each one of these here so I could I really I mentioned the genius before haven't I I think I have yeah I really want to do an accounting of this now if I so let's just see if I humor me for a second here let me just open this here so working backwards if I open all these and new tabs I just want to go back to like June I know that I was doing a ton in like April May so let's see does this at least have the date a live stream on May 11th okay so let's let's try to let's go back to May which one was that because I actually might have been light in May due to thesis which one was that that was 136 made a fourth that's obviously May and 134 is 134 is April so let's close that out so let's open up this May June July August my goal is to average for a November Chris wall oh did anybody yes did anybody I see Matt Graham so when you fill out that I need to match it with your user I'm going to choose to trust this so I'm gonna send yeah and by the way I'm getting text messages from home because my Phillips hue lights they flash when somebody joins so hey the lights are flashing okay so I'm gonna send those slack invites soon all right actually what I should do is just work on my other stuff that I need to work on just like keep livestreaming but I think I think it's Friday I'm gonna go I'm gonna take a break okay so wait I'm getting so many messages okay now let's look at this okay so May May 11th is one whoops what what the May 24th did I really not livestream between May 11th and May 24th no I messed up I can't even do this right wait there's no 137 what happened to livestream 137 huh okay hold on hold on livestream 137 Schiffman can anybody find livestream 137 faster than I can here it is promises in JavaScript's I'm going to edit this I'm adding it to the playlist somehow it got left out add to playlist live stream archive okay Save Changes and now if I go to that playlist it refresh so now if I go to the bottom it's totally gonna be at the bottom isn't it livestream 137 so I can move it up found it okay promise is there okay so let's start over no cuz these are at the beginning now 136 137 so 136 at 137 136 is May 11 so that's number one 137 is May 23rd that's number one 138 is May 24th one 139 is May 24th I mean I guess of two in one day I'm gonna count that as two because these are along that was only this one's only an hour 10 minutes I'm count as one but I don't know 140 is May 31st whoops I probably should delete one here so that's a total of four four and a half I'm gonna say that's four and a half in May okay now 140 what did I just what it was when I stopped at 141 was made was that June no June 8th so 140 was May I can't keep track a nice system is really flawed May 31st okay so 141 is June good 2 hours and 15 minutes 141 where's 142 142 is June good 3 hours long that's pretty good 143 June 2 and a half hours long June's got a lot looks like 144 so I'm only a June 18th I've already got 4 did I forget May 4th I forgot May 4th so five and a half 145 145 is June 27th I took a little break there it looks like which is 145 June 27th 146 it's July 20th oh because I went away yeah yeah that makes sense so June has 5 okay so 146 is July and August at 1 July 147 is also July 27th in July did I really only do 2 in July I think there's a July 147 what's one is today 148 this was July yeah last Friday that makes sense so did I forget may the 4th did I not get this one 135 yeah so now I missed 135 which was also in May okay so May at five and a half June had five July had two and August so far has I'm gonna count this as two because I did a full livestream this morning and this afternoon so we average that 14 and a half divided by four so I just need one and a half more live streams because if I get to 16 by the end of August that's an average of four so I need one and a half more so if I do one tomorrow and I get one one more and at the end of August I'm actually be at four in August and that will be good so that's what that's the sort of commitment I'm making in terms of people supporting through the membership and that sort of thing okay all right let me check let me check these slack invites if you are in the chat right now you just joined as a member please let me know did I send the invites we hold on I'm just gonna I'm gonna do a little double checking of this ascending member slack invites now we're to go community community channel memberships okay so now let me look for uhhuh seven hours ago okay great this is validated slack invite coming in okay now one more one more coming all right Matt it's like invite coming and there we go I'd be curious actually yeah so I'd be curious for a graph of actually the amount of time that I live streamed I'm sure I can use the YouTube API or something I really also this is something I'm really like toying with I sort of feel like the live priz what you just joined go to the community tab go to the communities have find that members only post there's click click to the Google forum and enter your email address there and just put prison the YouTube username column I feel like the live streams and the edited videos should be separate channels but I don't know how to break that apart now it's like too late because how do I start a new channel from scratch or to say like oh if you want the live streams so I think I'm probably not going to do that but if someone wants to try to talk me into that I'm open to the idea okay I don't see any more but anyway I will I will I will look at those oh yeah III can't say goodbye it's like a problem I have but so we'll see I'm gonna try to live stream for a little bit tomorrow to be honest with you I think I want to do some more ml5 stuff sorry to dissapoint about that Tetris I will keep that in mind that that's the thing about it though is like when am I ever else gonna do Tetris I'm gonna think about I'm gonna sleep on it I'm gonna sleep on it you can tweet me at Schiffman with you know strongwilled opinions if you like can comment on any YouTube video you want by the way I'm something weird happened the other day that I'm curious about I wonder if I could pull this up I think I can't pull this up without privacy issues let me see if I can I'll just mention it so I have that this video coding visualizing 500k subscribers this particular video the other day came up hey look this particular video is suddenly in my analytics was like what like hundred times the traffic that it would like normally have because it's an old video and nobody's watching it anymore and then I went looked at like geographically and it was up everywhere but the views from India we're like way up compared to everything else does this get to this get like linked from somewhere can anybody help me find that if anyway there's a idea why that happened I be curious to recreate it just look at my analytics right now to make sure that's not continuing to happen because it's just the arbitrariness of the YouTube recommendation algorithm is probably what it is right the snake game is what yes because very few people are 33 people in the last 60 minutes watched that video right now which is not very much I mean it's amazing in many sense hold on beginning Oh interesting Matthew in the chat makes a good suggestion if you want to separate the lie from the main channel spend a year streaming to both a new live only Channel and the current coding trained child I just feel like I wonder if there are people who want the notifications for the edited content and people who want the notifications for the live stream and those are two and having all that together redundant lis in the same channel is like too much and maybe I should have just coding trained live and coding trained Channel I don't know the answer to that so I'm curious for your views I gotta go I just can't say goodbye thank you for tuning in and entering the fourth dimension would be today I enjoyed it I'm so pleased this is something I've looked at for years and thought I have no idea how to do that okay I don't understand anything about it so uh what do I do when I finished the forum priz wha Griswald just wait for his wall here comes here comes frizz wall the invitation sent alright so I'm because I'm gonna be away for so long I do this does help me kind of think like I actually don't need to serve ice cream tomorrow just in terms of my own personal accounting to feel like I'm doing the amount that I sort of set out to do with my goals but it would be nice to get a little bit further with some stuff before tomorrow don't don't get your hopes up in terms of the tetris thing that that honestly seems pretty unlikely but thank you for indulging me with the straw poll I do see it as something people are interested in and I will see you all tomorrow okay goodbye everybody see you maybe tomorrow if not at the end of the month stay tuned for the edited versions of the videos and as always thank you for your support I need a tagline like Jabril has that great like always remember to always feed
