hello so I'm about to make a few more videos about objects in JavaScript and p5 and how you can deal with these objects in arrays if you want to add some features to your code like clicking on the objects or deleting objects from the array or making your objects and have display images all sorts of things like that but before I get there I want to do something to kind of simplify my workflow it'll help you with your workflow and take a break from coding for a second just to look at how to move your code part of your code to a separate file slash separate tab and enter so this is really p5 specific although it actually is relevant even if you work using the p5 editor but here you can see here's a sketch that I built probably in a previous video where there's a ten objects that are made and set up those objects are being moved and displayed and you see them on the screen and the code for those objects is all in a constructor function this constructor functions job is to make those bubble objects new bubble triggers this function a new object is made it's returned back and that object is then put into the array bubbles now this is this works it's on one page but you know this bubble object get very very complex and could have a lot of code I'd like to put it somewhere else so what I would like to do right here is hit this plus button what this plus button will do is make another file associated with this particular project so when I hit this plus button I get a window here and I can give it a name I'm going to call it bubble Jas because I want a file just to put my bubble constructor function in so it can be in its own neat and tidy place because meat and Titan as well it just makes me happy but in the world should be messy it's okay to be messy I just I can handle it ok so there we go now you can see I have two tabs I have sketched j/s which has all my code and I have bubble J's which is blank so what do I want to do I want to go to sketch and I'm going to take all of this code I'm going to say command X to cut it and I'm going to go over to the bubble tab and I must say command V to paste it and so I now have two tabs sketch j/s you can see fits all here in the window which is just so extraordinarily nice right there's the beginning there's there's the balls array they're set up there's draw this is all the it's just so look at this just such a nice program all there is is an array and then you put things in the array and you do everything to be right it just it just works and it's lovely but everything that has to do with the bubble is now here in this separate tab so I can look at the bubble of constructor function so when I want to add new properties to bubbles like bubbles should all have their own color or bubbles should have another function where they check to see if they're off the screen all that stuff I can add here now I missed a step and this is a step that probably will eventually be taken care of for you by the editor but currently this is not something the editor does oh and I I didn't even realize I had left I had left this open from when I was setting up for this video but if you're just really here first with it you your your window would look like this so you would just see you have a sketch tab and a bubble tab but actually here up here is a Settings icon and I can click settings and here is an option for show sidebar and what the sidebar is going to show me over here is all the files associated with this sketch so as you're aware now you have your two JavaScript files your sketch KS and your bubble jeaious both of those JavaScript files are where you keep your code but there's also this libraries folder now that libraries folder happens to be where the p5.js library it's itself is and you know what that is it's just another JavaScript file so so different beef our Jes is just like more JavaScript it's just you didn't have to write that when you call ellipse the definition for the function ellipse is in that file and if you want to learn more about how p5.js works and start contributing to p5.js you might open that file up and take a look through it now a lot of it will have weird crazy syntax that you haven't seen before and lots more dots and lots more parentheses but that's the kind of thing that you might build your way up to eventually and get it every once in a while you can also see that there's p5.js which is a library another library file that I would like that I'm plan to make use of in hopefully some videos that I make today but we'll see about that so but the key file here actually is index.html that's the file that when you run your sketch that's the file that's actually being loaded into this page here and you know it just happened it's an uncaught reference error bubble is not defined why is the bubble not defined I've defined it right here well the problem is I made a new file called bubble Jas and I didn't tell index dot HTML to refer to that file so if I go over to index dot HTML you'll see here I'm a close the Preferences you can see here that there are all of these script tags I noticed another bug for the editor that I should file when you hit save as a project it should probably update the title of that project in the HTML file so I want to file that bug for me please p5.js editor on github but I think that that's what's happening but anyway the but I'm back to what I was talking about which is that you can see here's what this page is loading I need the p5.js library I need the Dom library I'm not actually using it but it's good it's there I the sound library I'm not actually using it but the editor is importing these three libraries by default as well as your code because of course you need your code to run well now my code is in both sketch JS and bubbled up yes so what I need to do is take this line hit command C for a copy and then reproduce that line again now I have two lines refering to sketch not chance and sketch yes twice but of course what I want now is the second one to refer to bubble Jas so any JavaScript files that you add you it's like you have just one long file the order doesn't really matter you know where you but but you can now keep your code organized if you have like your mouse handling press function in one file and your bubble constructor function another file and setup and draw in another file and might help you sort of like move back and forth and sort of see where you want to edit your code so now if I close this out and I go back to settings and hide the sidebar again now I'm back to just nice old happy land where I have my bubble tab bubbled is my sketch KS tab and I can run this sketch and there we go so as an exercise if you're doing exercises and following these videos you might take something you've previously written try to add a separate tab move your code around organize it and see if you can get the same exact thing too run and so what I'm going to do in the next video is I will start looking at some additional topics like how could I sort of pass a mousepressed event to each one of these objects so 6 minutes and 45 seconds one of my shortest I'm always happy when I make a short video I guess this is short I probably have done this in two minutes but we can we could drink we can all dream we have a dream of making a twominute video that explains something nicely ok see you guys in the next video if you you know choose to watch which I understand if you don't ok goodbye
