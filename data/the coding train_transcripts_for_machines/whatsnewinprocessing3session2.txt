hello I think I am streaming live I am here in New York City at the facilities of ITP in a small room with a camera and a laptop and a screen and a green screen uh to talk about what's new in processing 3 I did this about a week ago and found some bugs in uh processing 3 and I'm going to attempt to do this again so the if you happen to be watching and I'm sort of looking over here at this other screen here to see if there is anyone watching I can't tell but and first of all if you are watching please tell me how the audio is because I need to stop and start if the audio is no good but what I'm going to do here is twofold one is I'm going to improvise and talk and like kind of go through my script and look at some things and get kind of get ready and then at a certain point I'm going to hit a record button over here which is that's when I'm going to start trying to record the more official video the one that I'll save for later posting but all of this the raw footage and everything will be uh stored forever and ever on YouTube unless I decide to delete it because it's way too embarrassing but it has to get really embarrassing for me to find it embarrassing because generally I'm I'm just embarrassing um I'm I'm in a room by myself talking to a camera which is just embarrassing uh so uh oh and uh if I have some time you know I I have about uh an an hour and a half to do this not that anyone would I expect be sitting here and watching this for an hour and a half but at a certain point once I get through some of the stuff that I need to get through I'm also happy if you're got the chat open if you want to ask random questions about processing or other types of creative coding things I'm happy to try to answer uh questions as well so I'm going to take a quick look over here at the chat uh to see if anyone posted anything uh uh I love that there's from the UK and turkey it sounds like the audio is good which is excellent uh so um the first thing I'm going to do is just kind of talk through my script here um let's see if I can pull that up so this is for the video what I'm int what I think I'm going to talk I want to sort of say hello and welcome who's this video for who am I uh and that the video is about what's new in processing 3 I want to look at the welcome screen um which uh has um a sort of option of what to do in terms of like saving your processing to Sketchbook versus you're processing a three Sketchbook uh I want to look at the editor and kind of there's a lot of new stuff in the editor in terms of just visual design and color but I want to mostly look at the error checking how that works Auto completion uh tweak mode and uh the debugger however I'm not going to spend very much time on the debugger because I have an entirely other video that I already made about the debugger uh I want to just emphasize how much faster and speedier and less flickery the open jail renderers are this is really du due to many people's work uh but single lot a few Andre cbri and yakob vter did I pronounce that right uh spend a lot of time working on the openg renderer uh there's a new full screen function you can span on multiple displays on talk through that talk a little about support for high density displays um uh just mention briefly some of the the sort of stronger restrictions in terms of how you call the size function look at the contributions manager and how amazing and wonderful it is now and next steps and the wiki and GitHub and how you can contribute and all that sort of stuff so that's my script does anybody have any feedback on that script uh what I like to do since there's a 30se second delay before you hear what I say is I like to do magic tricks with my magic invisible water this is water that's invisible but oh so delicious okay that was about 30 seconds of me drinking the water uh let's see I don't see any other comments I got 14 14 that's one in a four double digits people watching this I'm really Ming up in the world uh so I think that's kind of my plan interested in the difference between open GL and how to get the most from that so um Mike uh bronberg asked which I don't know if I pronounced your name correctly uh uh how to get the most from some of the new stuff in opengl so maybe I can talk about that a little bit after I get sort of this core video done the core video I just want to be like 10 to 15 minutes and kind of gloss over the higher level stuff and then maybe we can have a little bit of discussion to be honest with you I'm not as uh my my expertise in terms of kind of like the the guts of the open gel stuff and processing is not as uh deep as it could be um just been kind of watching with Glee and amazement of how much work has gone into the open gel engine but I can try to offer a few tips or a few bits of knowledge that I have but um that's that good enough okay um any other questions comments losing viewership folks down to 12 I really I need like I want like a giant ticker just so I can be like inundated with this like number just really it's like strange I don't have the like Periscope thing where I just see hearts floating everywhere I just like maybe I could have some like hearts hanging from the ceiling in this room which would make me feel better I have a you you I I feel the warmth and love of the world in this strange place by myself talking to a camera you studio audience okay so uh rather than keep rambling I am going to get started to make this video I think because I think I'm ready to do it I the thing is I'm probably going to have to do it a couple times which when I'm going to record this a couple times I'll do it once try to get through the whole thing and if you guys have questions or feedback I'll record it again if there's anyone out there with a flare or a talent for video editing it's possible that I could conceivably um uh make the final video as kind of editing together pieces of like the good part from here and a good part from here but you know my sort of style is just try to do the whole thing in one take it's informal and I'll make mistakes along the way but that's also okay so I'm going to come back to my magic water because I need some water before I start and um I think that's it does the line have move up down yet text editor does the line move up down yet me goes to download Line duplicate in place sorry I don't understand that question zhie so um if you want to clarify I can maybe kind of look at it again later I am however because I I get distracted by seeing myself in this chat page I'm going to kind of close CL this laptop for a second so I won't be looking at the chat for like about 10 minutes or so I have a noninvisible coffee drink and I think I will get started okay feel like um I need a little more water so I'm having trouble getting going stepping out of frame for a second okay here we go welcome to processing three this is I'm take one Clapper okay I have to go over here oops to turn this mouse on because I got to press the record button you know this mouse is like way in the way okay I should probably have a different background than the just gray one but the gray one will have to do I keep burping which you can probably hear which is like really embarrassing it's live live YouTube okay here we go hello and welcome uh my name is Dan schiffman and I am here right now in this room to talk about uh what's new in processing 3 um processing three is the result of start over uh who am I new in processing three on beh I was going to say that okay once I get some momentum going I'll probably be fine try that one more time hit record hello welcome uh my name is Dan shiffman and I am oh the camera went off good thing I remembered good thing I just started these cameras have this bad habit of powering off after 30 minutes cuz I'm using Canon 5DS I think there's a setting that I can change but I haven't changed it okay stop and here we go this is going to be it hello uh my name is Dan schiffman and I'm here on behalf of the processing foundation and the many many well not so many there not so many there's really just a few core people who volunteer frosting is a very small team there's not a lot of people I want to thank people but without like listing names and all that I guess I won't worry about that too much I can't take any credit for any of this I'm just making the video hello and welcome my name is Dan schiffman I am here on behalf of the processing foundation and all of the volunteers so many people who have put in so much time and effort to make this new thing that's come out right now called processing 3 now processing isn't new processing has been around all the way since 2001 processing 3 is the newest and in my opinion the greatest really really an amazing and like I don't know I sound like Donald Trump in my over exaggeration but it's a really wonderful uh that's going to be like a cultural reference that's no one's going to want to hear two years from now I I'm going to start over no one's really listening to me I'm going to this I that was fine except I said Donald Trump it's the best ever processing video version of processing it's the greatest let's make processing great again okay all right I was not hired for host of The Daily Show clearly okay here we go hello my name is Dan schiffman and I am here on behalf of the processing foundation and all of the volunteers who have put a ton of time and effort into making this new version of processing that has just come out processing 3 now processing is not a new project processing has been around all the way since 2001 it's almost 15 years of work that has gone into processing but this new version has a lot of new features that I'm particularly excited about and so what I'd like to do in this video is kind of Hit the high points and kind of walk through what's new in processing 3 see what I can show to you if you have questions maybe you can add them in the comments or find me on Twitter and I'll make more videos to answer some of those questions um but first let me just say so in terms of the audience audence for this video If processing is totally new to you what I might suggest doing is going to the processing website link below as well as the hello processing tutorial which will also be linked below which will give you kind of an introduction to what processing is and uh how and how how to program with processing here I just want to look kind of look at what's new what's new in three that wasn't there in two okay so uh before I get but not before I'm going to just do it right now so the first thing I'm going to do is I have processing 3 look at that wonderfully beautiful icon designed by me because I have no visual Talent whatsoever but I'm so pleased to be involved with this project that so everything looks so wonderful um I'm going to click on this icon and processing three launches now one of the things you'll notice I don't know if this has ever happened before probably has but there's a welcome screen here and uh one of the new things about processing 3 is that processing 3 allows the possibility of keeping your sketch folder from processing to intact meaning all the libraries all of your sketches is intact so that if you ever need to go back to using processing 2 or move between the two versions you can have separate sketch folders and this is kind of the recommended way of working you can say you could use your existing Sketchbook folder and just kind of bring all those sketches into processing 3 or you could kind of start fresh and pull things over a little bit as you need you know so the hope of course is that you know after a little while processing 3 is going to be the main version you find yourself using but as libraries are still being updated and changing you might want to sort of keep some of your historical stuff if you have a kind of project you have to just get running for this exhibition this day so I'm going to do that uh I'm going to here I'm going to select create a new Sketchbook folder and I'm going to click get started now what it's doing is it is opening up the finder and it's telling me where do you want that new processing sketch folder to be now this won't exist for you I happened to before I made this video I made a folder here called processing 3 in my documents folder so that's the folder I'm going to select that's the folder I'm going to hit uh open to and now that is my processing Sketchbook and if I go to Sketchbook you can see there's nothing in there because I've started completely fresh and if I have a shortcut here on the the desktop just so we can take a look at that folder you can see what's been made automatically there a folder for examples libraries modes and tools so those are some things I'll talk about when I get to the contributions manager but uh this is where your sketches would appear as you start to make new ones and save them of course you can save them anywhere on your computer but in you know the Sketchbook is the default location essentially Okay so what's next on my script that's in front of me um let's start looking actually at the at the editor itself so the thing that's changed the most in processing three and just at a glance is the visual design of the editor icons are a little different there's a new button over there look at this line numbers right there's line numbers for your code uh these line numbers look strangely spaced out perhaps it's only because I've made the font for the editor quite large just for demonstration purposes in this video and so in fact I could start typing some code uh and I could say size and I could say draw uh and there we go I wrote some code oh boy did I make a lot of mistakes or what so one of the things that I don't know what just happened there while I was typing or watching I kind of like lost my train of thought for a minute I was like in the zone of being hypnotized and typing but one of the things you'll notice is that where there are errors you'll see oh look at this there's a little squiggly line there showing me there's an error here now you can obviously see I'm missing a second parenthesis here so one of the new features of processing three is that the uh real time error checking as you're writing your code processing behind the scenes is checking to find errors and highlighting them for you in certain ways you can also see this error is is highlighted right here missing right parentheses and look at that isn't that just like the greatest error Mage you've ever seen so one of the things that we've worked on quite hard in this new version is rewriting kind of standard Java error messages to try to make them make a little more sense and be a little friendly and quite helpful and this is you know it doesn't work perfectly in all cases but this is a case where you've seen it's worked quite well so I could go here and I could close that right parenthesis and we could see oh there's some other errors some other squiggly lines what's going on and now ah something else that's new right I'm missing a right curly bracket perhaps uh but one of the things that's new down here that you can see is the the message area the message area where you might normally type things like print line uh ah I sort of messed that up uh the message area is where you might see the results of uh print messages that you put in your code to kind of try to debug your code uh that's always just been the place where you also see the error messages it's one window error message spit out there your print line spit out there there are now two tabs there's the console where where the results of things that you log the console through print line up here and then this errors Tab and this errors tab will actually show you what the current error is and what line number it's on so and and you can see this red dot here is indicating that it's an error I believe there is also the possibility for uh processing to to demonstrate to give you a warning something that's like not such a good idea but your code will run anyway and that would probably be represented by a yellow dot if I'm right about that so let me fix some errors so we can uh I want to kind of demonstrate um some information some some some ideas to you so I'm going to take this out so one thing I want to show you here uh is uh let me do this okay so one thing I want to show you sorry that was a little bit awkward is notice how I'm missing a parenthesis up here and I'm missing a semicolon here previously in this scenario processing would have only ever shown you the first error once you fix the first error then it'll show you the second error now what you'll notice is down here in the console multiple the error console multiple errors are are listed and again you can see missing right parentheses missing a semicolon both of these have the Red Dot they're errors this is like great I love these error messages they're so nice and helpful and explain exactly what they should be so I'm going to correct those errors uh now processing just found one more error notice I didn't actually declare this variable y anywhere but I used it and now I have the V the the variable y does not exist which again is exactly what that error message should be so this is just thrilling and I can fix that error by saying in y and now uh oh I have the I spelled ellips wrong I have another error Spell ellips correctly and now all the errors have gone away uh and I'm going to hit save uh oops I don't need to hit save and you can see that um everything's gone I can click back to the message console so that's a little bit about the error checking I went on a little longer than I might have intended to um but I think I will stop there so that's one of the main new features um in the processing editor now another feature that is very exciting is code completion so first of all that realtime error checking thing that was happening you can actually turn that off if it starts to get in your way it's it's it's telling you errors constantly while you're typing and maybe that's something you just want to see when you when you hit save or when you hit run so in the processing preferences uh right here under continuously check for errors if you wanted to turn that off you could turn that off here I'm going to leave it on on but I'm going to add something else here this is not on by default uh um but it is something that you can quickly enable in the preferences code completion so a lot of you who have worked with other types of development environments are probably quite familiar with code completion you start typing and it's like hey maybe you're saying ellipse or maybe you're saying rectangle let me fill that code in for you this is now available for you in the processing development environment so I'm going to select code completion I'm going to select okay and I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say eel and then I'm going to say control space now code completion doesn't trigger automatically uh um the way that you trigger It Is by clicking control space and you can see when I typed control e control space it's making a guess do I want to type ellipse ellipse mode or use this ellipse constant um and you can see it's also giving you a little bit more information what are the arguments it expects ellipse expects four Arguments for floating Point numbers ellipse mode expect one AR argument and integer so I'm going to do ellipse mode and I'm going to type Center and I'm going to code completion that and you can see uh there we go so this is something that's possible in the IDE um it will also code completion also will pop up if I was making like a vector object whenever I hit the dot so as soon as I say V Dot I see a list of all the available functions for that particular object and I can kind of scroll through them and and select the one that I want and I know that I've got the spelling right and I know what the number of arguments expected are so this is a great uh really great new feature that's um that's in processing 3 okay moving on to the next item uh tweak mode so let me uh let's find an example to open up and I I probably should have thought of one in advance that I meant to open uh and I'm going to go under topics and uh animation uh no wait uh let's do simulation I know so simulation uh flocking this is one of the ones I always like to do and what I'm going to do right okay so you're probably familiar with the Run button this runs the sketch there it is you see it there there is another way you can run the sketch known as present mode uh I'm going to now present mode the sketch which just puts the sketch sort of in front of a background full screen to hide the rest of your operating system desktop and there is now a third way that I can call the sketch trigger the sketch and I'm going to come over to this part because I think this is what I want to demonstrate I can go sketch tweak so I'm going to run this sketch tweak and now notice the sketch running and look at the code I am going to scroll down see certain numbers suddenly have an underline under them and here's some numbers these are the weights in this flocking example each one of these B boid elements operates with three rules sep separation alignment and cohesion so let's say I want to turn off the alignment rule make alignment zero and make cohesion zero and make separation much much higher you can see that the behavior and I really should have to I'm going to do this video again because I'm dis practicing now that you can see how the behavior has really changed based on the strength of this parameter so if you want to just have a quick and dirty way to play with values and how they affect the behav of your code you can do that through this tweak mode interface and then once I hit stop tweak mode is going to ask hey do you want to keep those changes whatever those new variable values are do you want to keep those in the sketch now this is U no substitute for building your own interface or having interesting procedural and algorithmic generative ways to change values in your code it's really just a quick extra tool for sketching out ideas and trying different colors that you can play with and in fact tweak mode has a Color Picker built into it as well which is often useful um in addition to just tweaking different values okay ah and now the last new how long have I been talking for 12 minutes the last new feature that I would like to demonstrate here that's part of the editor is the debugger and I'm actually going to talk very little about the debugger because I've made an entirely separate video about the debugger that you can walk watch and I'll have that linked below again in the description for this video but right here there is this icon this insect icon that if I click it enables a debugger this is is a variable um this is a variable inspector there's different buttons now uh a step continue there's this idea of break points the debugger allows you to run the code stop at a given instant look at all the variable values and step through your code one line at a time to try to determine what the problem might be so I just got that's sort of like the overview of what's possible here with the debugger and um I encourage you to take a look at the other video if you want to kind of dive into that a bit more okay so what else is new in processing 3 so something that has really changed which if you like full screen fast Graphics is that the the a lot of the the engine in particular the openg GL engine the the engine that drives the p2d and p3d renderers has really changed um processing used to be based on this thing called an applet this very ancient piece of technology that used to allow you to embed Java programs into a web browser well that's a really dead technology and was kind of a stumbling block this uh with each sketch being tied to being an applet could really hampered performance and certain types of things that you might want to do full screen with a sketch this has all changed now that applet as a dependency has been removed from the processing core engine so let's take a look at some of the new things that have come up in that sense so I'm going to find myself an example I'm going to go under uh topics under shaders shaders are a nice way of looking at some of the p3d possibilities I will go to nebula so if we look at this uh nebula sketch this is actually rendered in p2d it's loading a Shader and if I hit run we can see there's a window and its size is 640x 360 so one of the new things you can do is there's a brand new function besides size and that is the function full screen so if I comment this out and instead of typing size I type full screen and oops and I don't need to save it um and if I hit stop and I hit run I'm in the land of white I'm in an apple advertisement I'm not sure what happened spinning ball of death what's going on with the world uh hello come back ah what's I got an error could not run this oh interesting something changed let's try p3d so what's what's weird is it worked with um alert GitHub found a bug I think you know I just use a different example for this video uh okay let's see what's going on let's try let's close this example oh I know it happened this is my mistake this is not a bug at all I'm a terrible person I've made a mistake I'm going to keep going because this is my practice round or maybe somebody could edit this video later okay let's start let me come back let's run this I'm going to come back to oh and I don't want to save this this nebula sketch you can see it here running 640x480 window the size function is determine that window size and what I want to do is change now from the size function to calling a function called full screen now full screen does not require Dimensions does not require a width or a height because by Nature it's going to just draw the sketch at whatever the size of your screen is however it does require a renderer with no argument passed in it will be the default renderer but since this is a um so maybe I should start demonstrating full screen with a regular sketch but since this um particular sketch requires at least the p2d renderer I need to say p2d and I can run the sketch and I see up there this is what I was looking for I just like this is my excuse that I could make weird hand motions and pretend that I'm floating in space okay so you can see here how uh speedy and fast this is how easy it is to suddenly make your sketch run full screen comment that back out set it to size uh there's if you've used earlier versions of processing you might have noticed like different flickering problems or the window takes a while to get going there's in processing 3 you'll find that a lot of stuff is much uh faster in terms of like getting the sketch running and also just faster in terms of the frame rate of what it's rendering uh due to so many things changing behind the scenes um another thing um let's just look at a different example uh I'll go down to uh demos maybe I'll find something there under Graphics uh let's try a tree foil this might be an interesting one and let's make this one uh full screen p p3d and uh this one's kind of nice a little bit dark can't doesn't doesn't show up as well it's it's coming more to light please don't hurt me tree foil I'm I'm a friendly human um so one of the things I want to mention here actually like in addition to just the full screen being so easy to use with the function and kind of launching instantly that um you know a very common scenario of working with processing is you've got your thing you made it on your laptop you're plugging in a projector now you want to see your sketch on the projector you want to see full screen in past times it's been a big hassle full screen in addition to taking the renderer can actually take as an argument the display you want to display it on so if I were to say full screen one that might be the default display your laptop screen if I'm connected to a projector and I say two then that sketch is only going to go instantly onto the uh display number two which would be your projector it sort of depends what your operating system settings are but this works uh really well and I should have this over to the right so when I'm typing you can see it better uh and then also really exciting is there is an option of saying span and what full screen span will do is if you have multiple monitors it'll take that sketch and span it across them so for multiscreen displays this is a really fantastic uh option that just sort of just works instead of trying to find some weird strange stack Overflow Java hack thing to make that work um another thing that is new in processing 3 is a a way to deal with high uh high density displays so um uh Mac retina machines other types of displays that have super high density displays uh fine resolution of picture but this is like it's hard to just do this video continuously I just need to take a break um it's mostly because I took too long for the earlier stuff I'm already at 20 minutes so I have to I have to take about half as amount of time and move through this stuff faster but I'm going to keep going just to practice um that uh um uh there's a new function called pixel density I should have just like an example ready to go I actually just use this Hue example so um for example here if I were on a high If This Were a high density display I could say uh pixel density density 2 and processing behind the scenes will do all of that pixel doubling uh to make the lines and the antial and everything look fine ER and crisper and more beautiful in that sort of like high density display way the other thing I'll mention is that there is a new experimental renderer which is particularly well suited to highdensity displays that you might take a look it's not the default renderer it's kind of hidden there in the documentation but uh it's the Java FX um so fx2d it's based on a technology called Java FX so if you want to get the highest quality 2D rendering on a highdensity display you might look into trying this fx2d renderer see how it works and chime in on GitHub with any bug reports or um and have questions about it you can also ask those on the Forum okay speaking of uh the size function it's always been the case in processing that the idea is that the size function you know it's generally good practice not to use hardcoded numbers in your code the size function in processing is the one place where you need to use hardcoded numbers in your code it's it's a the that the the the the hardcoded numbers there allow for a lot of these new possibilities in terms of rendering and uh bugfree I should just say there's a way around it look at the wiki I've lost lost my Steam on this video so I'm going to start over soon so I'm racing through the last thing and then there's the contributions manager uh I'm going to I'm going to pause for a second and take a break because um I took too long at the beginning of this video but let me run through the contributions manager stuff I'm kind of so and then I also want to look at the contributions manager which is new uh it's fully integrated everything's in the same place uh you can search for things like the connect library for want install on up a library you click install uh once you see once you click install you'll see a green icon that is installed libraries that don't aren't that uh aren't um compatible or gray out and then if there are libraries available for an update you'll see them in your update list with that icon and you can actually click update and it'll update them you can see that I'm on3 but the current version is 04 then I was going to mention the wiki which has more details I don't need to give all the details in this video and that the LI you know many libraries are still being updated for 3.0 a lot of them are grayed out if you're a library developer please get in touch we really want to help you update it and if you have any questions leave them in the comments in this video uh leave them in the comments in this video um that's one thing I want to say oh uh report bug on GitHub and also you can ask questions at the processing forum and always you can send me a message uh at shiffman uh so that that was my rehearsal I'm going to hit stop here even though I I kind of lost steam after about 15 minutes which I should be able to talk for 20 minutes I do that in class all the time I'm going to pause and I'm going to look at the chat for a second and see what uh see what comments you have so if anybody has any feedback or comments right now I'm going to try to start over and do this video again there's some things that I figured out that I was doing wrong that I can have ready better uh there's some mistakes I made that sort of thing so I'm kind of getting myself set up again I'm going to drink some more water I'm going to look at these demos I'm try to pick the best one rotating arcs is a good one particles what does that one do oh this is me apparently oh that's kind of a good one to demonstrate speed and I can move the mouse around 3D this this one will do look how fast it is so many particles hundreds of thousands of millions of particles I guess I could use that one um planets let's try this one that's more spaciness I like the nebul I think I should start with the Hue example for just doing a 2d one uh examples um Yellow Tail is a great one too um performance tests uh low level ribbons I think I'll do the particle one it's sort of like a classic thing that people are used to seeing I think that'll work well okay any other comments nice sketch with the particles okay good so I'm going to use that one okay I need a little short break for a minute I'm going to drink some more of this water here's the problem I have to leave the live if I if I turn off off the live stream oh boy it's the audio sometimes getting hello it's kind of hitting that red thing if I talk too loud but you did you guys notice any crackling or audio I think it's okay I I don't haven't been talking too loud um I have to leave this running because I can't turn the stream off and turn it back on but I need to go refill my water so I'm say back into minutes getting more water so if you're watching that's my message to you you I'm going to take my magical invisible water cup and go refill it and I'll be back in 2 minutes if you have any comments or about that sort of my list and script let me know I'm I think I'm ready to do this it's 210 I even have like an an hour more time so I think I just have to get my energy going and just power through the whole thing and and be more succinct I went on and on and on about certain things just need to show the error check I showed like five different errors just showed two Auto completion just show it tweak mode I need a better example for tweak mode that was too complicated let me find one uh so let me come let me find it if you have a suggestion for an example for tweak mode um just like Basics like form or something uh shape Primitives see these are static though it has to be something animated uh oops I'm here uh math noise noise wave let's try that oh this is going to work um because if I do this oops if I do sketch tweak so this is kind of a little bit of bug that tweak mode in I guess it has to do that it like like resets your code but it's fine oh so this is good because I can show this that I'm tweaking the background that's great and I can also show this ah yeah this is good but I just have to position it over here I don't have a lot of screen real estate because I made the resolution so low but I think noise wave this will work I can I can fuss with this I can make this work because this is a nice one too this incrementation yeah look how that changes it oh yeah this is good okay great noise wave will be a good example Le uh okay um so let me quit quit quit quit quit quit don't save quit don't save and now quit quit processing oh no bigger bigger bigger bigger I'll be right back in two minutes I need like a little clock I could just put on a timer but it's it's going to be less than two minutes 30 seconds I am currently live streaming from my office are you I am taking a break to get some water now I am going back on YouTube it's just me talking processing I wish it was my new like something else but okay I'm back oh and of course the camera without fail goes off so that's good I've got it back on uh I have to get ready again so a couple things I have to do here is I have to go to the preferences I have to reset process thing to uh not know it's been run before uh and oh yeah hot Pik that's right when I went to get my water I kept talking it's a good thing I didn't go I don't know do something I shouldn't be doing that's very funny I I was just talking to Gordy Gord is now live on YouTube um okay uh nine people okay I'm GNA I'm going to check here and uh okay uh I'm going to post something actually no I I think I posted enough times that I'm live streaming so people will find it or they won't find it okay any last comments looking reading Twitter for no reason more comments below okay okay and here we go okay my goal is to do this video again and take about about about um 10 less minutes to do it to be much more efficient about it um and and I just I think I'm ready to do it actually I'm going to drink a little bit of the coffee so I'm losing some energy here okay processing three my favorite version of processing ever water chat still working you know I've got a little gray area down here but I'm just going to leave that it's fine okay thanks thanks for tuning in Z gono and if anybody else finds their way here here we go okay camera one that's not a camera that's not a camera get some energy going here kiding okay here we go and processing three oops hello and welcome uh my name is Dan schiffman and I am here on behalf of the processing Foundation to talk about processing three um shoot forgot what I was saying always takes me a few minutes to get going uh hold on sorry everybody I kind of wish I had gotten through it that first time it's sort of hard to do this the second time but it's fine I can do it okay hi uh my name is Dan schiffman and I am here to talk about processing three uh I forgot the first sentence that I'm saying exactly again shoot hello uh my name is Dan schiffman and I'm here on behalf of the processing foundation and the all of the volunteers who have spent a lot of time and a ton of effort over the last uh you know many years in fact working on the processing software to talk about the newest version of processing processing 3 and what's what's new about processing 3 now processing which I've now said that word like 10 times in the first sentence is not a new project and processing has been around all the way since 2001 in fact I think we're coming up on the 15th anniversary of the processing software itself um so this video is really meant for those of you who have been using processing and want to sort of see what what are some of the new features of the development environment what are some things that it can do and what are some reasons why certain things have changed that's my goal to talk about those things in this video however if processing itself and programming is something that's completely new to you I would recommend checking out just the processing website and the hello processing tutorial um both of which I will link to below there's nothing below me but a flooor but I'm probably embedded in a web page somewhere talking uh in in the in the in the description for this video so take a look at that so my goal is just kind of give you a quick overview uh of the features kind of look at each one for a minute or two and then of course uh I would be glad to take any questions which you can ask in the comments of this video or on the processing Forum or you're welcome to send me or a um or the processing Foundation itself a message on Twitter and the links to those will also anything I say will be a link below in the video will just somehow be there uh by the fact of me saying it okay so let's get started and let's look at processing 3 so I have processing 3 it's right over there in the corner it's a lovely icon not at all designed by me because I'm incapable of Designing things that look nice but uh many people have worked on many things in processing that make it look absolutely beautiful and that's one of my favorite things about the new editor is you're going to see it has just a new look to it and a lot of new features uh which that look supports so let's launch it and one of the first things you'll notice is that a welcome screen comes up so here's something that's here's the first thing that's new about processing three if you have been using processing for a long time you've got a whole set of sketches in libraries and your processing 2 and they're kind of archived projects that work and you don't want to mess with them you can start fresh and have a completely new Sketchbook with its own set of libraries and tools and modes just for processing three and that's kind of the recommend the re the recommended uh option for you here you can see this option here you could of course just use the old Sketchbook you know most sketches are going to work between two and three not that much has changed but there are some significant things and for larger more complex project particular if you're using external libraries you you now have the option to keep those intact from processing two and kind of get things working in three as you have uh kind of time for okay so I'm going to do that and I'm going to hit get started I'm going to get a new sketch folder and what you'll see is it's the finders open up and it's saying like hey where do you want this new sketch folder to be so this processing folder was my processing 2 Sketchbook this won't appear for you I I made that folder before the video started but I'm going to select this folder processing 3 and that's going to be my Sketchbook and you can see here under Sketchbook it's empty it's there's nothing there yet I haven't made any sketches maybe I'll make one in this video and it will appear there and that will be a nice happy moment so looking at the editor it's new there's some new icons there's some new tabs down here and look at this line numbers so many of you have always wanted to have line numbers in the processing ID and they're there now and one of the reasons why they're there is there's an entirely new error checking system which refers back and forth to line numbers which so having them there can be quite useful uh for a variety of reasons so let's um let's start with the new editor I want to kind of quickly you know go through some of the new features here in the editor and the first one I want to look at is just how error checking works now I realize no no it's fine uh I realize I just ignore that preferences screen for a second edit that out um I was checking to make sure it was set right so what I'm going to start doing is I'm going to type some code and I'm going to type void setup and I'm going to type void draw and I'm going to type size 200 comma 200 semicolon now you can see I have a syntax error there right a parentheses is needed so a couple things you'll notice one is processing is like detecting the errors as you type so as you type it's finding errors as you correct those errors those errors go away and this one I found is um first you'll note this squiggly line is showing you where that error is most likely occurring you know sometimes it's going to get it wrong but almost all the time it's going to get it right and the error message here missing right parenthesis so this is something that's new about processing 3 and I'm very excited about it because we spent a lot of time working on rewriting the Java error messages so detecting errors and giving more helpful feedback and this this just like brings tears to my eyes because that's exactly what's missing a right parenthesis and that's you know a helpful message rather than unexpected token missing error I don't know something like that so we can correct that error and we can also do things like in I'm going to say int x = 50 and I'm going to say ellipse 300 300 3 2 200 50 50 semicolon so now something you'll notice this is also exciting there are two errors here one is a missing semicolon one is a missing right parenthesis so something new about processing three is that if I go to this down here to the console the console is where you see print line messages come out you know for debugging and other things it used to also be where all the ER messages happened now there is a separate errors Tab and if I go into that errors tab you'll see that each error is listed individually now zooming back out for a second you can see a couple other things these error messages are listed in which tab they're in now in this case I have a simple sketch I haven't even saved it yet so there's just one tab but you might have errors in different tabs as well as the line number the line number is listed here as well so you get a full list of the error messages I can click on one and now it's even highlighted in the IDE so this ability to go go through your list of Errors find them debug them fix them is a wonderful thing uh and it's and it's new and it works great and you can see as I start to correct them uh those errors disappear ah look at that I forgot so this is interesting I didn't expect this to happen but I'm making a video live let's talk about this for a second I was like why the errors disappear there's still an error so this actually isn't an error notice it's a yellow line and notice there's a yellow dot here before there were red dots there so there's something called a warning which is that this variable is a variable I declared but I never used it it's a warning saying like you know your codee's going to run just fine but does it really make sense to declare that variable and not use it maybe you want to remove that line of code so this is and again you have a nice message the value of local variable X is not used so this is something that processing 3 has also warnings and I kind of earlier had the preferences window up for a second I kind of quickly shoved it away this is something that you can configure in the preferences so for example you can turn off warnings like you don't really care about the warnings if the code's going to run the codee's going to run turn off the warnings the other thing you can do is turn off this continuously check for errors option so if that's kind of getting in the way of your workflow and you just want to see the errors kind of when you finish typing um you can disable that option now this brings me to my next item in my list code completion with control space another new feature for the editor is code completion which is a a great feature tons of text Ed code editors and text editors have this you're typing some code it's a long thing to spell the editor just sort of magically knows what it is you're going to type and fills in the rest for you a feature like this is now available in the processing IDE so I'm going to select that option on it won't be on by default so you're going to have to go to your preferences and select it but once I've done that I can do things like Type e control space and you can see here uh if I zoom into that I'm being given the options so I typed e did I mean to type ellipse or ellipse mode or ellipse and in addition to showing me which things I might be interested in typing it's showing me what that function expects how many arguments so there's a little bit of metadata not as much as a full reference but some information to help you along and if I were to hit enter there it fills it in and I can just go and fill in the arguments uh however I might want them whoops and I could get that there and now I have the ellipse function so code completion is there you can also use it with objects uh if you have an object dot the uh code completion will show you suddenly what are all the functions available inside of that object which in many cases is super useful because you can't remember is it you know was it called dist or distance or you know check intersection or check Collision that's a quick way to kind of look up and see what those functions are available and get know what the arguments are and have them typed for you okay so those are two core uh features oh I'm missing a right parentheses let's figure out where that is line number nine oh no that's still just that warning uh so that that's an old that error is just there historically by accident I probably should have gone away by now but I made it go away by clicking save okay uh okay so let's look at another new feature in processing 3 now this is a feature that's been around that you could have added to processing as a separate mode it's called tweak mode but now it's in processing directly so I'm going to go grab an example I think the example that I want to use for this is the example called noise wave I'm going to pull this example over here and you know there of course there is a run option for a sketch run it present which presents it full screen uh with UHS a sketch in the middle of the screen with a full screen background but I'm going to show you this last option tweak so I'm going to run the sketch I'm I'm not going to run it I'm going to tweak it I'm going to put the sketch over here and as I run tweak mode you can see certain parts of the code have changed look at this next to background there's an underline there and also this option that I can click on so I can click on here and I could just tweak the color of the background right from the the code itself okay I like this color I'm going to keep that then I could also go down and find certain values like okay I want to tweak um I want to tweak the range of what noise is being mapped to so ah 300 down to higher two or I could make this one uh this go down to 100 so you can see that the code is responding in real time to me changing these numbers oops somebody just banged on the door and uh you know I could also go down here and say okay well this is a sort of noise incrementation level look how how that drastically affects Things based on what I do so you can sit there and tweak values in real time as the code is running and then if I hit stop it's going to give me the option do I want to keep those changes so I change a lot of hardcoded values in the code I like the way it looks much better I can say yes of course it's an example so it wants me to save it and and I've got those new values so this is a great new feature I would say it's not really a substitute for like building your own interface or having some interesting generative or procedural way to affect the way parameters in your program work but for quick and dirty sketching and trying out different values this is a really nice feature to have in the IDE okay one more new feature to have uh one more new feature that is in the IDE that I would like to demonstrate to you it is the debugger and I'm really going to gloss over this because I've already made an entire video all about the debugger and I'll make sure a link to that is included also Below in the description but I'll just point out to you where it is uh this insect icon up here if you click it it enables the debugger you get a a few different options uh for how you can run the sketch the whole point of the debugger is allow you to pause the code and Advance line by line so there's options like continue and step there's ways of adding break points which are moments where the code should pause and then there's this new pane over here which is the variable inspector so that variable inspector will show you what the current variable values are at a certain break point so I'm just going to add a break point here you can see uh diamond is now oops I head is in front of that you can see I click here and I add a break Point there's a diamond there and if I then run the code under debug the code runs and uh whoops um shoot I was doing so well with this video U let me try adding it here uh uh I'm not sure what happened uh shoot I should went too far with my discretion of the debugger watch the other video it's fully explain I might have to edit this out at some point just cut myself off and go to the next thing cuz I don't need to demonstrate the debugger itself so let me let me actually like um uh kind of start over for a second back where I was and just say uh I'm going to start for where I was talking about the debugger icon so this is the debugger icon up here in the right hand corner if you enable that debugger icon you'll see that there are a bunch of different options for stepping through the code continue pausing uh boy I really screwed this up uh I'm going to let me start over from the debugger and see if I can wonder why that didn't work but I'm not going to not going to explore that right now um I'm just start I'm going to pretend I'm starting over talking about the debugger and then I'm going to keep going and maybe this can be spliced together as I am recording um so the last feature that I want to talk about is the debugger uh now oops oh shoot now I stepped on The Wire things are really going haywire let me fix this audio cable here okay the last feature I want to talk about is the debugger uh now I don't need to spend tooo much time on the debugger because I have an entirely other video that goes through the debugger in detail and I'll make sure there's a link to that below that you can go and watch but the core idea for a debugger is it allows you to pause the sketch at a given moment step through the sketch line by line and look at what the values of variables are at different moments to try to diagnose a problem with the sketch so to enable the debugger there's this nice insect icon up here in the top right you can click on that um and once you click on that you can see some options have changed here you can run The Code by debugging you can step you can continue and also there is this uh variable inspector over there in the right where variable values will be displayed so for more details about that take a look at the debug video okay the next topic I want to talk about is full screen and fast graphics and openg G and a lot of that's that's changed in really exciting new ways in processing 3 so let me open up a simple example here uh open recent uh Hue so this is one of my personal favorite little processing examples it's just demonstrating how Hue Works based on the why uh the Y value of uh the mouse I'm drawing colors of different Hues so one of the things that Pro the sort of core function of procing that you're familiar with is the size function and we we did see that there is this way of saying uh present and what present does is it takes a sketch and places it in the middle of the screen with a nice background behind it but there is a new function available in processing called full screen so what full screen is a replacement for size you no longer need to use both of those so if I comment out the size function and say full screen and I run it you will see my sketch is now happening instantly full screen and what's really wonderful about this is the full screen function doesn't just take your sketch and run it full screen on the display that you're currently working on you know what's one of the most common scenarios of why people work with processing they've got a project it's on their laptop it's hooked up to a projector it's part of an installation if I were to say if I have two displays and I say full screen one this sketch is going to run on this particular display if I change it to full screen 2 this sketch is going to run on the projector so the ability to quickly and easily send your sketch full screen to a particular display is a new feature of processing with this full screen function and in addition to that if I simply just say span full screen span this is a scenario that if I have multiple displays the sketch will span across all of them which you know if you've worked in multiscreen uh installations and environments before this is a very difficult thing to accomplish and now um this is possible just um just by um uh working in uh processing with the full screen function okay so what is ah there's a little bit more to this than that so what I want to do is uh close this sketch and go to a different uh example I'm just going to go to this uh uh demos Graphics uh particles and one of the things I want to talk about here is what's happened with openg rendering and processing so you'll notice processing has multiple renderers there's the the default renderer which is what I've just been using before there's the p2d renderer for Hardware accelerated twodimensional graphics and the p3d renderer for Hardware accelerated 3D Graphics processing used to be built on top of this thing called applet old ancient technology to allow you to embed uh Java applications in a web browser kind of a dead defunct technology processing 3 has now removed applet as a dependency this makes uh three all sketches but in particular uh open gel uh 3D and 2D sketches p2d and p3d sketches run faster start faster less flicker quick full screen so all of these options that we're talking about are available here so if I were to say full screen you can see here is a nice Speedy demonstration whoops oh I forgot I've got to give it the renderer right so one thing that I that I mentioned before oops uh that I mentioned before about um that about the full screen function is you can pass it the particular display you want to go to but you also can pass it the renderer you want so p2d comma 1 would be the p2d renderer on the first display p2d comma 2 would be the p2d render on the second display right now I'm just going to do p2d on the default display uh oops read only and I'm going to oops I can't save it and I'm going to run it and you can see here it is so this is a sketch with a lot of particles running and processing super fast at a nice high frame rate full screen it started instantly this is a lot of work um has gone into updating not just this applet thing but just making these renderers work better with new openl features a more efficient code more stuff happening on the hardware card and so if you take a look on GitHub you'll see all you'll see the names of the folks who have really spent a ton of time fixing and fixing and fixing bugs to make this work really really well so you should thank them for that okay the other new thing about display uh working with displays and processing is that uh and let me just go back not that this I don't know why I need to open this but I'm going to go back to this Hue example for a second is that you know the world is now full of what what's known as high density displays so a Mac retina machine is a high density display a uh uh there's there's other types of high density displays for use with Windows computers so if you want to get that sort of finer quality rendering with processing you can do so with the new pixel density function so I'll just type that in here for example if I say pixel density 2 what this will do is it will sort of turn on retina or high density display rendering so you'll see finer smoother lines like you might like you want to see on a high density display I should also mention that really changes the way you think about the dimensions of your window right cuz there's the sort of Dimensions that you think it is 640 and 360 then there's the real pixel dimensions of that window because there's more pixels going in there to make it look sort of higher resolution so there's also some new variables pixel width and pixel height that you can use for Pixel processing and that sort of thing and there's more information about that in the reference okay uh oh finally there is an additional experimental renderer so if you're interested in really beautiful perfect high density display 2D rendering you might take a look at the this new renderer that's called fx2d so this is based on this is built on top of a technology called Java FX and it's uh optimized for like Fast high quality 2D rendering on a high density display it's experimental though certain things work certain things don't work give it a try and certainly um ask questions on the Forum or post bugs to GitHub for that okay the last thing I'll mention about this while we're on the size function is it's important to note that processing three requires you to use hardcoded numbers in the size function this is a requirement for uh uh that helps all the engine behind the scenes that's working to make the window open correctly full screen not full screen very quickly and be in the right position there are ways around it there's a uh uh and on the wiki I'm going to show you a Wiki page it'll be linked below there if you need to use a variable for that size function there's a way that you can uh get around it and other things that you might do if you're working with processing an environment like Eclipse but as a core rule right now that's become a little bit more strict with processing three you want to make sure you use a hardcoded number for size and size should be the first line and setup otherwise things can break and do strange things okay so I'm almost through this video I've been talking and talking and talking about new features in processing 3 and the last thing that I want to show you is the new contributions manager so one of the most exciting things about working with processing is the fact that there are all these libraries that you can use libraries to do interesting types of geometry to simulate physics to to use different kinds of hardware and sensors so um there is a new contributions manager which allows you to manage what libraries you have installed updating libraries with new versions um H and it it's it works great so I'm going to show you some of the features of that so if I go to sketch import Library ad Library it's going to pull up the contributions manager so one of the first things you can see here is that it this contributions manager is now fully integrated as one thing so whether you're looking for a library a mode a tool or example and by the way this is new example packages if you're the author of a textbook or if you're giving a workshop or if you just have a whole set of examples that you would like to release you can release example packages that can get downloaded into the the development environment directly so you can see here are three um four uh such examples from a couple of uh books that are out there about processing right now so you can see here there's a list of all of the uh libraries that are available to you and I can scroll through these list I can filter by certain keywords like I could say video I could filter also by a category here if I want and uh one thing I want to show you really quickly as you can see here I I I preinstalled a library but there's an exclamation point meaning this library is due for an update so a library that is installed you'll see in a minute has a green check mark and a library that's installed that needs an update has an exclamation point a library that's gray out is one that is not compatible with this version of processing so hopefully all libraries will soon become compatible with processing 3 and then they'll appear in the contribution manager and you can install them but let's just install a library just to go through that I'm going to go to connect uh I'm going to just type in Connect I'm going to install this Library I'm going to click on this install button right down here I'm going to install it it's downloading it's installed and if I look for that Library again whoops um you can see that there is the green check mark right there another useful tab by the way is up here I can go over to updates and I can see oh here are all the libraries that are available for updates and I can actually just collect select update all so if I have like 10 libraries that need to be updated I can just select update all and you can see actually how quickly it updated it download installed and that that that exclamation part became green so now those libraries are there the examples are there uh you can see which is the available version what's installed um so hopefully this new contributions manager will make it really easy to keep track of what you have what needs updating what isn't compatible what is compatible that sort of thing it sort of brings me to my next Point processing three is new there's a lot of libraries out there for processing if you are a library developer uh please get in touch with us if you need help updating your library for processing 3 uh you can post on the Forum you can send us an email you can uh tweet to processing org um we really like to be able to help people figure out how to make sure to get their libraries updated for processing 3 um and in the editor so um let us know what you need us to do for that and so the last thing I want to show you is just if you need more information about what's changed I've kind of this and you don't listen to me just whoops ramble uh and not look at this YouTube live event um I'm going to show you there is this changes in 3.0 Wiki so this will be linked in the video but this goes through all of these new interface things a lot of these rules about size the new renderers the syntax what's deprecated all of these types of things in in sort of text form so I'd also encourage you to read that over so you're very kind to listen to this very long video uh and look at these new features of processing 3 please let me know what you think if there's uh things that I miss Miss ask questions uh if there's ideas you have you can participate on the Forum you can post a bug report on GitHub and you can send us a messages in all the other kinds of ways people send each other messages in this today's world so thanks very much enjoy the rest of your day if you're still watching and I hope to come back and make more videos about things that you can do in processing okay byebye all right I don't know if anyone is still there uh okay 11 people are watching so I finished that video there was only one big big problem where there was like a section in the Middle where I couldn't get the debugger to work so I'm going to look at that right now uh just to see if I can fix the debugger if people have other questions they want to ask I will stick around on um YouTube for at least another um for at least another 15 minutes or I just got a strange text message uh uh hold on let me see what's going on uh uh okay actually I have a um I have a message that I have to attend to so actually I'm going to just be finished for today with this stream uh if anybody has any questions um you could send me an email or post me that message on Twitter I will uh and I'm going to look into this debugger thing and see if there's a bug that I need to post hopefully this video will do and I can kind of edit it uh to get it up there without having to rerecord it okay thanks for tuning in and uh post questions in the comments or you know how to reach me on Twitter I keep saying Twitter um and uh that's all okay going to stop uh oh wait I have to stop the stream over here
