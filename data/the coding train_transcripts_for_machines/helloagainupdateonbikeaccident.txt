hello I hope you can hear me I don't know if anybody's there and I hope I will see some chat messages coming through this is not an episode of the coding train sorry I'm typing my password on this other computer over here do I have to press this to see the chat let me see oh no I see messages there oh hey I am hi hi yes so I wanted to do a video to say hello I'm sorry that it's been about two weeks since I've actually done a video I don't have a plan for this I should have made a list of all the things to talk about hello Boston hi hi hi I have seen so many wonderful chat messages I can't believe they're already 202 people here so if you didn't see on Twitter or wherever else I might have posted this I unfortunately had a was in a bicycle accident I was the one riding the bicycle the bicycle accident was with the street and mostly my elbow and I'm trying to figure out how to look at you where's the camera if I look over there that's me looking at you yes that's the camera so this happened almost a week and a half ago and just to let you know so this arm is pretty much broken mostly in the elbow is the major area of destruction this wrist is also broken it's possible this wrist is broken but it's pretty stabilized will probably heal anyway even if it is I had surgery on this elbow to have the elbow put back together there's some now some metal in my arm I believe I might have been just in a fog of a days but I think the surgeon said they put some artificial bone that's made out of coral in my arm and so I'm wondering if the universe is trying to tell me something about machine learning first of all I know this is totally askew I will try to get a better set up to do video streaming for my remember I'm at home no no I I think I've done one lie stream from the park and everything else has been from my studio and but I don't know if you guys remember the first time that I started to do a video about machine learning I said I did say something something's in machine learning and the fire alarm went off then I just got started with my machine learning videos and once I just got started with that then I went to one day of the O'Reilly artificial intelligence conference which was really extraordinary I went toward this wonderful reinforcement learning workshop and I'm forgetting the fellows name who ran the workshop but anyway and then right after that workshop as I was riding a bike to go to a dinner that's when I had accident if you're just joining late you can see I have some injuries here so so anyway so I don't know what the universe is trying to tell me about this coatings the code code machine learning stuff but I will get better I was wearing a helmet his first thing I should say should so this is the very beginning of a video this video please wear your helmet my whole lip was split my tooth is messed up my clap these glasses were actually totally broken I should go get my helmet hold on a second I'm gonna go get my helmet to show you the scratches you can look at this is my favorite poster of this is a poster of all every single bird of North America the complete collection the chair in my apartment yeah talk amongst yourselves for one second Oh get my element here's here's a unicorn for you to look at oh you can't see the unicorn here there we go can look at the unicorn while I go get my helmet guess coming back now I loop the helmet okay here's the helmet let's see if we can find the part that's all scratched up it's actually doesn't look like much I don't know if this will come through I don't if you can see those scratches and scrapes on the side of the helmet that is the side that hit the ground I assume I did not lose consciousness or I did have a head CT scan which was negative so all right and yes a cell of the bride in the chat is say get a new helmet so if you didn't know this which I did no helmets are only good for one crash is kind of like car seats same thing for a kid's car seat so sorry for every who's bored by this that you sorry I need to get a new helmet although I to be honest with you I think it might be a while before I ride a bicycle again certainly in the city yeah I do need a shape it's gonna be a while before I if I did get the glasses fixed which is what I was talking about so people are asking a little bit more about the accident there's not really a great story to this but I will I guess I'll tell it's and people are interested I was riding in Midtown which I don't usually do I kind of only ever ride along the West Side Highway bike path because I'm a little bit afraid of riding in the city which makes sense so I was riding in Midtown and there was a street where the bike lane had as a lip like the bike lane was not in the same level as a street and I went out of the bike lane down the lip to go around something I said believe there I think there was a car park it kind of happen is sort of fast and I said I don't totally remember and then when I turn to go back in the bike lane and kind of like avoiding traffic and kind of going quickly I just wasn't careful and didn't really pay attention actually I think I was never in the bike lane first when I turned onto the street and that's partially why I didn't noticed the lip I was just not in the bike lane because I had to go past a car went into the bike lane if I had just stopped like pip walk the bike up and so I don't really know what happened that's what I don't really remember yeah I think I would say so then I just fell sideways I assumed I had my whole right side of the body hit the ground because the elbow must have been what hit first and was shattered this wrist must have tried to brace myself and then what the you know hit my lip was cut and glasses were smashed in the side of the face was also hit so anyway so that's the story there's not really and then actually some nice the cars started to stop big to say are you okay and I was kind of dazed and not really sure I kind of pulled the bike out of the street and like got to the side and leaned against the post but a very nice man stopped and offered it was a city bike so it's a bike sharing service offered to take the bike back helped me get I had some tissues in my backpack helped get those out for me so I could like put them on my lip which was bleeding quite a bit and then helped me on my phone find the urgent care the nearest urgent care which I that walks to because I really actually thought oh I just cut my face and I probably bruised my arm I guess I can't go to this dinner I was going to go to but that'll be a nice excuse to not go to the dinner but then once I got to the urgent care and it was quite obvious that the main tire I mean I you nobody wants to see these photos but there was like a swelling and my elbow that was you know rivals the size of this helmet it was quite big I mean we're talking about a large mango kind of sized a swollen elbow anyway so all said and done I'm fine and but I have to go on hiatus a little bit unfortunately in terms of the kinds of videos that I typically make I cannot type really right now I don't really have use of I mean I have some use of this arm I'm trying to be very minimal about it because the goal here is for this to heal on its own without having to have a second surgery on this wrist and I should know more I have another many life is just full of doctors appointments these days but I have an appointment with a sir interestingly enough of course the surgeon started talking to me about machine and using machine learning do you know recognize do diagnoses and medical inventory and stuff like that so that was kind of conversation I was having with my broken elbow in and out of surgery okay so so I'm trying to figure out what to do a couple things I'll mention I'm seeing a lot of wonderful messages scrolling past messages of support which I appreciate and at some point I'll stop and try to read some of these messages and answer questions but I'm going to kind of continue to ramble for a minute a couple things one is now the nice time for you to support the processing foundation processing foundation org while I'm on break if you're looking for something to support if you want to become a patron through my patreon coding train oh no sorry patreon.com slash coding train if someone could post that link if maybe they're somebody watching who's got admin privileges to post a link in the chat you still can I'm gonna put it on pause for one month so they'll be one month of pledges that I won't take because I feel like it there's gonna be at least four weeks of losing making videos and but then so you can join and it probably it'll it'll be on pause for that first month but I welcome people to join and you'll still still get an invite to the slack community and everything that I've been sort of growing around the channel what else do I want to say I do have a couple people who might hopefully work out to do some guest videos and so the guest videos where will the guest video Oh Kurt in the chat saying Kyle McDonald is doing a p5.js computer vision workshop in Berlin that's interesting um you may see a couple guest videos I I could do like you know I'm some live streams just from my apartment like I'm doing right now and answer some programming question I had an idea to do some kind of like office hours something but you know I I'm loathe to create something overly complicated because I just have enough stuff to kind of keep up in the air but I I also was thinking that I would just get that random numbers book just live stream all day and read somebody suggested this actually I can't remember suggested this I'm sorry if it's choppy it's my iPad on a home internet connection yeah and I can definitely do live stream Q&A I'm gonna go sorry I've been actually open up this this computer keeps going to sleep I have a secre computer to the side of me here I'm going to check okay all right there doesn't look like anything here okay so I I'm looking at the slack channel see anything posted there so that's pretty much it I wanted them to mention something about the patreon which is in terms of the patreon rewards there's a reward I can't write on actually I can type better than I can write on a whiteboard right now unfortunately this is my left hand so if this were my right hand I might be able to write on the left hand but this this arm I shouldn't you know I mostly I have it in the sling and completely immobilized but you can say I'm all kind of like still cut up on the hand and stuff here so that this arm is I can't really use it all so okay so I want to mention something about the patreon o rewards which is that if you decide to join the patreon that those rewards can take up to six months to a year for me to get to I have somebody helps me with this but I mostly just ship them out you know every few months I'll have a cup of day to just like get a bunch of books together and put them in packages so if and I know that if people are interested in the book the actual thing is that other rewards and getting them you should just buy them directly rather than join the patreon but I will you will get them it just it also like the actual expense of getting the book and shipping it you know it really costs as much as somebody backing the channel for like five to six months so depending on where you live around the world so anyway so that's also another reason why I might do you guys hear a lot of noise I'm seeing places okay so let me try to have some of these questions how soon will you get back to your regular coding videos I hope you have an update on that next at the end of next week so I have an appointment with the surgeon they're gonna take off what's on my arm right now and have another look at it and put something else on it and I'll hopefully have a better sense of the scheduling then Timothy is asking tell me about the accident this would be archived and I'll leave this online I won't put ads on it or anything and so you'll be able to watch that where I talked about the accident so my arm really does itch I'm sorry this stream is terrible I thought I'd have such a good Verizon FiOS connection at my house but I guess not so I apologize for that wonder if this iPad isn't so great at it um do i watch much youtube and if so what channels I don't watch much YouTube actually I think it's a kind of old fogey thing but I do watch I've been watching this three blue brown calculus videos and I watched some of Suraj's I watched most of all Suraj's videos I watched the happy cats videos so I guess they do watch a lot of YouTube okay oh great I'm glad that people are saying the quality is fine I dunno computer file I haven't watched very much reading the chat to look for more questions do I watch Tom Scott's videos I've heard the name but I have not watched Tom Scott's videos can I do some videos about could you can you do some videos about you and your history with coding I could do that so I could just do some like talking videos I'm not really like production value of video editing kind of person so it's just gonna be rambling me rambling like this which I don't know if anybody really wants to watch but I know like a fun fun function I also watch and I know that he does these great like musings and just kind of talking but I feel like they're just tightly thought out and planned and edited and highquality I don't know if I'm really capable of that okay are you in pain somebody asked yes it's painful but it's not so bad I mean it's it's it's and it's much it's getting much much better now so I did but especially after the surgery the surgery was my I didn't really realize this as surgery as much worse or more difficult to recover from than accidents itself the accident was kind of just like little scary and weird and they wrapped everything up but I was kind of feeling okay but once I had the surgery that my whole right side is really I've had a lot of soreness and pain and so I and the pain you don't if we're gonna have to have a lot of physical therapy high tech games how far was it for me to walk to the urgent care I think it was probably if I had to guess half a kilometer quarter of a mile something like that I haven't been out much I go for I live near on Central Park which is lucky and I go for I've been going for walks there which has been nice is my pink book written in Java or JavaScript so one of the things that I'm really sad about is this month I mean that in a way this is a lucky time for me I'm not teaching such a summer time I've had to adjust travel plans I can't do some of my travel plans but I'm not really missing out workwise this is a lowstress of time for me to just relax at home and heal but because I had this time period of some extra time on my hands I was going to really work on finally finishing up the new chapter ten and second edition of the nature of code the pink book and I know that's gonna be difficult for me to do anybody has any ideas oh the ideas for things that I could do or ways that you could help I'm totally open to that but so anyway the pink book is written in Java all the examples reported to JavaScript that's the nature of code book and I'm was I'm planning I was planning to have a second edition done by the end of this summer and I don't know that might be a little bit I'll learn es6 that's perfect so I was thinking of doing like video course or reading actually what I would really love I this is gonna this is a little bit ironic that I I think I prefer to learn by reading books over watching videos but if anybody has suggestions it's hard for me to read a book that have to flip the pages but I can read on the Kindle really easily so programming books may be around creative coding machine learning math algorithms what some would say um yes six maybe I should learn like react or something I don't know I shouldn't learn react that's a bad idea I should do anything that's useful so but if you guys have recommendations of that that I can read on the Kindle that would be useful tweet me at Schiffman is the best way to give me your recommendations I could do a video on book recommendations myself and then hi Chris and then do I play video games normally not really I used to the video games I used to play actually if you guys are resourceful you could find an old near Times article about me I had to guess maybe we're talking 2003 about my video game playing there's been two new york time you can find two New York Times articles about me one was also no we did the video game one is more like 2001 there's another one about some artworks that I made in 2003 which I am less excited about find that old New York Times article tweeted at me can retweet it I my I think my name anyway I had a I played on this Bungie was this company that I guess now it makes halo and was bought by Microsoft but I played there early games was a myth the Fallen Lords was the game that I played the most also marathon anybody played these games these were old all times okay all right oh and I do have some exciting news to report which is that the new music video progress is being made on the new music video so that I actually shot the music video already which is really lucky cuz I did all sorts of ridiculous stuff in the music video that I would not be able to do now with all my broken limbs Wow Josh found one of the articles art what if Jackson Pollock were a PC so that is one of the articles there's another one if you could find it I think it's at least two years earlier it's written by Michelle Michaels or Michael Michelle I met him I was at a game conference at the Javits Center just as like a fan and he started asking me questions about gaming anyway oldschool Bungie that's exactly right P Dahl 615 hi I don't know who you are but you're toast that's it is it still online I don't know who you are but you are toast you're toast that's it bye age is 43 and my birthday is July 29th coming up soon so anyway I think I started answering the question of when do I expect to be making coding videos again I was certainly told I sort of had the sense from the doctors that by the fall I would be able to teach my classes without too much of an issue I mentioned that I do a lot of writing on a whiteboard but I'm hoping you know if I had a goal for myself would be beginning of August but we'll see if that's realistic or not what do I think about MATLAB MATLAB looks awesome to me I don't know it very well you know a lot of Oh eggs and yogurt calcium that is good advice I was actually wondering that what's good for bone healing I was told protein is good too I do eat a lot of yogurt I do have kids that's why I have this is my daughter's unicorn stuffy it's about my own they're not here right now I'm actually home by myself I just finished a puzzle no this is a puzzle that I did with my kids last night that's sitting over there I'll show it to you a puzzle that we did together but glitter puzzle glitter princess 100 pieces 100 pieces is the perfect like puzzle for a sixyearold there's a wand here too I don't have my pal just like pull a rabbit toys anyway okay do I know any working pitch detection algorithm for processing hmm I don't I'm trying to think if if the processing sound library does that next challenge Tetris JavaScript without canvas that's really interesting I would probably I would probably do was I gonna say I would probably I probably do it with Kansas do you think VR programming will be in high demand oh hey Kyle Greenberg Kyle has helped me a lot with this channel Kyle is a researcher than ITP alum where I teach he was just there in the chat ancient history found that article what was I just talking about a brain I was talking about I can't remember now oh the code Tetris coding challenge loved to do that Tetris yeah oh we heard games yeah you know the nice thing about this I think this is an S but on as much of a delay this live streaming has less of a delay than the usual setup I have so VR programming so if what the students are interested in and kind of hyped up about at NYU is any sign there is certainly quite a bit of activity and interest and excitement around storytelling and related interactive experimental works with VR now I think Gabe who I work with an ITP has said this but he likes to think of the field more like experimental cinema or 360 cinematic VR is maybe a small piece of what's happening with video and the ability to manipulate video and work with video in new and environments and immersive environments you know arv our 3d etc but I think that you know a skill certainly in that it's something that I would love to learn and get better at is working with environments like unity and unreal engine and different environments like that where you can do programming well I really never get to follow that chat so it's I don't get to see as much of the troll ish messages make a PNG to ASCII code challenge please that's a great idea hello to India would you prefer C++ or Python actually that's another thing I should do I should just learn I should read a Python book and learn Python I'm not sponsored by Khan Academy or anybody so right now this channel is independent I do get support from New York University in a kind of informal way and I use a room there that's and I help oh and you know what some have another guest video that's actually I got a so I think there could be some guest videos coming which would be nice I would love that Peter Peter says I wrote a Python book if you have a Kindle version of it that would be ideal I think I can read a PDF on a Kindle there's no such thing as VR programming just to camera projection made matrices yes I think that's probably accurate or am i able to shave not really I mean I probably could but it would just be so awkward it's not worth it I can brush my teeth I could eat so fond Julius ask is there a slack channel for the coding train there is a slack channel it's currently closed only to patreon subscribers right now that doesn't preclude anybody from making their own community slack channel but that's one of the ways that I am using crowdfunding to raise a little money for the work that I'm doing is to use a patreon too for membership to the slack channel there is also a discord there's also a discord that that I don't know too much about but that's the thing that I know there's a community using quaternion I should look oh I can't get I can't really get up and run and do my joke I feel like I should just always have my cast in this I can't I don't have this gooseneck thing that the iPad is on I just okay Nick Tucker asks what role does AI play in medicine it's interesting question I I can't claim to have any factual expertise in this whatsoever but you know certainly if you think about image classification and how how often doctors and medical professionals use images to make diagnosis or read data from you know echocardiograms you could imagine that if you have I mean I'm really speculating here with again without knowledge of health care industry or anything but I could imagine a scenario where you had a large data set you know of broken arms images of broken arms and then you had an unknown image and you could say we had a lot of images of non broken arms and you trained an image classifier to recognize broken versus non broken arms so and that's a kind of simplistic way of thinking about it but I think you're probably a lot of other ways to think about that do I have a Raspberry Pi yes I have wanted to do Raspberry Pi coding tutorials they just haven't gotten around to it I don't have much to say about Bitcoin people are asking if they can in turn I am definitely accepting help with things but I'm a little bit good it gotta be pretty selfdirected so if you want to like poke through all my github repositories and just look at github issues I'm trying to like answer some emails and I'm using actually dictation on the iPad which has been working quite well for me to respond to things but so I'm definitely accepting all help do you think we live in a matrix good question what if what if I told you I do the answer to that question okay is web development in high demand in the East Coast I would say so okay any thoughts on coding boot camps no I don't know too much about them I mean I think it's great they're great let me Nicholas asked what would you like help with let me think about that I guess and maybe I can let me think about that honestly just like we thought about it all right so I think maybe all this has been 30 minutes so I think I'm probably going to get going soon and thank you for all the nice comments the tweets I've gotten the messages I've gotten it's been really nice and supportive all all things consider this is a pretty minor accident and the grand scheme of things that happen in the world and I'm doing just fine and I have really nothing to complain about and if people are interested in me coming on and doing a livestream like this is just answering some questions I'm definitely happy to do this pretty often and if I guess the thing that could be useful for me is to think about is there kind of like a lowkey way that I can generate content or answer questions or do stuff while I'm kind of waiting for this stuff to heal so thank you for tuning in the pingpong a I tweet have I seen I haven't looked through all the tweets that I've gotten in the last week and a half yet so I'm going to go back and do that and what's my favorite restaurant big fan of Japanese food and there are some very delicious very expensive restaurants there's a place that I went to what's it called oh my god it was so good oh I can't have to look this up do you guys want to wait for me to look this up look it up on my other computer I should also check the slack channel here justly okay uh let me see where it's that it's on like West 44th or something oh no East 44th it's like right by Grand Central Station Natsumi no no that's a place that I go to downtown hold on it's gotta be a list I don't know I can't remember this huh all right I can't find it does anybody watching no people are really la I love that I could see a realtime amount of audience here I will find out what this restaurant is and I will let you know in the next live stream trip you are you're desperate I do live in New York City yeah people are offering I've said some people offer to do like guest videos that I upload to the channel it's not Nobu I do I mean no booths amazing but Sokka goroh could be that that sounds right how come I can't rember they named this I want to say that it starts with an M so I teach at M as well New York University go to ITP NYU edu and that is a twoyear master's program that's part of Tisch School of the Arts it's part of New York University and you can find out more information about that program if people are student applying or visiting you're always welcome to and I hope that I'll be better to teach our teaching three classes three classes in the fall I love I think Python is awesome I wish I knew it better and did more with it I have lived in New York since 1995 so not always I gotta find out what this restaurant who love sushi is it not by Grand Central it is a Grand Central your I just look Oh sushi Yasuda I think it's yeah yeah yeah 204 East 43rd Street I think this is it sushi Yasuda I just had one meal there at the sushi bar that was like totally totally amazing I do not own a bike this happened on a city bike and yeah have I ever been to Europe yes I actually lived in London for eight months pretty recently in 2015 I did a semester at NYU London and I would love to go back to the UK and spend some time there I really had a wonderful time there found it to be a very enjoyable place to live and it was nice to be not that things are supposed to be away from I never mind I get it to American politics and I was 2015 so but it was just nice to be away for a while from this crazy country okay I'm Rita just reading the chats pretty interesting to read all your messages make community project so we can code together that would be an interesting thing to do I would love to that could be an interesting thing to have some community projects and they could make them as sorry I'm getting a text message from my mother she's apparently not watching this Oh somebody asked about guest videos so I might try to do some guest videos I prefer to have a kind of pretty strict durational creation of them and actually have them with guests working in with me here in New York but if people make coding tutorials what I'm not opposed to doing is making a curated list of them and then doing like a live stream that has a video that links to like other people's tutorials to like watch this week so like a kind of like highlight reel of like hey these are things you could read or watch this week or something or like a you know this week in creative coding type thing I feel like there have been some things that have happened recently that I wanted to mention there was a medium post about the new p5.js web editor I did hurt both arms this the right arm is unfortunately much more serious and had surgery and it's gonna be a letch longer recovery than this is just a broken wrist but but it's quite difficult to the surgeon actually asked if you wanted me to do you gave me the option of having surgery on both and I opted not to have surgery on this one and hope that it heals on its own so we'll see okay so um private lessons I don't a little I want to I'd love to help people and I mean I guess teaching at NYU is essentially my form of private lessons for students who are in that the p5 web editor I'm sorry I see a question I answer and then I lose my train of thought one thing I might try to do is do a live stream and maybe matcha who helps me with stuff or somebody else in the patron group and the slack channel can be like a moderator and just give me kind of like a curated list of questions and keep track of them and I can answer them at a time because right now I kind of read the chat and talk and then I stopped hi there were two questions I was answering and I forgot what both of them were how long did learn to take me to code well I started really coding probably in a serious way in 2001 so 16 years and counting would be my answer to that question okay so I was saying so a couple things as I could do like a High Line you know I could do like here are some recommended things to look at this week video the other thing is I'm encouraging people to in terms of news in the world of stuff that I work on is to check out the processing foundations medium account and there's a post about the p5.js web editor which hopefully will that be more publicly released soon but there's less information that post is written by Cassie who I'm hoping to sometime this summer have come as a guest I should talk to her about this first maybe we could do a little bit of like a launch of the web editor with some videos for processing okay so I think this is like really by the way this is really enjoyable I want to thank you guys for there's 473 people watching lots of really nice comments a few people are like please stop talking or you're boring but you know that that goes with the internet territory I can take it it's not so bad and I actually this is really I kind of lifted my spirits in a really nice way I mean I'm not actually seeing anybody or talking to anybody but just like having the nice messages and feeling like I'm making a video and I'm online on YouTube again I have felt a little you know it's not so pleasant to feel like it can't entirely take care of yourself and I can't exercise in the way that I'm used to and I can't work in the way that I'm used to and it's hard to just kind of enjoy the sort of forced vacation you know vacation is nice but forced vacation especially when it involves pain and surgery is not so great either but I'm doing again All Things Considered I'm smiling happy summer it's beautiful day in New York I think what I'm gonna try do is go for a walk after I finished this video and I will not be able to play clappy bird that's correct I don't I cannot clap this is my best attempt look doesn't it look like this hand is a completely different color than this hand this all bruised so I think that's still the bruising I mean I don't want to show you the gross thing but if I were to show you under my armpit it's all red and black and purple and bruised and it's really quite something but you know and so fake hand yeah the other guy unfortunately is just New York City Street it was just being the street that collided basically I wish I mean I wish I had a better story not that I want to get hit by a car or something but so a lot of you are asking what happened I this video is now about 40 minutes long it doesn't hurt it's difficult to change tshirts yeah changing shirts is not easy hey got a testing reply to my mom so let me see here let me at least read what that message is and also I'm not really doing a good job ask questions and Twitter select something to do create Q&A sessions that could be 15 minutes long do mix social media with YouTube so you can grow your followers this is not for my mom this is for somebody of that Patriots lacks channel by other option could bring someone into code yeah pair programming oh that's an interesting idea I think would be some funny high jinks there could be some good shtick tell me see this message oh she's asking about my tooth I okay I went to the dentist today because this tooth is sore and a little bit loose but they xrayed the tooth and it is just gonna heal on its own and it looks like so my tooth it should be fine okay so I think that's it I could keep going on and on maybe I can you know maybe mild concussion there was no head trauma I had a CT scan but it's sort of unclear I had a bit of a headache for a couple days but I mean it didn't seem I'm pretty lucky in that respect okay so again I wanted to end on a positive note which was how nice this has been to see your comments and to be able to be live and making a video again even though there's really not anything in this video but me rambling I am definitely happy to do this once a week I do have people are asking I do have good health insurance I'm very lucky this is not something that everybody has and there's something that I really believe everybody should have and should have easy and free possibly I don't want to get into this but I believe health care is a human right let's just put it at that but I'm very lucky to have good health care through my job at NYU and so I haven't had any issues on that front which is again just part of this kind of privileged existence okay so um thank you everybody and um now that I ended on my on that note I will I don't know maybe I'll just come do some live streams every was so often don't go I I don't know what else to do here I could stay here and like it's sort of like I am just having a video chat with my friends and just leaving it open but I think I probably should go is Friday night and not that I'm going out to do anything exciting but my kids will be home from camp soon and we'll have a nice Friday evening I will be hopefully seeing the spiderman movie this weekend mom Maude Maude mom Kony wants me to read their name and and yeah that's about it so thank you for all the nice messages I'm really I mean is not something I should apologize for but I somehow feel the need to or the desire to I'm really sorry or at least disappointed that when I had just kind of gotten some momentum and started having this like bigger piece of free time over the summer to keep making videos that this happened and now I'm kind of on hiatus so but you know stuff happens this wasn't I I'm having a heart trouble with like this saying this wasn't my fault because I kind of feel like it was but it was just an accident and so I have a sense that I'm sure I will be better and I'll just be making more videos when I come back so thanks everybody and this video will remain archived and live on the channel but not life it will remain archived and available I see no reason to not leave this as an archive video anybody could watch they really wanted to because I just have to look at this button because there's a little button here that'll have to be like little effects look at that glamour dance party okay oh I could have been live streaming this whole time like this but can you actually see that documentary sketch and these aren't so exciting I can do better than this myself huh I could make some software that does this okay okay I'm screwed oh yeah let me just go back here okay Laura asking one last time okay how do I get rid of this normal swipe down I try this okay okay how about this dot this dot this dot this dot song never forget now this is too weird people wanted to see my farm on assignment wearing my rogue NASA tshirt this is the arm this this is the broken elbow there is a picture of the xray on Twitter and as always I don't have my pal do you have a piano over here never forget this top I would play the piano that would be so nice I can actually play the piano and I could sing in
