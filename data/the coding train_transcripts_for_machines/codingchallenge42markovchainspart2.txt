hello in this video I'm going to see if I can come up with a new name for this YouTube channel because I need a new name and what I'm going to do is I'm going to generate one using an algorithm called a marov chain now if you watch the previous video then I spent a lot of time talking about what a marov chain is and building the code for a marov chain from scratch one thing I didn't do do however which this video will focus on is how to use a marov chain to generate a short phrase so in this sense what I'm going to feed into the marov chain is many many examples of that short phrase so you could use city names or character names or thesis title ideas or course title ideas I think of that like school stuff because that's what where my brain is at but you know YouTube channel names so um here are a bunch of uh YouTube channel names that came in suggested from the viewers through a Google form now I could actually connect to the Google form directly and I have a example that shows you how to do that but I think for right now for Simplicity sake this is just in a text file called names.txt so I'm going to go to the marov chain code no longer do I want to have the hardcoded text about the Unicorn or the theramin instead what I want to do is I'm going to make a variable called names I'm going to add the preload function so in P5 the preload function is a function where I can preload data files like images sounds and other kinds of data files and I'm going to say names equals load strings names.txt so if I do this and I'm just going to say console log names I'm going to get lots of weird errors CU I took out a bunch of other things um I should see o I don't see any oh yeah that's what I do I'm going to see this array of all the I have an array of all the names that people suggested and there's some other errors so now what I need to do is I need to do this so This engrams remember this engrams variable stores the table of everything so what I need to do is instead of having one piece of text that I feed into the model the engram table um the barov model table thing I to call it um I need to do that through a loop so what I need to do is I need to put an outer loop so I'm going to say uh for VAR J equals z J is less than names. length j++ and I'm going to put a loop around all of this and then what I'm going to do is this inner loop is the thing that adds stuff to the NRS model what I'm going to do is say VAR text equals names index I so I'm going to add each line from that text file one at a time to the model the reason why I want to do this is I want all of that to be part of the Poss possibilities however one thing that's not built into my code is well how does a name begin a name could begin with C Cod Jo y c o d t h e o d e w n so I want to keep a separate list of actual possible Beginnings for the generation process so on the one hand I'm kind of done here like it um the thing that won't work let me run this uh cannot Le read property length of undefined sketch. JS line7 let's see what the error is uh ah H oh names index J boy that's bad and j++ so remember the outer loop is J so I'm looking at each there is no I so that worked and you can see I'm getting a nice big list uh with all the sort of possibilities that table is working if I hit generate though I'm going to have an error and that error is txt is not defined because how I was able to how I started the generator was with just the first three letters or whatever the order is of that seed phrase now what I think that would make sense to do is I need to I want to create I'm going to call it Beginnings I don't know if I've mentioned this by the way that this most of the all the code that I'm writing is based on python code written by Allison parish and I'll make sure to credit her in both the previous video and this one I guess I'm mentioning it now I should have mentioned it in the first one um so thank you Allison for that code that at some point I looked at a couple years ago when I first started doing this stuff um okay um so that was implanted in my head two years ago and it's coming out right now I guess there might be some differences never mind okay so I what I want to do is have an array uh a called Beginnings which are what are the possible Beginnings so each time I look at a name the first gram is a possible beginning so if if I equals z beginnings. push gram so I want to keep track of an extra list of all the possible Beginnings meaning here is the table of all of the NRS and possible outcomes and if I look at beginning here is an array of all of the possible ways that a name could begin and again there's redundancy here and why are they all two characters instead of three oh my n must be two the N is two okay that's right um I was going to start with three so if I do this again and hit Beginnings we can see yeah so these are all the possible ways that a name could begin and there's redundancy in there but I like that because I want my names to begin with the same probability as my input data so now what I'm going to do is down here the current gram just needs I just need to pick a random beginning So Random Beginnings so I just pick a random beginning and that's where I start and then I let the algorithm just go so let's run it and see what I get coding codes and unicolors coding time rainbows shiftman's rainbow coding heres and dis spectrum of colored orange yellow code Kiton that in that code so you can see have we found something yet I think first of all a couple things one is I should probably limit the name to about maybe 15 characters I don't know maybe let's limit it to 20 and uh maybe let's make the order two because it's making too much sense coding blander cande unic coding happy Rodi coding pitchy code Cod the K Dro coding in happen OD thatan rating C so you can see here that this is working but what the order is is really going to affect um affect the sort of the this. show coding balloon coding meteor meteorological P Happy Jumpy Dancy codes and so uh that order might be too high I might only be getting literal the sort of literal names and another thing here to point out is this would be much more probably interesting if I had a data set of a 100,000 names that I could use um you know something you might try is to you know what's your input data come up with what the thing you're trying to name see if you can find a really big data set maybe have a slider where you can adjust the order so the the user can actually pick what that order is as as the user is generating text from it so I don't know if we've come I really thought that at the end of this video I'd be able to do this and now the new name of this channel is you know let's just say it's okay hold on let's make the order three is that's kind of in between let's just say it's for the rest of today the name of this channel is drum roll Joy of light appearing D # jooy of light appearing D see you all in another video I there some more stuff that I need to talk about which is looking at uh generating Markov chains for longer pieces of text perhaps as well as uh on the word level I think would be worth taking a look at as well okay
