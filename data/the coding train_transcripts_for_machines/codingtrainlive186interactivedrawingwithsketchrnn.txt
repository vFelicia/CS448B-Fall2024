good morning it is Friday which has been released since last week the day of the coding trade and that is what you are watching live on YouTube I am here my name is Dan Yolo mmm chief maan and I'm here to do some coding stuff that's what happens on the coding train it's a person with the green screen and a laptop and a room with lights that are very warm and new cameras that don't shut off except for last week when they did shut off and I'm hoping that doesn't happen this week because I have a new thermostat that I turned down to make it cooler and it does not feel cooler in here at all currently in fact I don't have a camp roaming camera to show this to you it says it is 78 point one degrees in this room the temperature on the thermostat is set to 70 degrees and in fact in fact I even see one of these little like snowflake icons little snowflake icon that shows that the air is on and over here hmm people are telling me maybe the sound is quiet I'm not sure there's a vent up there you can't see the vent that's the vent there's air coming out it's warm air oh that's warm air that's weird there's another vent over here let's go examine this other vent this is what you two did for right a crazy person talking about the temperature climate change is real people it's getting very warm in here go to the whiteboard now one thing I did which is nice is I changed the settings of this particular whiteboard camera you might have noticed in previous videos that as I walk in the white balance starts to go crazy the focus goes in and out so it's no longer auto focus in fact as I come in here closer I am glory which makes me much better looking but hopefully I've tuned the focus well on this on the whiteboard so as I draw that's where the focus will be also some events here you don't feel any air coming out of them mmhmm all right so I'm gonna be here anyway I don't my glasses are all like best ugh today they're like there's nuts on them and I can't see this is not a good start highly professional operation we've got going here I do have a thing of buttons I change the cameras and stuff let's see what's happening in the chat hello from Peru it is also 1535 in South Africa so processing or p5.js today alright so let me just get right to the point which is to talk about what today's topic is so today's topic I'm going to look at a particular pretrained machine learning model called sketch RNN and this is work of researchers at Google which I will reference and point to when I get there so sketch RNN is a model that's trained off of a data set of drawings so I've used it before in previous coding challenges or videos but today I want to program an example where the user draws the user stops drawing and the AI or the computer or the algorithm or the pretrained machine learning model takes over and predicts what the next stroke should be to create a drawing of something maybe it's a cat maybe it's a rainbow maybe it's unpredictable so that's what I will be building today and by the time I leave which is around twoish hours from now did I start last week at 9 a.m. remember I did two and a half hours but I have a thing I've got about two hours so that's the time I leave hopefully that's going to be built a couple of the things I want to address first let's see if this works thank you to the sponsor of the coding train livestreams brilliant org brilliant odd org is a website for lifelong learning with a lot of interactive puzzles and full interactive courses that you can learn through doing and you can check it out at brilliant org slash coding train I will come back later in the livestream and look at the daily challenge there's a daily challenge every day I'm brilliant on organ and try to solve it along with you the viewer watching the other thing I want to do is address the swirling controversy around the coding training which is this new series that I launched recently called coding in the Cabana which I'm really excited about that's me and my sunflower shirt which I think I might actually be able to wear I was afraid I couldn't wear the sunflower shirt here due to the green screen and it's got green on it my shoe just came untied well it fix that in a minute but I think that I can and this is a new style of video that I'm doing which I'm recording at home in this little shed which just sounds a little fancy calling a Cabana and I did a video of the more rows it's kind of like my coding challenges but maybe with a slightly more relaxed vibe to it just trying to try out new things and I've already recorded the second one which I guess I am i spoiling it if you don't want to know what it is close your ears like it's not on that off the next minute or skip ahead if you're watching the recording three two one the coop's conjecture so I'm gonna do a visualization of this thing called the Collatz conjecture inspired by some numberphile videos but there was a major issue with these vit with this video to see if I can find a chalk I love that video but the sound of the chalk is and everywhere in the comments chok chok well I I guess I'd have to keep scrolling down there's a lot of more comments here eventually if I search for chalk or scratch there's a lot a lot of comments about the chalkboard and just to show you what I'm talking about also you couldn't see the chalkboard so we're talking about this thing here this chalkboard here I wanted to have a bit of an analogue feel to drawing and diagramming you know I certainly could use a tablet and that might be something I do in the future the reason why I'm bringing this up is because I used the chalkboard for the second video which I created shot and recorded before getting all those comments so I'm working with coding trained viewer Nathan who is some audio engineering expertise to see if we can lessen that chalk sound at least and then I think what I'm going to attempt I hope to maybe record another one this weekend and kind of doing these on the weekend he's try doing I certainly I could use a tablet or a Wacom board or something something like that but again I want to keep the analog feel for now so I think what I'm gonna try is an overhead camera and just paper and marker on the table so there you go that's my spiel about coding in the Cabana I also haven't figured out and this is something that I've been discussing with violet who is come on board to help me with some of the github repos stuff I don't know if I'll it's in the chat say hello to violet but the coding and the Cabana video currently isn't on the website so I guess that present probably but a lot of people made more rows Vic community contributions so I would like to figure out a way for people to share those maybe there should be another coding in the Cabana page that's different or they just end up here on this page but they have a little like the visual treatment that shows that one of the Cabana videos I don't know open to your suggestions if you have ideas about that the website is a community created project so you're welcome to contribute to it if you're interested in that Simon is alluring to me that if you are part of the coding train member program it's not really good program but I'm calling it back I think it sound very official which you can sign up through the join button on YouTube you will get an invitation into a slack chat slack it's not a slack channel it's a slack workspace which and has various channels in it one of which there's a chat going during this live stream that I'm looking at right now and Simon created a brilliant channel so we can discuss the brilliant problems there that's my spiel is that what I said hey how are you Dan I hear that you were sick ah and Daniel garden Daniel garden where's there's a CJ you Daniel garden should be garden friends I'm surprised you don't have a discord okay so this is something I've been discussing with psy who is the community manager for the coding train and hopefully they're gonna maybe post a poll or get get this discussion going in the slash channel there is a coding train discord that someone you started up I popped in there for like five minutes and then I kind of like got freaked out I've got back in you know I'm old and don't know how these things work the Internet is very confusing to me Oh get off my slack workspace I I don't love slack I mean I like a lot of things about slack I don't love using it for the coding train it's the messages aren't archived it's a closed space I mean I'm making that decision to make it a closed space but I don't really have the budget to pay for the sort of like verge it's like five dollars per user for a month which we're sort of defeat I suppose I suppose I could maybe do that if that is what the community thinks it's best I could figure out a way to do that but anyway so I've been thinking about switching over to discord and one idea is to you take over that unofficial disk or maybe make a separate one or I don't know there could be a discord than anybody can join the with like certain channels that are just for the members I really don't know what makes the most sense here so I look to you the community to help advise me on this and speak speak up and voice your thoughts about how the community can be accessible and inclusive and welcoming to everyone and that's something that's a really big priority for me and one of the things that I've learned with dealing with online communities is you can't just say that and can't just make things that people can sign up for you have to be very intentional about ways of inviting people in and and and fostering that kind of environment so hopefully I'm doing a good job at that I'm sure there are things that I'm doing not well and I and you should never be should always feel empowered to send me a message and let me know about how the community feels for you okay switching to discord is cheaper discord with member channel says Ben's what what about Facebook I'm not a fan not a fan of Facebook I do have a Facebook account I kinda know I would like to pretend that I never look at it mostly true but I think I do catch myself lurking in there from time to time there is a coding train Facebook page that doesn't get a lot of attention but it could be something I use more but I don't think that the Facebook groups is the right mechanism for the community to interact with each other that I feel pretty clear on okay Loch Ness cowrites I'm in the discord okay that's good to know TMC writes its the chalk itself that's weird and all high tech so Loch Ness feel free if the discord at the moment is an official discord I you know I don't have any oversight or purview in it it's people have selforganized to chat and talk about the coding train which I love that that's happening so Co you should feel free to share it and we can you know whoever I don't know if there were some administrators of that discord want to reach out to me to talk about if we want to make I to make that more of an official thing and yes I mean there's so many opportunities to do BOTS and interface with it I've so much that I want to do to upgrade my streaming but the truth of the matter is because I also have a fulltime job I really don't I don't spend the amount of time on the coding tray that maybe other people who are doing content creation and livestreaming fulltime are for better or worse that's just the reality and I am trying to hire more people to help me with this to expand the the feature set of what I'm doing as well as figuring out new ways to do stuff like create the content create this new coding the Cabana series from home but some things that I want to do just off the top of my head that just to mention and people can remind me about those are I want to get interstitial animations for starting and ending and taking breaks and that sort of thing having more BOTS that are kind of doing moderation and the chat or just that are fun and playful that can happen in the chat whether it's their discord or the YouTube chat that stuff I want to do I am working to launch a new merchandise store with standard standard is a company that helps out creators they're really a community of creators and they help with sponsorships and merchandise stores and things you can check them out at standard TV they also have a new streaming system called nebula which you should definitely check out and I'm some of my content is on there and I'm thinking about new ways to put content on there as well but but once we get the new standard store up and running then I'm gonna have new rewards for people to sign up for members and patrons and that kind of thing so that's just taking a very long time and if you're curious have questions about that you can reach out to community managers I also if you tweet at the coding train on Twitter that's on Saipan adjust that account and also on Instagram the Instagram has changed it is now instagram.com slash the coding dot train so this is the coding train Instagram also run by Sai and you can just sort of check out stuff that's being posted there I'm hoping that we can I can do more with sharing your work that people who are watching and making things on Instagram and that's something I'm trying to set up some new processes for alright know what else do I've got to say Oh also you should follow my cat's on Instagram mango and let's check on let's check in on that mango and goose look at this there we go this is very cute that's also Greta and this is Evie Greta and Evie look at those ears have you ever seen a cat with like foxy ears like that they're pretty amazing they're kittens I love them they're super fun you can follow them on Easter ah I knew there was a reason we're gonna make drugs of cats alright let's have a little fun I should probably do this no you know what I'm gonna take a break I want to mention a coating trained viewer Redfoo who has created a game called noisy food I oh and actually did a livestream about it Redfoo apparently learned to code from watching a lot of my videos also shoutout to coding garden with CJ the game that Redfoo made I believe that back end was I gotta answer this question from Jonas or Eunice in a second the the back end of red Foos game noisy foo was created from based on tutorials from CJ excellent coding channel if you want to find a channel that livestreams really often I mean I can't speak for CJ don't know what his future plans are but I see a pop up of almost every day of a livestream from CJ so I highly recommend you check out coding garden with CJ alright so check I maybe I will come back and play this game a little later let's just play it once right now just for fun oh oh oh oh you know here's the thing actually I gotta get a certain sound effect to happen so I got to change my system preferences here and I got to go under sound and I got to change this to multi output device so I think now you should hear the audio from the let's just see why did that come through it should have let's try one more time you get like a slightly better score here don't bump bump ow that makes me so happy I'm saying it oh my kids are very tired of me talking about this game noisy foo leaderboard let's see where am I here coding train coding train hello coding train your ranking is 58 Oh dare you to try to beat my high score here coding train I got a high score a 2 to take that David is writing Schiffman did you see that I beat your score yes I think almost everybody on here is beaten might score there are few people who are lower but have fun with this I had a lot of fun with this check out Redfoo I don't think Redfoo needs me to promote his stuff but check it out it's a lot of fun maybe I'll try to play in a little more later ok holy if only I could play and dance to some of red foods music without getting like the YouTube copyright engine spinning that would be kind of fun I'm sorry I'm sorry For Party Rocking that's all I have to say now my glasses by the way I'm now realizing really could use an upgrade let's move on to the topic of today so ah give me a minute here to pull up some links that I want to refer to Oh ukulele tutor submissions so um Lokesh writes can you react to ukulele tuner submissions so I think I did a bunch of those already I don't know that a lot of new ones have come in maybe Lokesh I don't know maybe you you posted a new one in Alexander this if you if you're really looking for the drawing with sketch or an end content and that's all you want I might suggest waiting for the edited version that will come out my process has gotten a little bit slower there's some good things about that and some notsogreat things about that but that will come out soon but most of the live stream is yes me wasting your time that it's a 100% accurate tune out good it's a beautiful day in New York City I'm training for the marathon exercise go outside play some music meditate all of these things are probably more valuable uses of your time than this if you want the tutorial wait for the edited version I would say I look caleb is eating oatmeal oatmeal my breakfast of choice big fan big fan oatmeal oatmeal huge fan oatmeal just huge fan oatmeal you Tran I was responding oh you clearly tuner but I did I'm glad that you mention that because let's find the ukulele tuner video I got to work on my SEO apparently oh boy coding train we're gonna get there there we go because I do want to mention a comment that came in recently which was really helpful to me let's try maybe sorting by newest first here we go so this is from a wisp chart interesting name from from on YouTube and wispy art rights one thing that I need to point out let's see is that your detection of closest note is not working properly because notes are existing in sense scale 100 cents per note 1,200 cents per octave while you are trying to operate in frequency scale Hertz the problem is that relation B frequency scale note scale is not linear so closest note by frequency designed equal closest note by sense distance so it sounds like from that description which you know I'm assuming is accurate wispy art sounds knowledge bonus writing in a thoughtful manner but I mean like fact check this and I'm sure people in the chat might be able to offer their thoughts as well but that if I apply some additional math in terms of this values that are coming out of the machine learning model and think about this other scale then I might be able to have a more effective interaction and visualization of how close I am to the correct note here is how and so wispy art maybe has made their own version in Scala skaila I don't notice that it's another programming language and then here is a live pitch detector that also uses CREP so let's look at this and see how this one works I say allow and let's let's get the ukulele here well this doesn't appear to be working why are you not working you're a very nice ladies by the way this was not in tune I didn't ever Ellis strings were left over from last week that was my little improvisation I don't know why but I'll investigate this later but that's something that I would love to address or think about and thank you so much you know I don't catch these days I'm not catching all the comments that are on YouTube but I try to keep a look and every once in a while something really thoughtful and helpful comes in and thank you to that user interaction Oh an assignment is telling me something I don't know what Simon's telling me did I not do something correctly click click click hello hello click click click user interaction click click click alright alright but I want to move on because I want to get to what I the topic of the day hold on everyone I'm getting an important message Simon thank you for the reminder about the user interaction and understand what you're saying now matthew is pointing out that maybe the focus is a little bit fuzzy and I think it is I think that let me see let me see how I can best fix this by the way I did a little investigation and it appears that there is a way for me to I'm using these sony alpha 7 3 cameras and that appears and by the way I think this one went off well that's not good it's getting hot in here so I believe there's a way that I can remote control these cameras from through WiFi or Bluetooth which if there's an app or even from the computer I could adjust the focus and white balance and that kind of thing but what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to put the train whistle here which is a pretty far back approximately where I stand Elizabeth maybe that then let's just put it here no this is gonna work I'm tryna I last week I had the mug and I could focus on I think what I could do is I could just pull my laptop back further I do want to fix the focus what do I have I have a book of random digits up here this will work this is like by accident I am buzz marketing a product that I don't mean but I really like it but this is not an official sponsor but I can use this to do the focus so this is about more like where I'm standing then the actual laptop screen so I think if I go and adjust the focus on that give me a second here I'm walking over to the can this is a oneperson operation here how to focus on focus I can even go a little past it because I'm a little bit further behind it that should be better how's this look better better worse better worse if I move back I think this is better I think this is better yes I hope Alexander is not continuing to watch hope they've been outside 96,000 120 you know I think I'm on the same page over time let's go for the whoo let's read some today on the coding train Gaussian deviance two point six five four that's a negative negative two point six five four negative point three one two point one seven zero negative 1.645 point zero seven nine point four one four point five seven nine point three four five point four seven two five one point five three one point one point two six eight one point four nine two negative three points them thank you for those of you who tweeted at me some collective collector's item original prints of this book I'm kind of afraid to like press the prime I don't mind most of them are for sale for like five hundred six hundred dollars and this to me feels like a purchase well worth it in terms of two things my coding trained hordes of cash but I feel that it's a little bit unreliable what sort of condition it's in some one of them says pages are missing one says it's like a third printing so I need to do some more research here but as some of you pointed out that the over the weekend or yesterday a couple days ago the channel hit still here nine hundred thousand subscribers which is kind of nuts and so getting there getting there to that you know moment of that's nice thing to sort of celebrate or enjoy I don't think we should optimize our lives towards subscribers there's more important things I would be happy if it stopped right now and I was you know just bringing people into the community who wouldn't otherwise who would like to learn to code who didn't have their own otherwise have an opportunity that's more meaningful but you know it's happening and so I could it makes sense okay good and I really would like to have that collector's item original print so be on the lookout do a little internet research if you got five minutes tweet at me if you find if you if you feel like you found something that's really the the one I should I should just press that button click that button especially if it's like some kind of local community bookstore that happens to have a copy as opposed to just you know blah blah blah ah jonas asks again why are you on the front page of processing so first of all that video on the front page of processing is a very out of date and I feel slightly embarrassed by it I mean the video is fine but I feel slightly embarrassed being there on the front page with a pretty outofdate video so I think it actually would be nice to make a new video for the home page reprocessing anybody want to help work on that that's a thing but I am director or administrator on what the right term to use is of the processing Foundation which is a nonprofit organization that organizes events and does initiatives and educational initiatives and community initiatives around open source and creative coding and so I've been involved with the processing project since around 2003 I am I know means one of the creators of processing nor am I born of really the maintainer the processing I'm just an enthusiastic supporter and participant in the processing community and happened to be there on the homepage okay we got to get started with this before that everything starts to go to crud we're gonna do this are we gonna do this in the p5 web editor yeah why not how am I feeling about the p5 web editor today I think I can make this happen interactive drawing with sketch Arnott okay could you increase the volume you're talking is a bit quiet so nobody else has said that thank you for noting that MX and but I'm afraid to increase the volume because sometimes when I do that in the recording there's clipping or peaking and so I'm gonna assume that maybe you that that's not a universal feeling but please let me know particularly in the slack channel if which I can catch those messages a bit more quickly if there are any issues alright alright I'm about to get started what's it so it's only 40 minutes in by the time I code well how's this month this is crazy so this is the mug you might remember this infamous mug and the keying is so much better this is a green mug but it's a slightly different shade of green that the keying is actually so much more precise in this new studio that I'm recording it I am 3 decibels less than the old set up I am happy to turn it louder but I am concerned it's not the nice thing is that can always get turned up in when the edited version happens well let's let me let me try something let me tie my shoe enjoy this dot as always I always forget to this stop Oh thank you everybody my mic was off I'm gonna wait till everybody realizes that I figure that out and I was playing with the audio I know this sounds is off the sounds off have to wait about thirty seconds now yes thank you CJ the microphone is muted I just don't I want to wait till the messages stop coming in telling me that okay and now people are telling me it's too quiet okay sounds good now here we go ready everybody ready hello and welcome to a coding challenge drawing with the computer with an AI whose buki Halloween [Laughter] no Halloween no Halloween references those don't those aren't very evergreen although it is about time to watch my arrow [ __ ] videos again hello and welcome to a coding challenge interactive drawing with the computer so what you are looking at right here is a demo from the magenta project this is the sketch RNN demo and what's happening here is I the a person is can walk up to this computer machine start drawing whoops let me clear one more shot when we're shot it's 80 just someone you know it's over 80 degrees the thermostat is on it's set to 70 degrees take three hello and welcome to a coding challenge interactive sketch are an N drawing you realize that this is how I just basically spent my entire day just like saying stuff trike again over and over again hello and welcome to a coding challenge drawing with sketch RNN now you might be wondering what sketch are an N that's ok that's good if you don't know what it is you're in the right place I'm going to try at best but my drive try my best to explain sketch RNN and give you some background reading material that you can look into to do a deeper dive and then make a project like this one right here I'm going to attempt to recreate this exact project so this is a demo on the magenta magenta is a project around machine learning ai and art from Google research and this is a project where you the user or me right now can't clear the screen you can draw I'm gonna draw like a little circle here and another little like this I'm gonna draw a little tail and then see if the computer can pick up where I left off and continue drawing a cat and you can see it's doing this over and over again I can also switch to say a pineapple this will be fun and I can hit clear and I can maybe I can start the pineapple and see oh look at that see what comes next Wow like magic but it's not magic this is machine learning so if you want the I think as soon as it gets to be 80 degrees is when this happens let's see if the focus at least stays today one thing I could do is to focus even the focus doesn't appear to have stayed why does the focus even like die I am very out of focus today's coding train I need a like brilliant two poster I can just put up here you know new cameras they don't go to sleep all this work and I am just destined destined to never be able to live stream without cameras that power themselves off this is actually worse than it was before at least before it happened on a schedule and the focus didn't get lost one thing I'm gonna do just briefly is I'm gonna open the door I don't know if this door is gonna make its way and get some cool air in here a little bit crazy that I'm doing this because now I am actually livestreaming with the door propped over anybody walking by in the hallway hello it's early enough in the morning that there aren't too many people here but I can feel the air coming in woo woo human rights the preshow dance was too hot for the camera I hopefully the air coming in here is going to help this by the way I'm not I will not be back live streaming next Friday without this being fixed so hopefully I can get this resolved I'm just gonna let some air come in here actually and maybe I'll get a maybe I'll refill my coffee that's always a good idea I'm gonna keep the mic on this is a bad idea but you're gonna hear me talking as I go over to the kitchen and I should probably just get some ginger tea we usually switch the ginger tea around the lemony maybe this was like a snowflake here we go you wanna do is I'm gonna also let the camera the offer you have a fan in there no but clearly that would help I think if I leave that camera off for a little bit everybody just take a little break so copper asks how old is the camera it's brand new it is a sony alpha 7s I can move over to here for a second I turned the lights off in this room the lights are LED lights they really shouldn't eat up the room so much but I think the power supply's get kind of warm go quickly look and see if there's a fan somewhere on the floor here I'll be right back I'm gonna leave my mic on I know it might actually that's dangerous cuz if I go too far the wireless connection might start to make weird noise and so let me mute them I'm gonna mute the mic and I will be right back I'm gonna look for a fan I'll just leave it here drawing a pineapple there was the pineapple pineapple pineapple there we go all right and then I'm gonna put this music back on sorry everybody I'll be back I'm looking for a fan well it's already cooled down just 78 degrees in there so where does pineapple ever I'm gonna power the camera back up there is someone is looking for a fan we're gonna knock on the door I'm gonna try to move on all right I'm very sorry about this I'm gonna push through and see if I can get this project completed I have a little over an hour we're just not good I'm also going to take about a half an hour I'll take a break and hopefully the cameras are gonna comply with me we got it down to 77 degrees dropped by three points just opening the door and during the lights off for a few minutes and maybe a fan will arrive okay all right here we go whoa that's an interesting pineapple it's really it's particularly sad because I lost all the momentum and like what I was talking about but it'll get edited together again somehow so what what did I last say I'm you know what I'm not gonna worry about it I'm just gonna random repeating myself so I can get moving here I'm so sorry everybody so sketch on sketch RNN is a pre train is it sketch RNN is a machine learning model that was trained on drawings drawings of a lot of different things like this pineapple here the data set that was used to train it is a data set called the quick draw data set which has about 50 million drawings in it I believe in or around 300 I think it's 384 but I'm not really sure the sketch RNN was trained on a data set of drawings that draw that data set is from the Google quick draw data set so I really I lost all my momentum and energy I should just play like the noisy food game or read some random numbers but I got a push forward overheating is a common problem with the Sony a7 roomtemperature shouldn't be the problem right smacks do you think max that just having like a small fan that's pointed at the camera would help I mean the whole point of these cameras is to yeah I don't know all right I'm sorry I got I got a I gotta go got a move on okay the quickdraw dataset has millions and millions of drawings in it and was collected as people played this game called quickdraw where the player is asked to draw a particular category and I think there are I think it's 384 but somewhere well over 300 different kinds of drawings in this data set if you want to learn more about what a recurrent neural network is and how the model is trained I'll reference a few things that I'll link in the description first you should definitely check out this paper by David ha and Douglass AK from Google brain where they present the sketch RNN pre train model you can read this blog post from 2017 that is on the magenta projects blog well time out I think maybe there's a fan oh you found one awesome donated by Rob okay I will give it a try oh thank you so much yeah Oh interesting okay all right yes thank you all right I mean I think what I'm gonna do is go point this at the camera but first I'm going to just test it by plug it into the wall here can we place it I don't have like long flowing hair and I don't have I don't know what the right music would be that's the highest setting No my flowing hair isn't working okay all right so I'm putting this on the floor right now um actually you know what I have a table well I'm gonna move the table right underneath the camera I am going to is this table go higher it doesn't see where the that's fine though I am going to put the fan on the table pointing it directly at the camera and plugging it in it's making a loud noise that's not great but I think as I step away you'll hear that left this table goes back I feel like I should get it even closer so weird it's tabled definitely with fire I'm not gonna worry about that alright there is a fan let me just put my face in front of the camera see if I'm getting the air yeah that's my year by the way hoping that's gonna help keep the camera cool what do we think what are the chances this is gonna work put it as low as possible to get the cold air and make it flow up towards the camera Nick is asking you're gonna say anything about the red food collab so first of all I wouldn't call it a cola IV red food made this whole thing all on his own without anything that I did other than existing and maybe providing some video tutorials but I did play the game a little earlier and I wish I had more time to play it more let me just check let me just check is this sound reasonable right now like is the sound of the fan too loud can hear the fan a bit but no problem I could turn on the noise reduction but I think I'm gonna leave the noise in there we can always post process it perfect okay great thank you everybody I kind of want to just start this whole thing over I know I know you're all gonna be upset by that but I feel like I've lost the momentum and it's going to help me to have that back so I'm going to start this coding challenge over set auto power off temp too high Oh is there actually a setting on the camera so Abraham is saying set so if someone can't really do that easily right now unfortunately it would involve me like taking the camera off it's mounted directly to the wall so to be able to see the menu I have to remove it so unless the problem becomes really terrible I might do that but if someone if if that's a legitimate thing I will look into that alright here we go everybody take five million hello and welcome to a coding challenge interactive drawing with sketch are an end now maybe you're watching this and thinking to yourself well what sketch are an N then you're in the right place because I will explain to you a bit about what sketch RNN is and provide you with links in the description to a lot of background material if you want to do a deeper dive into the machine learning model that is sketch RNN but what I'm going to build in this video that you're watching is a my own version of this exact project so this is a project on the magenta website magenta is a project from Google that is around a creativity and AI there's a lot of music examples with the magenta project and what you're seeing here is the AI so to speak I mean it's really a machine learning model making predictions I'm drawing a cat and I can hit clear here and I can begin drawing the cat like I could just stop there and it's going to try to fill in the rest of the cat for me let's see if I try to draw one like this with like a like a sort of body and like a tail we can sort of see what happens so this is the eye view sketch aren't in before because I can generate a drawing from nothing with sketch RNN but what I want to do in this video is create something where the person using the computer draws with the mouse but you could imagine all sorts of interface interaction ideas that you could do and then has the machine learning model takes over and finishes the drawing and you can see there are quite a few other models the sketch aren't in the sketch are an end model isn't one model it's actually a collection of many models based on these categories because the data that was used to train the machine learning model is from a project called quick draw so quick draw is a game that you can play also from Google where the website prompts you to draw something and then it tries to like guess to see if like you're drawing the correct thing and you people playing that game Google collected all those drawings so there's a lot of interesting questions around the data set itself but it is an open source data set as 50 million drawings I think there are 384 categories not 100% sure about that and so that's the data set that it was trained on the kind of machine learning model architecture is something called a recurrent neural net so maybe at some point I'll have some video tutorials that look more closely at what a recurrent neural network is if you want to learn more all definitely there's a wonderful article that I read now this video's description pause for a second Rohan and Lenny recurrent neural network yeah this is this is a wonderful article that I read that really taught me a lot about how recurrent neural networks work it's quite technical but also pretty friendly and uses some nice examples to describe how they're working but you can also read the original paper by David ha and Douglas Eck researchers at Google brain that describe the sketch our 10 model how it was trained and all of the details behind it including you know the real lower level machine learning math details luckily for us I also mentioned there's this nice blog post pause for a second I put on do not disturb I put on do not disturb when I livestream I put on do not disturb it's off for some reason on your on ok you can also read this excellent blog post on the magenta blog called draw together with a neural network which mentions other collaborators and gives you more details also about how sketch our nan works guess what though I'm going to start coding now because one of the projects that I work on which is an open source library for machine learning called ml5 Jas is built on top of tensorflow Jas which is Google's open source JavaScript version of tension flow of machine learning the open source library and ml5 also includes the sketch RNN model as part of it so if I go here to reference and I sort of scroll down here on to the left interesting left this is actually a mistake this shouldn't be here under text so I better just sort of like I can find the sketch RNN page and read a bit more about sketch RNN and get some starter code aim the fan at the camera wall interesting so far I'm feeling good about it I shouldn't I shouldn't say anything because it hasn't powered off yet but that's good it is eighty one point four degrees in here people sweat dripping down it's like a sauna saunas are good for you right the good for my back I have back issues but feeling pretty good did you know that I'm training for the marathon hopefully we're about that later I should mention a Ross of saying the ml five pages so buggy the website is actually going a big is having an overhaul right now so there's a lot of issues on the website so I'm gonna try not to lean on using it too much during this video but hopefully in the next few days and into next week it'll a lot of this stuff but please if you're finding things that aren't working or missing feel free to file those as issues okay let me just quickly also do this okay hmm let's see here just give me a second here to organize the screen I think 400 by 400 ePHI nand that means I can move it over to here which means I can move this over a little bit more I can also stand much further over so if I stand over here then I can move this back over this way all right I think this is going to be good how's the font size I think it's okay first thing that I need to do if I'm going to use the ml5 library is make sure to import it into my p5 sketch so on the getting starting page there's actually a p5 web editor template I could click on but I'm actually just gonna copy this reference and guess what new version of ml5 out today zero point 4.0 lots more to say about that in other videos to come but I'm gonna go back to my sketch in the web editor I'm going to click over to find index of HTML and I'm going to add it as one of the libraries right up here in index.html click save and go back to sketch a yes and I'm ready to code I'm going to add the preload function in order to load the sketch RNN model so I'll make a variable I'll call it sketch RNN I'll say sketch are 10 equals and I'll go back to the reference ml 5 sketch our net model and call back whoops and it everybody drink your cocoa and the model I want let's tow the model is hold on a second is this actually on the documentation page I don't think so so let me just give me a second here behind the scenes this need should be on the page but I'm gonna just grab this the model that I the model is a string that indicates what category what is the thing that I want to draw and I can actually find a list of all of them here you'll find that I'll link to this as well and you can see here's all the options so I'm going to start with a cat although I'm very tempted to do a cat bus cat pig and I'll come back to why those even exist in the first place you can think about that right now and how you might train a machine learning model why there might be a category that has two words combined Halloween the cat pigs are coming to get you a cat pig but I'm going to start with just cat and I don't need a call back because I'm loading the bottle in preload so I can assume that once I get to set up the model is loaded and let me run it no errors good sign model is loaded sketch our net initialized and why using sketch RNN is actually as easy as just calling a single function the generate function so I can say in Sketchup let's get up I could say in setup sketch RNN generate and then all I need to do is give it a callback so this is a moment to over here give it a callback and the callback I'm going to say got path stroke I'm not sure what to call this I'm gonna call it stroke path got stroke path and I'm gonna write this function function got stroke path that receives two arguments an error in case something went wrong and then an actual stroke path object or I shouldn't maybe call this results I don't know but I'm gonna call it stroke path and I'm just gonna say console dot log stroke path let's run this and see if anything comes out in the console things work it's like so rare in coding so this is now the foundation upon which everything else that I do in this example will be built so let me unpack this for you for a second a recurrent neural network is a kind of machine learning model that deals with sequential data that could be text like R comma a comma a comma n comma B I don't know why I'm putting the commas in there that could be text like a sequence of characters are a I and B Oh W it could be text like a sequence of words qu followed by qu it could be music maybe a sequence is a melody sub notes and rhythms a sequence each one of these units in a sequence you can think of as the state so in this case the state is very simple it's a single character here it's maybe with words it's a little more complex certainly musical notes the state might have which note is it what's the amount of time the duration of that note drawing a drawing can also be thought of as a sequence draw draw draw draw draw draw draw this is a sequence of vector paths or stroke paths as I'm calling them strokes their strokes of a pen and you'll notice back here in the code there's a DX a dy and a pen pen status so all of the states each element of the sequence involves a vector path a change in X a change in Y and whether the pen was down or up is the pen down as the pen up and there's actually a third state which is is the drawing completed which is end so if I all I need to do is figure out a way to say like okay you gave me this state now I'm gonna take that data and visualize it interestingly enough I'm gonna visualize it in a very literal form by drawing the path according to that vector in a canvas but maybe that state could be translated into music or words or some other kind of media how could you create an audio version of sketch RNN that would be something to think about there is a tricky thing going on here which is when do I choose to draw because if you've used p5 before you know that there's this function draw that you're asked to write which is always looping that's the animation loop and generally that's where you want to do your drawing but the stroke the data for the stroke has come back in this callback so I could get rid of the draw loop and do some my own timing stuff and draw in here but I think what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a variable just I need to tie my shoe again I keep stepping on my shoelaces so I just need to fix this I'm very glad that the fan seems to be working people are really worried about the audio I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna I just I just what I'm seeing is like the audio getting all the way up to the red I can turn it up a tiny bit I don't want to change it I'm already is not just gonna fix the audio stuff when this gets edited so I apologies to the the audio issues that people are having I'm gonna create a variable called current stroke and I'm going to whenever I get a new stroke I'm gonna say current stroke equals stroke path just gonna set I'm gonna get the Dana coming in and set it to a global variable then in draw I'm going to ask if current stroke exists I'm just gonna say if it's you have to say if current stroke if it exists I can just do that in JavaScript by just checking if the variable any variable that has stuff in it will return true if it's an object then I want to draw a line from some value X Y to X plus current stroke DX Y plus current stroke dy so in other words I need some new data here I need to have this idea of where is the current pen and this is up to me this is not part of the model the model is just telling me relative directions to go so I'm gonna create my own variable called x and y in set up let me initialize it to just the center of the canvas let me just fill in the background with a white background and then draw this line let's say a stroke zero a stroke wait for so it's a little bit thicker and let's run this now there it is my cat okay great Thank You CJ CJ is telling me be confident in your audio my drawing of course has stopped because I only asked the generate function just gives me what is essentially the next path the next vector so once I have that I need to ask for another one so there's a bunch of different ways I could implement this but for me the logic is such that setup is going to ask for the first one then I'm going to receive it in the callback draw it and then right here after I've drawn it let me ask for the next one so I could just do exactly this again but what I want to also do if I'm asking for the next one let me set current stroke to nothing again let me just sort of clear that variable so the draw draw might continue to loop but it won't continue to draw that same stroke over and over again until a new one comes in and fills in to that variable so I think now if I run this we're going to see the following okay what did I forget to do right so I drew the vector path but even move the pen to the next spot so I need to say X + equals current stroke DX and the same thing y + equals current stroke dy let's try that again there we go ok so I can't erase the background and draw because if I do that let me take off the console.log I need to I want to see the drawing continue I don't want to erase the background and there we go now this doesn't look exactly right right I mean that's kind of a cat solar always scribbling scraggly cat but and I'm realizing I did all this in my snowflake video but you know hey this I could have just picked off from there but c'est la vie c'est la blah blah blah that's life Wow Oh eightytwo point five degrees people in summertime here on the coding train it's my tropical drink in the Cabana the thing that's missing here is I haven't dealt with the pen I really should only be drawing the line I always want to move the X&Y but only if current stroke dot pen is down do I want to actually draw that line let's try this now oh I spelled that wrong let's try this now something's off what is it's so hot in here it's crazy well I'm almost to my break at least where I can like open the door get some cool air in here as we look at the brilliant challenges I need like an ice ice iced drink let's try it one more time so I'm almost certain I know what the problem is here which is that the it's for the next stroke yeah I know Oscar e is telling me the correct answer and I know this to be the case I'm just trying to think how to explain it I know what the problem is here and I'm having a bit of a sense of deja vu because I went through this in the snowflake video but if this sequence where every single state has a DX dy and a penn state the penn state is actually describing what you should be doing for the next stroke it's a little bit weird but it's off by one i suppose that's because the drawing always starts with the pen down that's not entirely true i think so though i don't know about that the drawing always starts with the pen down and also there's a penn state of end so when you get a dxdy you do that and then the next thing is n so this value that comes back in the pen is actually for the next the next state so what I need to think about this in a more clever way so I'm going to have a separate variable that keeps track of next pen and it's gonna start with down and then we're going to say is if next pen is down which it will be then draw the line and then next pen equals current stroke pen so I'll save it for the next time around and then always pick it up again and I'll obviously stop if next pen is end so I can say something like if next pen equals end I could say you know no loop and return this will just kill the p5 sketch it will stop but I do want to draw it first oh no but it would come next anyway so I would have drawn it previously let's try this kind of looks like a cat right so this is essentially a perfect reek so this is essentially a recreation of my snowflake sketch RNN sketch which I felt like I needed to do just to kind of refresh my memory a look at the new ml5 and make sure it's working in the web editor the way that I want because now is the moment the important part of this video where I want to pick up a user drawing a person's drawing who's using this sketch and feed that in well people are just chatting just chatting amongst themselves in the chat but before I do that part I'm going to take a short break to talk to you briefly about the coding trains sponsor and that is brilliant org so I'm not this is like perfect timing because I also need to take a little break to get some cool air into this room we're now up to 83 degrees I have a feeling there's some excellent courses and challenges on the brilliant website around a statistics and temperature and climate you're probably simon probably knows where they are and can find them for me but if you aren't familiar well let me just click around here for a second so a brilliant is and I've got my fancy new set up here brilliant is a website which has a handson approach so there's actually 60 interactive courses on the website most of what I do is on the channel it's like look at the daily challenge and that's one of the ways that I enjoy using brilliant it's like I have five minutes on the on the subway I'm at home I'm with my kids let's look at a fun problem but it also has full courses in particular there's a new computer science fundamental courses and so you can see here some of the courses there's actually one an artificial neural networks that I'm really hoping to dig into soon so if you're looking for supplemental material and and I mostly mind this for ideas for my coding challenges but there's storytelling there's code writing there's interact challenges and lots of problems to solve so you can sign up for free at brilliant org slash coding train you can also unlock all of the features in all the courses through a premium subscription and the first 200 people to subscribe via that link will get a 20% discount so what I want to do now quickly is just move over to brilliant org and look at what the daily challenge is now normally and I guess I need to continue this course that I'm doing which is data structures that would be good I need to do more videos on data structures so learn more about the instructors but I would've actually just skipped to a yesterday's challenge really quickly because this is what I love like this is actually a coding challenge themed around what's in a variable and one of the things I love to looked at this yesterday Thank You Simon for pointing this out to me is that this if you weren't this to us right x equals x plus 1 is the most normal coherent thing to say and I actually just used it in my project x equals x plus DX but this is actually an absurd statement if you weren't a programmer because X does not equal X plus 1 that's impossible it's wrong it's false but there's a nice challenge around this let's look at it so if X is a number Y is a number if you write code like the following I'm gonna do this over here if I were to write x equals x plus y so x equals something y equals something and Y then also equals x plus y and remember these are two lines of code executing one after another the value stored in X is greater than the value stored in Y which one of these is the correct answer so how after this basically X is greater than why would return true this camera does not have a fan on it I thought maybe I was giving this camera a nice little break by moving to this one I didn't actually turn it off so this one doesn't have the fan I'm not so concerned about that because first of all doesn't seem to lose its focus or maybe it does and it just I'm getting lucky with the focus but it looks still like it's in focus and I'm using it much less so um so how could this possibly be true let's just try some numbers X is 5 y is 2 so x equals 5 plus 2 I'm going to have 7 and then y equals 7 plus 2 I'm gonna have 9 so X that's not true so clearly there's got to be something to do with a negative number here so we could probably say if X is negative or if Y is negative my instinct is y is negative I'm probably getting that backwards oh my god let's try what if Y is negative 2 so x equals x plus y yeah because if y is negative x goes down then Y goes further this is kind of like we're incrementing so this totally makes sense I was right it was right ding ding 5 minus 2 is 3 and then 3 minus 2 is 1 so yeah I think just as long as Y is negative that's gonna be a great game so I like this because I like oh but this is such a grief you were if you're not a programmer most of you watching this have done some coding before if you haven't welcome I hope that this is enjoyable and you're following along to the best that you can I guess I would suggest going back and looking at some of my beginner tutorials or other beginner tutorials you could find but but I like this because this is really tricky to think through if you haven't coded before it even a little bit hard for me right now just cuz this looks so circular in a weird sort of way let's go back and let's try to what do we the input value of Y was negative so let's click that let's click Submit correct I started a oneday street I kind of want to do today's challenge do I have time let's see if we can do it quickly because it looks super interesting Lee has a visual pattern rearrange the dots so in the pattern below we add a new row to the bottom of the triangle to each step the next term will then be 10 plus 5 so we have 1 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 we're adding 3 adding 4 oh you're adding 4 here to get to 10 right I see we could extend this pattern as far as we want making larger and larger triangles but is it possible to skip straight to the number of dots in the hundreds triangle so what's the formula I guess okay I guess they're showing us the solute I was gonna have to figure it out the solution here first second third if we rearrange and double the truck oh look at this so the idea here is that you have a 1 by 2 a 2 by 3 a 3 by 4 so you always have a n if I draw up here you always have an N by n plus 1 photo you can't see that ok everybody I'll use you always have you know some sort of grid that is for example 3x4 half of it is this so you have n times n plus one is the total number of dots and just divide that by two is the half number of that so that's the formula so for a hundred you'd have a hundred times 100 plus 100 1/2 okay you could do that math in your head over the calculator n times n1 here it is I don't have to do that math it's right here 5050 can you find the pattern and the dots below well this is the same thing right it's just end times n plus 1 divided by 2 plus 1 plus n oh no no no this is a different pattern right oh because the triangle here is arranged on its side and the triangle here is arrangement so I think by the way weekend this is an extra dot dot dot dot so there's definitely a blow it gives me choices well it's got to be this one right because it's got to be I have a plus n that's what I'm thinking it's got to have a plus n like I could figure out what's the formula 1 goes to 3 2 goes to 6 3 goes to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4 times 5 is 20 divided by 2 is 10 it's got to be this one so I'm just by eyeballing it it's this one but why is that n plus 1 times n plus 2 is what well let's click on it let's click on it let's just see if I'm right just through that sheer instinct oh no there's a plus end down here ah I'm not on percent confident now cuz I didn't scroll all the way down there's another plus n so well first of all you could do these kind of tests my way test taking skill you could do process of elimination because for example 3 plus 1 is 16 I mean that's not the right answer is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 that's wrong 3 times 4 is 12 divided by 2 is 6 plus 3 is 9 that's not right so it's definitely this one so like process elimination I can just do it but there's there's probably a way to draw this in the interest of time there we go all right absolutely correctly I don't have to chat up there you get work figure I'd already mentioned this I should get the chat off backup sorry about this I'm I shouldn't rush through this I like to let people in the chat I'll usually I'll take the break and let people answer it but I've lost all of my control panels I forgot about my whole technique here n times n plus 1/2 so cast is writing this but if I go down here oh if you think doubling it n plus 1 times n plus 2 is the total number of things in a parallelogram because these are parallelograms right parallelogram as shown let me is that right ok the camera went off again well good news is the fan seems to be working because this camera doesn't have a fan pointed at it and that one does and it's the only one that's this one is the one that's powering off so what time is it oh okay that's okay I'm gonna take a few minute break in a second so it's alright 1 2 3 oh this makes sense right because well I don't think I drew that correctly oh and I totally did not draw that correctly yeah hold on I did I just drew it in a slightly weird way like the way that it's drawn is to is making these so that's like this I have three and then I have three and this is N equals one if okay yeah if you consider this N equals two then you would be right and but this is n this is for N equals one so if N equals one you have you have three times two which is n plus 1 times n plus 2 and that would be the case for if I add three more and then double that so yes I'm doing this sort of intuitively there's probably a more elegant way that you could describe this and certainly what I one of the things is my favorite thing to do is reading other people's solutions and how they explain it oh look at this that's cool even with some like nice mathematical notation I like how this is drawn oh look at this and then like with some this is great so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take a break if you don't already have a brilliant org account you can sign up right now if anybody has the inclination to make a p5 sketch that visualizes this with like maybe n is a slider and then shows the total number that would be something you could do that's something that I enjoy doing and then you I like to post my code solution here in the comments on brilliant so I'm gonna take a short break leave this up here I am going to actually turn the camera off just to let it cool down a little bit I'm going to prop open the door I'm going to take a break just for maybe two or three minutes I got to come back quickly and say that cachi and Cass are discussing equals one I'm gonna say once again coordinates and autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinates and we're back the lights are off the door is open the links are down low it's quiet we're going to go back to doing sketch RNN thank you to brilliant for the sponsorship I'm going to I've got the temperature down to 82 degrees follow me 82 it was at 83.5 we're now at 82 I'm gonna turn the lights back on it's gonna warm up in here oh the Sun is coming up it is getting bright good morning everybody welcome to the coding training we're back from our break we're gonna finish making this interactive sketch RNN project I have about a half an hour to do this before I've really got to go which I think it's quite realistic so hopefully nothing will go terribly wrong and no time for chitchat no time for chitchat now I have this cat and this the correct generated drawing a duplicate of what I did in the snowflake a sketch RNN challenge but here I am ready to add the next component which is a person coming here drawing their own starter path and then having sketch aren't intake over how would I do that so one of the things that I have to revisit is this state right once again I need to all this state any given state light Sonia you need to revisit the state so any given moment of the drawing is a dxdy and a Penn State so I need to collect a sequence of those from the person who is drawing one way I can do that is I want to the drawing I'm not going to be too sophisticated about this I'm gonna have the user start the drawing when they click the mouse and stop when they release the mouse so I basically want to events that are tied to the canvas so I'm going to store the canvas in a variable and I'm gonna say canvas mousepressed start drawing and canvas mouse mouse released I'm honestly finished drawing but it's not finished a sketch RNN I can say sketch are an end start so I no longer want to call generate right here in setup I'm not going to start generating I'm going to first collect the data from the user and function start drawing presumably right here is where I'm gonna start generating the drawing right sketch are an end start so I need a what I'm gonna call this is the seed path it's what I'm putting into the machine learning model for it to begin to it's the seed path it's what I'm seeding the machine learning bottle with so seed path is an array and I'm gonna say I'm gonna have a very variable called person drawing which is false and as soon as I soon as start drawing happen person drawing will go to true because in draw I'm gonna say if person drawing I want to collect those states so what are the states the stroke path is an object which has a DX a DUI and a Penn State well the pen is always going to be down again I could do something more sophisticated or I could have an interaction that the you the person the user could actually draw stop pick up do different things and then have sketch RNN know how to take over but by definition the way I'm building this is when the mouse is released sketch or an in takes over so the pen is always down and DX is I can use builtin variables at p5 it stores the current mounts position minus the previous mouse position so this is actually really easy to do in p5 because I have these values already so the difference between the current mouse and the previous mouse dxdy and the pen is down then I can say seed path dot push stroke path and then when the mouse is released sketch iron and start person drawing is false let's give this a try ok big problem I don't see what I'm drawing that would be nice but it drew a cat as soon as I release the mouse so I need to add something in draw which does the following hmm I guess I just want to draw I don't want to do exactly what I did here so let's universally let's set stroke zero stroke wait for and let's just take this line function put it here and I want to draw X Y X plus drogue path and then I want to say the same thing I want to do this so again there might be a way to consolidate this code and but there it is so this now at least I should see what I'm drawing whoa okay that's weird oh boy try this again what just happened there oh oh it's drawing everything relative to the mouse relative to the center that's not good aha so the first point that I'm drawing is actually okay so x and y don't get initialized in the center of course of course of course x and y get initialized when I start drawing wherever the mouse is all right that should fix this problem here's my cat now continue drawing like cat weird wait I drew the circle I drew the cat's face already try this again so it's picking up where I left off but it seems to be starting the drawing over why because I never told the model to sketch our name model about my seed strokes in the first place right I still just call sketch RNN dot generate that first time but guess what the generate function can take as a additional optional argument an array of states that are fed into the model and I have those already in seed path is that what I called it so now drum roll please I believe this is the last detail plenty more I want to say and a couple more things I want to do but this is the last sort of detail it didn't really come out like a nice cats try this one more time that was good but there's a bad got lucky so it sort of worked it sort of didn't work there is an issue there is something really important that I need to implement and actually it's my intention for this to actually become a feature of ml5 and it's going to handle it for you automatically but that hasn't been implemented yet in ml5 so in this video I'm gonna try it out and then maybe in a future video log do a video about adding this is a feature to ml5 and it has to do with the rdp line simplification algorithm which guess what if you look at the previous coding challenge what a coincidence it is the rdp line duplication algorithm so why does this matter let's go back to the example let's go back to this example here and I'm gonna do something pay close attention I'm gonna hit clear I'm gonna zoom way in close and I'm gonna draw very very slowly a lot of squiggly lines like this really really slowly now watch what happens when I lift up the mouse ready one two three do you see how the drawing changed the sum it's very subtle but some of the points that I was drawing were removed the the fidelity of the line was lowered even though it's capturing I'm capturing the mouse positions in my sketch at presumably 60 frames per second I'm capturing a lot of points so I'm giving the machine learning model the sketch RNN model all of these states were the DX and dy values are really really tiny but it wasn't actually trained with data with the data the drawings are stored in the quickdraw data set aren't necessarily I'm what am I trying to say the model wasn't actually trained with drawings that have a super high fidelity to them with lots and lots of points close together I'm actually could not sure whether if that's in the quickdraw dataset or whether that was like a processing of the data but one of the researchers at Google wrote a github issue on the ml5 repository explaining actually no that wasn't a github issue I filed the issue based on an email I was in touch with David ha who explained that so I want to say yeah I was in touch with David hah who explained that the RDP algorithm was used to simplify the drawings when the model was trained and so when you're feeding stuff into it you want to have those drawings retain that quality so let's move back over here let's find my code and give me a second here everybody I think it might actually be not in did I put it in coding train let's see because I didn't create the web page for it yeah so I'm behind on a lot of things interactive drawing no there isn't I think I for whatever silly reason I put it here under a different P 5 web editor account hope there's an extra character here oh I don't have a slack channel open and I see all these notifications help camera help guide for setting auto temperature off Thank You CJ where is it I made I'm gonna have to go to my class did I just call it no let me go to github.com give me a second here by the way if you're wondering what I'm looking at I'm finding the repo for the course that I'm teaching at NYU I encourage you to check out all the materials if you're interested but I'm looking for here I'm looking for the p5 RDP example oh it was encoding train and it's called coordinated bagel that's why I didn't see it coding challenge I forget what number was 151 or to just say RDP okay here is the code for the last coding challenge was the rdp line simplification algorithm and I'm just simplifying a sort of mathematical curve just to recreate the animation that's on the Wikipedia page for the rdp algorithm but I should be able to take these functions I realized there's going to be something tricky about this Oh more complicated than I think because this is but I can I can do this I can do this I'm going to create another file called RT PJs I'm going to reference it here in index.html and I'm just want to see right okay I'm gonna grab my implementation of the RDP algorithm which includes all four of these functions you can watch the other video to see me write those functions I'm gonna paste them all here and what I wanna call is just RDP so I give the RDP function an array of all a whole bunch of points then I also give it an empty array that it's going to fill with the RDP reduced points and it requires a global variable hmm the way I created the example was with a global variable called epsilon so I'm just gonna sort of hard code in a value for that at ten right here and then now right before I generate the seed path I need to I need to perform RDP line simplification so interestingly enough the RDP algorithm doesn't know anything about sketch or Hanan and dxdy and Penn State so actually what I want to do is I want to have another another array called seed points and those are what I actually want to collect well I mean I mean it's kind of over complicated it's okay I've got to figure this out I want to collect it's so hot in here yeah I'm almost 84 degrees it's a sauna it's like very hard to think when it's this hot I'm going to comment this out this is going to become important again but I'm going to say seed points push create vector Mouse X Mouse why and then I want to draw I'm just curious here they think I'm really thinking this through here and then the line that I want to draw is actually just mouse X Mouse Y P Mouse X P Mouse Y so let's try this this so the drawing still works weirdly what happens with the first ones thing weird is happening with the first one no it's normal okay that's just if I if I do this and then no okay sorry so the drawing works still that was interesting and then I get the cat there's no seed points so this is weird extra cat happened all right I got it now now I'm going to create an empty array of RDP points I'm gonna call the RDP function with start index and index all points are DP points again I might want to rethink how that function was created but it is oh you know what I can do now what I want to do is perform the RDP line simplification so I can actually go back to my previous example once again and I can sorry everybody this is what I'm looking for what I want to do is perform the RDP line simplification now so I can go back to my previous example once again and basically find exactly this code so I'm going to grab this code and I'm going to put it here and what this is doing is it's creating a new empty array and it's calling the rdp function on the all points array which is now called seed points and filling it with the simplified version of the line and then what I need to do after that is now I have this RDP point which is the simplified version of the line I want to say for let a equal zero I is less than RDP points I'm going to actually start at one RDP points dot length I plus plus and I need to create the state now so remember where was I doing that before right here this is exactly what I want to do I want to create the stroke path which is RDP points index I I dot X the previous one I one do the same thing for y and then the pen is down then I can I could redraw I'm not gonna redraw anything just for a second and then I want to put that into the stroke path and then call generate alright that was a little I'm manic here which I guess all my coding challenges are pretty manic but what just happened again the idea ultimately is for ml5 to handle this I think that's what I would like to do I would like to create a helper function ml5 that sketch Arnon takes your seed path in and like performs the line simplification for you but this is my coding challenge to implement it manually to see if it helps so what i'm doing here is i have the set of points that i've collected in seed points I call the RDP algorithm which simplifies that path previous coding challenge goes through that in more detail then I have to generate the States based off the simplified path and then that's what I put into the sketch RNN model not feeling superconfident here but let's give this a try it looks the same but I think if if I'm correct if I did this many many times I would have better results coordinated bagel there's something else really important here 1140 ok I think however it's very important that I create that same visual effect where I redraw the simplified line and that's actually a pretty easy thing for me to do right here because what I can do is in sketch are an end start after I do the line simplification I can redraw the background and then I could say begin shape like I should have been in shape and I'm going to say for let V of seed path I'm just getting all the vectors out of the seed path of vertex V X V dot Y and I'm gonna say no fill I should have I've already been drawing so but just to be consistent let me take this here is that let me take this here and put that here so now I draw and drawing and drawing erasing it and then drawing the simplified line let's see how that goes mmm I didn't see it what did I do wrong here oh no not the seed path seed points and I should be doing this before technically speaking it doesn't really matter but this is what I want to do here so this is performing the line simplification drawing an line isn't really right but simplify path path simplification and then now converting converting to sketch are and end States all right let's try this one more time did you do that simplify who it's hard to see let's try like a a much higher epsilon like 100 yeah oh yeah it did it's just not super obvious but a hundred is crazy just to prove the point let me prove the point hey let me do this hmm I'm not sure that this is actually like doing what I think it's gonna do let me do some debugging here whoops Oh No RDP points people RDP points RDP points simplified line is in RDP points not even the seed points the sea points was everything I collected the simplified one is called RDP points my I should use better naming now I think let me go back and change the epsilon back to ten something more reasonable and we're gonna try this one more time I draw it slowly so that there's a lot of extra points I'm gonna make a like weird curve here here we go one two three there we go so that looked like it really simplified it like way too much so I this would be an interesting thing to tune because I want this to be in this will be like sort of the hardcoded value probably an ml five although maybe it's a parameter that you the the user of ml five could adjust but this is what I would want to sort of play with to figure out what makes the most sense but now I can really see the line simplification happening you know what it should actually be I have no idea whoops it's back to five so before I go so as always with any of these coding challenges I'm doing just a really sort of basic version I think that I have mostly successfully recreated exactly this but one of the things you'll notice is that there's a lot more thoughtfulness to the interface and the design first of all it's drawing over and over again what what sketch RNN is drawing is a different color there's a nice interface for picking which model you want to load you can kind of like randomize stuff and clear it and there's a page of information all about how this works so maybe you want to create your own version and think about what is that interaction design how are you visualizing what the person is drawing versus what the model is drawing and how are you picking which model to draw maybe you can make this into a game an art project something that is just tells a story that draws based on you know words that needle texttospeech or speech to text or something that there's so many ideas that I think you had explore so I hope you make one of those ideas and share it with me by going to the coding trade calm and follow the instructions about how to share your community contribution but I will before I go just kind of give you a nice compilation I think one of the things that I want to return to is all the different pretrained models that are available now you I could also train your own model it should be a really interesting thing to try very high degree of difficulty there but possible but the reason why I'm assuming there are models in here that are in addition to frog there's frog sofa is because the Frog model was trained with only drawings of frogs the Frog the sofa models train was wrongs of sofa the Frog sofa model was wrongs of both without a distinction between the two so the AI the machine learning model is just learning about paths that happen when you're drawing frogs and sofas and so we could try crab rabbit face Pig but I'm just gonna enjoy myself and try the everything model and I'll see you in the next coding challenge oh it doesn't go over and over again how do i oh wait a second I wanted to do it again and again so let's at least add that here as well so if this state is end hold on everybody instead of saying no loop what I want to do is actually call sketch RN n dot reset which will reset the model and then call sketch Arnon start again is that what the function was called and so if I reset the model call start again it's going to draw a new version No maybe maybe not hey why did that break so let's say the model is reset it performs RDP again draw to draw it again like this is fine the C points haven't changed and then it should create oh the seed path here's the mistake when I'm resetting everything I don't need to do all this again but I might as well so I could refactor this but at a minimum what I need to do is actually I don't need to do any of this coz seed path is a global variable so but I'm just gonna do this I'm I'm just gonna reset C path so yes I need to refactor this but I don't want to add all the seed points in the seed path again so let's try this what will the model draw enjoy no it's not working still what did I miss look at the chat next pen next pen oh this so this return is a problem current stroke also should be set to null I think oh and next pen should be set to down so I think I need next pen to not be end anymore and a current stroke to know this is really gonna work please work what did I forget to reset so many things I guess like a deep I should do some more person drawing is false current stroke is null all right let's do some reset the seed path RDP points is reset mmm i'll Stinney to reset doing things in weird places which concerns me all right I'm gonna need to let's put this console.log back in oh wait let's also put that in Oh Oh x & y x & y x and y i didn't think about x and y and it's definitely a thing so when you start the drawing X is that Mouse X Mouse y know but that's fine yay and then oh wait a second ooh this is some this is the problem that's weird I actually never move I think this was wrong all in the first place because this needs to be in there I need to move X Y and then I need to also reset X Y or actually would make sense is for X equal our DP points the last one right X&Y needs to just be wherever this leaves off the last one I think this is the last thing I forgot to reset which I didn't even set for the first time XY needs to like pick off where we left off I think all right here we go I'm just gonna draw a line the monsters are coming to get you the sketch RNN monsters okay thanks everybody goodbye enjoy these drawings you know what no no I can't live with this I'm gonna leave you with rainbows and I'm gonna take out the console.log all right everybody rainbows and rainbows is rainbow not one of the models it's one of the sky quick great it quick draw no it's not one of the models were like unicorn no there's no unicorn model I guess we have to just go with cats let's do cat pigs or elephant pigs cat pigs let's do cat pigs cat pigs are fun I will leave you with wrong sketch I will leave you with cat pigs let's get this I know which one is the one I want Oh I know what I'm doing anymore and now I will leave you with the cat pigs refresh this again and I will say goodbye to you by letting you watch a compilation of sketch RNN drawn cat pigs mmm this is way too much fun oh there's a cat Pig all right so this livestream is now over officially as of 20 minutes ago I did somehow make it through all of this the fan is definitely the solution I'm taking a picture of the thermostat so I can send it to the building let me see what makes them how do i how do I do this let's take a picture it's eighty four point six degrees in this room right now okay thank you everybody I wish that I had more time to look at some community contributions to play noisy food check out noisy food aya ho maybe I can answer a couple questions from the chat Simon is suggesting Catbus Simon's also remind me that last coding challenges out yet it is prepared so I will be releasing that as an unlisted member only video I mean it's all in the live stream but the edited version of it later today and then as soon as the closed captioning is completed then it will go public on YouTube the second coding in the Cabana video with the Collatz conjecture should come out sometime within the next few weeks a lot and I'll be back actually up something semi special plan for next Friday I do need to take a week off not a week off from making content but a week off from public life streaming because I have a video that I'm planning which is relates to training your own machine learning model that's a collaboration with project that's not a Tony in beta so I'm gonna record that at some point so if you're wondering if your I will do that as a member only live stream the recording session of that so but I do want to do a live stream I definitely only do a live stream next Friday it's probably gonna be might be and probably gonna be in the afternoon timeslot I think I'm gonna be doing it later in the day next Friday so if you're looking for when next Friday is gonna be it's probably gonna be that I don't know what just happened let's try to beat my noisy foo high score one more time oh you don't have a sound it's very important that you have the sound buhbuhbuhbuhbuh really terrible at this then I did a I can't even get one did it when will you post a processing challenge the RDP challenge is actually what's done in processing so that will be posted soon and actually the coal lots conjecture Cabana video I did with processing as well and Redfoo is there in the chat all right since redfish here in the chat we're gonna even though I have a meeting that starts in two minutes the good news is the meeting is within two minutes walk from where I am four point six degrees in here III have a you know here we go ready here we go I'm gonna get to three my goal is to get to three back is broken that is really my back is broken or I'd like to see say yeah ba ba baba baba bagawk that's French for it's just that there's gotta be some way of like regulating I've got to go somebody Supply thing outside don't don't don't encourage me all right hear me in the hallway so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with Perley noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six well this is like Berlin noise performance apart like royalty noise performance apart with curly noise I might pick numbers like this pearly noise that it's early noise so this is hurling noise that is Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no so this is hurtling noise that is hurtling to her Perlin noise that it's Hurley more this is hurtling noise that it's Hurley know this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley so this is Hurley noise that is hurlyburly mrs. Hurley know that that is her early permanent improvement over that is earlier to Kerley knows that is earlier than is but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this three four three four five six five this is like Perlin noise performance part
