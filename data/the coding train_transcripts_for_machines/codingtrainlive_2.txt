do do do check check one two is this thing on uh just doing my sound check i see a few of you in the chat asking what are the topics for today um i am going to look at extending a selfavoiding walk into 3d i am going to look at the bezier function in p5.js and i will be demoing a new discord bot that is in the coding train discord and um what else what else i think that's about it i'll also be streaming tomorrow the pinned comment hopefully has this list okay let me know if my audio is working all right b we are beginning in three and a half minutes do do do do do so do so do good morning hello happy i was about to say happy friday but it's not friday it's thursday and i'm here live on the coding train broadcasting to you and i see that my mic is on and i see that my picture is visible to me so hopefully all that's working you oh gloria did i just wake you up with my loud voice uh i wish i need a dog cam i really need a puppy cam where are you going gloria oh you're going downstairs stay with me stay up here have a little rest oh okay i gotta pay attention to you welcome if this is your first time tuning into a live stream oh boy um welcome i already said welcome this is kind of what happens i'll get lost and lose track of what i'm talking about and where i am and what's going on but i hopefully get to some coding stuff that will interest you um if if this is your first time at all ever tuning into anything the coding drain then well by golly really welcome but um and what this is is this is a weekly semiweekly missing a lot of weeks here and there probably i had to guess i think i probably make 30 to 35 weeks out of the year a live stream where i cover a random smattering of topics in coding particularly around graphics and i'm using javascript and i often use various tools from the processing foundation like p5.js and processing to make creative and fun playful projects for you the people of the internet to hopefully learn something from be inspired by and go off and make your own version of it but this live stream is the unstructured sort of companion to what is otherwise on the channel a lot of sort of sequence tutorials for certain kinds of tasks and projects et cetera this is very unplanned unscripted um and kind of a mess but i'm back because it's been a really rough year i know it's been a rough year for all of you watching for everyone around the world um it's been a tricky year for me i let me just take a moment here to say congratulations to all of the teachers um education workers the students whether you're in you know second grade seventh grade in high school in college in graduate school wow i mean in all industries and types of walks of life it's been a tough year but i know this is the moment where a lot of people are graduating and i just want to say well done people it's been really hard and strange and i have done uh i would say a medium to poor job over the last year and um i i'm looking forward to having a little bit of a break finally this summer um which it's it's been quite a while um and hopefully you're gonna get one as well two fix the wrinkled green screen says cat king where is it is it like just this little tiny thing is bothering you it is kind of bothering me as well okay there we go i don't know if that was in royce is in ninth grade um i hope your end of year wraps up well um and that you uh hopefully you're what aren't you in school right now i don't know what but maybe you're in a time zone where you're not in school right now if you're watching this in school i don't know i don't know what to say to that all right i have fixed that let's see all right what do i have uh let me thank um today's sponsor uh oh i have to go oh i have to go over here and reveal some stuff um uh that's me this is my sponsor of today brilliant um if you think that learning from watching youtube or from having a geometry mug is uh for you then guess what's really for you uh brilliant you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um it's a wonderful educational website with all sorts of interactive lessons in uh the sciences and math and computer science and programming and geometry and all the stuff that i love i think you might like it too uh so check that out i'll come back and look at the website a little more uh during in halfway through today's uh stream so um what do i have uh for you today so i'm try i aspire to have a plan and a schedule and set topics and segments and it's been i don't know how long i got to figure out like how long i've really been doing this because i can tell you that i've been making video tutorials since probably for 10 at least 10 years when did i first start uploading those videos to youtube i think around 2015. i think that's right when did i do my first live stream well that's findable it's there it's still on the channel uh when did i start calling myself coding redacted when did i start calling the channel coding train all of those things are um points in the history of this project that i would like to kind of like accumulate and track maybe you know by the way there's no wikipedia page for the cody gray i don't know if they're merits being one or there should be one but um anybody's got some spare cycles and wants to create one to sort of track some of this uh history i'm happy to help i'm not gonna uh help edit the page but happily help provide any of the information and references for that but i'm just thinking about are there any anniversaries coming up but the reason why i brought this up is like i've been doing this for quite a while and still it's just a mess and um i'm i have some changes upcoming i'm i'm hoping to redo where i live broadcast from um and have a bit more of a a larger space to work with with some different with some i want to get some kind of toys in that space um working with uh like a vinyl cutter and some other physical stuff that i want to try to make stuff live with some like led like things so that's coming um but right now i'm still i'm where i am mentally physically emotionally is just trying to get the academic year wrapped up and get organized for the summer and i'm still playing catchup so the topics that i have today are pretty much um i'm just sort of looking at the chat here so first i want to share some community contributions um i will be doing that this is the community contributions that's my community contributions theme song uh i want to do that i am very close to releasing a coding challenge video about a selfavoiding walk and one of the suggested exercises i suggest in the video is to extend it into 3d so i would like to show a version of that and i haven't had time to make it so i'll just try making that on today's live stream that's a plan uh and then oh by golly i have failed i mean i failed like get get out get out your notepad if you want to list all my failures in life you better have a lot of pages in that notepad but i and i haven't failed yet i'm um but i have failed to complete something that i have promised to make um and i uh i want to make sure that i do that in june and what it is is creating video tutorials that were requested by donors to the processing foundation annual fundraiser so i don't know if this is easily uh findable but let me go oh you don't see what i'm looking at this is the processing foundation website um if i click over onto donate um i wonder if i can find many i assume some of you watching here are in this wonderful list of names of people thank you for supporting the processing foundation i would like to look for the annual fundraiser it's very hard to google things with the word processing in it because basically all of my results are processing transactions for donorbox ah somebody will find this link for me and and and and tell me ah support p5 there we go oh that's 2019 donor box page uh what if i change this to 2020 very hard life is hard people life is full of 404 errors let me just tell you that all of my many years on this planet none outside of this planet as of yet i've been full of so many 404 errors boy i'm not prepared um but uh one of the rewards for donating to the processing foundation was to uh request a video topic from the coding train um and so um two topics that were requested from the donors one was bezier curve and one was the copy function so i want to spend a little time exploring both of those functions to prepare for what i might put in the actual and i'm thinking this is gonna be like a 10 minute video so you the viewer if you choose to stay with me here today the opportunity to help provide some suggestions or things that i might demonstrate um in the eventual tutorial so uh um um that i'm gonna make so that's that's really on my agenda am i forgetting anything i'm looking here just checking the discord oh my god i forgot the most important thing oh my goodness not the most important thing but a uh because truly they're all everything's they're all important or not important equally and unimportant actually if i really think about it but i would like to demonstrate a new discord bot that is in the coding train discord channel if you're not already in there um let me press a button which will hopefully post it into the chat um the discord channel where we have a lot of plans for the discord channel this summer to hope to do more kind of community engagement very excited about that but there is a new bot that is related to my book of random numbers which if i can find my sound effects i found that was very loud that was me who was loud i found it i had it lost for a while it was in the cabana because i had been using it for um the mouse conference video and i had left it there so it's a little uh weathered a little more weather than it usually is and we haven't done this in a while oh oh wait it's time let's look at the bot because the bot we're starting over today i'm starting i am sisyphus with the random numbers [Laughter] um so i i am sisyphus with the random numbers i am destined to just start this over but today it's this is a momentous occasion because i'm going to start over reading all oh and some lights are blinking i think someone gave a little chat message oh it was simone charlo thank you simone um i am going to start over my project which is to read this entire book i have learned so much about this book i have learned what is quite possibly the the incredibly obvious which is that when this book says a million random digits it has a million random single digits in them i have always read them in groups of five and was oft made the mistake of referring to it as one million five digit numbers which is not all the case there's two hundred thousand five digit numbers but um let's go let's get to the bot because um and then i will um uh read some random numbers uh yeah and so remember how it was saying hello to anybody who's a new viewer it takes me quite a while to get to any coding you know usually i have about 10 minutes left in my 2 hour live stream by the time i'm actually coding something so let me pull let me just do a couple things here let me switch back to here i'm going to pull up discord and oh my goodness and do this quick little fancy trick i have then i need to turn on a streamer mode privacy and safety it must be there right where is the streamer mode it doesn't automatically go on streamer mode is enabled okay so now i'm able to hopefully safe safely nicole nicole bella says omg i'm so glad you have corrected how you'll read the numbers right i mean like it's got i've got i mean i mean right thank you for validating this i feel seen right now so seen okay um all right let's see here i'm going over to here okay so this is the coding train discord lots of channels um i get um i still manage to get a lot of individual emails asking for coding help and i mean in my heart of hearts i would like to respond to every one of those but i just don't have the capacity to um and so this is where i point people to all these channels there's a volunteer team of moderators and lots of friendly faces in the discord so please come and join you can get help with all these different areas but what i am here and then for you there's also there's my favorite channel in the discord which is the pets channel uh oh ah you know what it's maybe the pets is a strong second to introductions i just i read all the introductions by the way it's my favorite channel i just love getting to know everybody who's joining and how they found the videos and that sort of thing so please introduce yourself in there i aspire to maybe i don't know if i aspire this maybe someday it'll be too many people introducing themselves and i won't be able to read them all but i really love that anyway what i am looking for is i yes this is the channel that you're going to want to try the stuff that i'm about to demonstrate to you uh bot testing but i am always very cautious on the internet in terms of what i'm showing on my live stream uh only because i've learned my lesson the hard way and i still get it wrong you know as all of you who have your notebooks full of my private api keys but um here here's my bot demo uh channel so in this bot demo channel which i'm going to there is a new discord bot thank you to saint plays uh who's the manager of the discord david i'm sure who's contributed to this and many other people i'm going to do question mark this new bot let's see here question mark is the way i know there's slash commands now on discord maybe someday we will get to that but the oh i hate how see i need this is my dream in the next live streaming studio is to have a full body camera because i have to the camera is quite close to me so i have to shrink myself and then i'm cut off here which really drives me curiously because i really want to point all the way to that help thing someday someday i'm i'm hoping i'm in an attic and i'm hoping to move to a garage long story for another time if it happens i'll let you know uh question mark i might not be taking a few weeks off if this is happening though because i'll be moving uh question mark uh help um so if i press that um that's how you trigger the choo choo bot so the choo choo bot um actually the choo choo bot which um oh oh i see yes yes yes the choo choo bot is essentially the bot uh now i remember what's happening the choo choo bot i am looking at the chat but just very you can't rely on that to answer sid hart that's question the choo choo bot is the coding train discord bot that is covered in my if i think i go under more under learning discord bot this is my series about how to code your own discord bot it's a series of six videos in theory i would like to there's many more things that i didn't get to that i would like to get to um but if you want to learn how to code your own bot check out these videos but i you know some of the features that are demonstrated are if i just type in i know this is like so tiny i should i just do this i'm i'm going to give up and do this uh choo choo if i do um let me do this uh choo choo oh no question mark choo choo i will get a random reply let's try it one more time i love how people emoji right ding right okay i'll get a random reply another feature is a gif if i just type gif uh it uses the tenor api to pull a random gif with the coding train search but if i say gif uh kitten [Laughter] by the way i'm supposed to have unlocked on my channel a beta feature and youtube or alpha feature called clips i know this has probably been something that's been on twitch for like the last 300 years where you can clip out and share separately as different moments of live streams and videos so you can get a thing of me going here we need a new coding train gif which will somebody will make but it hasn't i don't think it's available on my channel yet i got to get in touch with my youtube friends all right uh what was i saying ah that's one feature another feature what else did i do i did the message the gif i gotta look at my video tutorials i guess that was kind of it hello world posting gifs and then i like organized the code etc etc so that's kind of it but there's some new features which aren't in the tutorials but were implemented by uh the wonderful coding trained discord team and really mostly all same plays um kobe uh and if i do help now what i'm looking for is some new commands random walk find assign get number set easter egg i have no idea what that does random number reading set reading all of those things all of these are related to accessing the contents of this particular random number book and getting your very own unique random number now you will have two things you will have an index if you get one if you choose to get one of these yourself you will have an index into this book one there are one million indices can we ever get to the point where every index is taken by a viewer of the coding train probably not but maybe you will also then have a fivedigit random number that starts from that index and that random number that index that that fivedigit random number is the starting point to generate your very own unique and custom random walk visualization so to uh to really explain what i'm talking about here i need to circle back and go to coding challenges oh this is all coming full circle random walk this is coding challenge number 52 from 2017. uh you could watch this video tutorial but i will just show you the code for it this is what it does is it looks at a random number this is using the p5.js random function one zero one two or three moves up down left right um and if we let this run for one million cycles eventually we would have a particular pattern so what if instead of picking the numbers from the p5.js random function the numbers were picked from this what is the what was i thinking this was my version of the um the dark hold from the uh coding train dark hold is that what it's called whatever somebody will let me know um you will get your own visualization of the rant that what the random walk would look like if you followed all of the digits into the from from the book so without further ado let me first actually log into p5 web editor let me go back to discord i think what i can do is say question mark random walk and we'll just get one of these so this is the random walk pattern starting from position 196931 in the book and the random number there i'm not sure what uh um kobe maybe we need to work on some of the we'll do some edits here i'm not sure what instead is referring to but with the random number two eight four five one so if i do another one here is so we could just call oh it's question mark i always forget it's question mark i could always just say question mark random walk and i'll get a new pattern here's another one um so uh now ah i see oh instead we couldn't get your input that's why oh because i could do a specific one i can say random walk uh one so this will give the position one in the book this is the random walk and the number and i think actually position zero is actually the first position the random number three two five three three okay so now why am i say why why why is this happening well this is just the stuff that i love it's like the most like oddly strange like obsessive use of a book of random numbers that i could possibly think of and a good demonstration of all sorts of concepts in creative coding and randomness and bots and apis and graphics and node and p5 and all that stuff but here's if you if you like what you see so far just wait there's more i'm going to say i think it's get number ah no no no um let's let's ask for help uh find assign get number supporter user my number my saved random number is so this is my unique random number well it's not it might not be a unique random number it should tell me probably what position i'm in also realizing we've got features go we've got feature requests going on this is my random number so now if i were to uh if i were to say i think i could find it find four two six five one it can be found in the book at row nine zero zero four position seven so these are the row and position i also would like to know the index how do i i wanna set my own random number so let's try set okay ah okay so anybody can do this uh now my number should be 73091 let's see yes that's my random number i have generated you a random number so now if you happen to be just you know in theory it would be great if everybody could just like pick but there you once you have one nobody else can take it so if you are a viewer of the coding train all you have to do is just type question mark set uh and it will set a new one for you that's very similar to my previous one wow look at that it's so close um but if if you like you uh if you are a it generated me a random one a sign i don't i don't know how this bot works ah oh no this is only for me um so there's some work to be done so i'm looking at various chats here so you can get your own the idea is that you could get your own random number if you're a supporter if you signed up to join through youtube membership you're able to pick your own or in theory i've assigned you one that you when a new person joins i have a little bit where i assign them a random number but then that random number will generate a particular random walk and where if also what is next what is next in your journey uh besides having a um um besides having just your own random number and unique random walk pattern that you can generate in the discord well bear with me for a moment and i see uh the creator of the spot kobe typing in here discord manager let me go here so what is happening here well look at these beauties these are train whistles handmade i believe in vermont i found a nice little wood shop that makes them they've been shipped all the way to oregon is that how you say it i always get it wrong uh where uh coding train uh illustrator designer extraordinaire jason is working with a laser etcher and i i aspire to be able to have this set up for myself to do as well laser etching the coding train logo onto one side now what's going to go on the other side you might ask um well this so this was a uh this is not this is a speculative version of getting your own then the random walk pattern that is generated can then be rendered and etched onto the train whistle and shipped to you so at the moment i'm starting with i mean i would love everybody in the world to be able to have one of these if they so choose i'm starting with the sort of conductor level of the youtube memberships uh because it's about matching the sort of cost and time of doing this and then hopefully i'll be able to as after that after i get through that we'll see if i can start offering it to the passengers or or other folks in other ways little presents to go onto my train take a train tour around the world and hand them out but um we're still finalizing the design um but ultimately i think it uh in the end i think i'm going with offering more space on the whistle for the random walk pattern and then the index of to where the random number started as well as the number itself will then be etched there so um this is pretty much all i have to say about this the set command takes a number optionally supporters can use it as set number to pick their number right so but what if i do this am i just not uh maybe i'm not actually a supporter so it's not letting me do it because it's giving me a different random number but to me i think we need to also always offer the number and the index and because the index is really what is driving the unique pattern that the random walk is generating is there anything more for me to say about this play around with this uh post your questions but um it's 10 35 here i am going to look now at the feature of reading and set reading i looked back in time for you shiffman last read the book at page eight oh wait a second welcome mark boots you are the very first passenger to board the code i mean you're all passengers but the you know green highlighted bar in the chat that says passenger welcome to passengers you are the very first one to join with the new system of the bot random numbers and while i could open up my book and find a random number for you let's try out a new um a new uh feature which is random number so now sound effects are all on the wrong page we will now get mark boots random number [Laughter] did i spell it wrong [Laughter] uh okay uh oh turns out it's called random okay try it again here we go what is this emoji that someone keeps reacting with i fortunately i can't see it but i have a feeling it's something i don't want to see all right so this is now mark boots now now mark boots if you're not currently in the discord uh i can't actually set and assign this for you right now but please join the discord uh and uh be in touch come into the supportive channels we'll get it all figured out okay so back to back to um reading last read from the book at page 18 row six and column one um the emojis are really distracting i totally agree uh um what am i set uh i need help again because i can't i have no my memory does not uh uh set reading okay set reading zero let's see if this works we're starting over people we're starting over please provide a valid page row and column okay i want well i want to be on page the first page of all the random digits is page one the row is zero and the column is zero okay so let's see if this works set reading page one row column aha you have updated the book position to one that should say page one another little live bug report uh row zero and column zero and now we begin for the fourth or fifth time the ceremonial coding train reading of the random numbers i'm just gonna do one row just to ease my way into this one row one zero zero nine seven three two five three three seven six five two zero one three five eight six three four six seven three five four eight seven six eight zero nine five nine zero nine one one seven three nine two nine two seven four nine four five all right i am verklempt now set reading page one row one column zero all right we're good so next time when i am streaming i can just say reading and it will tell me i last read the book at page one row one and column zero so um it's interesting you wanna think about the language here i mean this is a little bit of just semantics here but um this is technically speaking the starting position for the next random number to read so the last read was the end of page one row one column you know whatever and are the columns right there 50 are there 50 columns or are there 10 because we still sometimes think of them in groups of five which might seem arbitrary to you but just to be clear it's not completely arbitrary because this book if i hold it up to the camera and if it would focus on it the numbers are organized in groups of five so that that does have actual meaning the question is would i ever stop reading mid group of five i think i could live with the constraint of not but technically speaking what are the columns oh so much to think about how are we gonna get this right all right um i can't believe this live stream has been 40 minutes uh of of me talking about the random number book i do by the way have a mug with geometry formulas on him is it lovely it's getting quite warm up here where i am you know what it's time for it that's right it's time for community contributions that's right it's the time where i the person live streaming looks at my computer and pulls up things that you the viewers in the coding training have made in response to various videos and examples and things and features them on the stream and mostly just has a big smile and cheers and loves that stuff but what's that breaking news a community contribution came in across my twitter desk just this morning and i'm going to try to find it right now um here it is um let me see if i can zoom into this here for a second this is from and i have permission to share this this is from dhruv jamulia who one hour ago wrote just made an a.i that learns to play tetris using genetic algorithms and p5.js so in a moment i'm going to click on the web application you can see the github there and then there it is thank you i mentioned a huge shout out to shiffman yeah yeah uh just a medium sized a small shout out perfectly fine no need for any huge shout outs whose videos on genetic algorithms inspired me to make this when i clicked on the link my jaw dropped to the floor and i thought wow this is really if i just didn't waste hours without talking about random numbers in my live streams maybe i would have actually built this project because this is on my list um and so dhruv i don't know how you feel about this since you've already made it but on my i would like to uh do a bunch of videos about both coding uh tetris and as well as building an ai with genetic algorithms and neural networks to play it but let's take a look at it i'm going to click over to the webpage and close out the tweet and come back here okay so tetris ai artificial intelligence learning to play the world's most influential puzzle game i'm going to go to the classic we can look at i encourage you to look at the about this is the link if anyone's looking for it tetris ai.netwifi.app um and let's do classic okay now uh so i believe you know i didn't make this to be clear this is a community contribution and you know that because of the music i'm playing uh let's hit start so what it looks like to me and i'm totally speculating here is that it is just randomly playing this tetris game so randomly moving things left and right randomly rotating them and uh it's tried twice this is very similar to the flappy bird um examples that i've made it's tried it twice four times and each time it's keeping track of what score it got now i'm guessing that whatever mechanism is making the choices uh whatever system of rules you know i can only assume if i were doing this i would probably use my uh neural evolution technique so there's like a neural network that's taking the configuration of the tetris board as its input and then the output is some action like left right left right drop rotate left right i'm not sure whatever the options in tetris are and then whichever ones score the highest after a certain number of times or recombine to make new ones and i'm going to hit increase speed which is one of my uh and we can see it doing a lot more and so i can only assume that after some amount of time i don't know how long we would have to wait um we would get one that plays fairly well so one thing that i think is good to do if i can if you'll humor me uh with a little um feedback here is uh if after this has been run for a while to be able to save the state you could use even local storage for that or perhaps just save the current like configuration of the high scorer might be an excellent thing that you could load back and that's something that i think that i did with my um flappy bird um examples um and kake in the chat is saying hey i made this project a while ago using deep q learning so deep cue learning is one of my uh i don't know is it white whales is it my windmill that i'm always trying to defeat i don't know what cultural historical uh reference point i should be using here um but i really i i don't it's deep cue learning and q learning is a topic that i have really been hoping to explore and cover and hopefully someday i can get to it and chris writes this feels like the 2021 version of war games great movie by the way i watched ferris bueller with my family recently that was a lot of fun uh okay so let's see um i'm almost halfway through my time and i want to get to some of the coding projects i'm planning to do i also need to take a break and tell you about the brilliant the sponsor of today's live stream um but let's look at let's let me um let me let me constrain myself to looking at two community contributions and the way that i'm going to do that i know we have the wonderful wheel spinner but i'm going to just try seeing today and thank you so much for sharing this on twitter with me i would like to um can close this i'm going to go to the coding train website i'm going to go to the coding challenges and there are currently uh 161 of them so let's go back to discord and uh say random can i give it a range i can't remember if i can give it a range i got a number uh one three seven two one so if i were to just do it uh modulus 161 will google do that for me uh 44 oh modulo badger low modulo modulo is the operator modulus is the result of the operation 44. so now we're going to go to coding challenge number 44 it's an oldie um and oh it's a multipart one oh a fin 111 this one's going to be a little wonky i'm actually going to be really surprised if this one has any community contributions uh let's take a look at uh part two and ah there are there are three community contributions well two are by the same person that's no that's uh it still counts as three um and one is called feeling emoji and all ooh i love that title feeling emojian emojianal um mckay is also asking do you think we'll explore ray tracing i would like to i would like to um so let's take a look at a sentiment.js this is i don't know what this is hello okay um i am dan oh okay the coding train is live and happy ah okay so this looks like uh so if i remember correctly what this particular coding challenge demonstrates is a methodology for doing sentiment analysis on a text which uses a pre sort of hardcoded list of words with assigned sentiment scores that were put together if my memory serves me correctly by a group of psychologists um who created this list it's a wellknown list called the afin 111 and so i presumably what this is is a nice little interface for typing in a sentence and the reason why i might get a score of zero is none of these words the coding train or in the list but if i say happy jovial um sunny day and i got a score of 2.5 maybe it's like an average of the scores of all those words um sad depressed gray day negative 1.67 so you can see you know this is not a a very sophisticated method but it is a mechanism for taking any arbitrary sequence of words and turning it into a numeric score so you can go back and watch that coding challenge thank you for this new interface sam lee and now here's a colorized sentiment score also by sam lee um which ah whoa um i don't know what to do paste text here um happy sunny jovial day do i press this button now and i get the score and oh and look at that it is highlighting the words with probably a sort of brightness level according to what score it got so like for example um let's just go to rainbow on wikipedia and let's copy paste like this text bring it in here press this button wow not a single word is in the aphin 111 dataset that's kind of nuts um interestingly enough it would be it would be interesting to compare this to um uh where's oh sorry learn.mo5js.org to what is in the um the sentiment analysis model in the ml5.js library so this is a particular module in the ml5 library that uses a neural network to take text as an input and output a sentiment score and this particular pretrained model that's offered with ml5 was trained off of movie reviews so i think we could have a very long thorough discussion as to you know what uh what sort of biases and sort of are inherent in using movie reviews as your training set but you need some training data set that has chunks of text with labeled with a sentiment score and so presumably a movie review that's been assigned a score like our star rating that's how you can collect a data set like that without having to manually curate one so i think if i um go here to let's try going to this uh example i hope this works um and let me just change this here so this example uses the movie review model and it scores the sentiment of a text with a value between 0 and 1 0 being negative 1 being positive movie reviews were truncated to a maximum of 200 words and only the most 20 000 most common words in the room so this is very similar but instead of being a sort of hardcoded curated list of words that a sort of socalled trained expert i don't mean that they aren't experts i just think it's like you know who are those people and are why are we entrusting them to assign sentiment scores to language i think that's a complex question uh what's the difference between doing that trust having an expert created list of words versus an automated list of words essentially generated from a neural network based system so let's go um well let's just sort of see you can see we get today is the happiest day and it's full of rainbows is a very high number saddest day and is full of uh rain storms and clouds uh sad and miserable does that not work cause i got got a very high sentiment score yeah um well i got a different score and let's see if we can make it be negative this is weird something's up something is definitely a miss here um miserable sad annoyed i hate everything and i'm so gosh darned tired angst analysis demo there we go what's it i just curious yeah all right so i'm not sure um yeah i'm not sure what happened there before but we can see that you know with me trying to write very extreme uh sort of sentences that uh in my mind are clearly uh negative versus positive um i'm able to sort of produce some results um this is a very small text box but i'm just curious to see if i can paste this in here and hit submit the rainbow wikipedia page is full of happy positive uh energy and sentiment all right uh we've got one more uh here to uh demonstrate feeling emojinol by chris hall let's take a look at this um and how are you i am okay today it's been a hard year but things are looking up and i'm excited for this summer so this is pretty cool i mean i i like what this is doing um it's looking at my text it's showing me which words have which sentiment score so we can see i'm getting a total of two hard we had a negative score excited had a high positive score and then i guess it's summarizing it uh in with an emoji as well as with kind of some uh text i don't know of how that text is generated picked from a list i don't know if it can only ever be a happy or sad emoji um but i like this idea of almost like a free writing exercise and in real time as you're free writing um you're getting this um feedback on the the web page itself is changing i could imagine doing something that's more abs that's kind of abstract in this vein as you're typing an email even like this would be like a chrome extension you're typing an email in the sort of color scheme of your email editor uh is a browser extension i should say uh is um is changing or could you have something that's like reading the sentiment of your code like code comments that would be kind of interesting um so um so this is great thank you guys see this is this is uh this is bringing me so much happiness today because uh i just love to see the sort of creative possibilities that come out of of many of these examples ah all right hold on a in the chat says i just discovered this channel i am excited but where do i get started well lucky for you i caught your message in the chat and i am here to answer it so um back to the coding train website if coding is brand new to you and you want to explore it through this channel you know to be clear there are many other pathways and possibilities and places for you to explore coding um but um through this channel this particular beginners sorry these playlists are meant for beginners with no experience whatsoever um the p5.js one is probably the most uptodate one and in fact you can sort of see i'm slowly filling in the gaps of replacing older videos so this is a beginner playlist that i would like to always have available and kind of current and you can see that there are some videos that were made in 2015 that are still in this playlist the code for all these videos still works i also look a little bit younger i think my brain is working better as i age you know this different things seem harder for me to figure out but uh so you know i think there's hopefully there's still value in these older videos but um you know i've been able to improve the examples for clarity based on feedback as well as improve some of the production value of the videos so you can see that these are recent ones that are newer that just um you know from uh from february march of this year so next on my list you know it's always this balance of how much do i want to do live streaming versus uh work on the nature of code book or versus work on updating these videos so but i would like by the fall to finish replacing all the way up until i think these um boy a lot any of that were made in 2015 so i think the 2017 ones i'll probably keep still but all the 2015 ones i would like to replace by the way if you have feedback i don't know what people think of the new sort of thumbnails um and the new style of the videos but um but yeah so that's where um um that's where you can begin i'm seeing people in the chat requesting to show different contributions and but um i think right now um as it is 11 a.m the exact is perfect i spent an hour this is this is how it should be i spent an hour you know it should really be 50 minutes or 55 minutes because i'm gonna take a five minute break i yeah the processing ones are really old um yeah i spent about an hour kind of meandering through showing some contributions talking about the discord bot um i want to work on in the second half of the live stream i want to work on um self 3d selfavoiding walk and and looking at uh bezier curves um so i'm going to take a short break before i take a break i would like to thank uh today's sponsor uh the coding train the engine is kept running by the sponsors of the go to drain built this thing up that has a lot of components and a lot of pieces and i'm really thankful to have uh partners oh and ahmer super chat is coming in this also helps keep the engine running uh uh have friends from the different sponsors who are able to support the work that i'm doing um if you like learning stuff on the coding train if you also like having mugs i just switch over here to this view with uh geometry formulas on them this is one side of my mug you know you know what's better than learning some geometry formulas from your mug of tea or coffee or warm water with lemon as my grandmother used to like to make um i think it was called uh yiddish it's like vasa mcmillan anybody who knows yiddish what does that mean is that like with milk in it i'm not sure it's like these things are popping into my mind um but brilliant is really um a website and uh app that i think you will um particularly particularly love it has um so what do i do i talk ramble incessantly um and demonstrate stuff but really for me the way that i learn most effectively is through trying things on my own and so brilliant is really a website that's all about uh and an app all about trying things on uh for your own interactive courses daily challenges um and just the the topics like if i go to the courses page um you know this is like i just go ah well i just want to gobble it all up because it's all of the topics that i really love it's got stuff for all ages um you know two courses that i would like to highlight for you one is the um fundam program with python course so i i like to highlight this one because i um program with javascript and a lot of get a lot of requests about learning python and this would be a great one to explore the basics of programming with a different language for you this course called geometry fundamentals has some really amazing uh visual animations um that demonstrate core concepts in in math and geometry honestly one of the reasons why i love it so much is my mic still working it's like disappeared from my screen it is um one of the reasons why i love this course so much is that um it gives me a lot of ideas of like visual things that i want to make um coming back to uh here um like this beautiful geometry course um i'm uh it's just like really amazing i'm gonna hit continue um and you can see here i'm in lesson two uh i got this one right i guess at some point i'm gonna go on next well i'm a little bit afraid so the end the answer to the prior problem we found that a progressive series of similar l shapes each with a red portion of one third and use that to derive the fact that the entire large square has a red portion of one third it's kind of like these infinite series are super interesting another approach is take each red square and make two copies one to the right of the square being copied and one to the one below so this shows that in purple oh interesting and this method of covering the overall large square leads to two purple squares for every one red square this again moment of realization this leads to the red area being one third of the overall square um so you can go through and uh it's going to give me oh no no i gotta work on this one now okay uh so like at your your instinct would be like threefourths right because one two three and then the blue circle you know there's four sections but this blue circle has a yellow one let's think about this are we at four so it's more than three threefourths right so we can eliminate threefifths which is less than threefourths i kind of want to do that purple thing how did that purple thing go where for every red square we put two blue squares so for every but there's no for every oh each one of these is four so for every four 8 12 yellow squares i can color three blue squares so 12 out of 15 which is fourfifths did i get that right i got it right oh my god oh that was so exciting oh wait wait wait i don't want to go back go back um what i love about this is then i go to the show explanation and um yeah it did this is what i did in my head uh 12 and then three um awesome which reduces to four fifths oh this is so fun so um if you are interested in this stuff um you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um it lets them know that you found it through the coding train which helps me out a little bit and there's lots of stuff for you to explore there there is also a premium subscription that you can buy for yourself a gift to somebody else and if you go through that link the first 200 people to do so will get 20 off okay um i am going to now um so thank you again to brilliant um i am going to take a short uh hopefully just like two or three minute break just to grab some water uh do a 30 second meditation and come back to look at something called a selfavoiding walk and extending that into 3d and hopefully by next week the actual it's about a 35 to 40 minute coding challenge video building the entire selfavoiding walk okay uh see you all in about two or three minutes and i'm muting my microphone here i'll be right back so do so do all right i am back um i see folks in the uh chat are asking a very common frequently asked question which is what is the music that i'm playing uh this is a song it's called tori the dog i have no idea why it's called that is by a composer named adam blau who is a film and tv uh composer based in los angeles i think you can find um him on twitter um adam blau i think he has a website adam blough.com adam blau is a friend of mine from my old bright college years okay thank uh offered up this uh track that he had written that doesn't get used anywhere else for me to use um all right so what's happening now we're actually going to do some coding uh thanks again to the sponsor of today brilliant um so what are you looking at here this is remember i spent all this time talking about random walks and the uh new coding train discord bot earlier and the next coding challenge that will be released on the channel is programming exactly this and i know this is a little bit unfortunate the way things are working for me these days where i'm covering additional things from the uh coding challenge on a live stream when the coding challenge hasn't yet been released but that's the way it works right now um so this is the code that the challenge ends now what what you can see about what's different about a selfavoiding walk is it's making a random decision every frame to move up down left or right but it's never allowed to step into a position where it has been before so we you might be able to see this a bit more uh clearly as if i started over and you can see one of the things that i've built into this example is if it ends up somewhere where it is stuck and has nowhere to go it will backtrack and try a different route so this is i i think this is a beautiful um um a beautiful an algorithm that has beautiful results um i i kind of hypnotized by it i could kind of watch it all day i think there's a lot of probably this is just a very literal basic visualization of it i think there's a lot of possibilities of what you could do to explore this um on a live stream a while ago i think i did this with you know some curves and started to make these different patterns from it but what i uh would like to demonstrate in the video is what it looks like if it's in 3d so you know time box myself here maybe just give me myself 20 25 minutes to see um uh how that works now i just realized that i need a three okay so first of all let me duplicate i already duplicated this uh so let's say three you know what i wanna first see like how do i even render this in 3d so first of all if i say webgl great okay so that's excellent now can i in draw say orbit is it do i say orbit controls orbit control there's a uh oh there we go so there's a function in p5 look at that that is wild that is so cool so even just doing this and i think i oh and you know my font is so tiny sorry about that um let's now let's give myself a little bit more space and i can zoom in ah hold on i don't know why this orbit controls thing there we go it's just very do i not yeah it works it's just kind of like a little wonky um all right so now now that that works uh and maybe what i would like to do is have the spacing be a little bit bigger so that way also it's a little bigger okay um so i can sort of see this whoa it moving closer all right so now what i would like to do is change this to make 3d array columns rows what's the word for the in a 3d grid i mean columns rows i mean it's really just x the three different axes uh i i was to say like zoll's i wanted to make a um zowls okay columns rows and i'm officially calling them zowls [Laughter] uh layers depths depth i realize it's depth but okay i'm fine uh not we'll call it depth so for every column we have a certain number of rows and for every then four and this should for every element of for every row i mean this is like a crazy way to make a threedimensional array in javascript but it's just the way i know how uh is this right i think this is right um we can do a nice console log table so we're gonna make a 3d array columns rows depth and i'm just going to say depth is the same as the number of columns and let's let's test this out orbit control let's test this out so i'm just opening up the console here because if i say make 3d array 10 10 10. was it not called that oh i have to run it oh unexpected token but we have an extra parenthesis there okay it's running let's go back to here okay that works so um three let's make it three by three by three let's just test it let's look at that so it's got an array of three arrays and each array of three arrays has three things in it empty times three that makes sense can i do like console.table um test yeah so this makes sense because it is a 2d array with each spot having an array in it okay so that's good i think the only thing okay so now what else do i need to change and can i give myself a little bit more room here i guess i shouldn't have made it uh 800 by 800. let's do that and then do you know as i obsessively try to have the right amount of space here okay so now um we've got a 3d array the spot is zero zero zero um return is valid i j k everything's got to have a third element to it uh oh k k plus plus k is less than depth i j k spot i j k i'm just kind of let me hit stop here and turn auto refresh off please i just want everything that was previously in two dimensions to switch to being three all right what else do i got here is valid all right and then also check if k is less than zero k is greater than or equal to depth that would be off the grid okay translate i don't really need to worry about that spot is next spot path path length college uh if you've hit every spot uh spot.z spot.z okay now where's my spot class needs to have a dz and then all of the steps now there's a lot more possibilities for all of the possible steps that it could take wow if i did a good job writing this code the original code extending it into 3d is going to be as easy as what i'm doing right now which i don't know if that's really the case but we're about to find out okay uh i j k uh the z is and i realized this would make a lot more sense if you had all just watched the video where i built this all options all options new x new z is valid new x new y new z um okay grid uh we need the z component which is k plus dz is that really everything what's the chance that i did this right very little oh my goodness i think it's actually kind of doing it it seems to not be moving along the z very much though i mean it did like why why did it go why is it sticking within a sort of current plane the second dx should be negative one in the step constructor i think i got it right hold on it's kind of staying within one plane line 13. oh thank you that i couldn't see there we go wild wow that is wild what why did i just do that in like 10 minutes i mean visually this could be vastly improved i'm trying to think if there's anything i could do right now just to sort of visually improve it so one thing is i feel like the line thickness is a very thick so um let's let's make it thinner and maybe what i want to do is actually not use orbit control but translate i'm putting where it starts in the center but it can't go negatively so what if i actually have it start at um like what's the center center x equals uh columns divided by it's the same for all of them so columns divided by uh 2 but make sure i floor it and then uh let's just reuse that so i'm gonna have it start in the center um and let's just make sure that works what did i just do um but now i want to translate oh whoa that's weird but now i don't want to translate it anywhere or no i want to translate it by negative i want to translate it you know what let me put orbit controls back in wait i i want it to starting in the center of the grid which i want oh no spacing times columns negative spacing times rows negative spacing times depth there we go this is what i want i want it to start in the center but be able to go in all directions do i have orbit control in so now there we go i wanted to be able to kind of move around it can you fade it darker the further away from the camera yeah are we breaking yes is this what was that called like the tubes that old uh win3 this old screensaver am i am i just remaking that what was it was it like is this what it was called pipes pipes i did not realize i just made this all right let's what's the so yeah i'm totally basically making this amazing amazing all right but uh i have to visually think about the design of this a bit more but i wanted to do a couple things one is what if i take out orbit controls and just do like rotate x frame count times 0.01 or something so it's always going to whoa that's a little bit weird and let's try rotating y more slowly okay okay so this i'm enjoying and what can i do is there anything i can do just sort of visually right now yeah i kind of wanted to make it thinner there we go so here we go this is what i will capture give each walker a i want to start multiple ones give them different colors so this is what um oh um this is what i would like i just this is enough for me right now i just wanted to be able to demonstrate um to demonstrate the core idea and so i have now a visual thing i can render for um making it in through in 3d yeah yep i could write i could take the rgb so first of all let me grab this code and i want to go to discord and ah random max between zero thank you and i'm going to go to links so i this is where i will typically paste links to things that i'm doing in the live stream somebody is welcome to paste this into the youtube chat i just don't have that open right now but um so that's where you can find the link to this code right now um but i think this is good enough like this this is what i want to capture that video this is the last piece for this video to come out any questions translate to center before rotating so it stays in perspective so in theory it's it is translated to the center of this particular kind of cube that it is going to try to fill um based on this translation but i believe that it is appears that it's not staying in our perspective because it randomly chose to go in one direction at the beginning and never came back to go the other way so i could dynamically translate to like do something interesting of like where it currently is like this would be a little bit crazy like what if i said um translate to um negative spot dot x negative spot dot y negative spot dot z like i think this would make it i mean it's it's very jarring but it's following the current spot whoa i could okay wait i got i got it now i can't uh let lerp x lerp y lerp z um how do i have them all equal zero is there a way to declare three variables all at once where they all equal zero that's not just this uh okay um so what i want to do is say lerpx equals lerp lerp lerp x spot dot x ooh stallion that's way too jarring for me um so if i want to move towards the spot i want to go just like a small percentage of the way there so let's say 0.1 let's call that amount and let's do that for y z and then negative lerp x lerp y lerp z this should now more smoothly follow it oops negative and one more negative let's see if this works right you can see that it's a bit more smooth let's make the amount like really literally less there we go it's kind of cool so it's like an automated sort of camera that's trying to why is it moving further away though it should be staying close to it maybe that's just the lurping is slow it's kind of interesting though i mean i don't know if i like what happens if i take the rotate out very strange so there's probably there's there's probably a uh a different way to do this that would be uh interesting in terms of following the camera but this is kind of a quick demonstration that i have right now i kind of love it actually but i want to look at bezier curves the rotation is around the wrong anchor point i know right well i'm not rotating now um but now i am what if i do rotate z so it's just kind of spinning move the rotate above the translator all right all right yeah focus on the center work out the center from the minimum x to the minimum y yeah there's so many ways that this could be done but focusing on the center would be a very good idea uh capture the maximum x y and z and center on their midpoints i'm going to leave that as an exercise to the viewer although i kind of to be honest that actually okay can i allow myself five more minutes to do that let's use p5 vector um so i need min x min xyz max xyz so for let v of path and then i would say min x y z equals um or spot of path like oh no let but yeah i'll just say v it's fine min x y z equals the minimum whichever one is smaller of v dot x and itself minx y z dot x min x y z dot y min x y z dot z so this is getting the minimum xyz then the maximum should be the max function whichever one is bigger between the x the y the z and the max then center dot x equals min x y z i kind of want to just call these min v no but it's not really that because min x y z of max x y z dot x minus min x y z dot x times zero half of that plus the minimum is that right center dot x is the maximum minus the minimum that's the the range half of the range offset from the minimum y z y z y z y z oh wait a sec the maximum the minimum can't be zero it'll always be zero so the minimum has to start at like infinity um and it's the minimum oh dot x dot y dot z dot x dot y dot z and now what happens if let's get rid of the rotation what if i do translate negative center x negative center y negative center z and i might want to lerp those but hold on missing parentheses oops here yeah look at that that is wild okay let's put the alert back in this is this is really cool uh let's put the alert back in uh where is that lerp lerp lerp so this should be center dot x no no center dot x center dot y center dot z and let's yeah that's fine and then uh lerp x lerp y lerp z okay here we go everybody so it's interesting i i was i would have might be done the average location but i like this minimum and maximum because it's sort of like panning now the question is should i add some rotation like is that interesting to also see it rotate i feel like i would like to see it rotate around the y axis is kind of what i'm expecting to see it's why is it rotate away the rotation am i just wrong about the way that i'm thinking about this and the rotation really should be before the translation maybe yeah this is what i meant to do i don't understand why the rotation should be before that's like backwards the way i think about it but this is great if i don't say so myself uh um let me see here what else is happening um all right now can is this the pipes screensaver apparently it is it was not my intention i probably should brand this like redo the coding challenge as windows pipes screensaver and that would be good clickbait let me just see now if i can do something kind of nice which is make this window width window height file share and get this we hit stop i'll share and get this view view enter full screen and here we are everybody let's just enjoy this for a little bit this is a selfavoiding walk in three dimensions people really want me to add color [Laughter] but i want to look at bezier curves today i only have 20 minutes left oh the live poll i forgot about the live poll all right i have no idea if the live poll is gonna work but there's been so many um uh music please i don't know i don't really got any uh okay i'm still here by the way all right let's add color bessie by the way uh for all of you um we're wondering when is the next live stream it's tomorrow so i can do the bezier curve stuff i want to do tomorrow um let's add some color okay so what's going to be the best way to do this all right let's try um where am i i don't think though um i have to change the way that i'm drawing it because um unfortunately i'm drawing it as one continuous line and um raycasting coding challenge of the infamous maze from windows 98 would be a nice next step that's a great suggestion cola games a random walk with bezier curves oh that is such a good idea tomorrow so i'm live streaming tomorrow around 2 p.m eastern um you know i'm kind of cramming in oh i've committed to doing a bunch of live streams this month but i didn't get to them so i'm cramming them in at the end so i'm doing another one tomorrow but let's see i think what i would need to do is draw them as individual lines so let me just try something first real quick which is v1 is path index i v two is path index i plus one and then if i'm drawing a line from v one dot x v one dot y v one dot z uh dot y d2 dot z is this the same result yeah okay great so now i can do individual colors because i can take um i have a crazy idea here i should probably do hue maybe i should just do it as um just using hsb mode well the way i was going to do it since we have x y z is r is map v one v1.x which goes between 0 and the number of columns to between 0 and 255. let's just try this real quick g b uh and so i think someone said layers could be instead of depth it could be a good idea uh stroke rgb let's just try this there's some colors appearing here what did i miss v1 xyz zero column what am i missing here oh i could do map the path dot length distance from the center interesting uh yes okay wait why are the most of them just oh it's x x there we go this is what i need to do there we go so this is uh a different way of doing it let's take a look at how this looks and i wonder if actually i should have a minimum amount of color for each just to sort of enforce some amount of brightness and now let's hit save let's go to here see the full screen version cola game says i forgot to add that i could never thank you enough for getting me interested in programming literally shaped the course of my life oh that's so nice thank you uh your passion for what you do is amazing yeah all of the coordinates are positive so this was kind of a nice um idea of a way of doing it and um but i do think that cycling the hue along the path is maybe a nicer way of doing it so this is a different way of doing it would be so that's one way let's say let me comment this out too let me say a color mode hsb so now what if i say uh stroke i modulus 360 that's the hue and then just have these max out at 100. oh i still need these two points yeah i think this is what people were looking for uh so let's see this what happened here there we go so this i think is what folks were looking for this definitely works better in terms of being ridiculously colorful selfavoiding walk but i i i can do i could do you one better here let's add the frame count so now it is also psych the frame count gets added before i take the modulus and now is the cycling too fast do you even notice it does anybody care i like this i mean i could make it i always thought i could make it like more extreme very blinky let's just do it by two i don't know maybe the softness slowness of it is fine um all right ready here we go we are finishing today's live stream with this selfavoiding walk is it possible to make the lines thicker yeah i was making them thinner on purpose but yeah i can try that did i just close the other the code no it's just in another tab let's we can make the we can go back to what i had before i think that took are they thicker oh no that's for the point where's the stroke weight there it is the problem is um you can see there's a flaw at the end well this is a nice place to wrap up today's live stream with my 3d selfavoiding walk rainbow rainbow colored selfavoiding god this is bringing me enormous joy i don't need to be in the image here i don't know if that music really went with let's see what a little music do i have i forgot that does really work this kind of works so the drawing nicole says if the drawing point was also a specular light could look pretty cool that would be kind of amazing all right um i'm i'm wrapping this up i'm i'm a little disappointed in myself now because um the the coding challenge definitely like if this were the end result of the coding challenge i mean i could record another like five minutes of extending it into 3d um but um i think i should just let it let it be um but like i love the idea of branding this coding challenge as the windows pipes screensaver yeah it would definitely that would definitely help its uh youtube popularity i'll have to think about that i have to think about whether i have that uh yeah it's so uh um alex is in the chat is pointing it's slowing down a bit so you know this uh this is a limitation of you know javascript canvas and the number of vertices that i'm drawing for all of these lines um we don't know if there would be i'm sure there are some efficiencies that could be added here or geometry that could be saved and in a way that it gets rendered more in an optimized way because it's not those points aren't moving although my five minutes left in my allocated amount of time trying to be good about just streaming for two hours the poll is forgotten yeah i'll have to come back for the poll tomorrow i just went ahead and um but one idea that i kind of have just out of curiosity oh no no that won't yeah actually it will um what if i did something crazy and just like jiggled all the points oh yeah that is [Laughter] i mean i i don't know what i expected to happen there but that's really kind of nuts yeah i should be using something more like thoughtful in terms of uh uh and like maybe what's interesting is i'm storing all the xy positions of all these points separately from where they are in the array so there's not really any reason why it couldn't over time kind of disintegrate and get a little bit more like look at it's kind of getting wonky as we go um it probably would make more sense for me to use a particular algorithm that retained a displacement from its original but i like the idea of it being less kind of exact and actually maybe that's maybe instead of moving it randomly i should just offset them a little bit like so in other words like what if actually instead of doing that in the actual spot class when i make the x position like what if i just say plus offset based on the spacing so it will be in a regular grid visually still the data still retains its that's too much i suppose i cannot stop i need a time limit which i am now down to three minutes left still too much yeah this is kind of more what i'm looking for maybe not enough yeah so this is interesting so let me just let's let's go look at this in the full screen one so this is just adding a little bit of noise so that it kind of looks perhaps a little bit more sketched um you know i think that's sort of an interesting uh twist on this um it still is very blocky you know i could certainly try to make it more like curved lines but i kind of like this um adding a little uh mess to it all right i'm gonna see uh so so by the way um please join the discord and try out all of the discord bot stuff um message um message us and give us feedback about how to improve that um it's not windows xp now anymore um i will be um back tomorrow if you can believe that uh my goal i haven't i didn't i didn't set the time yet but it's um i have stuff in the morning so probably around 2 p.m eastern also for about two hours and yes cat king writes uh in the chat um breaking news coding train releases a copyright disco sensation that's gripping our nation um but yeah let's look at seeing if we can add bezier curves to this tomorrow and see what we get um thank you everyone for joining today um i have this little uh goodbye song that's about three minutes long so i'm gonna set this to full screen and refresh the page and ethan asks and answers some questions why don't you update your macbook to big sir i'm afraid too should i do that couldn't hurt uh did you try the new slash commands i have not tried the new slash commands yet but i do intend to do so at some point soon um cat king says bye bye to you as well uh just a quick uh shout out thank you to today's sponsor brilliant.org codingtrain you can sign up for free there i don't know is there a course or puzzle that has that is related to the this uh 3d selfavoiding walk i'd love to know mutate the xyz while drawing every frame so over time it would disintegrate with the cumulative effect yes that's what i started with but it became too disintegrated what would be really cool is to add spring forces between them so they could kind of like uh like add a spring force between like where it's supposed to be and it's offset so they could kind of jiggle but always spring back into place that might be interesting um after today's news i'm quite glad that i didn't buy an m1 says julian i don't know what today's news is i don't have to fill me in on that um we will need a processing conversion if we're adding curves to this yeah so i definitely would like to make a processing version of this that wouldn't be too difficult in many ways this is probably well suited to processing in order to keep its efficiency you could have the old lines become slowly transparent and delete them excellent suggestion from razif an essay says i want to see this with spring forces so much me too me too that'll have to be another one at some point um thank you all for tuning in to today's live stream um i may i think i'll probably like leave this running um as i go um and i'll keep an eye on the chat uh um for a little bit um i'll be back i'm gonna need some lunch take gloria for a walk i will be back with another live stream tomorrow if all goes according to plan uh in the afternoon um eastern time so stay tuned i will post notices about that in the discord um maybe on twitter but mostly if you just you know subscribe and hit the bell or whatever you'll get a notification on youtube all right thank you everybody see you tomorrow i hope more regular live streams right as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop never forget this never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward coordinate song it's the fuller cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me see it with me it's the polaroid unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens the kittens the kittens kittens and kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound and effects what else is there unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes i really lose okay we're gonna do it kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and getting kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and getting bye everybody have a wonderful day see you tomorrow
