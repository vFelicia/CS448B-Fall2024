hello my stream oh yes I am attracts me like no other function I can't I can't get anything right I don't want to stop coding now this song is dedicated to processing my first love my true huh happy February 13th one of my favorite days of the year I did you hear that rattle at least the ukulele it has a weird rattle and so me being the mechanically minded person that I am I'm very mechanically you know really good with tools and building and putting things together that's sarcasm you hear my voice I found this screwdriver and I tried tightening all these different screws that I found all over this thing but I don't know still rattles so if anybody wants to submit other love ODEs to processing or maybe to p5.js or other types of programming things I will sync those later on today's heart themed coding training episode alright so welcome good morning my name is Dan and Buster the Kotick train this is a live YouTube stream that now happens every Wednesday at 1030 a.m. Eastern believe that I have an actual regularly scheduled time so all of you been asking just come here next week at this exact time and I will be here except for when I cancel or something happens there's like a snowstorm or a mistake or like beating came up that day that day hopefully no I haven't I can't bring myself to actually put on the top on the YouTube banner like every went live every Wednesday at 1030 a.m. because I'm afraid that will jinx myself but that's what that's my plan so yeah people are eric is asking shouldn't the yellow colors fade to blue as time goes on Oh alexandros I think hey it's probably from the nut or the action you should check the trust rod I have no idea what any of that stuff is I hope you're not that's not like but that probably has to do with parts of the ukulele so yes so this is a this is the result of the coding challenge that I did last week and I don't remember where what the settings here are somewhat arbitrary in terms of the fading and let me in terms of some of these values let me run this again so I kind of wanted to continue with this this week but I don't know things didn't go well for me in the last week after putting this code together but I do want to talk about how I still want to do some follow up videos about that so let me begin by talking a little bit about fluid simulation and where my head is at with that so I want to want to talk about a few things so this is what you're seeing here is the result of me porting code from my cache it's a blog post called fluid dynamics or fluid simulation or something like that for dummies that code that blog post was written based on the seminal paper from 2003 I think realtime fluid Amyx for games from by jos stam and so this is like kind of a 15th generation version of that in processing and it works in this nice way to create this fluid like feeling I mean feels looks the visual appearance here is much more like smoke but with changing the way you render the design changing with various parameters of the design you could probably create a variety of different kinds of fluid like simulations however this is not many people have gone before me to create versions of this in more thoughtful and sophisticated ways so my original plan was just to port the code which I did the next step I was going to try to refactor the code and I started working on that a little bit I want to show you where I got to because maybe some of you might have some suggestions so I'm gonna go to github.com slash Schiffman slash CFD the CFD stands for computational fluid dynamics and these were some like these were some like test bits of code that I put together before I did the actual live stream if you want to find the actual code from the live stream you can just go to here you will see the video here this is on the coding training comm this link will take you ups this link will take you to the code and then one person who this is exciting we have one community contribution so let's take a look at this community contribution really quickly from Juan Carlos Punk's Campuzano flow around circle incompressible non viscous fluid I love this so this looks like it is a particle based fluid simulation which is really where I want to get to with all this stuff and you can see the path of these dots kind of moving around this circle can I move that circle I can move the circle that's kind of cool I might suggest it sort of surprised me that it went the color of the background when I clicked it so I might if I were giving my quick offthecuff feedback here I might consider a different color change or when I click and drag but I can let's try let's click on trace so that's cool so we can see the trails of these particles let's click on speed oh it says drag circle right there what does radius do Oh that makes the radius of this interesting only much smaller so let's make that big let me drag it around cool so that's great so I'd be curious to look and III would want I would love some documentation here about and I wonder it's probably in the source code if I click here some documentation about what what what algorithms led you to this particular simulation or did you invent them yourself or what was the sort of technique employed here that's terrific okay so but where I was getting to is over here I started refactoring the code and if we look at my code from last week which is just again a port of other people's code what you'll see is that we go here to the fluid class what you'll see is all of the data that's part of this fluid simulation is a set of six different individual arrays there is a velocity vector associated with each spot on the canvas each spot on that grid of pixels and that velocity vector is described by an X and a y this zero notate the sort of previous velocity vector so we always need to know historically what was the velocity before this moment in time and this is very common a lot of different cellular automata algorithms that involve data on a grid and then also there's this idea of density which which I might think about renaming to die because it's the amount of dye at any spot in the fluid and that's how we end up visualizing whether we're using we've mapped that amount of dye to a hue or to a brightness value and then s is the previous amount of dye so I had this idea that let me let me and I was gonna do this live but I thought I would just try the first steps of it which you can see here and I am this is my fluid refactor and if I go here I had this idea okay well what if I had like this idea of a velocity object and it was actually a P vector object and the velocity object knew a current velocity in a previous velocity so a I'm just like trying to get some new variable aiming to make the code a bit more readable but also if and then if I had a dye object which would just be a scalar so the velocity object is a vector the dye object is a scalar and then this would allow me to have the fluid class have just these two arrays like the array of velocities in the array of dyes and then I could start the code would sort of like simplify into like this I kept going down this road and this is this doesn't work but then this is my idea oh then I could apply the different steps of this particular simulation diffusion projection diffuse project Advent and I would diffuse and project the velocity and add back to project the velocity and diffuse and add back the density and then I started realizing the whole way the code is written if we go into those functions that perform these operations is to operate off of a single generic array so I guess I could overload the fun of two different versions of each functions whether they're getting a vector or an array then I started to get lost and I was like I don't know the best way to do this and that was like late at night last videos but I got the live stream about this tomorrow morning so I you know I rather than take up all of today's live stream trying to refactor this code what I'm asking for you is your suggestion so if you're watching this right now and I want to think about this have some ideas for me let me know let me know because my goal is to refactor it in a way that's more readable maybe turn it into a library maybe ported the JavaScript maybe optimize it there's lots of possibilities here but then I was sort of thinking what am I doing here am I really the person in the world who's going to invent a new fluid simulation like library and algorithm and organize it I mean probably not to me maybe and certainly with the help that I've found with this wonderful internet community of people who watch this channel I'm sure there are lots lots of people watching who really could thoughtfully contribute this idea but there are many other there are this is not a new idea and in fact researching this a bit more I found another library called pixel flow it's last commit was pretty recent so that does it oh no that's not pretty that's a year ago last commit was a year ago but you can see it has a lot of functionality for this these ideas and if you you can download and I actually ran some these examples which are quite oh here we go which you can see are quite exciting and amazing so this is an interesting possibility for me to look into actually just using a library where all of this has already been sort of refactored and reorganized in a way that makes it useful for for like making the projects there is also MSA fluid which is a library that I used many years ago which is the exact same algorithm that I implemented but thoughtfully packaged into a library but not currently compatible with processing 3 I quickly checked I think this would require a small amount of work work that I could actually to to update it to work with processing 3 more easily so that's a possibility but the I've been in touch a little bit with Gabriel Y mouth let me find Gabriel y mouth on Twitter Gabriel y mouth is a researcher specifically in fluid structure interactions and based in the UK this is the website and Gabriel y mouth has created something called a lilypad processing which is and and let me just download this I'm gonna let's let's take a moment because this will actually just run right off the bat so I want to show this to you because this is really really phenomenal and why why why is my zsh broken let me actually go to the desktop and let me clone this repo real quick let me open here and let me open this up in processing i'm gonna go to lily pad lily pad and i'm gonna run this so look at this let me zoom into this here we can see we've got a really excellent and more dynamic and probably accurate fluid fluid simulation and there's so much there's so much to this like this this quick demo this is like scratching the surface of what this example I don't know what to call it example demo open source code project does but to me and and there's and it's really well organized thoughtfully in an objectoriented fashion but for for me to use it and to like there's just like so much going on here and is probably fairly well documented here documentation on the solver guides are contributing the project simple instructions there's lots of documentation here but what I think might be useful would be to turn this into a processing library and by that I mean something that I can do actually just through here import library add library for example if I look for a pixel flow is it here yeah pixel flow is right here so I'm gonna I'm gonna find pixel flow in the libraries I'm gonna hit install I'm gonna install it and then let me go find one of the pixel flow examples so I can go over to examples and I can go to contributed libraries and go to pixel flow so we can pick any of these let's just try fluid 2d fluid basic and then we can run this and ah so look at this the package control p5 doesn't exist which means this is dependent on another library let me quit this these by the way because they're so sketch import library add library I'm gonna add control p5 which is an interface library which it's much harder to do interface elements in an elegant and flexible way and processing in p5.js because you're in the browser being able to manipulate text boxes and buttons and sliders and and and and create an interface there's so many more possibilities given the rich set of features that a browser affords okay so let me now try running this again so there we go okay so we can see this is a similar idea of yet another fluid simulation example so so this is where I'm struggling with how to how to move forward first of all I got a lot of stuff a fluid simulation I'm so fascinated by it I want to oh I want to but so one path which of my original path was to kind of refactor my code make it a little bit try to understand how the algorithms work a little bit more and explain those things that will take some time and research on my part which is a little atypical for how I do things which is more fly by the seat of my pants so that's one possibility the other possibility would be to leave that fluid video alone and go straight to using a library whether it's pixel flow NS a fluid or lily pad all three so that's what I'm looking for thoughts and suggestions about but I'm going to leave that now I'm I'm like looking over here and I'm seeing some would say he is not looking at chat question mark so no I am not looking at jack except for every once in a while when I to look at the chat okay so I want to put that aside and today I want to focus on the heart let me quit this okay wait oh let's also go and go to the DVD logo challenge since there were several community contributions let's take a look at some of these so let's look first at bouncing DVD logo by Bruno in 3d that's pretty great that's pretty awesome thank you for submitting that let's look at verlet DVD logo by Anurag this is cool so look so add rope there we go so now these are looks like on Iraq who created this actually made an entire verlan physics library Berlet J yes I typically have used toxic lips yes for my veux lip physics that's really cool to see the thing about alternative physics for this DVD video bouncing 90s screensaver look beautiful let's see what else do we got here bouncing DVD with corner detection and more oh look at this I love this so it's counting the number of collisions the number of corners the corner threshold I guess is like how close does it have to be the size is the size of the logo the speed let's make it go fast all right come on everyone ah would hit the corner I missed it and then changeable speed track and hit the corner detection by temporary pride I like this press T to enable/disable the track of the logo cool scroll the mouse wheel to speed oh I love that I can scroll the mouse wheel which speeds it up or slows it down and background switches if the logo hits the corner logo color switches if the logo hits the edge ah so we know if it hits the corner I'd at the corner if the logo at the edge wonderful okay so thanks for those I'm really trying to spend more time keeping this site up and so each coding challenge has a card first of all thank you to all the people who have contributed to this website this is not a project I made or designed it myself this is a community developed project let me just go to github here and click on contributors and I you know rather than rather than name people I can like just sort of scroll here and we can see a lot of people who have contributed to this website so there's actually another project which is a sort of like coding train website 2.0 that's on the horizon but what I my goal is to really have a place for the community to be able to share work that they're doing and for me to also make sure I'm crediting all the different sources and things that I use so for each and YouTube description works and the playlists work to some extent but this is basically each challenge has a card if I go here I'm gonna go to the DVD logo one or actual let me just go to this Fourier transform one so if I go to the challenge this is the video obviously but you can see here's the code there will be on the my goal is to have p5.js web editor and processing code for each challenge and I know that David Schneider a viewer has made a processing version of this so hopefully that'll get up on the site soon you can download the code see it live I might need it I don't know if that's the right terminology but that will just I'll give you a link to the actual demo run in the browser and then various other things that are related to the video are discussed here and this is the important part that I wanted to highlight this is where you can submit your own version so right now there's no kind of elegant you know web form type thing this is all has to be done through a pull request which can be somewhat daunting and a little confusing how to do that but there are these links will take you to instructions on how to do that and don't be afraid come we are welcoming and friendly in the coding train github repository if you've made something and you have no idea how it's a minute open up an issue say you need help try a pull request don't worry if you get it doesn't work it breaks there's a bug just give it a try I hear this from so many people oh I'm no good at that github thing I wish I could contribute something sometimes you just have to get over that first hurdle and you need people to be there helping you get over that hurdle and so Cody Drake there are lots of other places that our wonderful community is opensource communities helping people to get started contributing I hope that coding train can be one of those so it's just my little pitch to encourage you to contribute okay I'm not using a timer today I will use my Bell live demo yeah live demo probably would make more sense mark sheriff writes in the chat that is a good question on you are been asked do these live streams get saved in the channel yes so let me take you to the coding train on YouTube you can see here that I'm live streaming now if you go back I'm just gonna go to uploads this is everything that's on the Chola I'm logged in and you're seeing my unlisted videos here we switch accounts just for a second I meant to be on oh I don't know everything is all messed up all my accounts and everything are now being shown things are coming up unlisted videos view as okay wait now I'm gonna get ads okay fail to the first fail of today alright here's my chairs my videos this is what you would get if you were not logged in to YouTube and you would see all these different videos what I'm looking for is yes so these are typically what the live streams look like this is live stream number 100 the last one what we're a little bit behind so you can see these are some recent live streams that haven't that don't have like a thumbnail and and a title with a number on them so a little bit behind at that but the live streams usually get numbered and then everything else on the channel is mostly redundant content edited out of the live streams so as always anybody has a suggestion for how I could organize this stuff better you know a lot some people on YouTube have separate channels one for livestreaming one for uploaded content I'm just kind of doing everything all in one channel it's in one place anyway there I'm joking there's nothing there particularly private I will just mention that I make I have some videos that are for a course that I teach at NYU that are unlisted because they're specifically only for that course but they're there just add administrative videos my sort of technique for the way that I do it is when I have content videos for a course I have those public on YouTube okay okay what am I trying to do right so what am i doing today what am i doing today ah so I want to let me pull up the oh my goodness Simon Wow so first let me talk about Simon Simon is a viewer of the coding train I'm gonna do Simon Tiger let me go back to me logged in I'm a search for Simon Tiger and we're gonna get Simon's YouTube channel and we're gonna click over here Simon speaking of processing Community Day and I'm gonna click over here and then go to Mythology hard of mathematics this particular video then I'm going to close this close this and close this so this is a very famous pattern in mathematics called the cardioid there is a video on the mythology YouTube channel which is a fantastic use of do Tube channel about mathematics about using x tables to to visualize this cardioid shape the cardioid shape appears in the Mandelbrot said it appears in diagrams of kind of like patterns there's a an explanation in this video of how you can see the cardioid pattern and I in the top of a coffee cup based on like the way the light bounces off of it and reflects off the coffee all sorts of fascinating stuff here Simon creates Ivan created a created a poster I have which I have downstairs hanging in my office I sure brought it up here to show you visualizing all of the times tables in inprocessing inspired by this particular video and this is Simon giving a presentation about it at processing community de Amsterdam so these are my two inspirations I think vihart also has some videos about the cardioid and about general and generally speaking vihart has amazing wonderful one mind filling soul beautifying videos about mathematics and different types of things so I encourage you to check out the work of thy heart if you don't already I never look at the chat so slow mode is not again not on again I know why I'm forgetting to not put slow mode on in the chat oh well we'll see if I need to we'll see if I need to we'll see if I need to pull this car over kids well of the car over so I would like to do this and so in honor of I'm trying to avoid saying Valentine's Day by just to say Valentine's Day once in honor of tomorrow I would like to make a heart I would like to express my love for processing and we're gonna do that here by visualizing the times tables and get this pattern and I there's a I would like to recreate the animation I'll just click over to it I'm gonna I'm gonna let this play this is masala Jers content not mine a mythology are here I probably just gonna let it play for a few seconds so I'm gonna try to kind of recreate this animation I'm gonna stop it now because I want to be careful about repurposing other content encourage you to go check out the mythology video um but I want to see if I can create my own version of this animation ok we refresh this page refresh this page there we go cardioid there are lots of techniques for creating the cardioid shape this being the most common this is super related to the epicycles video I recently did I don't know if it makes sense for me to make a video just programming this way of generating it but it's useful to see that and then I could also get where's my Mandelbrot set challenge and have that ready to go let's see here here we go let's grab the processing code so what I want see you live let's do that so a little long let's grab the processing code and see what happens here because why would I avoid Valentine's Day the reason I would avoid valentines day because it's a fake holiday to just excuse corporation to sell greeting cards loves is a real thing I embrace hearts and puppies and rainbows and all of those things but not this candy scum rock commerce nonsense it's my okay let's take a look at this alright so in processing I should be able to make this let's try to make this 1280 960 yeah so there you can see the cardioid shape right here and then of course what it's been another half an hour geez Louise got started doing something get my ukulele out again okay why is this let's just do this okay this this I have this I have this okay what's interest what's here what's what machine what is what is machine learning think I should watch next interesting fascinating okay alright so this is legitimately sometimes it's not sometimes it's something that I've programmed hundreds of times not hundred times but several times before but maybe not in years sometimes it's something that I'm completely looking at for the first time and try to code and sometimes it's something that I like practice the day before and then I'm recoding again usually it's this which is like I kind of understand how this works I watched this video a couple times this seems very similar to other things that I programmed how hard could it be but I'm about to attempt this for the first time I have never tried to program this particular visualization I'm definitely going to need the whiteboard camera so should I just say Valentine's Day there's nothing wrong with saying Valentine's Day I'm going to draw a nice heart here I'm going to attempt to draw the p3 logo which kind of looks like a 1 and then it has kind of like a 3 like that I really like like live on YouTube drawing a heart and like my own very poorly drawn version of the processing logo apparently I am ok here we go so let's cycle the camera and let's get started actually I think what I'll do is I'll start with this and what's Oh interesting this is kind of envelope of a pencil of line so this is basically the others as they say the same thing okay okay Oh whoops sorry you can't see me all right I'm gonna start with this on my screen all right here we go Valentine's Day with Pete with processing don't make me get out my ukulele behave chat don't make me get out my ukulele do I have a love song here I have the lullaby that's not where you love song this is kind of lovey lovey dovey all right okay maybe we won't do any music well add some some very impressive music in post all right here we go hello happy Valentine's Day from the coding tree I'm gonna say it once I can be serious for mine hello there's something in my heart that I love and here on this day February 13th although you might be watching this on February 14th there's some other day in the future I want to express my love for processing processing a programming language and environment that started in 2001 created by Casey Risa and Ben fry please read all about the history of processing in the processing foundation it's work right now Crossing foundation org and I forgot to blow my train whistle at least there's no timer right Snape the ACE let's let's move this along people hello I'm here it's February 13th I am feeling the love I would like to express my love for processing my first programming love my one true love process express it by creating this this is a famous shape in mathematics called the cardioid if I'm pronouncing that correctly cardioid like heart it's kind of like a heart and today it might be some other videos after this one where I make all sorts of kind of heart patterns but I just want to make this pattern now if you want to learn more about this shape and where it appears in mathematics I want to point out to you this wonderful youtube channel called mythology mythology has a video called times tables Mandelbrot and the heart the heart of mathematics with mathematics and processing and code and all that sort of stuff now I should also point out that rendering an animation of these times tables in processing has been done before and most notably by Simon Tiger and one of the things I love about processing this year is where there's been this worldwide set of processing community days recently in Amsterdam Simon presented his work on creating this very large poster about the times tables across the community Amsterdam I was just at processing Community Day New York over the weekend and like my heart is definitely full of like love and wonder with all the things people are doing with processing so this video is dedicated to all the people who are working on processing in p5 GS and fellowships and and everything I love you all now everything's gonna go wrong because I'm gonna start coding but you know so this this shape um you know you can find it in looking at the waves light reflects around a circle I mentioned the Mandelbrot set you can see it right here as in this bulb of the sort of like first bulb of the Mandelbrot fractal set is a cardioid shape and it's kind of amazing that it appears in this context of time tables so and then I think we're gonna if you watch the end of the mythology or video there's this like animation at the end then I was just like wow that looks so cool I gotta show it to you now but I'm just gonna program it and hopefully it'll be at the end of this video somehow I'll program it so let me talk about how this works okay so happy happy almost happy February 13th to everybody I love processing okay now let's say and this is good timing because in my course at NYU this week just today we were yes yesterday we're talking about polar coordinate so I'm gonna need to make heavy use of polar coordinates for this particular visualization so we're gonna start with a circle and we are going to divide this circle equally into parts basically almost like a pie chart but the way I'm gonna represent that is just by spacing out equally spacing out a set of dots so I think of the mythology video he starts with 10 that seems like a good number so and probably makes sense from you start here 0 1 2 wait a second I think it's gonna work if I get the three over here right three four five six blades and all we have our first fail record scratch this just just ignore me I'm over here looking at something yeah okay oh that makes it oh yes yes one two one two three four ah okay okay okay let's try that again I have one I have two now I need eight more so I need four along the top and four along the bottom this is for me to get ten so one two three no that's three one two three four one two three four okay I did an okay job there so this is my circle whoa my ukulele this really shouldn't be here what you're saying yeah there's gonna be some interesting editing in this I'm okay everybody don't worry that was it sounded worse I mean if anything my glasses are might be broken I didn't actually get my head into glasses okay all right I have my circle with the evenly spaced out dots so now let me number them zero one two three four five six seven eight nine so I want to do times tables meaning I want to multiply each one of these numbers by two and whatever number I get then I want to connect it to that so two times zero is what zero so that's just 1 times 2 is what so that connects here 2 times 2 is what's 4 3 goes to 6 4 goes to up shoot I'm gonna have an easier time programming this than drawing it that's for sure 4 goes to 8 5 goes to 10 there's no 10 while we wrap around we use the modulo operator so we use the remainder basically if we keep counting like this will be 9 10 11 12 so 5 goes to 10 6 goes to 12 7 goes to 14 and 8 goes to 16 9 goes to 18 etc etc etc yes so you can see here that this shape is sort of starting to emerge I did a terrible job drawing this I feel like there's a mistake somewhere but whatever close enough you get the idea so let's first start by just creating exactly this all right Oh matchy let's edit it let me close these other things out just because I don't need them open I don't need this let's let's save this on the desktop as times tables and let me just add whoops oh I don't want the debugger on let me add void setup void draw let me say size is 6 let's make it a square right 640 640 actually hold on let's just see what that looks like that's pretty good oh my god I'm not in the right camera sorry everybody so why it used to be I swear in an old version of processing wherever I would leave the window it would kind of remember it and then when I would run it again it would end up there but just doesn't do that anymore it really makes me crazy there's probably a way I could modify like you can do like I don't want to get lost in this but just give me a second just curious no this doesn't work anymore I'll have to investigate that all right all right all right so let me start writing some code circle hmm okay so now what I need is I need a number of points so let me call this like this is the sir what's this scale the devised or I know what to call this total points just call it total all right so and I'm gonna make it a float let's keep it as an integer for right now I'm gonna change it to a float in a little bit you'll see why so now I'm going to I need to do a loop and draw all those points I want the center of my visualization I want everything to be well I let everything to be oriented around the center so I'm gonna translate to the center width / 2 height divided by 2 and then this is where that polar coordinate thing comes in I need to figure out the way I'm gonna find all those points is right there are how many slices of pie here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 oh 10 how convenient so each one of these angles is 2 pi divided by 10 so that's how much I need to that's where each one of these points goes so I'm gonna say a delta this sort of like Delta angle I'll just call it Delta equals 2pi divided by total and then another actually another thing that way I could do is I could just use map so I could say angle equals map I which goes between zero and total to between 0 and 2pi it might be an easier way then I'm actually need this Delta and then I need a radius so which is basically I need to know like well how what is the radius of this circle that I'm visualizing and so for that let's just make the radius the width of the window divided by 2 so let's call that R which is the width of the window divided by 2 and then I want to say x equals R times cosine of the angle y equals R times sine of the angle and I will refer you to my video about polar coordinates to understand these particular formula pause for a second I see that there's some super chats flying by thank you so much when I finish this coding challenge I will thank you more properly thank you okay all right and then the next thing I just want to do is draw a point so I'm gonna say I'm gonna make an ellipse fill 255 ellipse at X Y and oh oh thank you Ben fry I'm going to call this circle there's a circle function now 16 I love using these ok so let's see what do I get there we go look you could see there's my 10 dots around the circle now I probably want to be able to see that circle that would be nice too so let me say stroke 255 no fill ellipse and this the translate needs to come before drawing this I just want to draw I know it's a circle it's a circle at 0 0 R times 2 right because the circle function expects the diameter the radius times 2 so now we can see there we go oh I have my circle with all my points now I need to do my math thing all right so I'm gonna have a value I'm gonna call this n so n is going to be what is the x amount that I'm going to multiply each number by so there's total pot there's a lot of different parameters in the system and you can play with them to create all sorts of different kinds of patterns hopefully we'll see some of those by the time I get to the end but right now I'm going to make this a two times table to try to get that heart that cardioid so I'm gonna call that maybe I should call that factor let's call that factor let's I'm gonna put that up here int in factor equals two and I I'm sure there's a nice way I could do all this together but I'm gonna do this as a separate loop so now I'm gonna do this again I mean obviously I'm just reap I I will refactor this later as I like to say but what I want to do is I want to say hey is I like I want to go from point A to point B which is I times factor those are essentially my indices of like where where I'm connecting the lines so 0 goes from 0 1 goes to 2 2 goes to 4 and then I need a function it actually this could be really useful for me to write a function that returns a P vector giving me the giving me a given a P vector for any given index so so get vector for any given index and then so basically I can say the angle is map that index but which goes between 0 and total between 0 and 2pi and then the vector equals a new P vector at and this should be a global variable R I cannot set the width up here because it doesn't know what the width is so I'm gonna make this R here and then I'm gonna say R equals with / I couldn't make that an argument to this function but just gonna keep that as a global variable make a new P vector R R times cosine actually P vector class has something in it P vector from angle angle that'll make the vector pointing in that direction and then I just want to multiply it by the R to set it to be that and then right so I'm using some vector stuff here which I realized is now maybe a little bit beyond the scope of if you were coming to this video just without knowledge of how the P vector class works in processing or in p5 which is a p5 vector it's just an object that has an x and a y so it's a nice way for me to store the X and the y together and I can make the x and y components from an angle and then I can scale that by multiplying it by some radius so it's really it's really got that sort of polar coordinate thing built into it so when I multiply it by r and say return R and then actually since I'm here refactoring this I could say right here P vector V equals what did I call that function get vector based on I and then I should be able say V X V dot Y so I basically just took that code and put it into a function because I'm probably gonna need to do this quite a bit I don't want to return our I want to return V well this is liking what I'm doing so far I think this might actually work okay so now I want to say get vector for I and then get vector for I times factor but guess what it's not just I times factor right what so first of all why oh this should be a peeve Ector this should be a PE vector so it's not just I times factor although I guess I could rewrite this function it depends on where I want to put this actually I'm gonna put it here so I need somewhere to deal with the fact that when I do 6 times 2 I get 12 but I really just want to because 12 divided by 10 is 1 remainder 2 so 12 modulo 10 is to the modulo operator which I have a video thank you goal 11 about modulo is also linked now up there somewhere in a corner of this screen okay so now right here I could just add that here modulo total okay all right so I don't think I'd actually drew those lines but this is still working that's there now I should be able to a line a dot X a dot y bx b dot y there we go it's backwards well why is that I mean it's not backwards oh because I started over there interesting so a couple things I could do I could just call like the scale function to flip it the other way I mean what's backwards what's forwards who knows I'm just saying in terms of watching that mythology or video it was oriented the other direction I also feel like our she needs to be a little bit smaller than the actual size of the window so let's make our equal like let's give it a little bit of buffer like 16 pixels that's a little bit nicer to see again my my visual talent skills are so nonexistent and I know people are watching this word designers and with artistic vision and you will make something beautiful out of this and I can't wait to see so ah ah aha I saw a chat message to go by which is really quite smart which is that I could just hear if this is the angle right this is the angle all I have to do is just if I wanted to start on the other side I can just add PI being 180 degrees so if if I'm starting with the angle here which if this is zero if I always just add PI I'll get here if I'm here I'll get there not type of thing and when I say PI I mean the number pi not a delicious blueberry vegan blueberry pie okay have to blow my nose where my tissues it's dripping okay all right let's give this a try oh it looks right okay now now we're getting somewhere so but the mythology uses the number 200 I'm just gonna let's go to 20 and see what we get Lou that's kind of interesting let's go to 200 Wow there we go mwah what there is the Cardiac oh that is like beautiful just on its own and by the way what's interesting about this is this is very similar if not precisely the pattern you would see if there were a light source here and reflected or bounced around this particular this particular circle so okay all right oh it needs to be red it needs to be orient the other way need to have like an arrow through an example baby Cupid flying by lots of things all right but I want to make this animation so there's a there's a bunch of different things we could do for example this this could be a variable so let's just look at that really briefly just to see I'm gonna say float I'm gonna make it a variable here equals 200 or I'm gonna say sorry int total equals map mouse X I'm going to take the map function Mouse X goes between 0 and width and I'm going to map that between 0 and 200 and then I'm going to convert that to an integer so now as a whoops oh so then good point this let's have this take a total and then the get vector function should have the total passed in maybe there's a different way of doing it but now we can see basically based on the number of circles we can see as I move the mouse left and right that increasing so that's one way I could animate this I think it's probably us to decide like a different way of animating this which I will get to in a second I think is probably more interesting and it's varying the factor like what happens if this is a three times table by the way we could just try that right now so let me make this back to 200 and let's make the factor 3 look at that interesting now by the way I die I shouldn't do this but I'm gonna try this let me go to the mandelbrot code okay now the mandelbrot code creates this pattern why it creates this pattern because of this formula Z equals Z squared plus C why is there an M there the kupets what if I change this to a three that would mean oh that's gonna change I can't do that so easily without it I need a complex number library this is about I thought like oh I could just in my head I was like I could just do this that's interesting okay I'll come back to that later maybe we should this is this is the math for squaring the complex number and I would have to like rewrite this entirely okay so this won't this won't make it nephrite thank you this won't make it in the final edit for this I'm looking at the chat okay all right nice idea but I'll I'll come back all right breaking news I'm being told toward from the chat that this shape is called a nephrite so this is an F roid and if I would go to say factor for look what I've got now so this and interestingly enough we could actually make these floatingpoint numbers let's just see if I have to change anything in my code if I do that I'm going to I think but let's see so I'm gonna do this alright so immediately we're stuck here like oh these are no longer integers so what if I make this a float and this a flow list of everything B floats there we go that work let's let's be sure about this right so that was factor 3 let's try factor 2 point 5 yeah this is looking like I should look so this is actually doing these same exact math but it's allowing for the spaces in between so what if I have two point two that could should connect to four point four and we can do modulo also because seven point one would connect to fourteen point one modulo 10 would still be sorry seven point one kick to fourteen point two modulo ten would still be a point four four point two so this works with floating points and now we can create that animation and so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make this the global variable factor I'm going to start it at zero and then I'm just going to slowly over time say factor plus equals 0.01 interesting oh there's the cardioid there's the nephrite isn't that lovely and beautiful and amazing I just I just love this now think of the possibilities I have done the most basic thing to just create this animation and at some point it's gonna get it's like really crazy stuff it's gonna start to but there's so many other parameters there's ways you could think about color here I'm gonna make a JavaScript version of this that will run the browser that I will publish that you can look at which is basically exactly the same code I could look at this forever I hope you enjoyed this dedication longdistance dedication to my true love the heart of mathematics and processing no wait wait I don't want to go just yet I'd love that it just keeps going it's like never stops so what I want to do actually before I leave besides to make it all rainbow coloured is I wanted to show you this is a nice way to increase the factor but I want I'm gonna make another video that's about making a perfect gift loop and I think this is an opportunity for us to make a perfect gift loop so where would be a part that matches up so one thing I could do with this this this factor oh so one thing I could do with this factor is they like map it to a sine wave so for example what if I have a variable called T which is gonna be like I'm gonna keep track of time and I also have a variable called like DT which is like my time step and maybe I'll just go up by 0.1 and so what I want to do is factor equals map the sine of T which comes out to negative 1 and 1 between 0 and 200 oh yeah we go all the way up to 200 I don't know how high we should go there but let's try it let's try it up to 200 and then T plus equals zero point one so this would now have the factor value not just increase over time but smoothly oscillate with like an easing function a sine easing function there's lots of other easing functions you can use all the way up to 200 and all the way back down to 0 which would be a perfect loop so let's try that it's a little bit too fast well maybe 200 was too high let's have it just go up to 50 still whoa okay so I have to figure out what makes sense here five there we go so you could do that hit five and now it's coming all the way back down to zero and back up to five so I don't know that I've hit on this exactly right let's make this go up to 20 let's have tea go up even slower why does it starting oh because sign no sign of zero is zero opposite over adjacent oh no no it starts at zero so Oh weird I wanted to start at zero so let's make this what happens if I give it a negative number I'm just curious I was interesting so I'm just seeing what's happening it's going all the way up to 20 let me just actually have a go too oh wait yeah interesting that's weird within what it does with the negative so I don't want the negatives so here's this is the simplest hopefully the lot of stuff just got cut out there I was confused the issue was sign goes between negative one and one you know all you need to do is have time start at like poem hopefully there was a little edit point there what might what it wasn't doing what I wanted to do because I wanted to start with times table 0 but sign of 0 while it is 0 is then in if I'm mapping between the range negative 1 1 it starts at 1 so I could just change this to cosine because that would start at this is that would start at negative 1 or it actually starts it sorry yeah no it starts at 2 sine of sine of what is negative 1 I should know this right let me just show you how I figure this out it's PI over 2 R like group right so why did this not come on because so one of the things I love about thing about sine is like Y is sine as Y is sine of the angle Y is sine of 0 0 degrees 0 well if this is the angle sine is opposite over adjacent or I could I could call this the Y in this the hypotenuse or something so Y divided by H and imagine as this angle gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller like this eventually the if the angle is 0 the length of this side of the right triangle sine Roy trying anymore is 0 so even though the hypotenuse is whatever it is 0 divided bat so sine of 0 is 0 now sign of what is 1 well if the the angle 90 degrees right the angle were 90 degrees than that that side of that right triangle basically which isn't a right triangle anymore it would be equal to the hypotenuse so it's 1 so 90 degrees is 1 so it must be like negative 90 would be negative 1 right so if I start it at like if I just say print line print line sine of negative PI divided by 2 negative 1 right so that's where I want to start so I'm gonna I'm gonna make this have some continuity here oh wait did it just work by accident no I don't know what's going on anymore why did it start at 0 use trig circle yes a units big circle would be better I always think in weird ways though trig circle would tell me better oh because you're so weird just let me just I've ruined this video it's going so well this is what I want oh that's okay zero everything connects to zero I actually wanted to start at one as I want it to be it doesn't actually matter I was I was thinking that zero makes everything you see nothing but I'm totally wrong about that when the factor is zero everything connects back to zero when the factor is 1 you see nothing so in a way I actually want to start at 1 which is no no no applause please I want to start at 1 which is pi divided by 2 or but how come that oh that's starting at 2 so negative 100 it's actually perfect I had it right all along it just was like such a high number whatever I should have gone gone with this let me just go back I'm gonna like ignore that I thought this will like an interesting idea you think it's just it happened so fast at the beginning so in a way I wanted to this is not the sort of like oh because it starts at 5 when it's zero to two it's always in the middle so I want T actually to very specifically I see I get it now I get it now I always want if I always want it to start at one I always want to start it at whatever sigh whatever this number is / I always wanted to be 10% of the in this case so if we're 20 I would need this to start it this is so silly what I'm doing I don't think I'm right now I'm mostly just alright so let me think about this more for a second so this could actually I could actually have this be a number so I always want the starting point to be whatever so I can just do arcsine right so for example if I were to say let me just figure this out for a second if this were factor max factor is 20 right then what I want is and this would be max factor this is no longer a global variable T should start at arcsine of Max Factor / right I'm trying to think about this sign of T 0 to 1 1 to 20 oh that's a smart way of doing it yes it would be so much easier if I just multiplied Max Factor by sign or if I add one cosine of T plus 1 that's a good solution you know I was doing so well and then I then I went off I'm too many tanned that's an interesting idea let's try that no map okay hold on I can work this out so many ways to do it on 0 to 2 and 1 Damien no that's not gonna work use frame that set location in the draw function that's interesting hold on I want to make this start always at wherever it's going up to this is so silly it's lonely do it this way because this will be an easier way to think of it factor equals sine of t plus 1 times max factor and then this is the same thing I had before but if I'm just getting rid of the map function to think this through all I could do from C that's actually a really good idea right because the map function doesn't care if I say map sine of T with a range between 0 and 1 and I always want to start it whatever whenever it's 0 I want it to be 1 Max Factor yeah there we go yeah that's that's what I want yeah ok I don't know why I couldn't couldn't think of that so what did I have before yes okay sorry sorry for that digression everybody lost my mind there for a minute it's very hot very stressful to do this in front pool I bought all right I'm I'm back I I went off on like a hold down a whole rabbit hole of like figuring out something which was actually quite simple which is that I was wondering why it wasn't starting what I wanted it to do I wanted to start I wanted to start like this if I put this at two I want it to start where the factor is one I want the factor to be one because I want it to sort of start in this loop with it always at with with you just seeing the outer circle and if everything is multiplied by itself then zero connectors are one we have no lines but if I increase and this works if I'm going between zero and two because sine of 0 is 0 and in this mapping function I end up with 1 but if I were to change this to 0 to 3 then it's starting somewhere else so that's not what I want and actually a trick that I can do with the map function is I could just sort even though the range is really negative 1 to 1 it's gonna figure out what to do even with something negative so I can actually make tell it the range is from 0 to 1 and then but whenever sine of T is 0 it should always equal 1 and then go up to like 20 that should work although it's really fast if this is just like way too fast still pretty fast but that's because I'm going so high let's just go to five I just want to see like a smoother animation there we go this is what I'm looking for so you can see start at zero and it's sort of like coming up to four of those little bulbs and then back down to zero and then back up so Oh tea is supposed to increase by DT ah whoops yeah I don't know why I made this DT variable and then didn't use it oh there we go I was also a mystic DT that whole time so I could control it and we could probably make this 20 now yeah and we could sort of see there we go this is a little bit better so I just wanted to see it's sort of like smoothly breathing animation that Luke's so it's going to go all the way up and back down I know this video was going so well at the beginning and became a bit of mess here at the end but I am really excited to see what kinds of things do you create from this the heart of mathematics the cardioid shape thank you for watching and I'll see you in a future coding challenge goodbye so really slows down is it good up there isn't it in fact sweeping negative 5 to 5 ah I think you're right hmm all right let's let's do let's let's understand how this works I should really do this in like right if sign whoops if I get the value one sorry if I get the value zero zero this should print I should see a 1 that's exactly what I want if I see the value 1 I should see a 5 what if I get met do negative 1 negative 3 yeah so I this isn't really right the problem is so there's a nicer way to do this which is I could just say all right I could have T start at negative PI divided by 2 and map sine of T yeah that's what I want what's wrong with me this is what I want or I could use cosine because cosine will start at zero I don't need to go back down to zero cosine of zero is no cosine zero is not negative one so yeah okay well we redo that again ah this is even like simpler than what I had sorry Mathieu negative cosine oh you you smart people in the audience I'm gonna do it cosine starts at one I know so I could map it from 1 to negative 1 there's so many ways there's like a hundred thousand different ways I could do it it's actually not that complicated I've just lost in my own thoughts here which is the thing that seems to happen a lot ok all right there's a weird edit point this is actually working the way I want it to work but it's not starting at the right spot like let me just run this again it kinda like starts in the middle and I want it to start where I wanted to start where the factor is 1 because I want all the points to connect to themselves which is what I don't see anything because I don't see any lines because every line is drawn from the point to the point so actually there's a really simple way to deal with this which is that sign I'm at T starts at 0 and sine of 0 is 0 so like the factor is actually starting at 5 here because if I'm in the middle of the range that I'm about I know I'm just gonna change this range I don't I don't care about the range between 0 and 1 actually for the purpose of the animation so I start the range at 1 and then sine of what is negative 1 it is negative PI divided by 2 so I gotta just start at negative PI divided by 2 which will mean sine of 0 will be at negative 1 and then you should see this there we go so it starts I want this to loop all the way up to this number of Bowl however I'm going up to 10 and then all the way back down to 0 so now I have some stuff that I could play with in terms of like oh I could have this go up to 50 I could change DT to be like twice as fast and I don't know it's way too fast probably to like get the effect of the animation yanks but you get the idea sorry for how crazy that looked let's make this do this like even slower see it start to form so this will now be a nice slow animation all the way up until 50 I'll take this out I am excited to see what you make out of this what happens when you think about the geometry in a different way you think about rendering this in a different way you think about color you think about multiple dimensions you think about different styles of animation what if you like we're actually like draw all the lines as there's so many possibilities here I hope you explore this and make your own version of the cardioid to express your love for somebody on this day on our every day of the year thanks very much and I will see you in a future coded challenge yeah three pie divided by two equals negative one but it's the same it's the same thing it can be negative right all right now with colors I'm gonna let everybody make their own version of this let me just quickly put this in the web editor so we have it but I actually kind of this didn't like the looping of this didn't work the way I kind of imagined it would so I think I might actually prefer to just leave it at I mean this I think this actually was a nicer animation to be perfectly honest hey Espen Larsen joined as a new member Espen Larsen is the creator the singer the composer of no I'm not leaving that was just the end sine squared from 0 to PI that's interesting all right sorry this is like way too much fun to watch I feel like I want to do this actually I want to do this oh it's slow interesting uh why is it slow let me sorry I just I can't help myself let me just like play with this for a little bit just a little bit longer before I go into the next coding challenge I feel like these circles are which ones are unnecessary will I get just as much value out of like fewer lines I just want to I just want to give it a little a little something and what happens if I do this with hardware acceleration there we go all right let's take a little break and let this play I'll do some thumbnails okay so let me let me do some thank yous I'm here where where is this thank you to Israel ah hoo ho sorry thanks for your passion I learned a lot with you thank you to otaku's thank you welcome to new member akre technologies and new member Espen Larsen so let me just say so membership wise there is a join button on YouTube I also have a patreon if I'm constantly thinking about whether I'm gonna keep the patreon or not but I don't have a lot of benefits for people who join as members I do mail you a sticker or not a cigar a bunch of coding train stickers you can see some of them here and and then I sometimes do live streams where I'm trying to like test out an idea or fix something that will just be for members only that's pretty rare wouldn't count on that and then we have a slack channel so again I should mention that if you if you have recently joined as a Youtube member but you don't have a slack invite check the community tab and there's it's probably just I'll post me much I post a new one the only way I can get you a slack invite us through a Google Form I forgot another way to do it so so to ekor technologies and Espen sandal Larsen hopefully I can get you your slack invite soon okay the song by the way is manfred writes you've got to make this song long longer there actually is a full version of the song on Spotify that you can find but and I will ship the stickers anywhere internationally it's very inexpensive to send something in the I mean it just costs a dollar or two so I'm very happy to send you the stickers wherever you are in the world the thing that I have a problem with is I don't get to it very quickly and so sometimes you have to bug me a little bit about that and I apologize for that you shouldn't have to but um you know if yeah so okay it's just by the way what's interesting is it just still going I should really put what the factor number is this would be interesting too let's just do this for a second text factor number four minute number format by the way is a function and processing that will control the number of decimal places you show and so we can go like this whoops Oh text is a little weird and PGD will this work whoops oh I forgot because I am so now we should see that's the factor up in the top left so we'll see that's kind of interesting to see what number it is by the time it gets to different patterns so you can see that's five usually the number of bulbs is one less than number six all right so what else am I gonna do today it is noon I've got another hour so in me here oh oh I want to do the I definitely want to do the next thing I want to do is the gift loop thing okay so if to think about this I just like letting this run can I let it run in the background while I do other stuff yes so let's look for hold on I've gotta find some messages sent to me from goal on 11 just sit here no oh it's cuz it's not with the G this is good and this is good okay I'm looking for this I also looking for Saskia where's the best way is it tumblr yeah okay and what's this No this and then there was something else when I'm looking for gift loop gallery okay interactivity and computation if loop gallery I think this is what I'm looking for okay awesome ohho I love this that's really great I love all these okay okay so I think I am ready for the next coding challenge where are we now we're up at factor equals 75 Simon and Simon's poster I wonder how many go up to Max Factor then reverse the sign of DT and you get back to zero and then reverse again yeah whoa it's interesting how it sort of comes back to what it was of course at the beginning okay all right right yeah a slider would certainly be an option okay so let me just I just want to put this back yeah I'm just getting the code into a place where I can release it fine all right great okay okay let me just look at let's look at Golan's code for a second so I want to make like a simpler version of it but it's super good to see so let's look at this one if I run this alright so this is what it's doing so the technique here the technique here is to have a counter that basically goes from 0 to 1 that's like a percentage complete of the loop it looks like and there's a you specify like the total number of frames so like if I change that to 500 it's really the same thing but it's just running slower because there's like more frames if I change this to 50 we'd see it like this ok and then then this will start recording it so if you're recording it you compute always computer percentage and then you oh you call like a render function with that percent that's pretty interesting and then it takes a percent between 0 1 and then there are two different graphical techniques for example like this spinning thing and Hutt's % times 2 pi that makes sense and then transformations a percent times 2 pi times negative 0.25 interesting linearly moving percent plus 0.5 modulus one map percent for 0 to 1 okay that's like linear sigmoid aliy moving pink square function double exponential sigmoid Oh fascinating oh I see there's all these different easing functions mmm how much do I want to get into all this traveling sine wave % that's super interesting ok ok alright so easing functions yeah so like different easing functions you could use got it okay okay I think I have used cosine square what's that okay so I think I'm ready to give this a start all right all right let's let's get this going okay hold on erase this I really want to adjust my Mandelbrot code to being able to do to be able to do the complex numbers to like the third power the fourth power that should be an interesting thing to do so maybe I'll get to that at some point let me just check the chat here oh my goodness I forgot to record this to disk it's fine we'll have to get it down from YouTube but I need to do some green screen thumbnail shots later oh sorry Matt shoot what's here's a hint for you what's this I don't know what's going on here oh this is something happening in the chat that's not look the quality on this live stream was hopefully okay because I'm gonna have to when I edit this together it's gonna when Matt gets it it's gonna have to be the YouTube archive that gets edited because I forgot to hit record to disk use a tan to to get angle and modulus to get length and maybe the chat is discussing something that has nothing to do with me right now I need to to to move along I'm saying lag was it lagging before hopefully it'll be fine hopefully it will be fine all right anyway I'm recording this to disk now so everything else from now will be okay what I want to know is it was not lagging during the challenge okay great okay great all right well we can always fix some things in post by like overlaying the visuals if we have to but I'm gonna move on all right okay I get that as lagging theirs let me just check the my yeah bad it's so that I don't know it says the stream status is currently bad I don't know what to do about that all right all right here we go hello I am here today to do a coding chit chat oh my god I think I have to minimize the chat yeah try it slow mode I don't know hello I am here today to make a coding challenge about making a perfect well whatever I make won't be perfect but you might make something perfect gift loop so what does it gets loop why am I talking about gift loops so one way that artists who work with computational media and computer graphics are distributing their work and and and expressing themselves is through posting gifts to various different online platforms an artist I would like to highlight is Saskia freak who has been making daily animated artworks for quite a long time in fact maybe there have been at least 1500 of them which is mindblowing and you can see a whole variety of them here on her tumblr there's some other I think she would a medium article about this process they're amazing a very famous gift artist that I have referenced in previous videos if I did a whole coding challenge trying to recreate his cube wave is cube wave is bees and bombs so bees and bombs creates looping gifts through algorithms and math and graphics in all sorts of astonishing mindblowing ways so I encourage you to check out bees and bombs also tumblr to see all of the kinds of gifts that he has created I'm goal on Leben at Carnegie Mellon University professor Carnegie Mellon University gives an assignment every semester in his course interactivity and computation to create a gift gallery and so these create a gift and this is a gallery of gifts that students made in his course just this past fall and Golan has a lecture about loops throughout the history of art you know all it's very easy to think as we work on programming computer and make algorithms visual and happen in javascript in the browser with your open GL shaders WebGL magic that this is the first time any doesn't happen but this kind of work has been happening for years and years and predates the dawn of computers themselves so this is a wonderful set of historical references to different kinds of Luc's that people have been making and of course here's the iconic Muybridge galloping horse that you can see here so I encourage you to check out all of these resources read about loops and in fact you don't even need to watch this video you can go right here to gold ons Luke templates which has templates for Java I'm sorry processing Java p5.js JavaScript and Python processing as well so what I'm gonna do though in this video is I'm gonna make my own I'm not worrying about making something artistic or innovative or beautiful I'm just gonna try to show the process from start to finish of writing code in processing rendering it out to files and then compacting that up as a gift that you could post I'm also gonna come back and do a follow up video there's a new p5 JavaScript gift library that some students of mine worked on last semester in a course about open source and so I will come back and show that in a future video as well so let's get started so what is the driving principle of making a loop so if you look at Golan's code examples the core idea is to have to have first a total number of frames so a gift an animation is just rendering a whole bunch of images in sequence at some framerate for your eye to see and it appears like animation and if whatever it is in the last frame or really what would be the last frame the sort of like frame before the last frame matches up exactly with the first one then you have a loop so in other words if I'm drawing a circle here and then it goes to here and then it goes to here I don't need that many frames and then it goes to here and then maybe it disappears I have a blank frame then in theory the next frame I want to see it would be it entering the screen that but instead I go back and show the first one so this will look like it's a loop that's going on forever whereas reality is just starting at the beginning and the last frame matches that and so as it goes back to the beginning it appears infinite so this is the idea so one couple things we need to do we need to keep track of like what is the total frames we want so we're going to need some sort of variable like total frames like in this case I want to have one two three four five and I'm really going to use the number six because I'm not gonna I'm gonna read this is zero zero one two three four five wait hold let me think about this if I don't want to render out the last frame but the idea has six anyway Oh everything's gonna be okay just take a break take a deep breath am I supposed to look at the chat now and probably everybody saying aye why does he look at the chat I can tell that's what's in the chat I didn't have to look at the chat to know everybody the chat is that just me look at the chat I'm gonna go look at the chat oh no I knew it I knew it I knew what this would happen I knew enough to pull this car over I'm pulling this car over Giff with a G some people like to say good and some people like to say yeah but I like to say good but I don't mind and if people say because we can all where's my dad where's my pen the G is silent if I think that's a good way pronounce it if I lost my pen my marker and I have to go I have to go be a human being somewhere else in the world today how come I lost that marker I have a sweater I have like a keyboard I have oh here's a marker is this the marker I was using maybe all right I don't want to get lost in the details of the total here let's just say the idea is that the animation itself has six frames 0 1 2 3 4 5 into that's the frame count and then I might not include the last frame 1 actually stitch it together because the last frame like is really back to the first frame again but the point is the total number of frames need the total number frames and then I also want to have a variable called percent and the idea is that percent will always be the current frame count will be in the current frame the current frame number divided by the total number of frames and what you'll see in Golan's example let's do the same thing is if we have the the ubiquitous processing draw loop draws looping over and over we could actually put our code somewhere else like maybe I'll write a function called render and we would just call that function render passing in the percent so this is a fun that knows how to render some kind of design based on what percentage of the way through the design it is and as long as the design is his is thought of in a way where the end matches the beginning then this is going to work out all the other stuff about like saving frames and all that kind of is it recording is it not recording that could be in the draw loop okay this is way too much explanation because it's in essence like quite a bit quite a bit more simple but there's something to say that it was the king of yeah why there's two more things I want to say about this one is Golan writes in his instructions as student sketch on paper first so I really recommend you you do that if this is something you want to create try working this out with crayons markers charcoal pencil that's a really helpful going into that sort of like analog drawing process will really help you think through your ideas number two is what are the kinds of algorithms that move a value from one number to another number and in fact maybe like by the wrap back around and there are all sorts of different kinds of ways of doing this um probably yours if you've watched any of my videos before you might be thinking of the sine function the sine function is an excellent function to use for a gift loop because if it's start as a sine function if I were to graph the sine function right it sort of it where it starts it and it repeats it's a repeating pattern over and over again you could also use and then there's a ton of different kinds of easing functions so there's this lovely website called easing functions easiness net which is an easing function cheat sheet and I highly recommend you explore some of these other easing functions to think about how you might move a value through this loop and if you go to Golan's code I'll just click on the click on the processing one for a second you can see like even in the code here there is a this like double exponential sigmoid easing function so anyway that's a that's a like exports you can do separately from this video let's just get the basic mechanics working so for example I'm gonna go back to processing actually let me make a new sketch where do I have a sketch already whatever like a new sketch what I call it gif gif loop sometimes I just like start to MI at two hours yet once I get to two hours like I stopped being so I like reading the chat sometimes all right so I have a blank processing sketch now and I'm going to go set up I'm gonna draw I'm gonna I'm gonna let's let's make it a square like 400 by 400 let's make the background zero ah but no no no no let's make another function called render and this function is going to take a value like percent and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say render percent I'm gonna say the percent is the by the I'm gonna I'm gonna make my own variable called counter divided by the total frames so this means I need to say like okay well I want to have a hundred and twenty total frames in this gif I want to have a counter equal to zero and now here what I'm gonna do let's just do something like say the ellipse an ellipse is at % x with this would be a linear function now at height divided by 2 and which is like 20 by 20 so we can see now if I say counter plus plus and I'm going to say afloat let's just see if this works for a second so this is the idea that I have a total number of frames I have a counter that's gonna go up and I really want it after I I want to start the counter at zero and then count up by one after render and this the idea here is that a much more complex sophisticated design with all sorts of different kinds of easing equations could be in here but let's just see if this works I have some brackets out of place what so I have some weird extra slash here so let's see what happens there we go so we can see it's moving across it's almost like the ball is moving because it's being drawn based on a percent now how do i how would I determine how I want to render this so if I'm record like I'm just gonna have mine start recording right when the program starts so if you look at goal lines examples a bit more sophisticated you press a key it starts recording but here what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say right here save frame gif pound pound pound pound which are hash PNG and I'm gonna I'm gonna make a folder called output so what this function does is it saves an image to the directory output associated with this processing sketch as a PNG those hash symbols or pound symbols indicate to processing that you don't you want the file name to be numbered based on the frame count hmm I'm gonna do this a different way oh because I'm I want to use my own counter this is going to use the automatic frame count which is probably fine but what I want to do is I'm gonna say plus number format counter 4 + PG so I'm gonna add the counter number in here manually I think that's gonna be all about this number format function says use four digits no matter what I guess I can just use three because I know I'm going to have a hundred 20 frames only need three dot PNG and then what I could say is if counter equals total frames I'm gonna just basically say exit here so I'm gonna tell the program to stop so let's run this okay now let's look it I have a folder called output I look in there and we can see there we go I have all my images so these there are tons of ways now I could take this and stitch it together as a gift let's actually do that really quickly so for example I'll pause for a second sorry I'm looking at the chat okay I'm trying to say if I want to do this I'm not gonna do the stitching now okay so I'll show you how to do the stitching later in fact this new p5 library actually will just create the gift for you too but it's kind of nice to have them as separate images and we do have this question of like do I have it matching up correctly like we should see the last one should be 119 and it's there so you know my algorithm is perhaps like not the best like really like this percent times width isn't really like a perfect loop so that's something I might need to improve but let's let's make something that I know will be a perfect loop so for example one thing that I could do now is I could say alright let's let's use rotate so I'm going to say angle equals percent times 2pi and i'm going to translate to the center of the window I'm going to say wrecked mode Center I'm gonna say no stroke I mean no fill stroke weight too and then I'm gonna say rectangle at zero rotate by some angle rectangle lets you square square at zero zero with a side length of 100 so let's look at this what just happened no fill o stroke to 55 and this should have a fill of 255 so now we can see this is spinning now in theory that's gonna match up perfectly because that rotation at 2pi equals the rotation at zero and I'm rendering the very last frame right before percent would be one in which case it would actually be 2pi so this should match up perfectly so let's now I'm going to comment this out let's do this one more time let that spin stop now let's actually make it a gift all right so I need to look up really quickly I need to look up really quickly how I would um what's the let me just look oh I think it's on Golan's homework assignment like some recommended websites like easy gift or something I guess I could just Google one I just want to find like a reputable gift stitching website gif I mean you could do it in Photoshop but I don't want to I don't wanna use Photoshop gifts tip it open source gifts somebody's going to recommend one for me Oh posted assignments okay let me look prices ins I'm sorry I'm looking at a different computer right now tips for making gifts gift maker dot me let's try gif maker dot me giffy I like but the giffy tool just lets you capture it so let's let's go to gif maker dot me yeah let's just do this okay all right so I picking just this website that was recommended on Golan Levin's page gif maker dot me you can also make a gift for the Photoshop their countless all include some other resources of how you can do it but what's nice about here is I can click this upload images and I can go to the desktop to this gift loop and oh whoops hold on that's this sketch oh I didn't even save it oh my god I'm such a loser hold on hold on let's delete that and let's go to the desktop let's run it and I can click upload images I can go to the desktop I can go to my processing sketch called gif loop I can find this output folder and then I can just do select all hit open and it is uploading all the images oh I'm putting my gift out of the oven it's ready ding yes all right and now you can see look I have this control panel which lets me do stuff and change the animation speed and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla create gif animation what do I do now download the gif and then I go here let me find it oh it's so slow so let's uh there must be animation speed does that make it faster or slower laughter like look at this no slower oh yeah oh I see so hold on so we can see the gift here it's actually like running really really slow that's because if these animation speed is set at 200 milliseconds in between each frame so if I change this to like 10 maybe even just like 2 unless maybe too fat let's make that 5 there's a 10 there we go so we can see that looks good now can you see is that a perfect loop looks like a perfect loop to me so now I should be able to do create gif Craig if Craig if and then hit download the kif sorry was there and then if I look at it in finder know what let me just why it does not work you the gift no it's still so slow why why am I not able to get that speed if i refresh this is it let's try that again the Skippy cricket hold on hold on so there's the gift maker on giffy which I use but I thought oh let's do this alright I'm ready to make my gift now and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use a giffy has a gift maker here at goofy calm slash create slash gift maker and I can add multiple images to create a gift slideshow oh I'm making a slideshow I have no idea so I'm gonna do this by the way I'm arty my finder is already pointed to this folder but basically I just need to find my processing sketch which is here on the desktop under gif loop I saved everything into output and then so now if I click here and do command a4 select all and open it is now uploading all my files look at this oh this is so cool so now I could see all of the images and I could probably I could delete some I could I could change them so I could do something like editing here and then if I want the whole thing to be one second interesting so like I could change this is it giving me like a preview that's the preview oh this is very very slow oh I want each image to be one second I do not want that so if I want like 30 frames per second then I want each image to be oh I just have to use the slider well is that like the only options I get I can only do ten frames for a second seriously it doesn't let me have any more control over it than that that's not good I guess that's kind of reasonable to do but I want to have more a faster frame rate well let's at least see if this works continue to decorate Oh 15.9 duration exceeds a master maximum of 15 seconds well no so this is the disc gift makers no good apparently we need to the old website was better alright let's go back to that no wonder goal on didn't recommend this one alright here we are can I just drag and drop it by the way just curious if it lets me do that no that would be nice wouldn't it all right I found this website thank you to the recommendation from Golan gif maker dot me there are so many different ways you could make a gift you can do it in Photoshop there I will include reach links to other websites that allow you to do this ugh if he has one though it has some limitations I just found out because I just tried it and what I need to do here is click this upload images and basically I want to take this folder and upload all of the images I saved out to that website so I am now going to click upload images and luckily my browser is already into that folder oh I wonder why but you would have to navigate to find it I'm gonna hit command a which does select all open and then now I wait for these things to upload oh it uploaded and now I take my gift out of the oven and present it to you here all right so we can see that it's going it's very very slow so if I want it to be that's because it is the animation speed is 500 milliseconds which I assume is the amount of time for each image and I believe 30 frames per second would be like 16 is that right so if I do that we can see how that looks right so that's like 30 frames per second and then I want to do create gif animation click that please wait a moment then I'm just gonna click view the gif it opens up a new tab that's still really slow right that's not 30 frames per second why is this not working all right let's try downloading it see if that helps so now I've downloaded the gif it's not 30 frames per second is it just that I and it's just like when it's smaller it looks so much faster 16 is 60 yeah 16 is 60 sorry yeah he had sixteen point seven seven probably ffmpeg yeah I should do I was just trying to avoid like ffmpeg cuz it's like a whole thing people have to install gizmo calm easing is that for making gifts or that's for easing change the animation speed before you upload the image last time I use ten yeah I guess I could use Photoshop I just I wanted to use something that everybody could use not everybody will have Photoshop and not everybody all right let's try easy gift / maker that's another one use the gift comm slash maker try number 15 million all right let's try this okay let's try this alright I can't get have things make my oven joke one more time alright you can use yeah we're trying to do something that you don't have to install and you don't have to pay for although these things have like we're doing on ads on them but all right we'll try this okay all right so now that I've made all those images and save them to the output folder I'm going to try stitching them together as a gif I'm using this website called easy gift comm it's must be easy cuz it says so so I'm assuming this is gonna work great but there's lots of other ways you can use Photoshop you can use ffmpeg there's all sorts of different tools software tools you can use to stitch images together into a gif but let's see what happens if I select Choose files luckily for me it's already going straight to my output directory but you'd have to find that on your through the fear your through your finder or whatever operates that's music I'm gonna do select all I'm gonna click open and then I'm going to say upload and make a gif and this is gonna work right look so we can see well look at this we can see all of it the delay is 20 so 20 milliseconds would be I guess that's like somewhere between 30 and 60 frames per second and somewhere here I should be able to say oh I can change the delay time so 60 frames per second would be like 16.7 let's just leave it at 20 loop count loop forever I'm not gonna worry I'm not gonna crossfade frames what's interesting that it has that effect let's try this make a gif oh but have to wait now it's baking the oven very slow oh that's in 1/100 of a second that's not milliseconds okay it says right there on the page in 1/100 of a second one one thousandth of a second is a millisecond so like 32 milliseconds of delay is like maybe around 30 let's make this three we want three one hundredth of a second let's just try that let's see what happens I mean you might want it slower but I want it to kind of like look like how it looked in processing so let me click this again there we go look there's my gift there's my gift is it perfectly looping sort of hard to tell but let's now I should be able to download it I can probably just like right click and do save image as and say put it on the desktop and then I can look at it here and there it is yay okay so you get the idea look what to showed you next I don't know if I really want to show you much more make a gif calm pictures to give okay now all right so you know ultimately the creativity of what you design is really the is is really the thing that I'm hoping that you will discover in yourself to make something I mean I've just made a rotating square but I think in order to be able to explore your creativity you're gonna need the tool you're working with to be a bit more flexible because right now the way that I set this up is it kind of runs it once and then quits but I really want to be able to watch the thing loop and if and then like change the code and run it again and change the code and run it again and then when I'm ready kind of hit record so let's do that this way what I could do that through an interface but I'm just gonna make a boolean variable called record and I'm gonna set that equal to right now I'm gonna set that equal to false okay so what I'm gonna say here is if um I'm gonna say float I'm gonna say float percent equals zero and this is very similar to Golan's if record then I am going to use this counter that I have and and then I am also going to do all this stuff like saving the frame otherwise I am just going to say percent equals float the actual frame count I mean I could always use the counter this is silly I should just always use the counter but frame count modulus total frames divided by total frames and so this should really be this is a little bit goofy but I'm gonna put the percentage around here the parentheses around there okay so let me give myself a little bit more room to look at this code this is a weird I gotta I gotta explain this for a second and why why why there we go okay so what I want to do here is I want to have the frame count always cycle back to zero and I want to which I use the modulo operator and I want then I want to divide that by total frames but I want to convert that into a float and so I don't need these extra parentheses or this parentheses yeah no yes this is what I want sorry about that this is what I want I want to do frame count modulus Topher this is so silly I'm just gonna use the counter for everything there is a built in frame count variable and so really uh so it's really just about what I'm using the modulus or not so now that recording is false this is just going to play the loop forever and ever again and I know that if I ever want to now record it right if I like my design I can go and delete what was there before which I don't have to it'll overwrite it and I can hit I can change recording to true and then I can run it it will do the recording and then it will quit out so there you go you know what there's a mistake here I am recording the last frame and I don't want to let's look at the let's look at the output here yeah 120 I don't want 120 because 119 is the frame right before the starting frame the way that I've coded this so this say frame has to be here so that's a quick fix let me delete that again let me run this here goes record it's going to draw that last one but that's fine now we should see the very last four shouldn't it exit before it does that didn't all right well let's do it this way let's just check if it gets to the end if it gets to the end so frame before the last one then quit and now here we go ah that works I can see just based on where it stopped okay great so this is why why I want the last frame to match up before the first one okay great so there's so much other stuff we could do I could use like a sine wave again I would encourage you to look at different easing functions and try all sorts of different kinds of designs and your only limitation for yourself is that the end matches up with the beginning but matching up can mean a variety of different things because something can leave the window and then enter again so there's as long as the as long as there's a visual continuity your gif will loop so I will come back I will show you also how to do this in p5.js in the browser with a special new p5 gift library that I've been testing thanks to the creators of that library and I'll come back to show that to you in a future video and please share your gift loops we're gonna have them all over the place I don't know coding trained gift loop know what what should it be just share them just look at this video's description I'll explain how to share them good bye thank you it was 120 still there uh hold on and I just didn't delete it let's see let's see I'm pretty sure I deleted it I feel like I need to do this whole video again know then that weird it's even though it exits exit is like it must be asynchronous or something because it's it oh you know what it must say it must say it says exit when you get to the end of draw so draw it's probably more like an indicator like if I really did I wonder if I did like system exit zero or something yeah that worked interesting interesting so the processing exit function let make sure that draw finishes that's an interesting little tidbit make sure that draw finishes where system not exit actually forces the exit gift train but it's like a gift please share your gifts with me hashtag gift train it's like a gift in the rain see you next go to challenge good bye yeah I see what you mean this this is so flawed in so many ways but I'll decide if I need to come back and do this again all right let's make some more hearts oh it's one o'clock let's make a few more hearts oh I could say we returned that's a good idea let's make some more hearts so many hearts let's make some more hearts we can make it a gift loop all right okay all right everybody all right here we go it's time to finish up for this week oh I wanted to talk about the date of course I never get to it I really have to work on that oh my god oh my goodness oh my goodness all right do I need I'm not so sure that I need the board but in case that I do I guess I should erase I think that gift flute video is like kind of useless but we'll see you sometimes I think that and then I just I'm in my own head because and actually maybe there's a lot of stuff that's like new concepts for people okay all right I'm here to make some mathematical hearts look at these formulas if you plot these formulas you get a heart I mean what could be better than that this one here is might be my favorite although this one here is kind of interesting look at this so we could try any of these but I actually want to try something a little bit different here I mean I'm looking at this and I know what formula are there so what I'm about to is no in no way magic whatsoever but I want to try to get a little bit of an intuition for why that crazy formula makes a heart shape and how you might basically design your own parametric equations to generate different patterns so there are a variety of different techniques for this oh look rotated cardioid and we could just graph the cardia I just with like one minus sine of theta oh so many ways it could make the cardioid but let's let's let's go to processing my happy place my love my true love processing can I put like emojis in the in the comments hold on heart emoji Matt you you're gonna edit this part out let's just see if I do copy mmm no I cannot put emojis in the comments it's so sad how do you what did we do before there were emojis like this right okay now that we've gotten that out of the way that was a very important I'm gonna go back to the curb thing so first thing that I want to do is this is going to be a lot easier if I think of everything as oriented around the center of the window so I'm gonna translate the corner of the origins in the topleft then translate to the center by the way this channel I shouldn't call it the kodi train I should just call it here's another example of things you can do with polar coordinates based like every video I make it's the same but maybe that's the theme for this week so now what I want to do is I want to loop around all of the points of a circle you'll see you'll see why it's like I want to basically I want to say float on a four float a which will answer angle I'm gonna start at zero I'm gonna go all the way up to 2 pi and I'm gonna go buy some increment I'm gonna pick that arbitrarily oh there might be reasons why I want to pick different increments at some point so I'm gonna have every angle from 0 to 2pi and I'm also going to make up a variable called R which is kind of like radius let's just go 200 right now and I'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the polar two Cartesian coordinates song autotune and the Internet will fix that for me R times cosine of the angle y equals R times sine of the angle what I want to do here is I'm gonna say no fill and Stroke 255 and begin shape because what I want to do is create my own custom shape based on all of these points oriented around this circular path hopefully this will all start to make more sense to you so then I can call vertex X Y and then I can say and shape and I can run this and you have this a circle I have made a circle the circle and and by the way if I were to change this increment value to something much higher you can sort of well let's make it like much more extreme you can see here like I'm I'm actually just moving around the edges of a circle and if I thought more carefully about like two pi divided by six then I might have a hexagon all sorts of possibilities like that right two pi divided by six there we go nice little hexagon there but this is not what I'm doing I am just tracing the contours of the circle now here's the thing I can start to futz with these equations for example what if I wanted to pinch a little bit hold on pause for a second you can put an emoji in JavaScript sorry I'm seeing some comments of other equations yeah this is the one that I'm doing the system 1 Simon okay sorry all right so what if what I wanted to do is like pinch the shape a little bit so interestingly enough what if I say like cosine of a times cosine of a let's see what that does Oh weird so you could see what that's doing I'm squaring the value so it's kind of squishing it a little bit long the xaxis but of course everything is on the right side because if I square negative I get a positive but I could go to the third power so why don't I say power of cosine of the angle to the third power look at this so you can see that even just doing that gets me this diamond like quality so that could that's really working for the bottom of the heart in a way that's the bottom of the heart but I need to change the top so I need to think about what I'm doing with the Y so again I'm just kind of this is vary in many ways like similar to my Fourier transform epicycles videos there's like conceptually tied here in that I'm messing with the oscillating values as I move around this kind of circular path now let's do something else like let's say well what if I take sine and I multiply the Y value what if I kind of multiply itself by sine of the angle but have like the frequency doubled so if I do this right well that's interesting look what kind of shape I get there hmm what if I multiply it by like a much more extreme amount like five whoa look at that so things are starting to happen and probably actually what would be much smarter for me to try to visually demonstrate this I have to think about this would be to animate the process of this and actually show the separate X and wha X's and Y's moving in similar to the Fourier transform videos but I'm going to kind of move from here and I'm looking over here because I'm I have the actual formula from that Wolfram page that I started with you can sort of see here okay ah look if I have and this is actually using sine 4x + cosine 4 but I think that's just gonna like put it on its side probably but let's let's let's um so let's put some more stuff in here to like think about let's look at this so five times starting with 13 times okay so changing the amplitudes as well so if we do this times a times well let's just give train yes spen it is gift tree I probably should have just put the formula in I don't know why I'm doing it this way I thought this would be interesting classic villain mustache the chat is saying that instead of a heart I've made a classic villain mustache all right I think it's time for me probably just to put the formula in I'm sort of interesting to explore the different possibilities here but ultimately if I'm seeing this equation what I want is third why these interesting numbers right well I'll get to that in a second but let's do cosine of T or minus I don't want to multiply this stuff together losing my mind here so I want to subtract out ah yes so as I'm getting to the top depending okay so this makes sense so let's let's actually put this stuff in let's change this to cosine let's change this to sign right no let's change this to sine sorry let's change this to cosine because I already have done that and then I'm going to say cosine and this is like I've got a 2 a 3 and a 4 2 minus a 3 minus a 4 so you can see what's going on here but I need to see you could see that it's now actually a little bit more squished at that at the bottom then at the top and so what might be interesting here is to think of you know this as well if this is our and then maybe I want R times 2 times this oh look at that because now when it comes to I you can start to see the heart oh but it's upside down so I kind of want negative one times the whole thing because of the way the processing coordinate system is we can say look I've kind of getting a heart there but I've gone to extreme so I should probably get rid of this our thing let's just make r1 and use the actual numbers so we the actual numbers in the formula are 13 5 2 so I can say 13 5 whoops 5 times whoa 13 5 2 and then a cosine of for a just has is not multiplied by any factor so now if I do this let's put parentheses around what am I doing here got too many parentheses here this there we go I look there's the heart and then now I could scale it up by a factor I mean I could just use the scale function but I could have you know basically scale it up by 10 and then I could say negative R times that and there we go so now you have made the heart let's animate it this was very silly my whole like trying to walk into this formula really I just want to like look it up but let's animate it let's have it trace the path of a heart because that'll be really nice so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to create a an ArrayList of P vector objects so if I were doing this in JavaScript this would be a much simpler just plain array and then what I'm going to do is I am going to not have this loop anymore but rather have a global variable called a and I am going to do this same exact thing but I am going to say here that the for loop sorry the for loop will be for every P vector V in the heart draw vertex at V X V Y and then what I'm going to do is each time through draw I am going to make a new vector I'm going to say heart dot add new P vector at some X&Y and then I'm going to increase the angle by a little bit so here we go okay with math I'm so happy my artistic talent is nonexistent but let's at least make the stroke weight a little thicker let's let's add a fill someone give me a nice red color but I feel like it should be like a little bit more a little darker and a little pinkish so let's try that and let's make sure I add clothes here so it closes the shape whoa oh no no no no I do not want clothes I specifically do not want clothes yes that's what I want and now we are making this heart so I challenge you to go and look at these other formulas and try them I'm Simon Tiger has shared with me a ton of other formulism of maybe I'll see if any of those I want to try but you find a formula and make your own heart could you do it in 3d I bet you could make a 3d heart all sorts of stuff and share that with me coding hearts hash tag coding hearts coding love for this wonderful any day of the year we could be making we should be making hearts all day of the year no reason to just do it in February when it's cold outside almost like snow and sleet and everything anyway I love you thanks for watching the coding train and I'll see you soon it looks a little messy at the bottom how dare you yeah it does how dare you insult my heart they think it's probably cuz I have just too many points down there yeah that's better combining this with the fourier stuff would be good here here everybody our is a height divided by maybe like it's four hundred before he got ten so divided by forty let's try that oh this would be a good gift loop let's make the gift loop everybody hold on okay we're gonna make this a gift loop it's winter it's a snowflake yes I see that you have some 3d formulas in yours Simon that is fantastic I don't think I'm gonna get to those today but I really appreciate your your your suggestions you should make them and you should make a video about all your different heart formulas alright hold on hold on okay so hold on it's time for coding train I made this ridiculously terrible video about how to make a gift loop and you should really just go look at Golan Levin's amazing resources and different artists that I mentioned saskia freak and bees and bombs who are doing wonderful things then I made this video which I actually kind of love that makes a heart inprocessing just using like a nice little math formula look at that each time to make a gift loop of the heart for Valentine's Day there I said it's Valentine's Day this is what we're doing alright so first that I need is for this to always end where it started so I have an idea for doing that which is that if what I'm doing is I'm adding these I'm adding the vertices of the heart over and over again when I get to the end all I want to do is start deleting the ones from the beginning so I should go back to that idea of percent so let me actually open up my other so I'm going to open up the gift loop code this is my design so what I need is this at the top I'm gonna go have too many things open oh oh my goodness I need this at the top then I need all my drawing stuff in I should leave that in there I mean oh my Dino I'm standing from the code but I'm just copy pasting from the last one and we get all my drawing stuff and I'm gonna put it in the render function and now the percent the percent is going to tell me what to do with a so that angle I'm gonna have to change legs so let's just first do it this way a equals map percent which goes between 0 and 1/2 between 0 and 2pi so right now if I run this with record and let me let me close this this should just be I've got my gift loop we just move everything out of the way I've got my gift loop here and I want record to false I don't want to record yet so now if I run this we can see it's making the heart oh oh right and then done okay so that's the right idea but it's not looping because ultimately I mean there's a bunch of things I could do because I could say if I record it I mean in a way I'm getting a loop but I want it to like shrink back down to 0 so I need the size so basically I want % I want this to be like actually 1% is between 0 and 0.5 halfway through I want to draw the heart so I'm going to say this is weird but if % is greater than 0.5 is less than 0.5 less than or equal to 0.5 there's probably a better way to do this but I'm going to do it this way right now I'm going to add points otherwise I want to remove the number of points that I've added and I think it actually is just gonna work if I just say heart dot how do I get delete something out of I think if I just delete 0 that'll be like the oldest one as I get so let's try that that removes them all what's going on here oh but I still need to draw I always need to draw it ah so I'm always drawing it no matter what but I'm adding points for the first half and removing points for the second half there we go there's my loop okay so now guess what I should make to add some colors and things oh it should beat people are saying it should beat of course it should be okay okay we're gonna have we're gonna add beating to it okay so there's no reason why the size the size is being controlled by this thing are here so I should say map okay hold on the Wow oh wow no that's a totally separate thing while I'm drawing it ah so hold on so let's so actually let's take this out let's take this so this should this will make it small right right so that makes it small so I can control the size here just while I'm drawing it because I could say R times R times great so now what I want is the R to be so I want an angle to be mapped but the percent between 0 and 1 and maybe between 0 and like 2 pi but like times 4 like I probably want it to like beat like 4 times within just the 1 so I'm going to map that and then our equals map of sine of that angle which goes between negative 1 & 1/2 between like height divided by eighty to height divided by forty so I think this would like map the Sun whose size to a sine wave and the angle is getting mapped from the percent and so this would be and it should be a perfect loop of it beating okay I feel like I need to add more color and stuff to this and kind of offcenter all right so let's see if this is a perfect loop I have no idea if it's a perfect loop its we if something was weird about it oh something is weird it's not deleting all the points this is crazy this is actually kind of a nice effect but I'm not deleting all of the points I did and am I just getting like some left over hold on let's make our I think I thought the math would just sort of work out let's let's take out the beating for a second whoa oh yeah it's not you could see there's like an extra point each time so it actually kind of works the first time but I think I need to remove else remove the heart and then I think actually here if where do I check I guess if percent is it gonna get to exactly one point oh let's say greater than or equal to I mean then heart dot clear no it's still getting an extra point Oh weird why is that point in there that doesn't else heart remove wait I have to think about this first I came close look at that 3d heart the point four percent equals 0.5 yeah right right this is flawed I mean I think it'll actually work when I record it because it's just doing it the first time but I would like it to actually loop I'm just thinking about this here otherwise remove let's just just be sure this is the issue all the way down to three all the way down to four yeah it's got extra points in it so why if I the why they're not the same number of frames oh it's as simple as that it's as simple as that guess what the problem is I'm adding an extra I'm adding that last vertex twice because I have less than equals there so this is actually as simple as just getting rid of that equals there I just want to use percent is less than 0.5 I'm sure somebody in the chat already said this but now you can see this loops perfectly so now what I can do is I can change let's make sure there's nothing in output let's delete whatever is there before I can change record to true I can run this and now we should see if I look in output if I look at all the images and I scroll through them and let's just look at the very last one you can see yep it's kind of that's the end of it so now I can go and I'm like edit this part out but I'm gonna go to where we can speed this up and I'm gonna go to what was the website I used easy gif maker yes so I'm gonna go to this website easy gift com I'm going to choose some files I don't need to I'm gonna wear tonight where is this now or these the hearts yes those are the hearts I mean hit open and upload and make a gift it's got those files I am now going to change the delay time to let's just make it three that seemed good from before three one hundreds of a second make a gif my cat is there making the gif making the gift oh the beating the heart beating cute so I'm gonna go from where I hear so let me also add the heart beating back in I'm gonna add where was that so now I'm gonna add the heart beating back in where I had our change and that oh I uh what time is it all right perfect let me add the heart beating back in so I had that from before where I had are mapped to the result of a sine function and so if I do that I'm pretty sure this is the perfect loop still is that beating too fast slower beating people are saying so it's a slowdown the beating I'm gonna just do 2 pi times 2 is that better I think that's pretty good anyway you can work on you can make your own version of this this is fine for me right now I gotta end this video I am now gonna change record to true I'm going to hit run it's going to finish that I'm gonna look in the folder and I can see I have all the images there I'm just going to check the last one which looks like that and the first one yeah I think this will match up perfectly which basically the first one is empty so I think coming all the way down to zero and back up will work so I'm gonna go the website that I used whoops hold on so the website that I used before although there's a variety different ways you can make a gift stitched out of a bunch of images is this gif maker easy gift calm slash maker so I can click Choose files and I can go to my output directory where I have all those I can hit command a select all the files and then click upload and make a gift so it's now uploading all those images and we can see them all here now I could do all sorts of things to futz with them and I'm curious to add this crossfade frames let's try adding that Oh better bad idea I don't know let's make the delay time 3 100 of a second that's more like 30 frames per second and then it's not exact and then I'm gonna click make a gif and then the cat is going to wait for my gift oh and Mike if it's ready yeah now I can just do save image as and I'm gonna I'm excited to tweet this heart and I'll tweet it later there we go this is done there's my no that's not it where'd I put it hard kiss there it is thank you everybody I love you I hope you enjoyed this special about using special this vid me up about using Matt to draw a heart curve and then animating it as a infinitely looping gif and I I just can't wait to see all of different I just want to be flooded with heart gifts just flood me with art gifts make three big good 3d make them rainbow colors put stars in them and cupcakes and whatever you can think of I'll see you in a future coding challenge good bye MA oh wait what's uh what's the difference okay oh I love that 3d heart picture okay all right everybody yes finally kid Gopi says baa Raghava choked claw that's how I feel as well finally I can go drink I forgot to bring water with me today so I'm excited there's a bunch of videos that can come out and I will see you in Ojai Cody garden with CJ in the chat everyone should check out Cody garden or CJ's channel oh let me do some anymore thank yous that I might have missed okay let's thank you to all the other people watched art gift train and I don't know I think I'm done for today I will be back next Wednesday I'm gonna check my calendar but this is my plan now if you're watching this right now I am going to try to have at least for the next few weeks every week so the way that I work until someone tells me not to do this this way anymore is I do a livestream every Wednesday at 1030 I do a bunch of things during the livestream and then a wonderful Matua Blanchette who works as the editor for the coding train takes everything from the livestream and chops it into separate smaller videos which then get uploaded into different playlists where there's coding challenges or courses I actually made a video yesterday that was not livestream it's like a little extra beginner lesson about create graphics and p5 so I might even upload that this afternoon but I just want to highlight I'm really I think I'm like a little bit stuck here data and api's Schiffman github please come and look let me just go to oh no it's on coding train github I am planning I should pin that repo here it is already pinned I am hoping to make a new playlist and I've been getting suggestions and discussions about what I might include in this think it's probably gonna be approximately 10 to 15 videos and I want to cover really about I'm working with data and API is in JavaScript so things I haven't covered before or things that I covered before that are kind of out of date now from with for a total beginner but the focus won't necessarily be p5 so I will also teach about the fetch function and also look at data API is in node and I will use p5 to do some drawing stuff but I'm at some point I gotta make an outline but if you have suggestions or things that would be good bitesize beginner and data sets I'm looking for cuz I want to look at something with like a CSV data set a mapping data set and maybe a news API these are the kind of things I want to look at okay thank you everybody I will see you next Wednesday or on the various uploads that come I'm so thrilled to have this strange thing happened to me in my life that I am here making videos on YouTube about coding with and and getting to be completely ridiculous if I feel like it which nobody seems to have complain about too much I get complaints a lot of people are like you should you should take yourself more seriously and/or like what kind of like whatever substance are you using to be this weird way that you are and I can assure you that it is just a mild chemical ginger tea tea and caffeine I do I do drink a lot of things with caffeine in it alright good bye I am going to sing you out with s new member s Ben oh wait wait wait wait Matt Chia always says give me some green screenshots of four thumbnails because look it's my invisible computer this is what people this I'm really just going for clicks right clickbait clickbait expressions alright that's good enough goodbye everybody
