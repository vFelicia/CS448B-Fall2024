hello good evening happy Friday it is me on time dare I say did I possibly could I possibly have actually hit the start button maybe thirty seconds early I'm checking the chat I don't even know if I'm livestreaming nobody's even said hello to me yeah I'm gonna go on as if I am and then I will feel foolish later when it turns out that no one has seen anything that I've said right now okay so I don't know if you are somewhere in the world where you could be watching this this live stream of the lunar eclipse I would suggest that you probably turn off watching me right now and go outside I don't know but whatever the appropriate way to watch this is please go and do that I guess this is an image from the Bereket Observatory I do not know where that is in the world somebody I'm sure will inform me rather quickly uh Bruno asks by the way Schiffman did you adjust the green screen filter back why yes I did I did adjust the green screen back and I thought to myself this morning let me not we're even though that's my new favorite shirt it's like blue it's got a flamingo on it I decide to put on this shirt which is you know admittedly my second favorite second favorite shirt due to the flowery nature of it but looking over here in my preview monitor where I see myself I'm a little bit worried about the video compression YouTube compression algorithm thing and it's possible I am I am safe I am wearing a safe as you know I am the kind of person who wears a tshirt under the shirt that has been firmly established but I am wearing a tshirt that can be shown on video today this is in fact a google Summer of Code 2017 tshirt ah wait a second I am also wellprepared today with a few other we were talk about wardrobe let's see if this cameras working good this camera's organized something really I mean shocking this is like shocking you know sit down sit down right now if you're standing actually standing is probably a good thing stretching is good don't sit for too long don't Stanford alum move around a lot that's my advice in general but now you might want to sit down something insane I have never done this before never worn this before on a live stream shorts I'm wearing shorts it is very hot in York City actually if you are in New York City right now I'm gonna go out I mean I don't think you can hear it in here unfortunately I was in the hallway a moment ago this massive Thunder there's I got like the alerts on my phone flash flood warning so they're safe let's see if we can see how the storm is right now you can't you can you can hopefully hear my audio and I open this window for a second to give you some audio of the storm know about this window yes okay I'm not gonna be able open these windows you can't hear there was like incredible thunder anyway so yes Schwartz was saying uh yeah alright so oh yes heat wave heat wave some of your experience in quite a heat wave it's pretty it's not it's not a super heat wave here in New York but it is quite warm or though now it is pouring pouring pouring pouring rain okay so how are you lunar eclipse I'll put the lunar eclipse away you know I'm tempted to do the whole thing and the rocket launch thing and I make myself small and I'm standing on top of the lunar thing and blah blah blah but I think I I shall put it away for now I was gonna talk about red burns I have some things open you know oh right also all the things I've read to talk about I am here with my space Mellon I went to a different shop II that's spelled sh oppe which is the way I like to spell shop e where I purchased some of this delicious magic space melon this trick is getting really old or any good soothing cool it's a low acid hmm wonderful wonderful what what am I here I forgot Wow go to drain I was a very pathetic cream was all okay I'm a timpani sound effect apparently it's 27 seconds long I can barely hear it no no you can hear it you can turn it up much louder now it eventually gets to the end by coding train so coding train is a weekly and at the moment Friday evening probably next Friday evening as well New York City time that is YouTube livestream where I do I waste a lot of time and sometimes do so okay today I have a exciting JavaScript library project that I am planning to spend most of today's livestream talking about is called ml5 I have definitely talked about it before I have an idea for a coding challenge okay I would like to do but first I must thank our sponsor Cody crane is sponsored by water you know in that melon that low that high pH that low acid melon that you were crunching on and you was so delicious you're just like chewing up and swallowing it stuck in your throat well that's when water that's when you need reach for your water water it is liquid and when you drink it it helps do it helps to wash that piece of melon down okay you know these are the things I you know I should really prepare for these live streams which I don't I really should but I don't but even so I really want to get some new sound effects alright 94degree i'm gonna look at the check oh we got a new sponsor that means I wonder if my family is at home that means the lights flash let me be I'll get a text message let's see welcome cryptic Thank You cryptic for sponsoring the channel better hurry before the power goes out ritually so I am in a large institutional building and I have never known the power to go out here of course it did back during hurricane sandy you know which was quite an extreme storm in New York City power goes out you'll know because there's nothing about what I'm doing that does not need power is that the right double negative it all needs power the moment the power goes out this live stream land and then I'll get to go home early on a Friday this is a special weekend for me let's see if anybody in the chat can figure out Oh Simon sorry I'm so easily distracted this is a problem with me and my life streaming but Simon just I assume that's a photo that Simon just took posted in the sponsor patreon actually YouTube's changing the name sponsor to member soon select channel that's a wonderful photo of Eclipse I wish I was there to see it I hope that all of you especially in Europe who are having heat waves and lack of rain you get some water soon I don't think it goes that direction exactly but try to I'm gonna try to send the rain to you from here all right so um I'm just checking the chat for a minute all right so I wonder if there's any new people here today if there's anybody new here sure you left already here after all my nonsense but the this stream is I'm hoping will be really well suited for total beginners I'm I'm doing things I've done things a little bit backwards because I'm learning stuff and trying different things so I am with were looking at ml 5 as a library I am sort of going but going back in time I've done a lot of videos and tutorials that goes all the way in depth but someone in depth into machine learning topics such as neural networks and even lower level machine learning libraries like tensorflow j/s and that's helped me hopefully build a background of knowledge to be able to do what I want to do today which is present a very beginner friendly machine learning library that lives on the surface hiding a lot of the lower level details it has its pros and it's cons of course but with the idea that anybody who watches the tutorials that I produce today could be a beginner and completely new to machine learning and follow along and to the extent that anybody ever learned to anything and watching me learn something so that's my that's my main goal for today I think I will start with that I have a coding challenge that I would like to do which is animated sprite I don't even think it's letting anybody ever suggested it came up in a meeting I was having yesterday and it was a I made an example of this years ago and I it it kind of comes kind of comes up a lot so that'll be useful to make a video about it so toothless des I guess I I'm just all about though sponsor you can sponsor the coding that's the official coding great sponsor scheme song toothless des asks how to become a sponsor it's like a YouTube thing you have to pay but you don't have to please no one is under any obligation whatsoever nobody nobody guessed the special quality of this weekend I'll reveal it at the end of the livestream I think this is what's going on oh the coffee is attacking me and by the way I know I do not normally drink coffee on a Friday evening this is a onetime thing some three liked a light bit of coffee Wow a lot of unsweetened almond milk in there organic not made from scratch you know you can make your own almond milk very easily you go to the grocery store it's their really expensive they put all this stuff in it do you know what you need to make almond milk almonds and Wow what's synergy go to cream brought to you by water hmm okay uhoh Austen fish asks is it the anniversary of your bike accident that is a great guess it is not the bike accident I had last summer which left me with this beautiful scar on my elbow and the inability to straighten my right arm all the way and like all sorts of interesting titanium stuff that's in here that was I believe June 27th good guess though all right so it's been an Irish Coffee no but there will be I like to have that often I might be happening after the livestream if I can make it home torrential flooding of New York City Rostow asks first weekend in the new apartment nope good guess good guess I did move not the first week in the new apartment but good guess good guess good guess alright so let's see here I guess what I'm going to do now is ah Phobos gaming asked I should say is there a way to access the slack channel without paying anything iiiiit pains me and even read that question I did have the option I suppose of not seeing or pretending I didn't see it I did see it and Boas game II got it right by the way yes Phobos gaming did get it correct that is the correct answer pup I was answering Phobos gaming I feel like you know very very good very good good guess I was answering this slack channel thing at the moment the system that I have it's not the best is that the way I'm a funding some of the work that I'm doing as well as creating a smaller community to discuss topics and ask questions is through crowdfunding there are some plenty of unofficial not on the future but are plenty of ways to write comments or join conversation so on Twitter I'm gonna set up a discord I believe for the coding train and I'm open to suggestions and ideas because I do not love the idea of having this sort of like closed community but that's the way it is at the moment as the Sun in the background got a name asks Python plus plus thank you for your super chat donation and by the way when I look on my monitor over there and I move my arm like this the flower shirt starts to like flicker like crazy but maybe you don't actually see that in the livestream Simon writes I'm actually watching this live stream outside to watch the lunar eclipse I hope Simon that your eyes are mostly focused on the lunar eclipse cuz I don't I will be livestreaming again next week you know maybe I won't wear this shirt it's exciting also this is being recorded you can watch it later and the lunar eclipse is really a once in a hopefully not a once in a lifetime is it I don't know one night okay so Karim asks what do we need there was that super chat question did I answer it as the Sun background got a name no it does not but I do want to make that into mochi for sponsors is there uh there was a good question there it was something about what do you need okay so if you're gonna follow along live with me today you're going to need you know you could go and look at my workflow video I know my workflows a little out of date and you can register your complaints at the office of IDE complaints it's down the streets lower Manhattan next to the courthouse but if you're gonna follow along I will explain in the video tutorial what you need but just to give you in advance you're gonna want to text editor you're probably going to want to run a local server on your computer a lot of text editors will come with a local server I have been using the node local a node local server more recently and then you will need a browser and everything else is and then you'll probably want to grab one of my recent code examples it just has like the p5 library imported into it you know if you just take any of my coding challenges and kind of like the recommend one from last week that's what I want to do forgot about that the recommend one from last week down grab that code open it up delete the leak out of the stuff from sketch guess you'll be ready to go okay so actually so before I get started with ml5 j/s let's go to twitter.com slash hashtag coding recommend this one didn't catch fire so to speak like others have but we can see some versions that people made this one by ACT Nellis drost was also inspired by the same number file video so created this last month so this is actually a lot of people made their own visualizations of the number sequence before I even did I love this sort of like the 3d quality of this the spiral nature that's beautiful as requested right to mark oh here is the best version I imagined I believe it's beautiful I would agree I think it's beautiful and we can see here this is one of the the challenges that I pose to the viewer to animate the arcs themselves so you can see this has been successfully done so the arcs don't just stamp on there but they animate this is mine this is from model Madeline Dahlberg let's click on the link and go look here 100 open processing org wonderful site to do your code and click on the screen then enter it enter a number so let's do seven great and so it looks like what this is you can enter a number we see the number sequence and we see the how much is there so what happens if I were to enter something really really big like 1000 Wow cool so I guess that's actually that's 1000 numbers is there's a murder if there's a maximum could that doesn't seem like one thousand number is it that maybe it goes up to 1000 that's the highest number but anyway I love the interactivity of this great work Madeline now I'm going to look at this I like these that just like try a different visual idea some straight lines from Earth on Twitter audiovisual and cmajor okay we've got a listen to this okay I don't know how well you can hear that it's nice so I assume here the difference between what I did first of all in terms of thinking about how to design the quality of the sound in terms of the configuration of the envelope also there's actually applying C major scale here I'm gonna get some more slightly more musical quality out of it audiovisual representation I should really hook up the sound it'll just take me a second don't know why I'm being so if I go here and then I click on multi output device the sound goes through this is nice I like being able to see the things I like about this I love being let's see the number I love seeing like where the where we are in the sequence you know mine was kind of interesting in how it was like scaling automatically but I do love I like that it's fixed here as well this is really nice great work by Tom fedley a learned a new name today recommen the coding recommend challenge here's one I've met some nice use of color this is actually really nice one of the things that's a sort of failing of mine is that it looks like there's so many circles because the the arcs get so close to each other on the top and the bottom but if you alter the color you can see the more spiral nature of it so that's a nice that's nice work and then there's this one from Ahmad and I like this I like being able to see the number line like so including the number line actually there is a nice visual addition to this I think great work everybody so in addition you can still post your your versions of the recommend coding challenge to hashtag coding recommen on twitter you can tag me at Schiffman it helps me find it I don't necessarily just check the hashtag but also I will let's see I think there's at least one if I go to the coding train comm and then I go to coding challenges and right here to recommend sequence and I go here this is also a place you know that Twitter stuff is sort of nice and in theory it might be there you know still next week but this is a place where you can also add your own community contribution through a pull request on github there are some instructions here if you if you click on see how we can see one and what's nice about this is you can include your source code plus plus information about you and your version so let's look at animated arc and here we go and this one I love this what beautiful round of applause for putting it on code pen so it's nice to see this on code pen and this really is we've got this animated animated arc there it's wonderful wonderful work everybody okay so this is one of things I enjoy the most one thing I really enjoy about my week is getting to check out the versions of things that people make for what I made okay I think now we are ready for ml5 j/s I must have a piece of melon I'm going to investigate the chat for a minute oh there's Joss SEC W is in the chat I apologize if I'm mispronouncing your name if anybody wants to phonetically spell it for me that would be helpful burgerbob is asking what about changing your workflow in this stream you know I shout out to Austin from the patron group who has really been soaked mind in understanding because he's made many good points about things that I could do to upgrade my workflow to make things not just well Makela make things easier for me and I'm kind of have a bit of a mental block with this stuff and I tend to not get to it I don't I keep me honest folks viewers out there let's see if I can schedule a specific live stream dedicated only to that sometime before the start of the fall semester which is the day after Labor Day here in New York City in Labor Day holiday in the United States I can't September fourth fifth something like that so bug me about it tweet me call YouTube comment me I think I need to I think the only way I'm gonna do it is if I schedule it as a specific dedicated livestream otherwise it's just gonna be the thing at them I would say like oh yeah I'm gonna get to that today but first let me do these things I'll never get to it it'll be at the bottom of the list our Simon is writing artist color in the gaps of the pattern and then it becomes more colorful yes so um if you watch the numberphile video there is a particular artist who has made kind of coloring pages out of the recommend number sequence and filled in and they're beautiful I encourage you to go check that out and it's interesting to think is there a way to do that with through processing or html5 canvas and p5 would be an interesting challenge although I love the handdrawn quality of that stuff okay processing 3.4 released that's another thing that's worth let's let's take a look where do we find where are those release notes so there is a new processing and I just think it's worth showing this because I think if I go here I think the release notes let's go to releases yes they're here so this is something by the way if you're not in the habit of reading if you're like a processing user and you're really interested in what's new what's fixed following the development of it I highly recommend always reading these release notes whenever and a version like three point four means more significant changes than just going from like three point three point seven to three point three point eight this has to do with something called semantic versioning it's a numbering system you know if it was version 4.0 we'd all be you know opening bottles of champagne and shooting confetti cannons into the air and just like dancing like it's like we're so whatever dancing II but yeah this is just uh and it was like what three point three point eight from people improving for at seven we would enjoy but three point for coding train whistle for processing three point four all right huge batch of bug fixes and updates a bunch of things for Windows better handling in the contributions manager for sites that use HTTP I think actually this broke I I think some of my libraries and example bundles are broken currently because of that maybe they've been fixed or I need to do something alternate error message on Windows do features it's possible to make your own a theme file for processing whoa that is cool that is really cool copy the theme dot txt file from inside the processing folder to your sketchbook and edit away for instance to make a dark theme there's this link here which I would love to go look at I've got I want to just do all this stuff today but I well it's possible to copy the text of the status bar that's wonderful that's super useful py de as a supported extension so double clicking Python sketches will launch the PDE Wow they add added added double and long versions of the data classes internal sort fix the welcome dialog redesign the rename window I can want to look at all this stuff rewrite request image now uses a new version Java updated the copyright and year and launched an about string and then here we go give go hi otherwise known as Gottfried a hand because there are a lot of new things in the Raspberry Pi version process guess what I have I have a I have a project I really want to do sorry I can't figure out the camera went off and it relates to what Ava Ava and the chat just asked will you ever do any some Arduino stuff I do want to do some Raspberry Pi stuff and one of the things I really want to do is I moved to a new apartment and one of the ways that I can't well when I was taking my son to camp we were there were like two buses we could take but you had to go like you couldn't go to one stop and wait for both of them and the MC has this like bus time app so I can like check and see where the buses are we could say oh this one's here this one's here so we could kind of like figure out which bus to go to but if you actually just go to like the bus station are now in the subways they have things like boards that show the next train the time I would like to build one of those for my apartment that just like I can configure it just these two bus routes and these two subway routes I want to see like when all the next trains on the next buses are in order in one display and I so the one thing I don't know I should have checked this before mentioning it is does the MTA provide that realtime data through an API I know that they published the schedules but the schedules is very different than the actual realtime data see I don't publish that realtime data I think through an official API I think I can't make this project but if they do I certainly can and I would the reason why I was thinking this is like me dipping a toe into physical computing because I would love to just make a little um you know get one of those inexpensive I assume they're inexpensive like led well I know those things are called those displays that just show like a certain number of characters and there's little grids of little dots there's a name probably let me get one of those Flipboard things wouldn't that be amazing to build a Flipboard but that's that's way that's there I there's no chance I'm ever gonna manage to do that so melon goggles right Stan I don't really mean but you have been streaming for 30 minutes without telling us anything about the actual subject okay that's a very good point I mean I did mention what the topic was going to be so 7 segment display right sausage so much stuff is going on I can't process all this now I'm getting information about how to pronounce ah oh my god okay I can't play that right now that is no good that's no good ml5 all right all right people are so excited about MFO let's do it apologies so I you know you you're yeah okay so just see me like a couple minutes I'm gonna do ml5 next oh I'm gonna cycle the cameras you know I have to say if you really yeah I might recommend waiting for the edited version of the videos but a lot of you are here and you came I did advertise this as ml5 so let be let me get that going all right so let's think about this it's a good if I prepared wouldn't it be good if I prepare it I think I can I have a bit in my head what I want to talk so this is good so I'm just gonna begin hello welcome to a playlist of videos about machine learning this is a playlist of videos about machine learning for hopefully you who are you maybe you could be anybody you could be like watching this in the year twenty sixty seven from your recliner selfdriving quadcopter and you've you've taken your brain out of these sawing hello welcome to a new playlist of videos this is a playlist I mean you know hopefully there's a bunch of videos in this playlist because I'm just starting to record them now so they don't exist yet but this is about machine learning and it is for the total beginner now there are some caveats here I suppose to that but I really wanted to make something you don't have to have watched any other videos about machine learning on my channel I have others that go more in depth and use different tools this is really meant if you're starting it's totally new to you you heard you've heard the words machine learning you type them into some search bar and have some how you landed here watching from the future leaning back you're you've taken your brain out for its afternoon thawing and you're gelatinous couch is comfortably supporting your skillet skeletal a anyway the point is you're here I'm here hello so I'm going to be using for the set of tutorials a pretty new JavaScript library called ml five the purpose of this first video in the series is really just to talk about two things what is machine learning what is ml five so the one caveat I would say possibly to being a beginner here is that you probably want to have some knowledge and experience with coding itself now that isn't to say that you aren't if you don't you're welcome here please watch I will point you to other videos that can help you fill in some missing gaps but I'm going to assume a little bit of knowledge about programming particularly in JavaScript and I'm also going to be making fairly heavy use of another JavaScript library called p5 so if p5 is new to you I'll refer you to some other p5 tutorials I will but that's going to be a larger large piece of how I build various examples throughout all these videos pause for a second I paid that brain joke before apparently it's like a thing that's always like floating in my head I mean I know it yeah okay wait wait this is the part I was gonna yeah everybody I know exactly what I want to do to talk about ml 5 but I actually like I realized I don't really have in my head prepared a really nice extinct 10,000 steps you see that animation you can it goes the way there you go definition of machine learning guess what I would consider his inputs outputs making sense of date a computer to perform a task to learn to perform a task give me your one set in the chat give me your one sentence definition of machine learning you know what I've actually I should just go to my where is that I had such momentum I should never pause from the content where am I going what am I looking for either some notes that I made yeah looks right field of study this is the classic definition Arthur Samuels machine make machines to learn make computers do my homework what does a neural network so interesting to see everybody's telling machines have do stuff that you don't do it yourself yeah that's actually good that's a good idea a form of artificial perms then to learn on its own yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah these are all great wow these are really good self learning a ID to make it tough go the best ball all right so I'm gonna try to explain it in my own words now just give me a second here replying to messages all right so before I get into what is ml5 which is really the core the probably the core component of this video let's just take a moment to ask ourselves the question what is machine learning here's the thing it's my hope that just I don't need to define that right now because the point of this set of tutorials is to kind of explore that question all along what is machine learning but we need a place to start from and so one thing that's I think important to realize and is that there are a lot of terms that you might have heard one thing that's I think one thing that I think is important to note is that there are a lot of there's a lot of terminology machine learning artificial intelligence deep learning neural networks support vector machines etc I could keep going what are all these things means some are algorithms some are topics of research and so I think I'm really struggling with this really struggling with this go back to it always this is this is the stuff that had the hardest time with because I'm so petrified of saying something like sort of revealing myself like really dumb no idea what I'm talking about which has already been revealed many times ok so before I start talking to you about what is ml5 which is really what I'm here to do let's just ask ourselves a question you know first ones called ml 5 ml for machine learning what is machine learning now there are a lot of lots of terminology out there machine learning deep learning artificial intelligence neural networks the list goes on and on and hopefully the definition that whatever I say to you right now doesn't really matter because we're going to sort of explore this topic of machine learning and all these other other all this other terminology throughout these videos but I think one thing to realize about machine learning you think of this idea of artificial intelligence computers robots taking over the world and they've learned their own language and they're defeating our but you know really what comes down to it brass tacks so to speak machine learning is examining some data a whole lot of numbers and trying to make sense of that data and teaching a computer basically to learn patterns that we can present that's really a and we're not talking about something called supervised learning Europe or even more terminology supervised learning where I'm gonna get I'm gonna get into all that and I've gotten into some of that in other videos you know it'd be good to look at so I just pulled up some notes that I made for a course about artificial intelligence and and and at NYU here and this is sort of the classic definition of machine learning from 1959 Arthur Samuels a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed and so let's think about that for a second this is actually useful and I'm gonna get into ml5 in a second but just just a little bit longer right I might say something like the most simplistic sense I could write a program that has a specific algorithm that says if Mouse X is greater than so let's say this this window has a width between zero and four hundred if Mouse X is greater than 200 then that is the right side can you see this yes greater than 200 is the right side else if Mouse X is less than 200 or just else that's the left side this is me providing the computer so to speak I've written a program with some intelligence it knows how to tell if a point is on the right side or the left side of the window I have written the algorithm for that well machine learning is about teaching a system to understand a data without explicitly writing your own algorithm this might be the most trivial simplistic algorithm ever but the way I would do machine learning is I would say hey machine learning system I'm going to give you lots of information like 350 is on the right side and 301 is on the right side and 212 is on the right side and 273 is on the right side and 100 is on the left side and 97 is on the left side and 24 is on the left side and 198 is on the left side I'm creating a data set and I'm just gonna say here's a lot of stuff I'm not gonna how to don't I'm not gonna give you some specific hardcoded algorithm to know what's on the right or the left I'm just going to create a data set it's going to have a lot of information in it and the machine is going to learn the patterns in that data learn how to make some kind of prediction that's a key word here the prediction being is this point on the right are left based on that data this is the essence of machine learning teaching a computer to perform a task without explicitly programming the algorithm for that task now there's a little convoluted cuz aren't we programming the machine learning algorithm and a sort of program but this is the conceptual idea okay let's see alright oops wrong camera alright so let's see here mmm okay all right Siraj who knows probably more about this than i do is in the chat hello Sirach okay so let's see here how do anybody want to like offer any like significant complaints about that sort of like introductory idea i am all ears I'm looking for my eraser I can't find it because I didn't teach erase it all right all right this is the thing when a lot of the stuff that I've done during the heat during this during the semester like when NYU is actually in session I I usually like will teach some sessions during the day or the day before and then come in the YouTube videos so I've had a sense to sort of like try to explain some stuff and have gotten some feedback people ask questions and I feel like I sort of have a little bit more on my feet under me I think that's probably not true I'm probably just as what's let's leave it at that and I'm gonna move on to where I'm a little bit more comfortable just talking about what is ml 5 y a melon goggles makes a really good point somebody I just think if I can only remember these things when I'm here I guess I could go to amazon.com and buy a cloth right now melon goggle says I should buy a cloth what should I look for for a cloth someone just tweet me a link to like a cloth I should get I'll buy it just can't remember it right now all right all right okay whoops I lost the chat here okay all right alright alright alright here we go there we go okay so now that we've sort of vague terms it's best that I could covered very highlevel Brooke okay so now that we as best as I could made some definition created a definition of machine learning one that the least we can start with and I'm sure I'll hear from you in the comments let's talk about what is ml five so before I talk about what is ml five I want to just mention someone to you red burns who is the founder of the program where I currently teach called ITP red burns is a huge was a huge source of inspiration she was a mentor to me and I wanted to start say I wanted to read a few quotes and we actually have a whole book of red burns quotes but these I think these quotes are really important and they are the kind of driving principles behind a lot of the work that I do but in particular a lot of the reasons and behind the ml5 project so technology is not enough consider the technology I should really move the mouse technology is not enough consider the technology as a tool which in itself could do nothing treat the technology as something that everyone on the team could learn understand and explore freely so this is really important don't believe the hype that expectant people say but it's easy to get caught up in the shining technology stuff but we have to remember that without human beings here on this planet what's the point so while I'm really interested and I get lost in my like interest in just sort of numbers and algorithms and patterns and things like that that's I think a core value that I want to make sure I stay grounded to throughout any time that I'm looking at algorithms and thinking about how to how to use technology how to teach technology how to make use of it so this is actually from an article from the ITP journal adjacent there will be a link to this in this video's description which describes sort of the background about the Machine ml5 project itself at the the end of this video I want to talk about various people who made contributions which I have here on this links I will do that but but but let's talk about what is ml5 so in order to kind of figure out what ml5 is I'm going to try to make some diagrams this is gonna be great I can feel it right now so I'm gonna put ml 5 right here in the center now an important component of this discussion is a library called p5.js another really important component of this discussion I'm gonna put it up here is a library called tensorflow yes and oh boy oh boy another really important part of this discussion is just the library tensorflow itself as well as you know maybe sort of this thing called Kerris which i might refer to so first of all what is ml 5 j s ml 5 GS itself is just a JavaScript library it is a library of functions that you can call from your own JavaScript code so again I mentioned that I'm gonna rely heavily on p5 p5 is also just a JavaScript library p5 is a little bit of a special JavaScript library make a little heart there couple stars because it is really I it doesn't necessarily conform to the standard patterns you might find in other JavaScript libraries it makes a lot of decisions to be as friendly and welcoming and wellsuited for a beginner as it can be so one of things you could do in regular in p5 is you can write a function called set up and any code that you put in set up executes the moment the program starts you can write a function called draw and any code that you put in draw happens in a loop over and over again this is this standard kind of design pattern for writing a program that generates an animation like a game or a piece of interactive art so what I'm saying here is that my examples that I'm going to show you in these video tutorials are using p5.js almost that's like it did the base starting point and then I am also going to import the ml5 library so I need to import both of these libraries and I'll show you how to do that in the in the HTML file which is something you'll see in the code examples and once I have the ml5 library I can start to do things like this ml 5 image classifier and then so this is a function setup is something that sort of specific to p5 draw is something specific to p5 and then image classifier well we kind of know it's specific to ml 5 because I had to write ml five dot image classifier so this is one thing a little bit attached which is no surprise if you watched my videos before but a lot of JavaScript libraries are namespace meaning if I'm going to call a function like the image classification function I've got to say that name the library dot that function name so image classification this is one of the common tasks of common machine learning tasks right I'm gonna say hey machine learning here are some images of kittycats here are some images of puppy dogs learn about them so and we're gonna see how you could do that exact kind of tasks with ml 5 itself ok so this is the basic idea now why did why am I talking about this so here's the thing if you just were wandering around the streets of I don't know Venice Italy I thought of that there are dance streets there no it's all like oh my god that's crazy you're you're paddling through the canals of Venice Italy and you go to the little canoe sound that got no the boat next to and you say do you know how to do machine learning I'm a probably oh you just go use a thing called tensorflow now this is possible they say something like oh you just go use this other thing called like pite or something else but there are many many examples of library's most open source libraries that have a lot of functionality for common machine learning tasks one of the most well known ones of those is called tensorflow this is a project from Google it is open source and most of the time if you were using it you would be writing code in the Python programming language well in my tutorials I'll be writing code in the JavaScript programming languages programming language not in Python well amazingly there happens to be this other thing called tensorflow TAS also developed by Google researchers I will include a lot of information about how you can find out more information about Tesla just and the creative potential address in the video description but this is a version of tensorflow written in JavaScript down truth tensorflow it's really rotten C++ code so even when you write your code in Python it's just like running other stuff that's C++ but that's not the case with tetra fluro Chet touch your floor digest is everything's happening in JavaScript and ml 5 an N and you could go and just use tensorflow digest directly to do your machine learning stuff and I have some video tutorials that talk about that but ml 5 is a project that actually wrap that is a layer it includes tensorflow digest so ml 5 is a library where additional functions were added on top of tensorflow TAS to make certain tasks easier and in truth this is a lowlevel library meaning if you were to use it directly you have to really worry about things like memory management and uh and it's kind of stuff you know it's interesting you can do it but if you're just getting started and want to learn the basics of machine learning and experimented play this is going to be in your way it's gonna make things take longer and so ml 5 is going is a let's goal is to make a lot of the things that you're doing tensorflow digest a bit easier and more accessible ok pause for a second I went on way too long there's a lot of links I love how there's all these the links for the cloth in the chat I'll come back to those later I Dan unfortunately I don't have a good concise I will be doing a live stream also next Friday probably the same exact time and but you have to subscribe to the channel and click the alerts thing that's the best way to know when I'm doing a live stream because you'll get a notification when I schedule it yo yo soy in the chat asks memory management on J s WTF well actually it doesn't seem strange but because a a tension flow at GS is it's actually manipulating data on the GPU directly you have to create these things called tensors and then you have to deallocate the memory when you're done with them and you can watch my other videos about that if you're interested ok ok alright okay so here's the other thing that I really want to discuss there are three I would say I'm gonna give you I'm gonna talk about three components of the fields of machine learning right now there are particular machine learning algorithms one example of that is something that you might have heard of called a neural network this is an algorithm to perform a machine learning task there are many other examples of algorithms there are also there's something known as machine learning models and in particular there's this idea of a pre trained model okay so I want to talk about that in a second and then of course we have this idea of data and data sets so I'm going to circle this here for a moment I'm going to put my stars next to it because this is essentially where we will begin you and me and the people from the future who are watching this video or they'll have time traveled into the paths I don't know whatever this is where we're gonna begin now most machine a lot of machine learning tutorials will start with something like AI now we will look at linear regression it's kind of similar to that thing where I was like I had that line in the middle of the window or the points on the right or the left and we're gonna do linear growth and statistical components of machine learning algorithms but one of the things that is happening in the world today the reason why I'm hoping that this video tutorial and this ml5 library is important and useful is that our lives are increasingly being governed by pre trained models corporations train models to perform a particular task to recognize your face to turn the words you're speaking into text there are questionable as many questionably ethical applications of this there are also fun artistic and playful applications of this so one of the ways to get started as a beginner to machine learning is actually not to learn all the math and learn how to train all your own machine learning systems but to actually make use of some pre trained models that are out there for example the thing that I'll start with in the next video is a model called mobile net this is a model that's been trained to recognize the content of images but there are lots of images that I could show to that model that it will have no knowledge about and other ones that will have wierdly have a incredibly obscure detailed knowledge about why is that well what was the data that was used to train that model what was the algorithm what algorithm is that model using these are the critical important questions that we of citizens of this world increasingly governed and controlled by software need to feel confident and capable of asking and so by taking the get by friendly and accessible or approachable ways of being able to experiment with pre trained models this is a good place to start so this is where the video tutorial series will start and later as I go forward I will also hopefully look at what does it mean to create your own data set what does it mean to use a particular algorithm with your own data to make your own model and save that model so this is pretty much the overview and the machine learning is the thing have to do with numbers it has to do with and and the thing we're going to start with this something called supervised learning really so the idea of we're training a system to learn from existing known data so that it can work with new data and that will I don't know what I was just talking about there look at that crazy diagram alright so machine learning is a thing you the thing people are talking about we want to get some experience playing around of it experimenting with it understanding what it is we're going to use this ml5 library I'm gonna show you how to import it I'm going to show you how to import it into a p5.js sketch and I'm gonna show you how to start to use pre trained models and we're gonna look at what those models do well what they don't do well where do they come from why do they exist where do they come from and why do they exist okay so actually before I go let's look at a couple more things and by the way when I say go you can just click Next I'll be in the next video or you could go to something else but okay coming over here oh shoot sorry I shouldn't read the chat okay alright so I encourage you before you watch the next video what I would encourage you to do is actually just click around the ml5 website I probably would have made sense for me to do that's like I kind of overview that would make sense but really what I want to look at here just really quickly as these examples and there's a bunch of examples here and I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about all these different terms what's a classifier what's what's regression what's an LS TM what style transfer but the bunch of these used there are there's a bunch of pre train models already supported and this is where I'll start with in the video tutorials we're gonna look at pre chain models for image classification I'm gonna look at pre train models for generating text for a style transfer for something called pics two pics pose net pose and is amazing let me just I got distracted by the super chat because I don't know what I like so I see I see this like large number kind of freaked out Thank You Valerie but I threw some currency where it's a reasonable reasonable amount okay would love to hear your talks about genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning qlearning yeah I would love to hear that too I'll see if I can get to that eventually we come back and do this part over again so all right so you know I would encourage you actually before you watch the next video if you're continuing to watch these videos to just check out the end map go to ml5 jazz org I don't encourage you to click on there's lots of stuff to read about here but I encourage you to click on examples and go down and just try all of these so you can see there's some pretrained models that I'm going to use them to do a tutorial basically about each one of these notably like I mentioned one called pose net which actually can take an image and estimate your pose meaning where your hands where your shoulders where your eyes you know where your hips I might be getting that somewhat wrong there but that's a pre trade model just like a pre trade model learns how to recognize the content of an image here's a pre train model that looks how do I figure out where the human body is in a particular image so we're be looking at those I encourage you to just sort of click around here I also want to just quickly go to this Twitter thread that I posted just to kind of give a little bit of a background and pretty good credit because ml5 jess is not a life here that I created it's a it's a project certainly that I have worked on but it came from many many other people so first I'll mention ITP NYU that's not the right Twitter handle for ITP NYU Boyd I really botched that isn't it well this is a little bit of an aside yeah it's ITV underscore NYU ITP NYU it correct with her Antal okay so first thing to mention is and I did talk about this that ml5 jazz is a layer on top of tensorflow gotcha so all of the heavy lifting behind this really comes from this library which was a prod many people are working on in contributing this library at Google and otherwise but the project was initiated by Nikhil and Daniel researchers at Google the development was funded by with the support of the Google Pig mixture group the Google big picture group and people plus AI research initiative which is led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas and they've done a lot of wonderful projects about visualization and machine learning the style and approach of our library really comes from the processing foundation I mentioned the relationship I guess I meant to say like the reason why the five is here is because of the sort of symbiotic relationship with p5 we've made sure the ml 5 library you absolutely do not need to use p5 with it but it is fully compatible with p5 and the spirit of p5 I think in in its welcoming and inclusive a sensibility is a present in the ml 5 library and so thank you to p5 we've used the 5 there ok Cristobal Valenzuela Valenzuela who is also the creator of Runway I'm out which you should definitely check out started this project at ITP by creating a few examples with the deep largest library which is what tends to flow which is what became tensorflow DJ yes Yanina has done amazing work on porting style transfer meaning she and and pics to pix models into ml 5 this is what's really wonderful pikachu edgetoedge pikachu i yunying hopefully will either be making her own videos that will point you to all have her and as a guest to go over some of these amana davis has done a lot of work around data collection and responsible data collection that i encourage you to read about and find on the ml5 website through an artist residency Nikita wait a second tonight I might live did I just have like so many mistakes in this I don't know why did I say Huggins her name is Nikita Higgins at ITP right ITP residents sorry I'm like losing my mind I didn't rest I had so many mistakes in my eye hold on just give me a second here I'm just looking at my email here well how do I know it's Huggins it's hungins I'm right I'm totally right I just look losing my mind it's late on a Friday I never get you know okay great Nikita Huggins a resident research at ITP really did a ton of work a project management work vital important work in shepherding the library through many different stages the ml5 logo on the website is designed by Alejandro Hey hey Eun Kwang also gave lots of support to that Dan Ovid actually ported the PostNet model to tension flow digested ml5 Jess I'll be showing this in some video tutorials in the future and the a J's ITP adjacent journal which I did mention also thank you to Stephanie Colton who did all the editing for that article and I encourage you if you really want to read more about the background instead of listening to me ramble you can check that out we had a lot of guest artists who came to visit us and give us a lots of inspiration and ideas throughout the process and then so many organizations allowed us to do some of the first experimental workshops school for poetic computation Eyebeam creative coding fest ITP camp and yeah and there have been many other contributors that you can find if you go to ml v j s dot org and you click on code and browse the github repositories and see all the wonderful people have contributed so this has been my introduction to ml v the library itself and guess what you made it through this video congratulations because in all the rest of the videos I'm really just going to be coding and talking you through how to make certain examples how they work and what the piece is opposed samples are so thanks for watching this first video and I'll see you in the next one which the first thing I'm gonna do is just make a simple image classification example using the mobile net model see you there maybe alright alright alright I did my best I don't know about this did my best I did my best I look at my email now it's the worst day ever it's so distracting oh let me go back to the slack channel there's something showing through from your computer with the green paper on it oh yeah this never works not better I'm gonna see it okay all right so I'm gonna have what time is it 600 o'clock this could be worse I only started like an hour ago well hopefully I'm wrong the Train sound is being requested I have this sorry it's the Train all right let me think about this okay so I'm going to get this image of me how do I set the I definitely want SafeSearch on how do I set it there's a way for me to set it so that it's like all images that I can use I mean the Wikipedia one I think will be fine let me go here and then Oh interesting let's see what happens here mm let's see here sorry I'm looking for some images to use usually when I do image search I feel like there's a way to specify under tools tools there we go usage rights labeled for reuse we go there we go this one I'm looking for okay well where'd I saved the other one did I not save it no I didn't okay okay so one thing so let's just see here my suspicion here uhhuh so interesting enough this is a puffin and what it thinks it is is an oyster catcher and it has a kind of a little bit of sort of low confidence level this is a toucan and it's a toucan where the confidence of 99.99 percent so my question to you watching this and I'm going to repeat this in a second is why does it know this one and not this one and what I'm going to do it's our github code and a5 library under source maybe utils imagenet classes okay then I'm going to figure out what I need here so I have this I have this I have this what was I looking for here is mobile net and image net this is what I wanted okay no I feel like there used to be this webpage that I would go to when I was like researching image net I feel like it was very different than this yeah I don't know okay okay okay we're gonna have to chat here okay why is there often a redundancy with it as a single word in two separate words that's a good question Alka I mean the I'm just going to show this is these are the literal categories okay so the other thing I want to do is just do see if I can find find I'm getting text from home that somebody just sponsored because the lights are flashing welcome underscore underscore thank you underscore underscore you're like Prince this is what I'm looking for that did not work what am i doing save image as here let's try this wall clock I love that okay wonderful and I don't know let's see here all these look at this weirdo this will work snorkel there we go okay so this is exactly what I want to demonstrate okay okay hello welcome to the first code tutorial that I am ever making I did make this kind of like longwinded rambling introduction to what ml5 library is itself but in this video I'm actually going to make a code example that does image classification so this is going to be our hello world hello to machine learning first start one of the easiest things you can do with the ml5 library it and it involves this is very key a pre trained model so this isn't this is not this is not where everyone starts and tutorials about machine learning a lot of Stroh's about machine learning start with like I said in the previous video linear regression in the math and training this and and we're just going to use a pre trained model somebody else made a machine learning model that knows how to recognize the contents of images and ml5 they open sourced it and ml5 is providing us access to it within javascript to use for the p5 library so i'm gonna write the code for this and talk about how it works but let's first actually if you just even want to just play around with this model to start with you can do this right here on the ml5 home page so right here you can see this image of a macaw and guess what the mobile net model labeled this image as a macaw with a confidence oh this must be the best artists machine learning model ever it's like magic it just knows everything and in fact I can grab this toucan and I can drag it in here look at this it's a toucan with a confidence is so smart so smart I can't believe the mobile net model is amazing now let's get this puffin in here it's got to know how to puffin ISM look at this the mobile net model labeled this as an oyster catcher and it's confidence is kind of low huh so what's going on here why is it not saying puffin that's clearly a puppet well first of all guess what a pre trained model for image classification forget about accuracy has a fixed number of even things in the world that knows about and one of the things that's really important if you're working with something like a pre trained model is actually to know what's in that set now it's not the most easy thing to find but right here on the ml5 github there's actually this page of JavaScript code that shows all the things that the mobile net model happens to know about in fact there are 1,000 classes and you could see like this is crazy it knows about a beagle and a bloodhound and a black and a English Foxhound it's like trained to know obscure dog breeds but if I look for puffins it's nowhere to be found boy stur catcher however is in there and if I were to look like what does an oyster catcher look like it kind of makes sense that's the thing it knows about that's closest to puffins so if your project is all about puffins you're not out of luck and I will show you ways to train with your own trade data to retrain a pre trained model but right now we're at this starting point so birds aside that's sort of you know it happens to know a lot about birds it happens to know a lot about dogs but let's just say for the sake of argument I'm gonna now give it this coding train logo it thinks that's a wall clock and it has kind of a low confidence and that I don't know maybe because of what's here the sort of flat nature of it yeah I could give it an image of myself it thinks I'm a snorkel which strangely is probably quite accurate I'm kind of snorkel like in more weights than whatever maybe I'm just that's too weird but the point is it actually knows nothing about people and it knows nothing about a lot of things that exist in our world who made these decisions what's in the preacher why are these classes written this way and and what was it even trained with so first let's talk about supervised learning I'm gonna race the white board do my magic erase the white board thing that I like to do I said I was gonna write code I will buddy Kenny buddy estimate to me after editing how long do you think that first intro to the ml5 video actually is and did I go did I go to if I went like get lost in my leg I want to talk about the technical stuff know if I went in the right directions with that okay okay so let's talk about for a second supervised learning what is supervised learning so image classification what's happening with image classification so the stage that were we're going to do in our code we're really just going to do the prediction stage so the prediction stage we have this pre trained mobile net model the model expects some input and it expects that input to be an image so that's the input to the model then the model generates an output and that output is a list of labels you know cat dog puffins etc and confidence scores you know 98% well I guess the the do the scores all add up to 100% I think I should just 90 percent six percent two percent etc okay so this is the stage that we're doing but how did we even gather we get to the point where we could do this ourselves somebody else had to prepare this mobile net model for us and the preparation of it is with a strategy known as supervised learning so supervised learning involves a it involves a training data set so maybe there is a data set it's almost like you can think of it like a spreadsheet right it has image and label so maybe this is the file name like image one dot jpg and it's a puffin except puffins down and move on that image to JPEG it's a cat right there's this big database and how the data is formatted and cleaned and all that stuff there's lots took that goes into that but essentially there's a big database oh I wrote off the I totally wrote way off the frame again all right all right all right all right it's out of frame come back to them and I'm gonna go back to the supervised learning thing where's my I have these lines showing me where the top is apparently their way in the wrong place so where's the actual top out there oh that's crazy crazy talk okay can you see that line nobody got it about right so somebody had to do this with the process known as supervised learning and write this down they're supervised learning so supervised learning involves a data set and this is often referred to as a labeled data set meaning and you can think of it as a spreadsheet a table a table of images and labels essentially there's two columns here one columns is a lot of examples of inputs and the other column is a lot of examples on outputs so I might have you know cat dot jpg oh and not a cat and then I might have you know kitten dot jpg and that's also a cat and I'm you know I have puffin dot jpg and that's a puffin so the idea here is that there is this existing training data set this is a training data set okay the data set is used to train the mobile net model it just says over and over again here's this image here's its label here's this image this here's this label and the process of how that works involves you know looking at the error they tried that the model tries to make a guess is does it get it wrong says it knows the right answer it can change its settings to try to get the right answer the next time this is the process once that finishes there's usually the model is tested with some other images that weren't used in the training set and then it's a paper is written about it it's published or it might be something that a company sort of owns and keeps keeps closed down it doesn't provide access to MIT uses it in their own proprietary software mobile that is one that is public so the important question for us to ask is we're going to use this pretrained model and we're going to start trying to understand why it's giving us certain results and what is it good at what is it not good at is we need to know what was that training set in this case the training set is a database of images called imagenet so let's come back to the computer for a second we can go here to the image that looks to do that I guess that's fine no I don't want to do that sorry hold on I specifically made this smaller we can come back to the computer sorry oops we can look at the we can look at the image net website and look at this image net is a database of almost 15 million images and that seems pretty good right in a machine learning system for it to do a good job in the supervised learning process it means a lot of data if we just have 10 images it's not gonna be able to do very much there's some tricky things we can do late that I'll show you later with small data sets but in general we need a large a zip so that seems like a good thing but one thing you have to realize like what are the motivations of this data set where are the images coming from well most of you know the this data set was really put together for research into image classification and in order to do that it needs to use well images that are like in the public domain that it can give access to and frankly almost all of you know it's very likely that if you do a google search for any of these so any of the let me just do this really quickly so I go back to the labels let's look for King penguin okay so I'm gonna do a search for King penguin I'm gonna go to images I'm going to grab this image I'm gonna do save image as I'm gonna save it to the desktop as penguin I'm gonna go back to ml5 and then I'm going to go here and say look a hundred percent you know why it's a hundred percent I am almost sure that that image is in I mean I'm not sure about this but going look that's probably in image net so a lot of these sort of like things that come up in a first search result that are in the public domain for Wikipedia they're actually in that image so it's going to work really well with something like that versus the image of a puffin that's not in the database doesn't even know about it so maybe if we could find an image of a penguin that's not in the database image that database it probably would guess it as a penguin but we wouldn't necessarily see that much of a confidence maybe if we had a zoomed out picture with a lot more background noise something anything you could try that super interesting is to just download this image and like draw over it or change a couple pixels what happens to the image classification afterwards all these things you could try and better yet you can try them by writing your own code so I think it's time and on and on for drew long enough about what this model is last thing I mentioned is if you really want to dive deeply into the mobile net model there is a whole paper written about it there's a github repository I'll link to all that stuff I encourage you to research this stuff and to think about it to ask questions and to be critical what are the motivations behind it the creation of a model what data was used in that model and what where might you want to use it or not use it okay so all that aside let's actually write some code to use the model now so I'm actually not ready to do that so this is gonna be an edit point so let me go to the desktop make a directory climb go five videos I'm going to go into it what do I do bundle and then image classification did that work oh my god losing my mind no P five G B I know I put it in quotes I'm like losing my mind I forgot I used this P five manager thing okay actually hold on a sec so I'm just setting up my workflow stuff which I will talk about in a second image classification index this is all good I don't need a libraries folder now something I forgot about I just want to check real quick before I make this video let me let's do a quick little test here and then I'm gonna have to back up so 27 I don't recall so let me just make sure before I go into this stuff that click on get started yep I'm gonna grab this put it in here I'm going to take all these images I'm gonna grab these ridiculous images I'm gonna make a folder called images put them in there I just I can't remember whether it works yet with load image or if I I just want to test the code real quick before I do the tutorial I'm gonna say load image somebody by the way give me a heads up when it's like seven o'clock I should maybe do that animation coding challenge just have a little variety load image images what did I have puffins whoops puffin dot jpg and then I want to just say image image zero zero so let's just make sure this works that's a large image of a puffin okay that's what's guy okay and then let's just see I just want to before I do the tutorial I want to make sure I know what I'm doing mobile gnat model ready I think that's only to do and then model ready let me just see console dot log already apologies to you live stream viewers because I'm kind of ignoring you right now I realize but I want to make sure that this works this is not right let's look at the documentation probably well I did that right already mobile net oh oh it's just slow I forgot it actually takes quite it's got to download the lot mount model from the cloud I just wasn't patient enough and then I want to stay a classifier classify image I got results this is how I do it error results console.log results I'm going to do all this again in the tutorial and talk it through okay classifiers not defined because not global I don't really want to put it up here but I'm going to oh what just happened my connection is oh look the connection is being all screwy okay get results SE I got results got results last attempt everybody classified click classify is not a function okay classify a classifier predict I thought we'd change it to classify which is fine but I had this memory of changing it to classify that's fine though yes if that didn't work pixels cannot be null this is fine I'm gonna do it the other way I just I really want I want it to work with this is the thing we need to fix yeah so I had a suspicion that this wasn't going to work I will do this just want to make sure this works create image yeah okay so it worked so this is sorry for me experimenting with this so what I'm what I was doing here is that p5 allows you to load images in two different ways there's the load image function which will actually load just the data if it image there's I thought do I have to say like but or there's the create image function makes an image Dom element so but it apparently it's only work with the Dom element thing okay so I'm ready to go I forgot what I was doing when I can I get rid of this file so annoying okay okay all right so we're ready now to start writing some code so what I'm starting with is very little I have a file called it's a text file called sketch j/s and it has some JavaScript code in it it's assuming the p5 library and I have already in fact oh shoot gotta start this over again sorry okay we're ready to write the code now I'm what I'm starting with is one javascript file with a little bit of code in it again I mentioned I'm using the p5 library the p5 library supports a setup function which executes when the web page loads create canvas makes a canvas and now I color the background with the color 0 which is black and if I go into the browser I am able to see the results of this code because I also happen to be running a local server using it a node server package now there are so many ways that you can run a web page that's running JavaScript and you could use code pen or open processing or something new that's gonna be coming out soon which is a p5 editor that you could use online that when it comes out all week do it in the video description but for right now I'm going to use my workflow of having my own text editor on my computer and the p5 libraries imported in the HTML file so here's the HTML file the only thing is it's doing right now is it's referencing the p5 library and something called the p5 Dom library which I need for some of the things I want to do and then also of course my own sketch jas I have a video where I kind of go through my entire workflow in more detailed steps I will also link to that in this video's description now that that's settled though I can actually start to use ml 5 so how do I use ml 5 so right here I'm on the ml 5 home page the first place I should go is just click on this big get started button so I'm gonna click on that and I totally clicked around to the wrong place let's try that again I'm gonna click on the get started button and I'm gonna go right down here and I look at this this is what I need now I can download the ml five javascript library file itself and included on my computer and I might want to do that if I'm gonna work offline but I prefer to just reference this particular URL in a script tag and this is at the time of this recording this is the current version of the ml five library zero point one point one now by the time you're watching this it might be like seven point eight point six if that's the case this video probably means absolutely nothing whatsoever but if it's relatively close to that version hopefully this video is still helpful to you all right now will not make my joke about your brain being inside of the gelatinous thawing machine thing in this video I made it so many times it's not even address even funny okay I'm so I'm gonna put that in here I'm just gonna go back to my web page and I'm gonna refresh it's still working okay good so now we have the ml five library imported and we can start calling ml five functions so one thing I might actually do is just go back to the ml five website whoops sorry we're just here and click on examples and I could go down to image classification and I could start kind of looking at this code and copy pasting some stuff I'm gonna kind of type it out and I have some of this in my head so I can just type it out but more importantly probably there's there are these examples which you can use to get started but you might also suggest like just having the webpage open to the reference page for a particular feature so again I want to have videos that go through all of these features but let's go through the image classifier one I'm gonna click on that okay so now this is the documentation there's a little bit of an example here and there's some information about the syntax and if I get confused I can refer back to that but since I know some of this having done this before I'm gonna just start writing directly into sketch j/s itself okay so the first thing that I need to do is I need to create an image classifier itself so I'm gonna make a variable and I'm gonna call it classifier and actually you don't I'm gonna call it mobile net because I want to remind myself that this is not magic that this is using a very specific pretrained model called mobile net so I'm gonna call my variable mobile net then I'm going to say mobile net equals and five dot image classifier so this is a function that generates an image classification object it's going to be stored in that variable mobile net and now it needs some arguments so what goes in there now the truth of the matter is there might be a variety of things you can put it there at the time of this recording there's really only one option which is the mobile net model so I'm telling ml five that I want to make a image classifier in the first argument I'm giving it as a string with the name of the model now in theory as much as an alive supports additional pretrained model I might get to type something in here like a unicorn classifier like maybe it classifies all different kinds of unicorns mobile net and then I need something else really important I need a callback deep breath deep breath deep breath deep breath okay so wait I got to stop for a second oh the ml five library supports callbacks which is what I'm going to use in these video tutorials and something called promises I have if you don't know what a jobs are get promises I will refer you to my playlist about JavaScript promises and you might look at some the documentation but if you're someone who already uses JavaScript promises is it another way of handling asynchronous events that's slightly different but very similar to callbacks that's something you can go and do on your own do on your own or I'll make some videos about that too but right now I'm going to use the callback methodology so in the idea here is I type in the name of a function I could also put an anonymous function in there called model ready and I'm gonna write I'm just gonna put that function up here in the global space because that's gonna be very simple and I'm just gonna say console dot log model is ready exclamation point so the idea here is I am now creating an image classifier with a mobile net model it's gonna take some time for it to load that model this is not a small thing now it's called mobile net because it's actually a tiny model that can even run on like mobile phones so this code would work well even in a mobile browser but even the tiniest model is something that's got some size to it it's gonna take a little while to load so let's go see how long go over here into here I'm gonna hit refresh model is ready so I know it was a few seconds you can see now one thing that sitter is like where did it load the model from does the ml5 library have a copy of it loaded that well actually no so one thing that's important here is a lot of the pre train models this is going to be different but a lot of the pre train models that you might make use of in ml5 are actually loaded from the cloud meaning some underground bunker servers were the model file is stored so and the this I believe it's coming from a Google server so if you're not connected to the Internet this example won't even run there probably you know at some point I'll be nice to support ways of running a mobile net model offline it is certainly technically possible but the ml5 library not all of the examples but this example in particular requires you to be online okay so the model is ready so now what can I do I can classify an image okay whoo this is fun for me alright so let's see I already have in this directory a bunch of those images that I was experimenting with so let's just use for example the puffin since that's our example we should see I shouldn't know that was going to happen let's let's start by using the puffin since that's one that we worked with earlier you know I personally I'd like to expect I like to use in my examples stuff that doesn't work because it's it leads you to ask questions and stuff just works it kind of feels like it can start to feel like magic and you can you know it's important to think about why stuff and how stuff is working okay so what I'm gonna do in setup I'm gonna make a variable called pufn pufn pufn and I'm gonna say puffin equals create IMG now this is a particular function in the p5 library right this is now like create canvas sp5 create images p5 this makes a Dom element an image element on the webpage that is that image so if I were to reload this page you're gonna see okay uh it's in the directory images so I need to include that there you're gonna see there it is down there now I can do things like if I wanted to have this all happen in my canvas I could say puffin dot hide and then I can actually say image puffin and this won't work but it'll be interesting to think why for a second and I want to draw the puffin into canvas the reason why it didn't work is once again things don't happen in JavaScript instantaneously so it's got it's gonna take some time to create that image I'm going to I could give that a call back it's called like image ready this is a lot of this stuff is unnecessary to the example I'm building but just to demonstrate the idea and then now I'm going to draw the image into the canvas ah but that image is really like a big size so I could resize it or I could just like force it to be the size of the canvas and there we go so I now have a p5 canvas displaying my puppet image and the model is ready so now once the model is ready what can I do I can classify the image I can try to ask mobile net what's in it and the way I do that is with a function called predict so you'll see different names for different functions in the ml5 library predict will come up often you might change to classify by the time you watch this video but I think it's called predict right now of ml5 I'm going to say mobile net dot predict puffin meaning I want mobile net to give me a prediction of what it thinks the content of the puffin image is and then guess what that takes some time it doesn't happen instantaneously so I need yet again another callback and I'm gonna give it a callback called got results and again I could do this with a promise if that's something that you're more comfortable with but I'm going to do with callback and then I'm gonna write this function called got results you've used p5 before this is very similar to like load JSON oh I want to load the date I want to load the data from this JSON file and then you usually have you know an argument to the callback which has the stuff in it the stuff that you want is filled that argument but here's something that ml5 works with error first callbacks this is a Java Script pattern where when you write the callback you always must include as the first argument and error argument an error variable meaning it's for the library is forcing you to check for errors so in this case I might want to say something like if error whoops not a new promise console and by the way I could say console dot log but I can actually say console dot error error and then otherwise console dot log the results so this is a little bit of extra error handling if something went wrong in the prediction process hopefully I would see that there otherwise I'm going to see the results all right let's see if this works and here we go boy stur catcher and we can see these probability is 75 that is crazy so this is really interesting to me this got 75% then it also thought it was albatross and Drake different probabilities now why a 45% 11% why why is this different than what I got with the oyster catcher in the homepage of ml5 2's I don't know the answer to that I don't have to think about that it's a different probability but nonetheless I'm getting a pretty similar result nice to do with like versions of something and that the homepage is running a different version of something but we can see this is the idea now what I could easily what I could do is I could go and I could say all right let me get the the label is results this by the way is an array with three objects in it so I could say I want to get the first object index zero and I want to get the class name right object zero dot class name that's the label and then I'm just gonna draw them and say fill zero text size 100 no social sixtyfour I don't know and then I'm gonna say text label and I'll say ten and like you know height minus fifty or something I don't know I'm just putting it arbitrarily somewhere on the page on the canvas so let's run this again we can see unloaded and then it says moister catcher right there how thrilling we have now run the motet model got the prediction for our image and there it is of course I could also do something like create a Dom element for the label I could also I could also get like the probability by saying equals results index zero dot and what was it called class name probability is the net other probability and I don't know if I spelled that right and I could create two Dom elements using Create P and we could run this one more time and now we're gonna see that stuff down here it's very very small probability is not defined probability probability Oh prob uh I named my variable prob because I got a lot of probs okay so we can see here there's the probability so you know this is the basics now you see you could actually just go and use this in right now one thing I have a couple ideas for you number one is make a little interface try several images can you make one where you can actually drag and drop your own image like it does on ml5 homepage could you make something where you draw on the canvas and it's trying to classify what you're drawing another thing you could try is can you get it to classify what the webcam is is seeing and guess what that's what I'm gonna do in the next video so there's so many more things you could do with this but this is the basic idea try your own version of this experiment play around try a lot of different images but in the next video I am going to basically take this exact example but hook it up to the live webcam feed and we can see it sort of classify images from the webcam in real time all right I'm gonna and so if I'm doing this as a live stream right now if you're watching this recorder that's recorded but I'm gonna check to see any questions and I'll answer those also to beginning the next video okay see you soon okay so sorry mine this is what happens after a live stream for like two hours my nose starts to get itchy I can't explain it it's like a nervous tic I got one more piece of melon so I think what I want to do is I'm going to do the video thing and then I want to try to do my coding challenge which is the animated sprite thing and then I think I'll be done for today how do you feel about that is that okay why okay I haven't really been following the chat does anybody have any important questions my colors are out of range for that syntax you need to use promises I don't know looking for any questions la conciencia asks when do you upload this video so it sort of depends but the live stream archive will be available as soon as this finishes at the same URL that you're at right now but the edited version of the videos will come out sometime next week probably is your hair brown well I always say my hair is gray but if we used to be Brown yeah important question is it two hours cold coffee that would be the answer that would be yes alright alright Rustom is asking can you use JavaScript inheritance today I've act I don't know if I took get requests final bit on Twitter or in a comment earlier today I don't I don't think I have time to look at JavaScript inheritance today but that is something I would like to cover at some point in the future image ratio is different interesting will I use 3jf in a future video I mean in theory anything is possible I can dream alright okay so thanks for these questions it's almost 700 see the super chats did I miss some super chats let me click here no that's for sending one top chat no I don't know how to see the super chats if I missed any important super chat questions I would be happy to answer them and of course I have heard of mr. doob okay I just want to check something real quick okay I've been on for two hours the stream status is good it's just interesting that I I'm just I'm noticing that I have this whole interface for like analytics while the stream is running and it's kind of curious that I can just check it sometimes by the average this is a good time the average view duration of the live stream is 12 minutes and 42 seconds so if you've been here the whole time thank you you're a your I appreciate it okay all right so let me go back to the chat I don't know we're getting some messages here I missed a lot of stuff in the slack channel chat so if there's anything super important goodnight to those of you who are going to sleep because it's like really late at night for you I've got another hour before I really have to go I mean I'd love to go but I'm gonna try to get through what I said is gonna get to it through okay so let's take a moment to do some stretching I'm doing some stretching over here I put on my weight at this waiting music for a second okay all right everybody what's that ready to him this weekend anything fun do you call it the pickle or the floss this is a constant discussion in my household is it the pickle or the floss which I clearly cannot do all right hello I am back to do another video about image classification with ml5 and in this video I'm going to take that's a puppet by the way not an oyster catcher I talked a lot about why it says oyster catcher not puffin but anyway I am now going to do a good classification but instead of seeing our good friend the puffin we're going to see I don't know if it's our good friend or not probably just me whatever is in the webcam of this computer Thank You barbone de Luci appreciate it hello back I'm here to do another video using the ml 5 javascript library a library beginnerfriendly library about machine learning I'm gonna use again the same pretrained model called mobile debt that I talked about way too much about in the previous video but instead of attempting to classify this image as a puffin which the model failed to it thinks it's an oyster catcher which is not an unreasonable guess I am going to attempt to classify images coming straight in in real time from the web camera so this would actually not take us very long frankly cuz I've mostly written all the code for it so pause I realize I've gotta be smarter about this and I want to now make another copy of it call it video classification because I'm going to change the code but I'm gonna want to have it I'm gonna go back and refresh and then go to video classification says that and I'm going to close this and this okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is instead of create image right here in setup I am going to say create capture video then I'm also going to add the draw function because right now unlike with the image we're just loading one image and then I was just drawing it once I need to have a loop that happens over and over again because what I want to see is the image of the video over and over again now again I don't have to draw the video into canvas I could just have the video element appear on the page itself but I like using the canvas just for sort of like it's kind of lead you to the water when the water is the place where you can draw your own stuff and be creative in the canvas so I like that I don't know if that made any sense but I this is what happens after two hours I I just I lose all ability to have any let me just start this whole thing over one more time for no real reason no reason other than my own neuroses I apologize to those of you who are watching this in realtime this must be super annoying I don't even remember where I left off okay so the first thing I want to change in the code it to turn it into video is I want to go and look at where I created the image so I said Puffin equals create image I had just this static image now what I want to do is I want to use the p5 function called create capture and instead of pointing to I can't spell today instead if I've can't spell every day instead of pointing to an image file the argument that I give the create capture function is just the constant video video means I want to create a video capture it's gonna default to the default camera it's connected to the computer so just to be sure about this I'm going to comment out puffin dot hide I'm gonna change this I'm gonna get rid of this which has to do with drawing the image I'm going to get rid of the predict comment that out and I'm gonna change this variable to video so the only thing that I should see right now is I should see the video appearing on the page so let's run this first it's asking me permission it wants to use my camera I'm gonna say allow and then there it is there's be okay so there it is now here's the thing I could just use the video element there and it's fine but I have this like thing that I'm obsess over and I feel as important what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hide the video it's this is on is there's nothing to do with the machinelearning image classification aspect but I feel like you might have a chance to express yourself to be more creative instead of just using the default Dom element if you actually draw the video to the canvas itself this might allow you to do things like draw on top of it and another type of stuff so there we go now I have the video in the actual canvas and I'm hiding the the video Dom element now all I need to do is go where did I do this I want to uh uh where did I call predict I called predict as soon as the model was ready well you know what guess what I'm gonna do that again and I'm gonna put video in here and I'm gonna get rid of this create peace stuff because I don't want to mess with that right now but the got results function can remain the same so as soon as the models ready it's going to get the results and it's gonna draw what it thinks the label is right there in the array okay there's a video oh so okay we got an error this is so good that we got this air because the errors you get when you use like ml5 they're really scary error math back and WebGL right pixels pixels cannot be no I mean that sort of makes sense to us okay so one of the things that I didn't mention in my introduction to ml five is I don't have that diagram anymore but ml five being built on top of tensorflow tjs tensorflow Jas he's doing all of the math using something called WebGL which is a 3d renderer for the browser and there's an interesting story as to why all those pieces fit together in this way which I could talk about another time but this is why you see these error messages quite often that have to do with like math back and WebGL so let's see what did I what did I get wrong mobile net dot predict video got results that video video equals create capture video hide I you know what guess what I don't actually I completely forgot something important that I wanted to show you how I kind of want to fix this because this really should work I'm thinking here I'm just pause verse I got why did this not work interesting hold on I have a weird sort of I just humor me for a second hmm make sure that hiding it isn't the problem I wonder if this is an ml5 bug this is not actually the way to do it I forgot the way to do it and I'm gonna change the way I'm doing it but I'm just gonna nope yeah I don't this should work but I'm not going to worry about that right now I guess I could just ignore the fact that I trying to think if I need to go back in the video because this error I mean I like that I got that error but the problem is now I can't fix it I'm gonna have to oh wait hold on I'm getting some messages in ml5 slack that's something else yeah okay now this is this is unrelated unrelated I'll look at that later thought maybe somebody was messaging me in a different place go back to here I don't want to let let yeah where's the stack trace T okay all right you know what I'm gonna back up before before I got that error right I was a little it was right about I'm gonna back up much yeah so I don't know why that didn't work but I'm gonna do it a different way which I think well let me just make sure it works the different way I'm gonna do it yeah so the way this this way worked so I don't know why that didn't work it should have but I'm gonna choose that's not the way the example is written and I'm gonna choose to do it the way the examples written I'll have to revisit that if somebody wants to explore that a little bit and file an issue on the ml 5 library github repo that would be helpful ok so sorry about this mention this might be hard to edit but I need to figure out now when to call the predict function and so in theory I should just call the predict function right here with the video but here's one of the nice things about ml 5 since ml 5 knows about things like hey you might want to do this with that continuously running video I can actually when I create the image class I'm gonna pop its I'm gonna take that this out of here sorry I'm gonna take video out of the dot predict function and actually the way to do this is when I create this image classifier I can actually say I want the mobile net model to act continuously on the video so I want to like hook those things up together so I can actually insert the video the P 5 video element right there into the into the image classifier function and then I can just call predict without any particular I mean I could always say predict on this specific image but now the video is just linked to that image classifier and I could just call predict so now if I run this oh shoot how do i how do I make this so now if I run this I'm gonna refresh it there go think we should see there I am I am a poncho or a cardigan are I'm often considered chainmail once again we're seeing the failings of the image the the mobile net model in this particular case now the thing is it just did it once right it just called predict the moment the model is ready but guess what what if how do I call it continuously well you know what once it calls predict and it got the results why not just ask it to do it again so if there was a mistake maybe I want to not move on but if it works I'm gonna get rid of the create P stuff here and get rid of the probability just for right now I can just do this so what I'm doing here is this is like a work this is essentially like a loop another loop that's happening when the model is ready that's when I can start predicting then once I've got the results I've got the results draw them and then show me the next one oh but guess what that's weird it didn't actually show up so this is actually a big problem so I'm gonna run this again we're gonna well hopefully this will work it's going to it so weirdly this is working I don't like that this is working let's see this is something that generally tends to get correctly kneepad really water bottle okay so but I this this worked by accident the fact that I'm seeing the text there I probably shouldn't draw in multiple places what would make more sense for me to do is make a global variable called label and then just oh and then have this and have that set initially to an empty string and then this drawing of the label should actually be right here in draw itself so let's try this again let's make it a little smaller and let's try one more time and here we go let's see what types of things that can classify and you know what I should this is you know so I'd have to more thoughtful about the design here so let's do this let's make the canvas a little bit taller and of course I could just write it into an HTML element but just for simplicity let's see here let's see if this does the trick I just drew you know that's a little bit better he meant to I should make the canvas a bit taller I don't know why I was so stingy there okay so what I'm trying to do is just draw a little area there we go okay so now and and honestly I probably should take out this console dot log these console dot log scan really slow things down and I'm gonna do this again last time here we go all right poncho Oh like let's see spatula it's pretty good spatula okay doesn't recognize a bell magnetic compass what about a train whistle a matchstick that's pretty good does it recognize a book broccoli what about a marker paintbrush I could be here I want to do this all day long this video is gonna be like 17 hours long pill bottle kneepad water tower I think the green background is kind of it likely confusing it what else do I got in this room oh let's see a cornea and piano accordion so you can see as long as it's something that's in there right if it's been trained on that particular you know if I just happen to have a chihuahua with me I probably could get it to recognize that Chihuahua so this is a fun thing that you can now play with you could make your own project about you know you know there's a Google made a project like this called ASCAP emoji scavenger hunt where you had to like find certain things get the image classifier to recognize it so there's all sorts of course it used some custom training there to make that work for particular objects but so I think there's a lot of possibilities of things you could explore here but now you can really have your hands in there play with the code visualize things draw stuff you know and really experiment with what is the mobile net model what works well what doesn't work well and you know the net one of the things that I really want to show you how to do which I will do in a future video in this series is use the mobile net model only as a starting point so the mobile net model is a starting point but I can then to tree train it with some custom images and some new labels so by golly I could get that mobile net model to recognize puffins if I wanted it to so thanks for tuning in it's not a thing you say do you tune into videos I don't know it's a live stream if you're watching this now thanks for watching okay and stay tuned I'm just gonna keep going through and show you more features of the ml 5 library what should I do next I don't know I think I might do I'm not sure yet watching the description will say next video what's the error because I used the puffin okay let me just check so I'm gonna saying something interesting which I'm curious about I'm going to take this out of here then I'm gonna put it back here this should do exactly the same thing it's just the shorthand to put the video in the constructor no I don't know why that doesn't work so this is supposed to work from I should work with the video you can manually pass in the element or you can give it you know if there's a video element you can give it to the instructor so I don't know why that didn't work all right I got time for this coding challenge all right I saw it okay so this I think concludes my introduction to the ml 5 library I I don't know I don't know hopefully it was it give me your feedback I mean it was anybody watching this tote like the the intended audience knows a little bit of JavaScript maybe use p5 never did a machine learning before do you feel like you're on your way to something maybe speaking of which can you cover convolutional nets yes so that's actually what I was gonna do next in my tensor flow GS series so let me think about this for a second I'm just you well look I'm live now so if I go I don't know where this is gonna live so this is the these are like the these are sort of like the non ml 5 machine learning playlist that I have and Afonso writes I thought it people are complicated Wow yes that's a good that's a good bit of feedback there these are these are the more complicated ones so it doesn't make sense for this playlist to be in here I think this playlist is just going to be actually I think it's gonna just be a new playlist and it'll be called exactly this ml 5ks a beginner's guide to machine learning in the browser great ok all right so now let's do a coding challenge let's go into the weekend let's go get our evening herbal tea or beer or kale wheatgrass smoothie whatever helps us to just feel like we're at home more relaxed it's time for the weekend we're gonna get there I'm gonna get there but I'm gonna do a coding challenge first you're gonna have to give me a few minutes to get myself reoriented for that so hold on I just got a sever a second so kayo asked can you do some machine learning tutorial for beginners that are having the first contact with it and brach back asked the question so that was the point of today I done I can't say that I did it successfully but right now there will be three edited video tutorials that come out of this which are intended for people who's with the first contact with machine learning now so that you can start with Bracke Bracke asks another question which is where should I start learning about machine learning on the coding train channel until those videos come up this is a bit hard to find whoops I need a better way of organizing all this this is the perennial thing but right now if I go to youtube.com slash the coding train scroll down and go to this one here neural networks and machine learning click here and now I would say you could you could start with you can technically skip session 1 & 2 if you want and just start with session 3 which is basically an intro to the idea of machine learning and you can see with me a bunch of different algorithms and more of the math behind it so and then I'm talking an intro to neural networks then I make a doodle classifier then I look at tensorflow J yes I make a color classifier and then there's this neuro evolution thing which links back to Gen I got so this is what there's a lot of material here so this is where you would want to start ml 5 is in parallel to this without a lot of the lower level details so yeah ok alright so now let me the coding coding challenge here I need to open up terminal again animated sprite okay tonight is that right I don't know what I I know why forgot its G B okay and I made it sprite now I can go here I can close the ml5 stuff I can delete the libraries here and I can let's go back to 640 480 and okay all right so I think I'm ready for the coding challenge all right oh wait wait wait where is the I got to do something here downloads I got to get the animation that I'm going to use which is this and actually I'm pretty sure I just need to fix something here and nowhere I'll explain everything a minute just getting myself organized JSON format or just want to make sure this JSON is right yep okay so I think I'm in good shape here that's the horse animation and great alright so this is the last thing I'm gonna do today it's uh it's I'm gonna do a coding challenge to make a variablespeed animated sprite that duplicates itself something like that and this is an example that I made I guess I will I don't know why I'm talking about this now but this was from 2011 this is like this is a processing example all right the weekend is coming I see it in front of me okay I'm ready that was bound to happen eventually okay got a cycle the cameras what's the chance let me see I should probably erase the whiteboard because I might want to use it so apologies you know it's really sad sometimes I feel like for the livestreams I should just play whatever music I want and just let the YouTube copyright overlords just monetize the videos because I just want to play interesting fun music maybe I can eventually make a lot more had some time could compose some more original coding train music or get more submissions from people I mean I I wouldn't play the videos in the park deep music in the parts that we're becoming the edited videos don't mind me I'm just here everything a whiteboard and you're watching whoo it's hot it's getting warm I wonder if it's still raining let's open the door just for a second I don't think it's like I can't even my watch it's 730 on a Friday evening I wish I could like make the camera like a roaming camera and then I could like go out into the hallway I'm just looking to see if it's raining still doesn't it looks like maybe the rain stopped all right hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to make an animated sprite this is actually a page on my website I have a website yes thank you very much with an example that I made apparently seven years ago you can download the code for this it's made in processing and it is loading a sequence of images and playing those images in sequence in multiple places at different speeds to create this running person thing across the screen so I'm going to try to do something similar I'm gonna do it at p5 so I'm gonna look at what does it mean to load a sprite sheet what is a sprite sheet even to chop up that sprite sheet into lots of little images and then to play those images as a sequence and make an animated sprite class that you can use and this is a very common technique used in games and all sorts of other stuff so let's get started down thank you hold on a sec oh wait thank you thank you dragon z p who suggested that i use this wonderful image sequence of a running horse which comes from open game art org this is under a Creative Commons license so I need to attribute it it which I'm doing right now hello I'm using this but I can so you can find a lot of free and open art that you can use here so I'm gonna use this if you if I were to click here and just download the assets we would see that it would actually come as separate images which I find to be very nice because I like to load them one at a time but what's actually often done and more efficient is to actually and I have this right here to load a single image so this is what's known as a sprite sheet a sprite sheet is a single image that has each frame of an animation for that sprite why is it called a sprite in the first place pause I'm looking for a sprite in animation sprite computer graphics why is it called the sprite Spray our key games oh I cannot find it the term sprite huh ah here we go look at this look at this in the category of you learned something new every day the term sprite was first used in the graphic sense by one of the definers of the Texas Instruments 99 18 a video display processor I'll let you continue to read this interesting Wikipedia page about the history of sprites but the way that we think of sprites today and in particular a sprite sheet today is multiple frames of an animation within a single image and this here is a PNG image so it has transparency so if I were to go I should just go to the desktop and open this up you can see it right here here it is again so what is it that I want to do what I want to do is load this image I want to get each frame out of it and then I want to show them one at a time in sequence so this is not necessary but again thank you to dragon who submitted this also sent me a JSON file so this is actually quite convenient this is a JSON file that actually has the information about where each frame of the sprite is in that image it has its XY knits width and height now it turns out this is really just a grid so I could probably just do this mathematically very easy easily but this is sort of nice that I can maybe load this in so let's get started with this right now so first thing I want to do is I am going to write a preload function I'm using again the p5 library and preload allows me to load media assets before the program begins sort of save me from callbacks and promises and that sort of stuff which is useful but I don't need that right now so I'm gonna say let sprite sheet be the variable for the image and let sprite data be the variable for the data so I'm gonna say sprite data equals load JSON and what was that called it's called a horse JSON and I've done something horrible here and then I'm gonna say sprite sheet equals load image horse dot PNG just to make sure everything's working let's draw the sprite sheet to the canvas and in setup lets console dot log the sprite data so this is the first step I and again this is a bit of over this is this is a lot of extra stuff like you know I could just load a bunch of images alright only sou me the JSON file but this is nice I like it I like it ok so let's go back whoops and of course everything's gone wrong so it couldn't get horse JSON and it couldn't get horse to PNG why because it's in a folder I always forget this I put it in a folder called horse so I need to add the directory path to the images there we go so we can see this came in so I definitely have the data there right I have the position and the native of each element and then why don't I see ah so I'm trying to draw the image and I completely forgot if I'm going to draw the image I've got to say where to draw the image and I'm gonna draw it at 00 there we go Oh timeout for a second I'm getting text messages ok this is important I have to hold on hold on everybody just give pologize bear with me this is this is a something something I need to just deal with when it's uh okay okay hopefully I'm gonna be able to finish up here soon okay okay all right read the comments Dan read the comments what comments all right all right okay all right I don't know what's going on in the chat but there we go okay okay so next step what I want to do now is I don't want to just display the entire sprite sheet I want to display each piece of it one at a time so let me go and what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable and I'm gonna say let animation equal an array so the array is going to be each frame an image for each frame of the animation so assuming I have that data I can see if I look at the JSON file right once again all of the all of the data is in a JSON array called frames so I'm going to say sorry back into the code I'm gonna say let frames equal sprite data dot frames I don't that's totally necessary for let I equals 0 I is less than frames dot length I plus plus and then I'm gonna get sorry I'm gonna look at the JSON again and now for each one I want to know about the position this X Y width and height is what's important to me I'm having trouble so I want to say let pause equal frames index I position and then now pause has all of the stuff in it for grabbing a particular image so watch but I'm gonna say let image equal sprite sheet and I'm gonna use a function called get so get is a function in the p5 library that allows you to get part of an image I could get a single pixel I could get the whole image I could get a section of it and in this case what I want is this section of the image the X and y with a particular width and height then what I want to do is just put that into that array so now this is really all I want to do is loop through every frame grab it out of the spreadsheet now again a convention might be this is one way of doing it which I which arguably might not be the quoteunquote best or most efficient way you can actually just leave everything in a sprite sheet and later I could just be like when it's time to draw stuff I could pull stuff out but I'm choosing to in setup just pull out the sections of the image and I'm gonna console.log that array now and we can see I have an array with seven images in it so now if I were to say draw image animation index zero that's all I see is that one if I were to say draw animation index two I see that one so this is working and guess what animation frame count what and then can't read a property width of undefined so you saw it for a second there and then it went away why did it go away well it went away because there's only seven images there so I could say modulus the animation dot length now somebody who I got this great YouTube comment the other day saying that I'm saying modulus and modulo incorrectly I don't remember what it was time out for a second where was that I'm gonna find that comment where was that comment hold on I got to find that comment comments sorry it wasn't that long ago so I'm just scrolling through I'm gonna find it this is obviously incredibly high priority oh come on how I'm gonna find it it's not that long ago I just saw it earlier today I guess I could search there's a thing where you could search let me do this search I'm so silly search comments much search there it is okay this was on recommence sequence part 2 ok let's find this comment oops okay I found in the comment the operator is called modulo and the number following it is called the modulus okay and goal on Levin came on the Kody training to the guest video about that operation but what this operation does for me in the code right now the modulo operation is it gives me a modulus value that's always between 0 and the end of the array so it's the remainder of division so this frame count modulo animation dot length watch what this does now I see that animation repeating and look at that look at it it's the horse it's just running and running and running and running and running great so I've completed part one when I'm gonna kiss keep going this is one video of this coding challenge I've got the animation playing it out but here's the thing what I want to do now is I need to figure out some way of encapsulating the idea of this animation into an object so I could then make many of them so what I'm gonna do to do that and I think what I want to do I think I want to make a new JavaScript file I'm gonna call it sprite j/s and I am going to in index of HTML I need to make sure that I refer to it and then in sprite j/s I'm gonna make a class called sprite and then when I create this what what when I create the sprite with a constructor I want to give it a few things I wanted to have a speed and I wanted to have it I'm gonna give it like an animation so basically that animation will be the sequence of images that's supposed to play and then it's also going to have a speed which is like how fast does it play it through so the idea here being that now I can say let me just do a variable called horse and I'm gonna say horse equals a new sprite with these frames of animation and a speed of 1 and here I'm gonna say horse show and maybe I just want to say something like horse dot animate so like our next frame or something I don't know what what makes the most sense but I'll just call it animate right now and I'll put it after so this means if the idea of this sprite if I want to show it and animate it in the sprite class I need a show function and I need an animate function now if I'm gonna have a show function that's basically going to be exactly this but the point here is that I want to get away from using frame count and so what I want is to have another variable that just keeps track of the index like where am I in the animation so I can use that instead of frame count this dot index and this by the way has to be this dot animation dot length and this has to be this dot animation I like and you know it would be really nice to have a length variable I think cuz I'm gonna probably need that a lot so let's just make it that just like makes the code a little bit nicer to look at alright so this should work and then in animation I just say this dot index plus plus or plus equal this speed so the idea here is speed is controlling the speed of the animation so I've basically taken the idea I've created an object that has stored in it an array of images that's the animation it has the length of that array it has speed how fast roads cycle through them and where is it currently so now if we run this and I've got some error here sprite digest line ten this dot animation this dot index so let's just let's just look at some stuff here to see what's going on Oh animation is one oh I put things in the wrong order ah this is a very common programming error look at this I wasn't doing this quickly and in here say horse equals new sprite animation comma one so add the image sequences first then speed number is second and in here I put the speed first and the animation second so I got to reverse those order so that they match and then there we go we're fine now so I've got to where I was before but the interesting thing here is that now guess what this sprite can have an X and it can have a Y and so it could be basically I could be drawing it at this dot X this not Y so then when I create it I could say I wanted at one hundred 100 comma 1 now it's there this leads me to be able to say okay now I want to have horses I want to have a bunch of horses I'm going to say for let I equals 0 I is less than 5 I plus plus horses index I is a new sprite at 0 comma I times 50 and then I want to say for I'm going to use a for of loop let horse of horses and I'm going to go through all those and show and animate all of them so now look at this I've got a whole bunch there they're all right there together maybe I want to just space them out a little more I could be thoughtful about the math of this oops I must not have saved there we go so this is good enough for right now I've got a whole I've got a bunch of them but look it now here's the thing what if I don't want them all to be matched up at the exact same speed what if I were to say let's make the speeds random so let's make the speeds random somewhere between 0.1 and one point I think that's actually the fastest speed that that number one so let's do that what happens all right I immediately get an error what is the error that I get it cannot read property with Ubuntu fine spray Tijs line 12 well the issue here is by definition if I go to sprite KS line 12 look at this this dot index modulus this dot length this works just fine if the index is zero one two three four five if it's a whole number if it's a whole number it can apply the modulo so I said it wrong again operation and it gets another hole number which is an index into an array arrays only have whole number indices but if I start saying plus 0.2 or point three I'm gonna get these numbers that aren't valid indices into an array well this is actually quite fixable and let's just do this let index equal floor so all I need to do is floor this dot index before I apply modulo and then I can put that in here right so floor is an operation that just eliminates the decimal point I want the index itself to go up slowly by a decimal point but I only want to show you know I have fewer frames I want to show the same frame a bunch of times so it's if it's point two it's gonna take five frames for it to get all the way up to the next whole number if it's point one it's going to take ten frames so this should do the trick now and we can see look at this they're all going at different speeds and they're running in place I might as well have them move now right so why not also have them move this dot X plus equal this dot speed and maybe the speed that they're running doesn't really feel right so even though it's the speed of going through the index I probably should increase that my scale of like five let's try that this looks a bit more realistic now I have it looks like they're sort of moving at speed and then I could obviously do something like if this dot X is greater than with then I want to say is this dot x equals negative I want to kind of put them off the screen negative this dot animation index 0 dot with so I'm just pulling I know that might make sense for me to make that a variable like this dot W equal this dot animation index 0 you know this is assuming all the images have the same width and that way I could just say put it off screen here so let's run this one more time and guess what I now have I believe a recreation of that example that I made where I have a bunch of horses all moving at different speeds through the animation and you know now the world is my digitally simulated virtual reality Easter so to speak and then I could I could grab any sequence of images I could have different sprites have different image sequences I could start designing the background I could have them you know I could apply physics to the way that the the X Y position moves around the screen I could start having collisions the point is that anything that you've anything that I've made in all my nature of code or other coding challenges that have an object moving around the screen the simple games this would allow me to have an animated sprite and I might even further want to encapsulate the idea of a sprite oh this would be a great place for me to talk about inheritance so I could then make other objects that extend that's an inheritance term sprite so I could make horses that are animated sprites or frogs they're animated sprites or puffins and puppet doesn't really do it so I could that's okay I'm a little bit off the of the rails here in my discussion let's think about this what could you do know what thing is what would happen if I gave it a negative speed I think mine would break so this is a little challenge to you could you make this work with negative speeds right it breaks so this example that I made doesn't support going through the animation backwards so try to add that could you make something like this that has different animations for each op so there's maybe five things but they're differ and each one has its own animation sequence could you do that so could you design your own sprite sheet so don't even do any code make your own sprite sheet and run it with this code exactly so there's so many things you could do please share with me I've been the comments on Twitter or at the link to the coding challenge URL in this video's description there's a way you can submit any versions that you make on your own thanks for watching this coding challenge animated sprite what did I owe ya slower add a rotation to it and incrementing by any integer will be too fast all right I think I think I'm good I think I'm done sorry I have to go home so I so but I will see did I miss anything super important there or was this challenge good enough for right now thank you everybody for tuning in I'm good everybody says I'm fine great so one thing I need to do is before I leave I've got a upload the code I'm gonna hit to stop recording I'm not gonna stop streaming just because I want this to go to disk all right is it possible to use ml5 with no task moto that's a good question it's definitely possible use tensorflow yes with node and I don't know about MF I don't know that I don't believe we're supporting that yet but that's a really good question okay so next week I don't know my schedule for next week Friday evenings have been working late in the afternoon I've been working pretty well for me so I might expect that to be the time next week I would love to squeeze one more to live streams in next week it might only be one would love to squeeze in two so because I'm actually going away again for a few weeks so I'm gone for about three weeks of August so August well things will really slow down I have been doing an accounting of my live streams to make sure it like again with the with the crowdfunding stuff my commitment is to four live streams a month and some months I end up doing more in some months less like I said look over it over the period of a year but I this is my second live stream of July I'll certainly get one more in next week's which will be three in August I might only have to but I pretty sure that I've done a lot more in jus in in May and June and I can also catch up and walk in September so anytime anybody feels like I'm not to be enough you know let me know again the complaints office for is down the street in lower Manhattan near the courthouse apparently and yeah so thanks for I don't I don't have anything else to say I would love to hear your feedback on ml5 wanting to hear from things that you make I am going to go only night but I did get a new sponsor and you know this is the undressed tiger thank you so much for the sponsorship la I appreciate it so sponsors you need to look in the community tab and they're our sponsor only posts there that have a link to a Google Form so enter your information in that Google form I will mail you stickers and you will also get an invitation to the slack channel and I am doing another mailing hopefully of stickers oh why it's just an email about that hopefully next week although if you sponsor today I don't know if I'm gonna get you into that mailing because I've already sort of put together but anyway I don't know what's happy with that but you'll get an invitation to slack channel and you'll be able to ask there so I thank you Andreas for sponsoring it's very much appreciated I am looking for a volunteer to design spa emojis for the SATs for the sponsors to use that's like a YouTube feature and icons for that like right now it's like the circle with these two lines I guess it's supposed to be like an S but anybody wants to volunteer to help design more emojis and icons just let me know in the slack channel or on Twitter at Schiffman you just send them to me I will upload them into the system alright so that's that thank you everybody for watching it is so appreciative I'm excited to be going once again on another machine learning journey with the ml5 library doing more coding challenges Oh little foreshadow I this is my this is the coding challenge I'm working on this is one I actually have to prepare for I've been like obsessed with this idea of like visualizing for D and then 5d and 6d there's a wonderful video Lee s.o.s this is not gonna be right that I watched the other day no let's do tesseract yeah this video understanding 4d the tesseract by lay I Oh SOS this is a great video I highly recommend this is a nice one too I watched both of these but I'm but I need to figure out I think I'm gonna do this in processing in P 3d and I want to do actual like the rotation the matrix math for rotations and so I think I need to make a couple video tutorials about that I need to kind of like figure that out a little bit so that's coming soon to a YouTube channel near you coding challenge 4d rotation hypercube tesseract would then be challenged to the viewer to do a 5d one alright thanks everybody and I will see you next next week at least once maybe twice subscribe and click the alarm bell if you want a notification it will show up when I scheduled on YouTube I usually do try to do that 24 hours in advance but it'll be one day next week okay goodbye I'm gonna hit the stop streaming button which is over here and then I'm gonna go home and begin the weekend please enjoy your warm cold caffeinated alcoholic non CAF decaffeinated non alcoholic beverage of choice relax take some deep breaths look outside at a view read a book get away from code for a little while and come back to it when you're feeling refreshed I need like a catchphrase I'm supposed to have a catchphrase this is my catchphrase where do i click stop the livestream oh here it is I'm now clicking the stop streaming button goodbye
