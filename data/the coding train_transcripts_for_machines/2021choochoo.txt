do so so do do hello everyone doing a quick audio check how's my sound can you hear me all right um i'll be starting in 2 minutes and 30 seconds do do me do wow that is quite a powerful train whistle good afternoon and welcome to a special well it's not so special this is not gonna be anything special whatsoever but it is a saturday edition of the coding train with me dan i'm excited to be live here with you i made the decision to come and do this live stream about 30 minutes ago so i apologize for the sort of last minute um notice i do i really do need to do one of the wonderful things about having uh sponsors of the coding train i want to thank today's sponsor of the coding train oh and i have to go over here to do this um brilliant brilliant.org is a wonderful interactive learning website for lifelong learners with so many different courses uh about topics that i cover here on the coding train you can check out brilliant for free at brilliant.org codingtrain i will come back and look at some of the courses a little bit later but um what i wanted to say is like it's really good to have sponsors because it gets me to live stream um i don't know what this i'm seeing 42 and 47 being typed into the chat um what what what are these numbers here darth torres and quibble here are uh in are typing in numbers i think this is a reminder for me to give our newest member abe their random number but i was introducing myself so thank you to brilliant the sponsor of today's live stream um i will most typically not be live streaming on the weekends in 2021 as i discussed during the regularly scheduled live stream last friday but i wasn't able to live stream yesterday friday because i was in the recording studio making new nature of code tutorial videos for chapter three so i'll come and show some of the examples that i coded up yesterday um hopefully i'm gonna get into some rhythm and momentum and the new videos are gonna be coming out sorry i couldn't okay yeah yeah stop talking to me watch um um so stay tuned for information about that um and the chat is quite is amusing me dan uh says ray j can you please do a series of tutorials on shaders in p5.js or whatever other platform you prefer this is definitely something on my list i don't know when i will be able to carve out the time i think one of the things that would be fun about doing video tutorials or live streams about shaders and excuse me while i um wipe my nose here for a second is that i don't really know shader programming i have tinkered with shader programming i understand some of the higher level concepts associated with the graphics pipeline and how shaders fit in to creative coding and computer graphics coding but it's not something i have any real experience with it's not something that i've taught a workshop on um so i it would be a great first series of kind of like learn along with me which is really the vibe that i'm going for with the coding train so keep reminding me about that right now i am i have a pretty singular focus which is the nature of code and i will talk about that i mean i'm talking about it now but i'm going to keep talking about it during today's live stream and show some coding examples from that kind of let you know uh where i am um with that um choo choo from the coding garden says jeremias um was the coding guard i really try you know it's impossible to not ever like live stream at the same time as something else going on in the universe but uh you know a sibling channel i think to the coding train is coding garden and uh sometimes i check to see if coding guarding coding guard what coding gardens streaming schedule is i know there's a lot of crossover between the audience and trying not to conflict but i didn't actually um look too carefully or closely at that today i want to also just welcome i don't know oliver if you're watching but oliver whose name i saw pop up in the chat coding train member for very long time probably one of the original patreon subscribers or supporters of the coding train i haven't seen um oliver in a very long time and so welcome back um it's really wonderful to see your name um you know one of the fun things about doing the coding train is you know it's a weird sort of thing it's i you know i get to know the audience and i don't you know what i mean by get to know this kind of loose term there because most of the audience the people that i feel like i know and interact with and get to see their work and watch them grow and learn and make their own channels and tutorials and produce their own content i've never actually met in person some of some of um i've never seen a photo of even other than maybe sort of like a profile picture but i do feel like i know many of you especially as i see the names pop up often in the chat so great to see you again oliver um let's see um i would like to take care of some very important coding train business um and since oliver is back i think probably oliver was not here when i started my new tradition of giving everyone who is a member i want to give everyone in the world all one million subscribers of the coding train their own random number but i gotta start somewhere i'm starting with people who subscribe to us members and so uh we have two new members hello to chris manning who saying happy saturday um oh cool and people are saying they got their my book for christmas um so i wanted to um i think i should give oliver their random number and then i also their newest member abhay um he uh joined during one of my member my recording session for nature of code and i was not able to provide his random number then so let's get started with random number time oliver probably one of the longest longest term members of the coding train thank you for your support over all these years and guess what for your support of the coding trade you get your very own random number i've been watching a lot of clone animated clone wars and i can't stop speaking like the uh introduction to that okay uh from page 319 uh row 15925 column 61634 your random number is 37 213. somebody marked that down for me um we're going to return to that because one of the things um that i would like to do today is work on the random walk with random number generator for custom train whistle project and obje we had the one of the longest most longterm members ever of the cutting train i think we also have here in the audience today the newest member of the coding train abhay abhay uh hails all the way from some part of the world please tell us in the chat where you're from obvi and if i don't know if i'm saying your name correctly so tell me how to pronounce it is the h silent um you from page 183 column zero one two three four five six row nine thousand one hundred twenty your random number is 57 969. all right bangalore india is where abhay is from okay wonderful thank you that's um so by the way uh speaking of bangalore india i didn't know that you were from there take a look at um i think the website is let me pull it up um and um thank you again to the sponsor today brilliant um let's look for uh processing india processing india.org so processing india is um a i don't know what to if you know to what extent it's an official organization but um it's a group of people in india who are celebrating and using processing organized uh many different uh processing community days um you know prepandemic and i do know in fact that there was one in bangalore in particular because some of the organizers of processing community today in bangalore uh are um alumni of the program at nyu where i teach called itp so um hey if you can if you want to connect with them maybe uh i can help facilitate that connection and you can meet some of your fellow um processing enthusiasts in bangalore i do want to mention i think i should mention this every live stream that 2021 the year 2021 the year that we are in right now which is not out to the best start if i'm being so honest i was kind of hoping you know 2020 i don't know if you noticed not the best year i thought well new year new leaf let's get everything going it's been a little rough a little rough here especially in these united states where i live um but hopefully hopefully things will be looking up um okay but um what was i talking about 2021 ah yes 2021 brings with it the 20th anniversary of processing itself processing itself was created i believe in august was maybe the first release of 2001 when i was a wee young lad in my uh 20s actually just before i began graduate school at itp i had no awareness of the existence of processing at all when it began i didn't encounter it until several years later but so this year hopefully will bring whether they'll be all virtual and remote or whether things will be able to start to improve in terms of our ability to be physically present with each other i don't know but some form of celebration of the 20th anniversary of processing so um i would say stay tuned to processingfoundation.org the twitter account of various social media accounts for things that might come up um around that celebration i do want to i was sort of thinking back to the history i think if i search for rhizome shiftmen reese fry yet so this is something that i did wow in 2009 back when i in the early days of me getting involved with processing itself i did an interview with casey and ben and i don't know why all the images are missing that's kind of sad for me around the origins of processing so let's see it was sometime in june 2001 as i was finishing up at mit we made a list of the basic specs for the environment and drawing functions it was one eight and a half eleven tight inch typed page by the fall ben had something working and the first workshop took place in japan in august 2001. um okay interesting um so anyway i'm i'm excited to sort of read this over again i think that's what i was looking for people ask like where does the five and p5 come from so this is actually the answer to it right here not when we started the project but we've second guessed the name many times since first it was an iterative name with the characters always changing so processing with like a zero for the o uh a five for the s three a one uh then we more conservatively started using processing with the five fives for the alpha version so that's a move to processing a few cases i regret not calling it seal i think ben wanted to call it bagel or potato so think about what would the world be like right now actually i think bagel is pretty awesome if we were all just here being like and now i'm going to show you how to program your own fractal in bagel.js maybe we could put some locks we'd all be making libraries that are like locks.js and capers.js tomato.js that's pretty great so this is pretty cool to read about and think about um you know obviously many years later p5.js came around with lauren mccarthy um the world of contributors to processing in p5 has really exploded and what i would like to say one of the things has been wonderful is to see the inclusiveness and diversity of that community which really was not present for so many years a real failing of you know the open source community i think that's really you know not perfect by any means there is lots of work to do but has greatly um improved um and um hello to julia in the chat julia our newest moderator um uh i i am a lowres i don't even know what to call all these programs so this is cool to sort of like spontaneous look up let's think about what we can do as the coding train community to celebrate the 20th anniversary of processing this year okay um by the way i have no agenda this is the thing i i really want to be an organized person who plans a sort of like live stream show with an agenda and things that i'm planning to do guests a schedule i'm gonna get there someday it might not be for a long time might be when i like retire and i just could like be at home as an you know a much older person i'm already kind of old but a much older person what am i even talking about live streaming i have this fantasy plan let me just put this out into the universe right now i don't know if i should be discussing this if it makes sense but let me just put this out into the universe right now while i have you a captive audience of 322 an auspicious number by the way 322. if anyone wants to try to figure out what my connection with the number 322 is go forth i don't know let's see if anybody could come up with that i i don't think there'll be any way that anybody will figure this out but i have a certain connection with the number 322 but i'm gonna i i i have um you know knock on wood uh a sabbatical from my uh fulltime teaching job spring one year starting one year from right now and i had one previously i don't know if anybody remembers i spent uh i don't think i actually this was kind of before i even really started the coding train so i don't know why you would remember this i've been making videos since probably 2012 at least but um sorry i hear the pitter patter of little feet and i'm always wondering if someone's going to come and interrupt me um speaking of which i have to leave at three because the reason why i was able to get this live stream spot is my kids are doing a zoom baking class right now making some kind of almond flour citrus cake tart thing and at three o'clock we're going to have app speaking of london we're going to have an afternoon tea and eat that so it's gonna be done um so but let me get back to what i was talking about so i we had a wonderful adventure we lit we as a family lived in london for the semester and um i'm looking into doing that again next spring but um with covid it's sort of unclear uh what makes sense to do what's appropriate what's safe will we be back to normal we will never be back to i don't know if we ever were normal i certainly i certainly wasn't but if you live somewhere in the world where you think it might make sense for me to spend a sabbatical semester uh with family um reach out to me let me know i have some ideas i'm sort of thinking about in this um you know my fantasy actually is to uh have a a house in the country some countryside somewhere with like a barn and i could set up a whole recording studio and that would be my project for the sabbatical semester so that's when i'll be organized with my weekly live show so this is just putting this out there starting to think about it's not for a year um but um yeah i had this fantasy of living in japan i've never been to japan um i looked into that for a little bit um i don't know we'll see we'll see i might just stay here in my attic in brooklyn and have a nice semester sabbatical i'm very privileged and lucky to be able to have the the um the opportunities that i have so love the hearts popping up the screen i kind of forgot that those were there so the hearts are an overlay in open broadcast studio which is exactly based on my fireworks coding challenge it's just running directly and i put it on for something that i was uh recording oh yes i have to make this video this weekend i forgot about it um and iceland ooh that's exciting um why um uh nicobar islands i've never heard of that that's kind of interesting to think about um so but i forgot to turn them off so there they are okay so let's see i just want to um take a minute here so um let me make a list of some things let's that i might work on today and i'm going to go to the rainbow etopics uh repository which has my uh spring 2021 dock so oh oh i have something actually i got a shot this is probably a really bad idea but i'm gonna show you something um i'm gonna show you something a minute so i'm looking at this so first of all i um this is now done oh you don't see what i'm looking at apologies um i'm looking at my sort of like list of things i want to work on for this spring and this is what i recorded yesterday um and i want to talk about actually have kind of a new exciting way of recording that i thought i might mention and i also made a sample sort of pilot version of my what i'm calling javascript express dots or javascript bytes little short tutorial videos about javascript concepts i would really like to expand this list if i were a different person i would make these on tick tock or something i noticed by the way that scott hanselman and if anyone's familiar with scott hanselman is really a wonderful uh educator and works at um outreach person um so um um people are making wonderful suggestions about places england is bad who wouldn't recommend it here england is a wonderful place i have a soft spot for the uk i was just remembering some wonderful times i had there um uh one of the things that is a requirement for me in my travel is i need a place with schools in particular for what will be a fifth grader and a seventh grader and uh so like um that's that's sort of like a complicating factor i have to really plan that in advance um so what uh espresso express espresso shots so i really wanted to be train themed so like espresso that really does make sense though um but i'm gonna um play something for you i actually have i'm this is never going to be released and i haven't actually watched it i hope matia doesn't uh kill me for doing this um but um i'm looking for it i have the like just the sort of sample rough cuts about three and a half minutes of just the idea of how these videos would work so i thought maybe i'll play it for i can't find it right now um i thought i would play it for you i'm just looking for it um weird i just had it open i don't know why it's not in my history ah here it is um i'm gonna make it full screen um let me move over here uh do you see this so here i am in front of it but i'm gonna move myself away and mute myself i'm going to play this approximately three i have not watched this it's a rough cut just a sample edit of the idea of these new videos that will be less than five minutes long each and this one is about the concept of a template literal so i would love to hear your feedback what you think about it this is not live people would be confused for a second i'm gonna just again i'm gonna leave here and i'm gonna hit play i'm not 100 sure whether the audio is going to come through so if it doesn't i'll have to start over here we go one two three play okay so the audio is definitely not coming through oh let me fix that i know how to fix that uh it's not too hard uh chrome i have to turn chrome on going out to usb capture um let me get back to this full screen give me a second here and back to this and here we go again try number two what's that is that the express train it is this is a new series i've got going here where i'm going to make short bite size if you will that's right bite spell byte video tutorials about quick concepts in javascript in modern javascript that i've started to adopt in a lot of the coding challenges and other p5.js video tutorials that i'm doing and the first stop on the express train is template literals what is a template literal you have probably in your coding life done things like a in quotes plus b in quotes uh the plus operator with a string with two strings concatenates the string and we have the result a b this is particularly useful when you want a console log something for debugging and you want to console log x position colon plus the variable x however there is a much better way of doing that now in javascript which eliminates the need for this plus and it allows you to evaluate expressions directly in a string itself and if you use the back ticks and your string um x position colon if i want to now display evaluate an expression and display the result or just the value of the variable i can use dollar sign curly brackets the name of the variable curly brackets so this is the way to embed an expression inside of a string let's take a look at that actually in action in the code this is a quick p5.js example which is just displaying the time i have three variables calling hour minute and second and then i'm putting together this string i want to take the hour plus the colon plus the minute plus a colon plus the second and we can see the result right over there in the window it's about 306 pm eastern time i just spent three hours like figuring out how to get the cameras to work in a way that i could record this video so thank you very much for being here i hope i'm making sense here i am now going to change this to having a template literal i'm going to write text then i'm going to use the back tick and i'm going to say evaluate the variable h then put a colon then evaluate the variable m then put a colon evaluate the variable s and then this i would like to display this at 200 200. i can comment this out run the sketch again and it's the exact same result but now with the template literal template literals allow you to do all sorts of things you know i could actually uh have an expression like m times two that would get evaluated i'm not sure why i would want to do that but you can see the number went from 7 to 14. you can also use line breaks right inside of a template literal so if i do this we can see look at this that line break is maintained in the string and displayed in the way that i'm drawing in the canvas so this is a bit of a weird example of this circling back to the console log idea here is one of my a bouncing ball in p5.js examples and if i had some issue with it where maybe it wasn't performing the way that i had hoped i could do a console log and i could say you know x position colon x this is also a nice application of using a template literal thanks for watching see you at the next stop on the coding train express help where am i uh here i am by the way i wanted to see if we could get a quick if i could zoom in on that uh you can see here i don't know if you can see this i'm gonna zoom way and uh that is actually the coding train logo laser etched onto this train whistle which i have been that's that sort of topic of today but you can't really see that okay um oh so people are giving uh um people are giving positive feedback there so that's i was kind of planning to redo that video there's sort of some like sort of technical issues in the way that it was recorded qualitywise um but hold on let me go back to here i need to just reorient myself i didn't realize i had multiple browser things open and i'm kind of lost here all right so i'm coming back like um let me uh turn that off again and come back to here so hard to do things while you're live streaming yeah all right back to here so um bobber a slang word for a small caboose with just four wheels all rigidly mounted to the frame this design was common in the 1800s baba refers to the bouncing motion of such a caboose in motion cool that's kind of an interesting idea i like that idea it's my replacing my bell here okay um enhance yeah uh all right so um that's coming soon i you know thank you i guess i got some if anybody has any um any feedback or thoughts in particular i would really love to expand this list the thing that i'm trying to one is i'm trying to create something useful for people so that they can have very quick access to kind of understanding some new features and conventions of javascript itself that are sort of outside of the bounds of my kind of other creative coding curriculum otherwise but also um one of the things i find myself doing constantly is in every video tutorial i want to put in for example a console log and i start using a template literal and then i feel like i need to explain what template literally is and then it adds like three minutes the video and then it's in like 10 different videos so i'm trying to sort of figure out um if that's uh what if if that's what i can do okay um are you planning to record any videos in this live stream since christopher so i really have completely separated the live streaming component from the tutorial recording component so this live stream is just me blabbering on and on for about another hour and the tutorials i record separately um during the week uh in the recording studio that i use um and uh those i do live stream but i those recording sessions are pretty informal there's a lot of time of me just tinkering around but you can join as a coding trade member to have access to those streams as well otherwise just wait the videos will all be released okay um so uh let's see what i want to do simon's giving me suggestions about generator functions not for today but i do like that suggestion i have some things that i definitely want to do so i want to show you something i think i should just show this to you now because it's like one of the most exciting things that i've come across in a long time and it's a little bit outside of the scope of coding um and i'm trying to think of there must what might be some interesting ways that i could come up with a creative coding project that would make use of this technology but i want to log into runway which is a um a tool for creating content um using machine learning models that i use in a lot of different projects and tutorials um you see you seen me probably train style gan models and gpt2 models which is a generative text model um runway has introduced something called green screen and green screen you know it's what's right here it's what i use an actual literal green screen to key out the background and you'll notice that this is something that machine learning models are now able to intelligently do without a uniform background of a single color like green for example if you've been in any video calls these days which you probably have you'll might be realized like oh zoom has virtual background for example how does that work well there's a machine learning model that's been trained on a lot of images you know again i don't actually know exactly what zoom is using but i'm just speculating here i've been trained a lot of images that are labeled of people here all the pixels of the person's silhouette hear all the pixels of the background we'll learn to differentiate those here's a new image mask it out on the fly so how uh uh runway ml has a tool for doing this green screening with any video and any kind of object and it's like totally mindblowing so let me try let me log into runway for a second i'm just in case i have to like uh oh okay wait i think this is going to be perfect so the one thing that i need right now is a video so come on log in um and i'm gonna so if so by the way first of all uh you could just go to runwayml.com to follow along um you actually don't need an account and the green screen feature is totally free to use the only thing you won't have is um access to without a paid subscription is um being able to export i think the green screen videos at like 1080p but i wanted to just poke around and look at this uh briefly i'm gonna come back in a future live stream and do more with this i just wanted to sort of like start so let's see what can i do here i guess i could make just like a video of myself uh i didn't really think this through i don't have a let's see do i have a video of like gloria um let's see let me look on my uh fancy uh television phone i like to call these tv my television phone here let me search for dog and i must have a probably a cute video with gloria running around um categories dog how do i find a cute video of gloria running around here's one it's just three seconds ah that's not going to do find one somebody wants to suggest like an interesting video um this is like a really sad failure uh let me just make a video of my i'm just gonna record a video and then i'll so let's see what can i record let's try uh let's try recording a video of this train whistle we'll see how well it does um this is hard okay a little behind the scenes here of the coding train that's such a mess there's uh you're gonna see my lights and a camera and a drum set here let's hit record i'm here in an attic and i'm going to move this around this is really weird what i'm doing okay so that was about like a 10 second video let me also just do a quick video of myself just to see how well that works and um i'm gonna hold this up oh i i meant to do it uh with this aspect ratio okay okay we got two videos now uh and i am going to uh i'm gonna see if i can just transfer them to my laptop really quickly let's see if this will work i might have to turn airdrop on i think that'll probably be the most efficient way for me to do this allow me to be discovered by i'll just say everyone i had it at no i have it usually set to no one uh macbook okay i'm sending these two videos and they should be there now so let's go to here and see all right so i'm gonna so here i am um this is video one video with me uh uh moving this like mario uh toy and then the other one is here with me and moving this train whistle around uh is the audio lost no okay so let's try i think that let's try first so i'm gonna do start editing so i am going oh look they have example videos that i could pick so i probably should have just used one of these but let's upload both these um both of these videos i guess i can only do them one at a time that's fine um okay so i'm going to upload one did it upload ah there it is upload yes okay now what i'm going to do uh next is open it up so this is a a browser tool um i could watch the tutorial which would be great for me to do but i'm going to skip that right now and basically what i can do is click on elements of the scene that i want to track and mask out basically rotoscope this is equivalent of ai machine learning based rotoscoping so i'm just going to say like let me just track this and so i did three clicks and it sort of found this but i want to now say i don't want my hand maybe so i'm going to like exclude my hand so it's just tracking now just the top of this mushroom so let's see what happens if i then go to preview and it's now running the model over all the scenes oh my god look at that i don't know if you understand what's going on look what this just did i mean that is insane oh my i still like this is like so crazy to me so now what i could do is i could go back let's see what i wanted to do if i wanted to stop this and i could go back to include like what if i wanted to actually have me as part of this so i could keep including more things get my hand so now let me go to preview and see and it's a little tricky to see because i've got this green screen here but um and it let's see so could i in the place where it fails can i i think what i could do is pause and then include click some more and now uh preview again but i lost my hand which is so i guess can i keep doing this and adding more things to include where it misses it so can i do like this and then i could do exclude like i don't want this area here oh i do because that's part of the object include that's part of the object too um preview i'm just sort of like i'm trying to understand how to like iterate over this there we go i think i've got it now i think i've got it now uh there's a few see why does it now it loses my hand over where here so can i stop there and like tell it to include it see now i've lost the rest of me there so weird so this is what i'm confused about and actually this is good i'm going to send them some feedback like how do i i mean it's definitely perfect for like almost all those frames and then there's just like actually maybe i have gotten it i just want to see like this like this is right so how can i get i mean this first of all this is just crazy how well this is working but note um so how can i if i can i keep going oh look at this what are these markers here like that's weird like what does that mean like there's a marker down here on the bottom i don't know what this means but let me try to there we go get more points oh that's where i uh clicked before okay so let's see now it's re it's got to rerun the model over everything so this looks good so there were just a few there's just a few places where i've kind of like i lost my hand here okay why is why do i have exclude these are exclude points how do i delete them ah okay there we go ah okay there we go i must have clicked exclude by accident which is what was messing it up all right i think i've got it now i think i had some exclude points there by accident i don't remember clicking where i messed it up so there's just i just want to see like can i get this perfect there we go okay looking good still some like a couple i'm like obsessed with getting this exactly right oh do i need to add everything maybe i need to add everything on the different keyframes i'm doing that's what people i think that's what i'm being told like if i do this like i if i'm adding to this frame i gotta do everything so now i think pro tip don't skip the tutorial let's see how this is going okay this is looking good now just one the couple couple little glitches one is here like it's not getting my finger but now i need to make sure even on this frame i i get everything i see like if i click into one frame okay so that's good and then all right so let's okay getting everything getting everything getting everything okay so just a little break here probably because i didn't realize okay i really think that i'm gonna have this now all the dots is the keyframe delete all the dots and place the pointer in the beginning of the video okay i think i've got it now little one little glitchy spot just one little glitchy spot like right here i feel like i'm going going over and over again is wild by the way okay there we go so that was perfect there's only thing i'm like a you know me i like i get really stub obsessive and stubborn like it bothers me that this finger is missed so what i'm not realizing is that when i edit on a particular frame i've gotta sort of click on everything this is probably not really i think one thing is this is not really what it is um designed for in the sense that um it's it's much better at tracking like actual like like individual objects inside of a video and i'm kind of taking up so much of it but i think now i think now i've got something let's let's give this a try let's see perfect okay so now i can do this and i should be able to do things like under um export now give myself like a different background like this let's try that and i should be able to do export video and now it's uh i think this is the one thing that you won't be able to do um necessarily um and so let's let that export let's try the um let's try the other um video that i uploaded so let's go to videos let's try oh didn't i upload another one upload because i only did that one let's try this one um is it uploading oh there it is okay let's try this one it's loading this video now i'm just gonna click on this and hit preview now this is just only the first frame i just clicked in a few things in the first frame look at that holy moly now do i want my hand that's what i'm not sure this is crazy how well this works so let's decide i'm going to keep my hand it hates my fingers so look at that i mean pretty amazing stuff let's see if i can exclude my hand i'm curious about trying to do that so let's go to this frame that i've already done how do i tell when i'm on a frame that i've already done like i feel like it should show me the points when i can delete it i guess i can delete it but how do i change i want to like exclude well i'm just going to try this ah okay now i'm there and now i want to exclude i want to exclude my hand so it's going to be really hard and then i want to include there we go that's pretty good let's just preview now and see what happens so here for example i want to exclude my hand and include a whistle okay wow yeah it's hard for it to separate right but it's doing a pretty darn good job so if i go here and do exclude include guess what everybody welcome to illusion grenade i'm pronouncing your name correctly you join the coding train and i got sleepy in the last few minutes oh i gotta do my sponsors um your very own random number legends oh if only i could remember my french well enough uh i'll just english on page 85 column four row 4 210 your random number is 5 678. okay i'm going to put this away um hopefully like i've shown you sort of like how amazing this is um obviously like uh there's some finessing here that i would need to do to get this perfect i i i have to i have to i can't stop let's find let's let's let's improve it let's improve it i have to it's just the way that i work and then exclude the fingers okay so now let's preview this i want to get this perfect okay okay so already i want to on this frame exclude the hand there we go ah christopher tube hd welcome to the coding train it is so nice to have your membership we're getting all these new random numbers we definitely need to work on our random number pattern generator thingymabobber uh right we're so close so close everybody christopher tube hd your random number is twelve thousand one hundred twenty seven that's page two two seven column two row eleven thousand three hundred and fifteen all right uh okay ah this is pretty good oh no no no no no okay it's all right it's gonna be fine we're gonna we're gonna fix up this frame and exclude some of the fingers down here there we go and now preview it ah okay if you check the demo on the website you will see they talk about changing the background nonmoving if you move the camera it makes the video hard to parse yeah that makes sense so by the fact that the camera is not stable is probably like a major issue but look even with that look how much of this i was able to work and i'm sure if i kept at this i would get it let's um let's go to videos i'm just curious like let's pick one of their sample videos like um like this moose and let's see how this works so if i like for example what if i want this tree like i'm going to do what is unexpected with this video and now do preview it's working well with that tree that's in one place uh how do i reset can i reset everything there's got to be a reset everything or maybe i can do this remove okay so i removed that now let's click on the moose whoa this is wild okay and now uh preview pretty amazing huh now oh i guess i was like where'd its feet go it's feet are gone because it's in the snow this is pretty amazing okay so i i wanted to show this because i want to sort of like figure out like what's something i could use this for so um if you have any ideas people i hope people will try this like actually one of the things that i've run into is every once in a while i've wanted to key myself out of a video that i had prerecorded without the green screen so this is certainly a tool that i could use with that so anyway um i'm definitely curious to hear your feedback about this um and um um give this a try um and i'll return to this and try to use it a bit more in a future live stream okay um so the thing that i want to work on today uh is i want to work on okay i want to show some of the examples from um the nature of code that i've been working on i'm just looking at the chat here uh i'm gonna take just a short i've only have till like three so i'm gonna take a really short like literally just like a one minute break but before i take my one minute break i would like to thank today's sponsor of the coding train it is my friends over at brilliant um so what is brilliant um let me move over here to show you um one of um um just some of examples of what you can do on brilliant so first of all it's a new year i don't know if you know this but it's a new year and you might be like looking to start it's a little late maybe uh january 16th for new year's resolutions i'm not a big new year's resolutions kind of person but i do like to sort of start off a new year a little bit fresh um and get started like i'm doing now with the nature of code and so i think that um brilliant if you're looking for something new to sort of build into your life brilliant is something that you might um consider um thinking about it's a website it's an app it makes learning interactive accessible and fun so it's all based on problem solving and active learning so you all of the courses you can see the concepts visually and interact with them so it's another way of learning um the kinds of content that i do on the coding train but um without having to just sit and listen to somebody you can actually practice um practice uh through interactive exercises the thing that i really love about it is there's no tests no grades there's all these courses they're just they're just fun to try i constantly get stuff wrong um this uh what i'm showing you here on the screen right now is the geometry fundamentals course which is one of my favorite ones the two that i would really recommend that are kind of most um relevant to things that are on the coding train is one is the course on neural networks so if you've watched it in my videos about ai and machine learning and want to kind of dive deeper into that looking at the neural networks course on the brilliant website what i would really recommend you can see here here's an interactive example of um of a neural network recognizing digits um you can also look at oh and i just uh let me just bring this up here um this you know i constantly get in the comments of my videos uh do you have any courses on python i really want to learn python and so i don't but um brilliant has a course called programming with python which you can see you can actually type code into the lessons themselves test it run it um and there's there's this is actually something that i've been uh really excited to go through and kind of improve my knowledge of the python programming language itself so that i could eventually make um make videos so there's over 60 of these interactive courses in math science and computer science it helps you achieve your goals in stem starting with one small commitment to learning and building up to longterm challenge and growth brilliant will puzzle you surprise you and expand your understanding of the modern modern world so you can get started for free just by going to brilliant.org codingtrain um you can you can try it out and look at what's on the what's on the website um and then if you're interested in unlocking everything that brilliant has to offer with a premium subscription if you go through that link you will get a 20 discount so one one of the new courses that they just launched that i was curious to highlight for a moment is the course called statistical statistics fundamentals so let me see here i haven't looked at this one at all i saw it in the uh information that brilliant sent to me this is a new course uh i saw some of the preview images like oh this is exactly some of the stuff i talk about in the introduction to nature of code so let's go through and let's just sort of see how well i do with just this first uh quiz all right so let's see how i want to show you a little bit about how brilliant works the mean or average of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers over how many numbers are in the set okay so if i want to calculate the mean or the average of the numbers 3 5 and 10 i add them all together i divide by 3 and i get 6 perfect so in the visualization below the purple dot above the line automatically oh is it um simon is correcting me is it not statistics fundamentals that's the newest course is it statistics one is that different simon simon is like uh always helping me out uh um i love how the audience helps me out with brilliant stuff but i'm gonna look at this anyway and then and then let me know if i if i if i'm in the wrong one simon how do i get to the correct one um but let's go with this one anyway because i love i like how this exercise looks in the visualization below the purple dot above the line is automatically shows the mean of a b c and d ah so like if i change if i change the number we can see how the average is changing look at this so this the one of the things i love about this is it's like oh i want to build this in p5.js now i don't know if this is exactly the thing i want to build but they're um every time i go through one of their exercises it's like especially though some of the geometry ones and that there's some uh physics related ones are always giving me ideas um um okay so um uh let's see let's go to courses simon is really telling me that there's one called statistics one so i'm gonna see if i can find it um browse all probability statistics and finance probability fundamentals statistics fundamentals i'm going to look i'm going to look here find this information statistics one yeah there i see i have the link uh brilliant.org slash courses uh advanced statistics dash i there we go this is the course that i was meant to find thank you simon for correcting me i was looking at an older design so this is their with their sort of newer design and newer animations so let's look at the first quiz here um let's go back for a second and read here decisions and judgments we made we make are based on limited or incomplete information amidst all this uncertainty statistic plays a special role so the first quiz is going to explore how probability is used in statistics to make informed decisions so we're looking at rupert here uh built a lucrative career convincing his audience that he can defy the very laws of nature but it's all sleight of hand and wellcrafted illusions designed to fool the senses so when he hears about alberta the oracle who claims that she draws the answer to any yes or no question from supernatural sources he set out to determine the truth for himself rupert thinks alberta is just a good guesser right i'm using my clone clone wars voice again so he gathers a stockpile of yes or no questions that only he can answer and then heads out for magicians alliance hq one cold and foggy night to put the oracle out to the test okay in the oracle's parlor rupert takes a seat thanks his host for the opportunity then poses his first question suppose for the moment that alberto really does just guess the answer to every question she's been given by responding yes or no with equal probability what's the pro oh i think i'm going to get this one right i was so worried this is going to be too hard for me what's uh uh what's the probability that alberta answers rupert's first question correctly just by guessing by the way my kids who are currently in fourth and sixth grade probability is something that i always try to talk to them about um and it's really um it's a i love seeing sort of like i mean they're not really really young children i'll say that sort of child's eye view of how to make guesses according to probability and what kind of assumptions they make and they're actually learning about probability and fractions in school so this is actually this is great i should really go through this with them but um let's see what's the probability that alberta answers rupert's first question correctly just by guessing so i think this is going to be one out of two right if there's only two possible answers and you pick one randomly well one of them is correct one of them is wrong one out of two is correct let's try that correct and this one by the way 98 of people got this right um and one of the things i like about uh brilliant by the way is it um it's very kind to you uh and gives you like sort of positive encouraging fact there's nothing wrong in fact like one of my my happiest moments doing these kinds of things when i get them wrong so um ah and this is great it's talking about probability distributions so this is perfect um i'm gonna pause stop here because i want to take a break and get back to some of the stuff that i want to code today but you can see how this kind of content really just aligns with creative coding the kinds of concepts you think about when programming systems and visualizations and i hope that you'll consider checking it out and if you do check it out if you go to um brilliant.org codingtrain that lets them know that you found uh brilliant through the coding train um and uh helps me out a little bit okay so uh thank you so much i've lost the chat um and azam is saying i am only eight years old hi awesome welcome i hope it's not too late at night for you and you should be in bed go to sleep young person it's your internet dad telling you um but i'm so glad that you're here that's so kind of you um so i'm gonna literally just take a break that is um uh two minutes long um and i would encourage you to sign up for brilliant during this break and i'll be right back to get working on some actual code projects i got to work on again i got to work on my sort of like live streaming um plans i'll be back in just a minute do do all right i am back very short break as promised and i am going to do some coding now uh so um one of the things that i started um that i will the the thing that i'm working the most on right now uh let's just see if we can find this um this is what i'm looking at um this um this particular playlist um is a playlist of videos for the nature of code book that i was working on a year ago i got all the way up to uh chapter two and i started recording the first three videos for chapter three so the topic of chapter three if i go to the book um is oscillating motion and um so if i go to the web editor i can sort of um that i was using as i was recording the tutorials yesterday i could sort of pull up some of the examples real quick so for example the thing that i started with is just looking at how to deal with angular motion so how to keep track of an angle that you increment over time and use translate and rotate to spin something in p5 a very basic starting concept from there i moved on to um kind of adding the idea of angular velocity and angular acceleration so here as i move the mouse back and forth i can kind of as if i'm applying a force to spin this um so you can sort of see this is what this is what the video tutorials are going through um i also uh then i'm just looking at these uh nature of code angular motion kind of added that idea to these objects that are from the gravitational forces examples so these objects are turning and rotating based on how they're moving about this space not in a realistic way in a somewhat arbitrary way just recapping what's going to come up in these videos what was next from there i looked at how you can have something using uh using sort of thinking about angles with vectors how you can take those objects and have them point in the direction that they're moving so you can see that's happening here in this example all of these examples will be with the video tutorials i'm getting somewhere trust me i'm getting to a point of this uh and then i looked at how this is related to um kind of also this idea of like aster the of a of a asteroids like ship so if i can like if i have the angle that the ship is pointing i can create a vector from that angle and then apply a force in that direction and that's what this example is so um and i think um i think here this was also just another example that i worked on in order to be able to like turn something so um okay so what do i want to do right now in the very first video for this chapter i kind of talk about the overview of all the examples and where oscillating motion if anybody from any of the members who were tuning in yesterday you can help me remember i remember one of the things i said as an example is plucking a guitar string i think i also said waves so when the video comes out i want to be able to show some of these examples and have additional examples that i won't necessarily like make a video for but that will so that's one of the things i really need to work on right now um i want to see if i can get the sort of guitar string thing um the idea of plucking a string and having it oscillate like a wave pattern see if i can make that right now and so where i need to go to do that is i'm first going to go to all of the nature of code examples and i'm going to look for the spring example which is in see these uh chapter three eleven so this is my oh okay great so this is an example that i will be making a video about how to create this example so let's duplicate it i don't know if this is going to be a good base for what i want to do but let's do let's call this guitar string so i don't know why i have things like set frame rate in here this was made very long time ago let's change this to let it has this idea of a spring and a bob and the spring can connect the bob and then it can constrain its length and then i can draw it as a line display the bob so why i would i really would prefer and i probably should do this with toxic lips i don't know if that would be a cheat because ultimately what i want is for this uh just to have the idea of a particle and then i connect the spring between two particles so let's see let's see how i have an anchor for a spring ah okay the there's an anchor and then the force is calculated between the another object and the anchor so i think what this should be is i should i'm gonna rename this oh look how oh my god this is like the most ancient thing ever wow okay i'm gonna have to really redo these i haven't looked at this stuff in a while so i'm going to rename this to particle and i'm going to change it to a class and then this is going to be constructor so i have to convert this to be es6 classes um i don't need to drag this anymore i wonder if this is actually not a good base you know what i think i always want to start over from scratch to like remind myself this is helping me prepare for when i record the tutorial next week so i'm gonna i'm not gonna totally start but i'm gonna just get rid of this dragging stuff i guess maybe i should keep it to be able to test it no i'm gonna sorry i'm gonna keep it i'm gonna keep it i'm gonna make these things that i could drag around i have it in there there's no reason to delete it let's make the uh update function uh the apply force function um this constant the display function and handle click like do i click on it function so what you're watching me right now is literally just converting an old example which uh before there was such a thing as classes in javascript i wrote it in a different way and these little semicolons are bothering me here so i'm going to get rid of those and first thing i should do is just make sure it still works the only thing i changed now is this is now a particle um and this is still work uh particle is not defined uh why is that sketch line 16 didn't oh i i renamed the file also okay so this has to be particle okay so this still works okay what i want to do now is basically i want to make i'm going to call something anchor and i want to make an anchor a new particle which is at width divided by 2 like 0 basically and the spring i want to permanently i want to change the way this works want i want to create the spring as a connection between the anchor and the bob without a separate function let's get rid of this constrain thing for a second um and we're gonna add anchor update um this is weird because i i did this in a very different way but let's just see if i can get this to work so now i probably should have started over to i think this is i'm gonna get so this is no longer a thing connect a and b so this and i i was my children were calling to me um okay so this dot a equals a this dot b equals b and then the update function is going to so i think the idea let's let's actually let's let's put it in the constructor so a spring should connect two particles and then in the update function i should calculate the force between the two particles and then that's all and then apply that force to both particles but it should be um it would it goes in opposite directions so copy the force to this one multiply by negative one i'm not sure if this makes sense we're gonna see again i think i'm a little hesitant about the way that i'm doing this um but um let's not worry about the constrain length right now um cannot read springline 82 i've got some like weird error uh in display i don't want to display the particles in here i want to display it as um a line between these two things okay i will be done in like about 20 minutes and we'll come down i see it i see it i see it thank you uh oh what have i gotten i've got myself down a rabbit hole that i didn't mean to get myself down um okay this is all gonna come okay great okay we're back to something all right now let's see if i can get this constrain length to work uh minimum length maximum length so the the of the vector between the two is between this dot a and this dot b's position these are two particles and um reset the position and stop it from moving okay i can't do the constrain right now help me everybody i've lost my mind oh my god i should have started from scratch says everybody [Laughter] oh my god this is i definitely should have started from scratch i thought i was doing something much simpler than i ended up welcome to the story of my life all right hold on everything's gonna be okay we're gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna slow down for a second and i'm gonna get rid of the spring so i have two particles okay and i just wanna see those two particles for a second let's get rid of the spring stuff so there's going to be a spring like update function eventually and there's bob update bob display anchor update anchor display and um we're going to apply gravity to both of these okay great so this is what i was hoping to see all right when i run this sketch i see two particles both falling with gravity now they look like something i think they must have a oh there's a damping effect let me take out the damping effect right now great so that looks more there's no there's no damping no resistance they're both just falling and then the spring exists should be visualized as a line between those two so if i go here and say spring.display cannot read display of undefined let me create the spring the spring should just be connecting the two particles and have like a rest length it's going to need like a spring constant that's what it should be this idea of the spring connecting two particles by the way i'm going to totally redo this chapter i'm realizing because this is the way i should write the example there's two particles and then the spring connects them and so the constructor should it doesn't need an xy it needs a rest it needs two particles and a rest length this should also be a variable so this should be like k like the spring constant should be something i pass in and these are the two particles okay and then so i'm kind of starting over from scratch and away so i'm going to pass in the 0.2 okay so now i have this idea of two particles and a spring now one of the things i definitely want to do is i want to say anchor dot lock so i want to have a function in the particle class where i'm going to say this dot locked is false and then if i call the lock function i'm going to say this dot locked is true i'm going to make it so that this particular object cannot be um cannot be moved it's like locked it's like anchored so the anchor i want to lock and if that's the case i think what i basically would say is the update function would be rendered irrelevant so this dot if it's not locked then update its location so now what i should see is right the top one is locked but the bottom one's just stretching out because the string is not act the spring is not activated so now in the update function this should apply the spring force to both objects a and b so what would happen now if i were to activate it a is not defined okay so this is the function i need to work on to get this spring force to work um so in update spring line 20 ah it's this dot a position this dot b's position okay and it's this dot a b this dot a apply force okay interesting um i think maybe it's the other way around yeah all right yes so you can see the spring is working it's activated now is my drag working yes it is okay great so now there's no damping there's no damping uh so it's kind of gonna spiral out of control that's one thing i need to think of but also uh um there is um damping is something i need to think about and what's the other thing i need to think about oh the length constraining i want to see if i can get this constrained spring to work so how would i do that so what if i wanted to actually call here like spring constrain length between 10 and 200 so this is totally artificial but i'm just curious what happens and maybe i don't need this what happens if i um were to kind of constrain it so no matter what i do it can't um it can't go beyond that and maybe this is not let let's not work on this right now let's assume i don't need that for what i want to do so first thing i want to do is just sort of see what happens if i don't lock the anchor the problem is i need to be able to catch it okay so some interesting stuff is going on i i also like let me um let me get rid of gravity like i don't actually want gravity here that was interesting to add yeah so this is doing what i expect but something weird is happening um it's like a little glitchy so why is it a little glitchy handle click handle drag ah so i think i should be saying bob dot lock well let's see uh particle handle click dragging offset handle drag it's moving the position uh i think and um i think what i want to do let me work on this lock and unlock let me make an unlock function i mean it's a little silly i could just have one function that i pass in true or false and we have a new member hunter i need to give hunter their random number in a moment um so i think i think also i need to like i think if it gets locked i should be clearing its velocity and acceleration like why is it on why am i losing it hold on so i mean this is just an interaction thing which isn't super important to what i want to do handle click handle drag stop dragging oh only so i think actually why do i have this in mouse dragged i don't think i want that i think that's the issue the particle is if it's being dragged yeah i want to do this always so um so i want to not just when the mouse is dragging i actually want to all i don't know why i had that you sort of think it would make sense but i want to be able to do this yeah this is what i want to do okay so now i can move this around i think i'm going to put some damping in because and there's probably a more thoughtful way to do this but let's add the um let's add this damping back in let's also say that when i am when i'm dragging it it's also locked so i think this is redundant now so i think i have the same variable doing the same thing but let me just lock and unlock it also when i'm dragging it yeah come back all right this is great this is what i want because you're going to see what i want to do in a second so i can move this around and then you can see they're like bouncing off each other okay this is great this is perfect exactly what i want nice little dampening the reason why i want to do this and again i need to make a proper video tutorial that builds this whole thing up but i just wanted to try to like make the example here during the live stream the reason why i'm doing this is now in the main sketch i should be able to and sorry that i'm like in front of the code here um see if i can um which way do i move over this way move over a little bit this way uh let me see if what i can do here is make an array of particles and springs and then i'm going to say particles index 0 is this one particles index 1 is this one the spring is connecting particle 0 and particles particles one okay and then for let p of particles p dot update p dot display and then for let s of springs s dot display s dot update and then p handle drag and then here also for let p of particles all right so let's see here now okay something went wrong i'm able to drag these around but i lost the spring force ah springs index zero there we go and i can drag either of them and they're always attached with this spring there's no constraints should the spring update before displaying you know yes um to be consistent i think that makes sense but ultimately it's a draw as a loop so it doesn't really matter but now what i should be able to do and let me just change this just so we can sort of see things better and like the particle is so large i want to um where is displaying the particle oh this dot mat there's a mass going on here uh that's kind of not being used right now in this example but that's fine let's make this 8. okay so the reason why i'm doing this you'll see in a second is i want to do this in a loop now so i want to create can you see the code i think you can i want to say let's make 10 let's just make five particles and let's do them actually two at a time and we're going to say the first particle i the next one i plus one is you know what actually let's do this let's make five oh no no no no no i always need to connect the previous to the next one so i'm not going to do them two at a time so i'm going to start with that there's a previous particle but at the beginning it's no i'm going to say if previous exists then let make a spring which connects previous to particles index i the one that i'm just making separate them by 50 with this okay so the idea here and then previous will equal particles index i so in my loop i'm making five particles um where i'm connecting connecting each one to the previous one and their where their location should be is i like times 50. okay so that kind of makes sense but none of these are okay all right because now i need to put the springs into the array and get rid of this okay so now i should have yeah there we go this is what i was hoping to create awesome now i should really be using like a proper verlet physics engine that's going to be less prone to error but even just with the sort of basic idea this works and now what i would like to do is let's say let's make the height 700 um your height divided by 50 i'm gonna do that many um that many and then i want to take the first one and say lock and the last one and say lock oh wait it didn't lock how come they didn't lock uh is my lock not working oops oh no particle locked equals true if it's not locked do all this otherwise that oh ooh this is bad so i'm uh the lock is a permanent thing that's not okay i got it so this should be if it's not locked and it's not dragged i mean not currently being dragged so if either of these are the case so locked and dragging are kind of different and when i click on it uh handle click uh the lock is a separate thing uh that's automated but lock is something that i'm doing okay i think this should fix that all right so the top are locked so i want to make this like i'm plucking a guitar string so they're gonna have to be like much much tighter right like how do i make it how can i get this to be like plucking a guitar string so i probably need that constraint or like what would you know what if um like connect them all to one single one that's interesting offset equals 50. so if i do this offset is now a variable so what if i make the offset 10. what if i make the offset 150 so and now okay so what will this do like what if i make this one that's better it's like tighter and 25 it's kind of a cool example but it's nothing like plucking a guitar string the springs um hold on so me i am sumi is writing a comment um the springs should be in the default state be quite stretched instead of having their natural length be the offset to be much smaller that makes sense so in other words they're uh what if i make their rest length half that makes a lot of sense let's go back to 50. yeah and what if i did that in even more extreme way yeah that's more like a guitar string that's a little bit better um that's helpful in pre increase the spring constant like how much can i really increase that spring constant like so one thing also that i can do now is not display the particles anymore there we go it's hard for me to click on anything because i don't know where to click that's pretty good actually it's better than i thought i would get here um let's try making the offset less i'm being told whoa that's a cool wave oh that's wild actually this is really this makes me want to do the following by the way to like sort of see this wave all right i'm gonna um paste this into um discord if you're not in the discord um you should join up uh here's a link to joining the discord into the chat um but um you should be able to get this code right now if people want to work on trying to get it very guitarlike i would appreciate that um and then i will be able to uh capture that to go into the beginning of the video let's see um let me go back let me let me work on this a little bit more i've got to finish up here it's three o'clock um that the the uh cooking the baking class ends it's time for our afternoon tea but let's see um let's see here let me go back to keeping them further apart and let me see how much and i'm just going to take that away that was an interesting let's let's oh this is irrelevant let's see how much i can push that spring constant um let's like make it five i think that's probably gonna be make it go crazy that's pretty good six i can't see where to pluck it yeah it's pretty good um all right let's uh let's change something here whoops um and let's change this to i just want to make it horizontal wait what just happened ah i'm a little confused why you don't just use the force to set the amplitude of a sine wave draw the sine wave instead of the line yes so i i i do want to cover sort of like using a sine wave but i was just trying to do this with spring with the actual spring force just to see how that would go i have to just guess where's the particle um so this is great i think that i can um um yeah i think that i can uh this is going to be good enough for just like the quick example that's going to be shown in the intro video um i'm curious to like how far i can push like the stretch length i think i need to you know what i should do i have an idea if mouse is pressed display the particle so i can now i can see where they are if you wiggle it reasonably fast you can get standing waves at multiples of the bass frequency quite easily anyway i'm happy with this right now um this is kind of this is basically what i wanted to do um just get like a quick example of something like this um which is perfect um i wonder if you could make an object drop on top of it like a trampoline that's a great idea that's a great idea anyway so i hope that people uh can play with this and make something kind of fun with it uh this will be an example of this will be coming in my videos honestly if this is trying to make this i really should just use toxic libs which is a library that's got this kind of physics engine built into it i don't know why this is this is very um my one of my kids homework assignments for their like tech class was to make an oddly satisfying video and this is very oddly satisfying um so i will i'm going to save this and come back to this later okay um i have to go i haven't been doing a good job of showing community contributions it's something i need to get back into um maybe uh let's show let's uh i'm gonna be leaving in the next be um turning off the stream in the next few minutes this was kind of like the main thing that i wanted to work on um and hopefully people will play with this example and make some stuff um but let me just quickly um get our wheel here um because why not look at one thing that somebody from the community has made um we can spin this wheel oh you are not getting the sound effects quad tree and flocking simulation let's take a look at this one so by the way if you're wondering what's going on in all in just about every single um video that's on the coding train website um if you go to the page for the video there's a place where you can add your own version of the video and you can see for example for this one nobody's added one so this one is totally blank and if you add it it gets added to a database again we've really got a lot of work to do to get all these systems talking to each other that i can then pick one randomly and feature it in a live stream i aspire to do much more of this but i'm just going to do one right now this is created by ernst schmidt the original challenge is the flocking challenge and if we click over here we're going to see hopefully this is going to load oh wow so this is looking at my flocking video and uh presumably and adding the sort of quad tree which is a way to make it more oh and hunter park's random number yes 100 parks thank you for remembering i'm going to do that before i go this is a wonderful methodology for improving performance in any type of system where every object has to check the location of every other object so what the quadtree is doing is it's allowing each one of these boyds to only look at their neighbors that are registered in one of these cells that's near to them without that quad tree um you know especially if i up the unit count to 600 this is amazing by the way i need to remember this when i'm demonstrating flocking because i'm trying to show all of these different behaviors and uh the capacity and how to make this work this is this is incredible this is like everything i ever wanted in my own flocking quadtree example big train whistle shout out to um ernst schmidt who created this ernstschmidt.com is their website we can take a look at it and boy everybody should check out ernst schmidt's website um wild this is that's really incredible work thank you for that i'm hoping somehow the universe will help me remember when i go to make the videos about flocking that i can show that example really terrific okay i can hear my children yelling to me so couple last things before i go first oh wrong wrong button hunter parks thank you so much for your membership and support oh my god this desk i need to buy a new desk people anybody have any desk recommendations can you this is like about to like totally collapse everything's gonna just fall and crash to the ground i want a nice standing desk that they can move up and down um your random number is hunter page 273 column zero row thirteen thousand six hundred fifteen forty nine thousand and eighty uh that's your random number hold on to that random number and i am now going to show you all very quickly two quick things um that i am looking for contributions and help with let's go to the desktop let's go to whistles and um it's not uh all right hold on everyone let's go to github.com codingtrain i've gotta go 306. t time um repositories random whistle here we go this is probably the same as what i've got but just in case so let's take a look at this in visual studio code this is uh that's fine i can look at everything on the desktop here this is a project which basically um what it does is and let's uh does it have a note server involved with it i can't remember it's just yeah no it doesn't um what what are you kidding me um web server prayer okay working what this website does is uh so what was the random number there uh somebody give me uh let's say hunter park's random number was somebody quickly i could scroll to the past chat give me one of your random numbers anybody from today whether it's uh abe uh um etc i need a random number i need a random number you guys are so far behind me in time it's no problem waiting waiting waiting waiting waiting i'm gonna get one drum roll please chad come on 49 080 thank you hunter so 49 080 was hunter's random number so now when i click generate what this is going to create is a random walk pattern that's been seated with that particular random number so this is hunter park's unique random walk pattern and where this is going to go is i had did i have this video under downloads on your desktop um shoot do i have this this is all from i showed it last stream i wanted to show that is this it yeah i think this is it yeah there we go so this is going to go on to and let me zoom ahead so the idea is i'm making these train whistles uh for members and that this pattern will be generated uh it was downloaded here then it will be laser etched onto this particular uh whistle and sent out um to the member now at the moment uh this is quite a a it's not that expensive but quite a process for this so i'm just giving this for people i think it's at the conductor's level um but eventually i'd like to give this to all members and everyone in the world should have their own train whistle but that's what's going on here so what i would really like is help with this repo i mean this website needs to have some new features for example it needs to be explained what it's doing designed a bit more nicely it needs to have some kind of database associated with it where members can keep track of their numbers and see their patterns maybe i want the code snippet to also be generated as part of it so if you would like to contribute to this um oh and of course it's on um there there's a readme here thank you to violet who put this together there's some suggestions for things we're looking to fix um and um that um and also i think it is live using github pages so i probably should add a link just to the readme of where it is but if i go under settings or if i just go to uh coding train dot github dot io slash random whistle there we go you'll see it here um so this url so let me paste this into discord so i would love for folks i meant to work on this more during the live stream today but and like add some features or chat about it but um uh obviously i didn't get to that so i just wanted to quickly show that for anyone who's still watching uh please come in and help with that the other thing i wanted to mention that i did um uh if i go back here to uh gump 500 what's what's the chance no this is not gonna okay so um one of the things that i did i'm gonna just show you this that i learned i taught myself and i would like to make some videos about oh there is a dot env file there hold on a sec everybody okay no it doesn't have what i need in it um i have been um learning how to uh work with uh mongodb i have some videos on firebase as a database as a service so i got it to work this again people have no idea what i'm talking about but this was a project i worked on last live stream and i think it's live hosted via glitch at gump 500 let me go to um let me just open it up on glitch i'll show it to you there yep so what this does i know you can't see it yet i'm going to show it to you in a minute is we come back here this project which is on github but also hosted on glitch it is basically keeping track of anyone on twitter who posts a message with the uh a certain number of miles that they've run and um um and then it keeps track of that miles and it's part the that number of months are uh i bring i'm a little brain dead all of a sudden so if i go to twitter and look at uh forest 500 um let's go to um i think this is where i was experimenting with it so if you use this hashtag gump500 here we go forrest gump 500 this is just a initiative for people to motivate themselves to run 500 miles in one year and i'm really trying to participate in this and so um i wanted to build something that could help keep track of people who are participating in this so basically if you go and i'm let's just let's do an example right now if i say tweet gump 500 and i ran actually today i did run i ran three miles today i'm going to tweet this right now i'm going to go back to this project i'm going to look in the logs it's listening to twitter there you go it just r it got this tweet it noted the time um it added oh i don't know why it got .1 miles there's a mistake in it right now why did it get point one out of three miles um and it uh added it to the database it found the document in the database and that matched the criteria and updated it and then now if i refresh this oops i didn't need to refresh the whole project i meant to just refresh the web page you can see that it went to 3.1 miles i'm not sure why it got point one so there's a mistake in it currently um so um so again i wanted to work on this more because i want to have like a nice visualization more error handling i want to figure out way for people who are developing it to be able to work with like a local database that's just a sample database um so but i've run out of time i'll have to come back to this on another live stream but these are um these are two sort of like community projects that i'm looking for help and contributions come and join the discord it's a great place to discuss this stuff um and all of that all of all the things so stay tuned this is it this is the end of today's stream um i'm looking for my goodbye song thanks for tuning in to today's coding train live stream next week on the cutting train i'll be back talking about more things like i'm talking about right now um oh it added three miles yeah hold on hold on let me see people are telling me it was not a mistake ah okay this was not a mistake it's finding the this is a console log that's finding this particular user and showing what was there previously and it doesn't show that's before it was updated so if i did another tweet um right here people are replying to me and if i said um add two more miles to my toto total oh boy i don't know i don't think it will work if i put more in there i have to say too much the regular expression tracking is not so intelligent so now if i go there let's see if that comes up did i not did i forget the oh there it is sorry ah now we see yes that was last saturday 0.1 miles then this one so now it should be the total should be 5.1 and the total is 5.1 so i have no way to um for a user tweeting from their account to subtract miles that's something i should definitely add um just to set the total like somebody might be like joining this initiative and again this is all honor systems so somebody could just tweet like this person did i ran 500 miles like i don't know who you're what you're so i don't know how to deal with some sort of form of moderation this is just sort of an honor systems thing but um but i would like to add a feature where if you said like subtract miles from my total um or maybe just set the total two so if i were joining it right now but i'd already run 30 miles like 10 times three miles each like i wouldn't want to have to tweet 30 10 times so there should be like a set total so those are things i want to add to this but really what i would love is some nice visualization stuff and then i gotta i think smarter every day is kind of running this initiative i haven't contacted him to see if wants to like do anything official with it i mean using the hashtag it could also set up a twitter account where you at mention it it's more of a bot that's listening to at mention and replying but those are some things that i'm interested in people um adding oh i gotta go for tea time i have ten i'm 20 minutes late already for tea time um just looking to see so um so stay tuned for new nature of code videos coming out i think to be honest i might that's my focus i might be the live stream should be about two or three per month they're not going to be every week i don't know what day yet um so stay tuned join the discord um if you one thing i wanted to mention because a lot of people are asking how do i know when you live stream so uh let me go into the discord um this is where i post links to things so for example i should right now post a link to this um gump 500 project um let me post that into discord but if you're looking to get notifications for when i'm live streaming this is what you want to do you want to join the discord and subscribe i don't use an at everyone so i you opt in to these notifications but i post updates here pretty frequently about my schedule and for example like today it was very last minute but i just said live stream incoming in 20 to 30 minutes so this is where um so somebody if somebody could remind me how you um subscribe to the notifications i think it's just like if i go to um i want to go to a channel that nobody can post in but me just for a minute i'm just going to go into useful links um like i think i'd say like i think it's just like exclamation point subscribe as the command yeah removed so that removed the notification for me so i want that back so i'm gonna subscribe and then i'm just gonna delete these messages i'll do that in a minute because they don't need to be here in this channel but this is how um you subscribe to get those notifications um thank you to the streambot team who maintains this uh discord bot in the coding train um discord and if you want to learn how to make your own discord bot might i suggest going to thecodingtrain.com under learning under discord bots this is my whole set of there's now six videos uh stepping you through how to make your own discord bot with no.js i do have some more that i want to make we'll see if i get to them but that's coming all right everybody thank you for tuning in you are wonderful i love you all see you next week on well i don't know if i'll see you next week but see you next time on the coding train all right goodbye everybody as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this dot all right i've got to shut everything down everybody i'll see you next time goodbye never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me
