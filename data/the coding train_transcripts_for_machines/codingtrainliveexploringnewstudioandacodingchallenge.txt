do do so do hi everyone test one two it looks like to me like the audio is only coming through in one year assuming you're listed with your ears uh one side the left channel so let me work on fixing that give me one moment and if you can confirm in the chat you hear me but only through the left channel that's helpful information i realized my ball is probably low relative to music as well i gotta fix that all right i'm back and hopefully in both of your ears um the mic is mono but it needs to be sent to both channels and i believe it is and i'm just switching to the next song this song means there is one minute and three seconds left so it's time for me to begin and boy am i uh trying to get together this together at last minute so i'll see you in about a minute a few more things to plug in and unplug oh i don't have my headphones on you know what we're going to live without those for today i will see you in a moment of muting myself do hello good morning happy coding train friday i am coming to you live from the hudson valley of new york state uh in a garage with new lights a new monitor car a little confidence monitor attached to my camera am i looking at you does this look like i'm speaking directly to you because right now i'm just looking at myself but if i look at the camera lens now i'm really looking at the lens but typically my eye goes up to look this way and i would just like to know if i look at myself while i'm talking do you feel the connection between us i know it might seem a little bit forced and fake now that you realize that i can't actually see you oh there's an airplane flying overhead there's a truck delivering something gloria is hanging out in the grass and the sunshine programmer 171 is writing in the chat i am 13 years old and i love your videos i code in java for most of my games and i like your videos because they can be easily understood by anyone ah programmer 171 you just made my day thank you for that wonderful feedback um my son is also 13 years old his new hobby i guess maybe i shouldn't be broadcasting this all across the internet but i'm about to do it anyway is building mechanical keyboards so stay tuned for a future coding train live session here in this garage where i build a mechanical keyboard and if you happen to be a mechanical keyboard builder expert person i would love to hear from you you could write messages in the chat but i'm only going to very rarely turn my head this way to see them i see right now julian is saying first time catching you live welcome first timers to codingtrain live a little like ding dong discord sound just went off i have no idea where that's from or if i got a message somewhere i have too many screens many screens oh i have so many new things to show you before i do any of that let me quickly thank and boy boy all of you should really thank this sponsor uh curiositystream you can sign up at curiositystream.com codingtrain um it helps curiosity stream keeps the engine running um what is curiosity stream you might be asking oh i'm going to show you i'm going to do like a better sponsor segment in the middle because i have some things i want to show you but let me test out some of my new technology oh look this is curiosity stream um it is a wonderful streaming documentary uh uh um is a streaming thing oh i can't i'm not prepared did i mention i'm not prepared i'm sorry curiosity stream i'm doing my best i'm doing my best please don't fire me um curiosity stream is a streaming service with lots of wonderful documentaries um so many things related to let's see if i can do this ah now i'm in the screen too uh related to this channel um i particularly love the nature and environment stuff that's kind of what i enjoy watching but i think if you're a coding trained viewer the science on the map i'm looking for any of dr hannah fry's uh videos um uh ancient engineering becoming a martian look at all this stuff i have not there's just so much stuff to watch there it is magic numbers it's for me yes it is for me but uh even better than just uh telling you about curiosity stream um and but i'm not even doing so i have a whole script for my sponsor segment later and this was just me like warming up i'm kind of going off into my script but it's not scripted and i'm not prepared i'm sorry i'm doing my best uh we're gonna get to coding today some coding is gonna happen um but um i am part of a streaming service called nebula which is a bunch of educational creators on youtube got together uh from standard and started this streaming service i think if i go here and the thing about curiosity stream is if you sign up through that link um you're gonna get a uh it says it in the description of this video see how unprepared i am without my script um i i think it's i just don't want to say the wrong uh amount oh i'm doing so well this is good thank you uh the practice later where where where is my uh oh yeah here's my uh no um uh there it is no find find ah find your secret key no that's my instructions for one password um yes 26 percent off that's less than 26 off um the for the whole year curiosity stream for 14.79 that's like a little bit more than a dollar per month if you do the math and you get a nebula for free well i was telling you about nebula uh nebula has all this amazing stuff i want to talk to you about this better elevation series i got to do that later and bring my break if you want to support the coding train there are so many ways you could do so and one of those ways is to sign up uh for curiosity stream at curiositystream.com codingtrain okay this was rehearsal right everybody okay great rehearsal i'm gonna get ready to live stream now let's go to the um let's go to the um starting animation oh i don't have a button for that because i forgot to set that button there it is let's put the music on okay i'm going to mute my audio that was a great rehearsal everybody everybody my whole team here production team director producer cube card holder uh hair and makeup department all of you here with me in the garage just me there's nobody else but me uh and here we go i'm ready to go live in three two one hello welcome to the coding train coming to you live from the hudson valley of new york thank you today's sponsor curiosity stream sign up for garage free stream at crossroadsteam.com codingtrain for 26 off 14.79 cents for the whole year a whole amazing library of wonderful documentaries for you to watch and you get nebula the streaming service for free i'll come back later and tell you a bit more about that during my sponsor segment okay now let's see here all right now that we got that all out of the way um what am i going to do today so first things first um i want to just sort of talk you through what i've got going on here in the studio at some point i would very much like to make a studio sorry there's a huge truck do you hear that so i moved and the truck is delivering a bed i've been sleeping on the floor for quite a while the mattress on the floor it's perfectly fine the bed has been delivered this giant truck is trying to get out of the driveway now it already was delivered i'm feeling very stressed out about it uh anyway live live i would say like welcome to live tv but this is not tv nope never never made it onto tv i'm an old person who who uh i don't know if i ever even auditioned to be on tv but nobody ever nobody said to me hey you should be on tv i just said to myself i should be on tv and then i made a youtube channel and here i am on your tubes so let's talk about the new studio so um what you're seeing is camera one camera one is pointing at this desk uh you can actually see i don't know why this button is broken but i'm just gonna go to here this is actually what the camera is seeing it is me standing in front of a green curtain i have a new light over here you can see how bright that is i'm to turn it off for a second i don't this is not hooked up it has a network plug but it is not hooked up so now it is darker i also have another light over here which i have hooked up to the network so i can press a button on my steam stream deck and it goes off so i'm turning this one on i'm going to turn the other one on um one thing that i haven't really had a chance to do is sort of sort out all the settings on my camera like it's a sony uh alpha 7 3 is the camera that i'm using and i've it's at some arbitrary iso i think there's other camera settings uh white balance color temperature so i'm curious in general if you happen to be a video expert or just a person watching any feedback i'm not going to really get it now i would suggest joining the discord and that's a place where you can more reliably pass along some feedback that will get to me uh in terms of the lighting and setup of this view um i would um and you can see like i've got the full uh full green here um and now this is open broadcast studio in a stream deck i press this button it switches me to this view i have another button for the banner just have a background my dream now is to have i mean i've been doing this forever and it's essentially the same thing that you've always been watching but it's just sort of set up a new i mean uh david and the discord was pointing out to me that like i've set up a new studio like four times in the last two years this is going to be i'm hoping the studio for the next well at least one year and probably two years and then we'll sort of see from there i mean maybe forever uh or three months from now i'll be like hey i'm moving again um but um i forgot what i was saying ah so this is it keyed oh my dream is to start having like coding train uh code examples and animations and easter eggs popping up and maybe some realtime interaction stuff so all of that is coming i just want to be able to see the chat here oh so over here i have like a monitor which has open broadcast studio running i see the youtube chat in theory i see the discord chat but i unfortunately that disappeared um you hear the truck says prathamesh in the discord chat um hi again to naresh so uh i'm trying to do a better job one of the reasons why i got this extra confidence monitor is it encourages me to look this way and look at the camera i often find myself live streaming like this but the reason why i like having a monitor over here is the other view that i have takes this laptop hdmi out brings it in i have a brand new streaming pc that's really the big difference here and i've had to like install and set everything up and has been doing it since about 8 30 a.m i thought two hours will be enough but we'll see i did some of it last friday so if i switch here i believe if i press this button this is just the raw laptop you can see i've got my october spooky month background here if i press this button i appear i didn't i can i didn't use any of the transitions that are in obs to have me fade in um and i see that uh programmer 170 oh no rusty nail uh whiteboard yeah programmer so ah it's coming so rusty now asked i'm gonna join your discord i don't think this button let's see if this button it doesn't work so for some reason my youtube button's on my stream deck i have a button that should post something to the chat it's not working i also have a button that should show me how many people are watching which is also not working anyway so you can see here the reason why i like to have this view is i often as if i'm reporting the weather to you uh i like to open up uh p5.js web editor and uh make the font quite a bit bigger and then i can say tomorrow's weather will be 400 by 400 canvas with gray skies uh you know what let's make it have blue skies tomorrow's weather p5 weather is blue skies so that is all the setup here now what is this you might ask this is a new ipad uh i even have a pencil it's not a real pencil it's an apple pencil not a sponsor though i'm totally available apple i'm available no chance of that so i think it's procreate pro create is the software that i installed i have for example this beautiful um so this has hdmi out as well and it's going into another capture oh unsupported signal okay came back and if i press this button ooh i think this cable is a little bit wonky i think this i need to i this um particular uh usbc to hdmi out dongle is uh kind of unhappy but i do have um i do now have this that i can draw and and do diagrams too but i really don't i i it you know interesting option um i can also and see it just keeps going in and out so i might not use that too much today but i also um today i was sort of like oh this is interesting since i want to talk about curiosity stream and nebula um i can open those up let me just go to the nebula main uh screen here and show you um that so um so this is i thought is useful it's another way for me to show and display content while streaming i kind of is like this ugly like hunk of thing metal here so i don't i don't love what that adds and maybe i guess i could put some stickers on it or maybe i don't want to use it i'll take that away but what you've all been waiting for ah wait no okay hold on you don't hear that so one of the things that i neglected to do was set up the audio routing correctly um it's is it here is the question so i need to in this if i want you to be able to hear audio i've got to go to audio input capture add existing laptop audio okay now in this view wait what what view did i just end up in this view this view yes now you should hear oh do you not hear me no you do hear me okay there's just too many things here remove can i remove this hi no remove delete there's like so many can i move this up come on obs i guess i could just do hide just gonna do hide gloria it's okay uh all right that drum roll really didn't lead to anything did it okay here it comes ready i have no idea if this is gonna work here comes everybody look at that okay uh you hear me the drum roll has gone away because i didn't add that audio i'm walking over i'm gonna get a marker i'm walking over i'm walking over in here i am now there's a there's a couple issues with this setup i do have a light i've had to position the light in such a way oh boy i'm a little bit taller than what the camera is seeing i want to work on that i had to position the light in such a way that it doesn't reflect off of this very glossy finish so i can see it's a little shadowy oh i have an extra light that i didn't hook up so i do have one more light that i definitely want to add should i put it on now that will help give me a second let's do that it says i need an extension cord for it but i can plug it in i think i can plug it in here i just have to not trip over it um and then let's see i need it's this one is connected to uh the internet over here uh where am i here so like i i think this button which turns off this light should also turn on the other light did that happen no oh it needs to be plugged in it is now on okay so now i'm going back i can't see uh uh um take doublesided tape and put the adapter on the back of the ipad rack oh that's very smart marvin thank you for that suggestion all right so now i'm coming back it's a little bit better because i have one extra very light so so here we go here i am uh if i need to draw a diagram like here is a velocity vector and here is the target for the vehicle and its desired velocity uh i am now able to do that as well but i think that this so first of all the only extra tripod i had maybe goes at best like five feet so uh it needs to be higher i think um and it i think it's probably a skew and it's sort of pointed down so i need to have it point up uh hopefully the focus is okay i can see some shadowing so i'm not sure i this i could so your feedback is welcome and appreciated first day using this i probably should get some more lights or maybe just some different camera settings to brighten it up um and try to reduce the shadowing incidentally i just want to move this for a second what's here is this locked i think i locked this are you seeing this is this chris is reading wait how do i unlock this door there we go ah there we go it's the great outdoors so i don't know hopefully the mic is still working you can still hear me but i have some dreams like maybe i could set up my laptop here it's a beautiful day you hear the birds the sun is out breathe in the nature this roof of the garage i think needs to be replaced it's gonna be a big project so there's a lot of things that have got to happen to make this all come together but anyway uh i'm completely barefoot so now my feet are kind of wet uh a little natural green screen background uh let's see if i can close this do i do this to lock it i can't figure it out i'll lock it later bring the white board back uh there we go so uh now you've seen pretty much all of the elements of the new studio one of the things that is true about being over here is i absolutely cannot see the chat whatsoever so for all i know you've lost the audio the stream has gone out who knows i can out of the corner of my eye see open broadcast studio so i do see myself and but i can't read the chat so it might be worth i have a table over here a little work table to build the mechanical keyboard that um maybe i can set up an extra monitor or something like that to be able to watch the chat while i'm here or maybe over here something like that so yeah so that's the setup i don't know if i'm going to use this today but there you go um i'm looking at the chat now mike's still perfect outside uh that's good to know it's good to know it is a wireless lav and i've got to come back over here um so here we are all right 10 55. things are still a little rough with the coding train um in terms of content production um a lot of my time is uh spent teaching and also setting up this new space um i hope to be back with live regular live streams as of today so i plan to live stream most fridays next week is a little bit tbd i've got some plans for october 29th um and then there'll be streams in november except for thanksgiving some streams in december we'll do a holiday uh fundraiser for processing um and then i've got lots of new plans that will begin to happen hopefully in january so what kinds of things do i do if you're new if this is your first time watching i spend a lot of time while i live stream kind of just chatting chitchatting um and like i'm doing now it is my goal to have their live streams be a little bit more programmed and so the kinds of things i like to do are share projects that people from the community have made i'm not really so set up to do that today i also like to look at the most recent videos that i have released take a look through the comments read some of the comments answer some of the questions and so that's what i'm going to start with and then the other things that i want to do today are i want to talk a little bit about how discord i have oh boy i signed up for this so i've got no there's you know it is no reason to complain but i spent a very good portion of last fall making a i think fourpart uh series let's go to the coding train website under maybe more under learning discord bot oh six part series so i made these six videos on how to program your own discord bot an introduction to the concept how the developer portal works starting to write the code with discord.js a library for interfacing with the discord api um how to hide your api keys with dot env posting gifs and the com and how to make a command handler look at all these wonderful thumbnails and you know they're edited and produced and like yeah you know it's no more of these old days where i just press the button and like take talk code code code and express stop and release the video edit it and zooming in and out and highlighting things to help make it you know people seem to like that i don't know we'll see anyway but the result of that is you could i could spend a lot of time effort and money to produce a series like this and uh libraries change and it's pretty much out of date and i would say this is um this is quite the case for these discord tutorials unfortunately now the the one thing is true you could still follow these tutorials and absolutely get your bot to work if you made sure to use the same version of the discord.js package that i'm using in these videos i've tested it it still works i don't know to what extent the discord api itself will change in which case some of the things that that that library is doing in the older version will be deprecated and actually stop working but at the moment it still works however um it's a much better thing now to use the newest discord dot js library and it's version 13. it's not even a year ago these came out in november and december not even one year did i make it with these videos i would say probably the introduction is maybe still relevant the developer portal is pretty much the same although you've got to do a few evergreen that's some evergreen content maybe because at least working with this.env file is a tried and true method that hasn't changed working with the api to get gifs is the same but posting them to discord is a little bit different and command handling has changed so i don't know right now i do not have the capacity to really rerecord new versions of these but i would like to spend some time just i have new examples and i've been teaching the new examples in my nyu course my goal with the coding terrain is i have my fulltime day job teaching i have this sort of side business youtube channel thing i like to make videos that i can use in my classes but also uh make them available to the wider uh youtube audience so i'm trying to balance it all i haven't figured it out so i don't know what to do about that but um i at least today during the live stream one thing i can do is kind of go through some new examples that i've made and point out what the steps are and talk about what the changes are so if you wanted hopefully i can give you a head start on uh if you follow these tutorials and you made something how to upgrade to the next version and i should really thank both kobe and david who are um creators and maintainers of the coding train discord bot who uh gave me enormous amounts of help um in uh figuring out um how all this new stuff works okay um now let's see here so i want to do that today so three things i want to go through my most recent i could release a video live while i'm live streaming you know what i'm going to do at the end of today's live stream i'm going to release the next video in my nature of code series because it's ready to go so that's something you can i think look forward to i'll do that today but and maybe i'll even show you a little preview of what it is during the live stream so comments update on nature of code steering behavior video series that's going on right now uh update on discord stuff and then i would like to this will make everybody very happy i hope i got to watch the time i got to get this started probably by like 12 45 at the latest i would like to see uh uh i would like to take a little return back to the old ways of how i used to make coding train content which is during the live stream i would pick a coding challenge topic and give myself a amount of time to try to program it and then all the while while i'm doing that i would also be recording everything to disk so that later that coding challenge sequence could be you know edited together with some light editing um and uh released as a standalone video um certainly these are the most watched videos on my channel the ones that i did that way years ago so and i my new setup in theory um i'm using this um i think it's called the like pro cam elgato pro cam capture card so it has um software that will record all of the hdmi inputs into the card to one big video file which i can run in the background while i'm live streaming and i have a like tx nvidia 3080 i don't remember what it is but i went through a lot of research to spec out a machine with a graphics card that i would hope would be able to handle both live streaming and recording to disk uh multiple hdmi events so we're gonna see if that works i'm not holding my breath i'll definitely be doing it on the live stream whether the recording actually works in a way that it can be reused we'll see um so that's kind of my plan could you say that again no no i'm not going to say that again why does that happen why does the technology just spontaneously talk to us for no reason i mean there probably was a reason i probably hit something press something did something it asked me to say it again i can't say it again don't make me say it again you know what oh that's what i should use the outdoors for reading the random numbers do i have the laptop audio here let's see oh wait hold on press this button no why is that not how come that doesn't work does this button work for muting myself okay i'm talking i'm talking i'm about to mute my muted and now i'm back and talking again that button works um naresh is asking how did i get a 33 what do you say what's the price 3008 or is it 3080 or is it 3080 uh i might be wrong hold on let me get my little notebook and tell you about the specs of my new computer um i know there's a global gpu shortage i think i must have just lucked out um i'm walking over here to my information booklet i'm gonna i'm gonna do a dramatic reading of uh the specs of the new computer that i purchased you know it's very hard for me to get back to my spot because um okay so all right ports and connections oh no wait come on isn't there just like a star guy install setup benchmarks benchmarks benchmarks tools and recovery windows should i upgrade to windows 11 on it anybody know it i really just wanted to read you the main specs is there another piece of paper i don't know why it's not i have this whole notebook yeah i have an nvidia geforce rtx 3080 10 gigabyte founders edition video card i don't know why i don't have the there must be must have been like a separate paper and this is just like this is going well i was i was excited to do a um random number uh uh reading and then i was like oh i'll read about my computer but let's just let's i don't even know where ah here's the random digits book okay remember i'm gonna get back to that remember that system i had where i would know my goal is to do i guess i have to start over again now that i'm in a new studio my goal is to read every number from this book what book am i talking about it is the book uh it's very uh reflective um a million random digits with 100 000 normal deviates i'm still in the market for a original print edition of this book um and if i think if i go into discord uh somebody somebody might tell me i i don't have oh i don't have well i don't have the music here boy i'm really uh hold on let's see uh give me one second to add i lost so many viewers in the last like 15 15 minutes uh audio input capture laptop audio uh does this mute it this button yeah that button works okay so now if i go here okay okay everybody here we go this would be much better for me to sit outside and do this again uh somebody if anybody is watching and could tell me where i last left off i know i could pull up discord but hey wait wait i can pull up discord on this computer don't worry i'm gonna get to something eventually okay discord coding train bot demo is that where i go um i guess i could go there um let's try that i used to be able to make discord bigger by doing shift command plus oh wait oh just command plus okay there we go ah it's there look at this thank you to kobe i am now in the coding train discord the bot the command is slash reading so um check where shiffman stopped last reading the book of random numbers and i need to continue reading the book at page one thank you life is good sometimes when your computer systems work and tell you where you last were in the book that you're reading ah yes okay page one you are all so nice to actually watch these live streams i mean if it were me i just have shut this off already i mean to be fair most of you did shut this off already probably or you just didn't bother to show up but not you you're watching you're the ones who are here and i love you very much uh page two page one boy i'm not very far wait a second seriously row two this entire book has many many many pages not just page one row two column zero all right we're gonna get further zero eight four two two six eight nine five three one nine six four five zero nine three oh three two three two zero nine zero two five six zero one five nine five three three four seven six four three five zero eight zero three all right so now i read a row next time and be on page one row two and column zero is that a thing that i can say can i uh can i um speaking of discord bots can i now say slash reading no a set or something set number i don't know maybe uh i guess i'll need uh oh look at this this is so cool get a picture of the coding train in your inventory i want this i need an id what come on come on give me my character too bad is thinking by the way i'm in a steps competition right now so it's really good that i'm doing this all right let's see we'll see if it comes through for me um but i love this is so much fun ah join the discord join the discord we're gonna do more oh look my inventory wow oh inventory uh whoops no i got one oh character i don't know why lots of stuff is happening here anyway um i got smile robot or kobe got smile robot that's exciting um is it on the blockchain maybe no i'm just nah did i did not say that backing away turning the stream off goodbye good night everybody thank you uh thank you and good night that was today's coding train live stream i will see you uh all right i'm back all right let's let's get going here let me get to segment number one which is reviewing um reviewing um codabot to read it for you reviewing recent videos so i'm gonna go to um the channel so the thing that i'm currently working on if i go here under videos what's gonna happen is it's going to show all my private videos which is fine i don't think i have that many let me switch to um this is so weird what's going on here uh i have this like fake not me channel and go to videos okay so but i want to see the uh no this is fine anyway i don't know how to do this it's so hard uh the most recent video that i uh produced which was um not particularly watched i would say um stig by the way is as making a suggestion in the chat which is something that i have already thought of or maybe it was already mentioned to me maybe stigma clint you you incepted this into my brain previously but this is this is a this is a project i really do want to make uh it's v related to my interest in v tubing but uh coming to you soon a new channel with just a 24 7 live stream of me reading random numbers okay um so uh here i am let's go to uh this video this video could have been in chapter one all right so um what this video is about and i think there's actually a better way for me to demonstrate what it's about is a concept known as scalar projection um and i'm actually just going to open up the code for it where oh that is not the right one looks like we might have a mistake uh let's see that's weird is that the thing that i just opened yeah so this is not the correct code example what's the other one here that's the angle between i think they might be inverted no they're both that so something went wrong where this is not the correct code well this is good for me to discover this um let's see scalar so it's that hmm let's go back angle between containment wander three beef lake bed path following well this i'm going to have to investigate somebody wants to file a github issue on the coding train website right now that was a uh un uh unforeseen error but i will just find the part in the video um where the code example happens and i think maybe it's here yeah so this is the example that i wanted to pull up where basically what's going on is i am taking a given vector right a particular vector that is in between uh green dot one that points from green dot one to green dot two and uh taking the projection of that onto this vector so as if there's a light above that second green dot and casting a shadow like this blue line this blue line is like the shadow of this vector onto this vector the reason this is incredibly important and useful is it allows us to find this normal point this projection point i'm calling it so if i want to look at the distance between any given point like that green dot over there and a line finding that normal the scalar projection using the vector dot product is a way of doing so the reason why i'm doing all this in the first place and if you watch the video that it'll do a deeper dive into it is that this technique is needed for path following if this blue line happened to be a path and the green dot happened to be your vehicle you need to see where it is relative to the path and have it steer towards the path so that um when if i do this where um and um pick out a few that i would like to address or that could lead me to adjust or change the example in a certain way did not have time to do that so i'm just going to kind of look and see what's kind of risen up here uh to the top based on whatever um youtube algorithm okay uh uh all right so i see a little message that there's some lag going on everything that i see is green lights everywhere but i do see people are saying it is lagging um okay weird i don't see any issues with the stream i see zero drop frames i see 30 frames per second um it's fine now it was a long hiccup okay i would like i do need to look into my open broadcast studio settings one thing i am getting is that youtube is telling me that my bit rate is low i'm looking in the obs stats page and it says my bit rate is 2674 kilobytes per second 2713 kilobytes per second so i don't know if that's a limit um to um my internet connection or that's a setting that i should change it lagged when i scroll down to the comments it's weird okay well we're back let's take a look okay um oh yeah look robert m oh i didn't see your comment i really need to be myself i mean i am myself but it's bothering me that i'm not really myself so i'm going to go here and switch to be me now i really am myself and i need to find the comments all right so robert m i want to heart this comment yes need to fix this you can also always post a note to the website github issues which would be where github.com codingtrain website and for all i know it's already there um but i don't see it here in an obvious place so i'm going to link it there and we might see it sooner okay there we go so thank you robert m for your wonderful comment that i'm reading live on the air uh thank you raj for the nice feedback um so let's read this from tmc you can have the option for that function to cap at the line segment but at the line segment endpoints it's actually more useful in navigating ai's to have the option of segment versus line oh yes okay so unfor i really wish i need to be able to run this example the whole point of me doing this is to be able to run the example there was always such fail on the coding train live streams hopefully it makes you feel good about how well things go in your life i'm looking at the time okay i have here's the thing i'm pretty sure i have a variation of this that's part of the nature of code examples um path following simple oh hold on i wanted to i wanted to do this capping thing because this is actually a really meaningful interesting comment so i'm i'm gonna allow myself five minutes to try to get the scalar projection code up and running okay 11 25 everybody say stop you've taken too long you've wasted too much time let's look for the path following example path falling path falling target ahead path capture path falling complex path path falling let's look at this for a second okay this is good so by the way this is the path following example the other thing by the way that i could use some uh knowledge about is if i were to unplug the hdmi out from this laptop this sketch would run at 60 frames per second but because my capture card is capturing at 30 frames per second if i'm plugged in the p5 sketch will will cap at 30 frames per second which isn't that big of a deal maybe that's fine but it i find it unnerving that all of a sudden my sketch is running half the speed is when i programmed it so i don't know if there's a way for me to force the browser to run 60 frames per second even if the output is 30 frames per second anybody knows anything about that would love to hear from you not right now in the comments because i won't necessarily get it uh join the discord and the information can get passed along to me that way probably all right so let's make a new sketch and i'm going to keep this function i'm basically remaking that sketch and let's do have three points uh pause a and b pause is create vector um at like 100 100 a is create vector and let's see here where am i standing kind of i guess i should move myself over a little bit um create a vector at um let's just try like 200 oh let's make this 100 200 200 100 and b create vector at 200 um that may be like 300 uh 300. so now let's say stroke weight 8 stroke 255 a dot x a dot y and let's run this sketch to make sure i'm seeing something and let's make these much bigger uh pause pause did i hit stop or something okay there we go so um now if i wanted to say stroke weight one and draw a line from pause x pause y to a dot x a dot y and the same thing to b um now i should be able to use this method find projection which is the function that i worked out in that video to say um let projection equal find projection pause a b and then let's draw that point and say stroke weight 2 24 again and let's make that green and let's move the point a around by the mouse a dot x is mouse x a dot y equals mouse y so i pretty much remade that example now what i would like to do to figure out is how could i have this green dot turn red if it is past the endpoints which is essentially me coming back to this comment have an option for that function to cap at the line segment endpoints more useful um to have the option of line segment versus line so uh you can easily search football steer further if your function is segment restricted when the ai follows a line at a distance to it will start to steer around the end point and never really find the next line in the path to follow yes so this is such a good point so the thing that i um have yet to really implement and um i'm going to go to this one i think i believe yeah so this is one of my examples that i demonstrate in the next video that hasn't been released yet but will be released today where these agents are following this path and this path is a series of multiple line segments so i need to know right see how the vehicles are finding that corresponding normal point to the path i need to know and um right see like over here they're finding it no i need to know which segment of the path is the one that they should follow so having some ability to understand whether the normal point to that line segment exists on the line segment or not would be useful um i think that lag message is just from before okay so hopefully the stream is still working fine so how do i go about doing this i kind of have no idea so let's think about this um well i could i oh this is a great chance for me to use my whiteboard let's practice that i'm going to come over here do i have a marker where did i put the marker do i have an eraser i have some tissues okay i think i want to order a new white board i said this before this one is very shaky and it would be great if i could get one that's like matte finish i also was thinking about getting like could i get like glass that i can draw in front of me and then we can have the beautiful background behind me i don't know if that would be visible but your suggestions are welcome okay so i have a line segment it's got uh i call it's a little bit weird i call these paws i guess i'll just use that same nomenclature pause a and b i don't know why did i it's a little bit we i i think there was a reason for why i called it these things in the video but i'm having trouble remembering that why and then we find this point so if a is over here we would find this point but that is off the line or if a were over here we would find this point so what are some things that i could do i could certainly look at i could normalize i could take this vector from pause this is called projection so if i take the vector from pause to projection and if it's in the opposite direction oh well i'm just looking for what's the easiest way to do this and the chat's probably explaining this to me i'm thinking this through live i mean right i know by definition i know this vector that's part of what i've worked out this vector so i guess i could do like um just look if they're if it's if it's in if it is if the angle between these two vectors is 180 degrees but this point that would not be the case i could look for the distance i know oh this is easy or easyish no yeah if i take the distance from this point to both b right if i take the distance from this point to a and to b and add them together i've got this magnitude but if i if it's past the line if i take its distance oh if it's distance to either one of those is greater than the line segment's length all right that's a way to do it maybe you have a better suggestion in the chat okay i thought of it right if i just look at this wherever this point is and look at its distance to this point of the line segment and its distance to this point of the line segment sorry the distance here and distance to here if one of those is greater than that length of the line segment it has to be past either side of the line segment maybe there's a more efficient way of doing it but that would certainly get me the result i think right i'm coming back here so let's just try that so in other words i have distance one is the vector distance between the projected point and pause uh this is vector distance distance two is the distance between the projected point and b and again i have to apologize for the weird naming i kind of i think i let and just making this example let's change the names um because i kind of would like it to be a b and i'm going to write the labels there i'm going to call this a b sorry this is going to be c and this is a and b so c is controlled by the mouse and i'm drawing a point at a b and c then i'm drawing the line between a and b and the line between a and c then find uh the projection point a c b and then what's going on here what did i mess up and me trying to make this make more sense no no hold on whoa okay oh dear projection point between no oh c oh my god what point to hold on i lost the track of what's what okay hold on hold on what do i want this to be oh it's so hard to like know how to do this it's very far away to get to this whiteboard okay i i was thinking it should be a b and this is c that makes more sense so i want to draw a line between a and c and a and b this is projection that's the projection point and then my uh my function should take a it was pause a b and yeah what what just happened this should work okay uh oh look at that okay there's an extra a there okay whoop okay a and b a is this one b is this c is this one there we go oh no you don't see sorry i forgot to press the button i forgot to press the button here we are okay i got it i got it and then the projection point sorry everybody oh my god it's 11 30 already no no no no no no oh i found whoa look at this interesting projection point what is going on uh a there we go i would i would i would really like to say abc but it's fine i'm going to live with that okay now the distance distance one is the projection point between projection and a distance two is the projection point between is the distance projection point and b i was going to label the points but now if i say if d1 is greater than so i have somewhere in this function i made this vector already pause a b i'm totally losing it uh so let distance equal p5 vector now i'm i'm not worrying about doing this particularly efficiently right now i might be able to repurpose knowing this distance from somewhere else in the code which i almost certainly do but if i just get the distance between a and b if d1 is greater than d or d2 is greater than d fill 255 a stroke red and then where is uh where is that this so and then i'm going to do this here so now i should yeah there we go if it's past the line segment it turns red if a dot b absolute value divided by the absolute value of a is between 0 and 1 the projected point is on the vector b that makes a lot of sense now why is that the case let's go back to the white board if a dot b this this if a dot b divided by the not the absolute value but the the length of vector is between 0 and 1. this makes sense i have heard of this formula before this is familiar to me i've worked this out before and it's just not fresh in my memory right now so why is that the case uh eight let's it has to do with the angle between i'm looking for my eraser which i don't have one so let's think about this let's work out this math because okay apparently i need to lock the wheels of this white board and get an eraser [Laughter] okay so a dot b equals um okay well we can do it two ways a sub x times b sub x and this is just for two dimensions obviously plus a sub y times b sub y the other formula which uses which i'm uh neglecting which i'm blanking on right now which uses the formula let's find that in the nature of code book and i'm going to go to chapter 6 dot product um i want to look for this is the formula yeah yeah okay this is the formula i'm looking for here the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b times cosine of the angle thank you um the magnitude of a and i don't know why i'm using capital letters all of a sudden the magnitude of a times the magnitude of b times cosine of the angle in between so if we take this and divide it by the magnitude of a we now have the magnitude of b times cosine of the angle between so this makes sense because if the angle between these two vectors is um right if if we go back to this drawing once again we're talking about this angle if this angle goes beyond 90 degrees then the projection point is going to be off to this direction or if the length right if the angle is or right if the angle is somewhere in here then it comes down to the length so if it's otherwise the cosine of the angle if it's passed is going to give you a negative number so you always would get a negative value or if you're getting a positive value then it has to do with the length so if the length over here is like past what this would be so this this is making sense to me um it's all back to this whole scalar projection thing right the whole pinpoint ah the whole point of the scalar projection oh i'm so silly i'm so silly the whole point of the scalar projection is as if i didn't record an entire video tutorial all about this that makes sense now it's uh the whole point of the scalar projection is it gives me this length so if that's a negative number it's off the side if that length is greater than the length of uh this vector yeah yeah so i don't need to do all of this because it's kind of built into my scalar projection code okay i'm going to leave this um uh i'm gonna leave this uh aside now because it's already 11 40. and i that's what i said 11 45 i was going to do a coding challenge that was that was a good one uh so you know this was a great rehearsal again once again this is a great rehearsal i'm kind of learning how this all works uh let's just uh um so thank you again for your comments this one definitely sparked a lot and uh the the path following video uh will there's there's there's a whole third part of the path of this sequence that i haven't recorded yet right there's what is scalar projection how do you follow a simple path and then how do you follow a complex path so this concept that we've been working on um um is definitely um is definitely relevant to that um uh path what uh that third part that i haven't recorded four minutes in i already have five wikipedia pages open i love that comment uh um okay can we learn physics this way you can learn the basics this way but it won't be enough to learn physics in detail this is definitely true okay um by the way this um so i just wanted to address this comment um i just want to say like it one thing you will notice here is if you go to the end of the video it's going to show you this happens from time to time as far as my release sequence um uh i'm reading the comments that maybe i'm not coding getting some good coding challenge suggestions um okay sponsor break reminder boy let me let me address what i want to address right now which is that um often the next video that i am about to publish is available on the channel before it is finished and what do i mean by finished um i use a thirdparty service to close caption my videos that often takes like three or four days so i have the video uploaded and present on the channel it could be the thumbnails not finished it could be the code examples and the description is not finished but just to have everything right and also to give a bonus to the coding terrain members that's of the people who subscribe to join there's like a join button somewhere on the channel yeah this join button here um uh this would this is available to um i often will have the video as part of the playlist and locked to members only so before it's really finished and ready the members can get a sneak preview of it also that helps me often catch errors so i've had members watch the sneak preview and be like ah there's a big problem here and i will then take the upload down fix it and reupload much better to do that before it's become a public video so if i click on this right now all right i'm back apologies for that the batteries just don't last all right i'm gonna wait till uh i'm gonna wait till the chat figures it out yes you did just watch a mic die this keeps happening break okay yeah sorry about that everyone i don't know what i was last saying i was explaining uh so i have these rechargeable batteries i'm sorry that i still haven't corrected this they used to last for hours and it's going to happen again unfortunately this shows two bars though i should probably just replace it now to be safe i'm sorry about that i'm upgrading my equipment uh as you see i have a new streaming computer i have some new lights a new ipad uh guess what i didn't get new rechargeable batteries actually i kind of want to just get a new lav mic this lab mic i don't know if you know also does a lot of like rustling it's just one that i've had for years uh it might be good to get a new one if you have a suggestion of like what's top of the line i mean i don't want to you know i got a budget i'm working with here but i would like to have a very high quality lav mic that's wireless that i could use so if you have a good suggestion for that you could let me know i guess this is a good point for me to talk about today's sponsor all right everyone today's coding train is sponsored by curiositystream what's curiosity stream you might ask i'm going to play a little video for you from the founder of discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service curiosity stream home of groundbreaking documentaries and awardwinning original series follow your curiosity this is curiosity stream all right i'm back here let's see um so uh this is a curiosity stream it is um curiosity stream is the awardwinning destination for documentary films and tv shows covering every topic from space exploration to adventure to the secret lives of wild animals so the link that i have on the screen the one that's right above me right now if you sign up with that link you will get a 26 discount on the annual hd plan that's fourteen dollars like i love that i have this huge picture of levar burton here they actually have this wonderful series called beyond the spotlight which is about different you can see there's mr beast over here um i've been really enjoying this series i'm a huge levar burton fan so that was a uh that was a real pleasure to watch um i'm the magic numbers from um dr hannah fry this is one of my favorite um oops wait i pressed the wrong button no wait what's going on that's so weird oh it's like trying to play it through the monitor that's so strange oh look at that so my hdmi out you're not actually seeing what i'm seeing on my ipad screen because i've got it hooked through hdmi out it wants to play the series to the output which is at the correct aspect ratio which i'm not going to do right now i'm just going to come back to this uh you as you know i love numbers i love random numbers what's better than random numbers magic numbers so there are so many excellent um um so many excellent um documentaries here and awardwinning original series now i've also talked about before how i'm part of a group of educational uh youtube creators um and we together started a streaming service called nebula and um if i come back to here um you know basically nebula has adfree content and experiments with all different kinds of content and it's partnered with curiosity streams so if you sign up for curiosity stream using the link with the coupon for 14.79 for the whole year you will also this is not a promotion not a trial forever you will um also have um access to nebula and one of the things i want nebula has all these wonderful originals actually this bad law word's good i haven't gotten to watch it yet but i'm a big legal eagle fan on youtube so i'm definitely looking forward to checking that out um the one that i'm really been enjoying and i've just got to find it here called better elevation is a sort of compilation i would actually really like to make one of these it's a compilation of our series of different videos from different creators about next level technology and new tools to supercharge their production so like here's one from patrick williams how to switch how how switching codecs can speed up from cat black using creative color correction so like you know i'm kind of like a fan basically of all of these channels i hope i really adam neely has a grandma in creative use of 6k for youtube um jordan herrod one shot shooting saves time for the better i didn't know jordan made one of these actually i had not seen that one yet so um davinci resolve i gotta learn that so many great things so if you want access to these nebula originals um you can uh tom scott has one also um you can get it through the link so um it's a great way to support my channel uh educational content as a whole 14.79 per year it's 26 percent off uh just go to curiositystream.com codingtrain i am hoping to make i would like to propose to make a nebula original at some point um different kind of content than the sort of stuff that i'm doing on youtube maybe something about like live streaming in my setup so as you can see i've got a lot of technical things to work out before i feel like i can make a good better elevation video but if you have ideas uh for what you might want to see from me on a streaming service like nebula uh please let me know okay so thanks uh if you've got a minute take the time to sign up while i take a short break i'm gonna switch to this ah nope don't have a button for that i'm gonna take just like a two to three minute break um i'm going to i still have my mic going i'm adding the uh audio input capture for the laptop audio which means i can play this piece of music and i will be back in just a few minutes to try to do i wanted to talk about the discord.js stuff so i'll address that briefly you are not healing in the laptop audio there you go and then i will do a sort of trial run of some kind of coding challenge i got two or three minutes to think of what i'm gonna do see you in a few do do hey isn't there like a thing that's like a generative art prompt for every day of october jen tober i feel like i saw something like that on twitter does anybody have that can you link it to me i'm looking for that right now maybe that's what i'll do back in about a minute and 30 seconds bye okay i'm back how's everybody doing um it is 11 55. thank you uh of course to curiosity stream for sponsoring i don't know maybe uh actually like my entirely like incompetent haphazard like mess of talking about a sponsor will actually result in the most what is it called when somebody clicks on your link and then they they get the thing that you were that you were advertising for i don't even know anymore conversions okay thank you curacy stream and uh thank you nebula and all of my friends who are making wonderful educational content all around the world um a chaos pendulum oh and i see stig i see your comment yes um okay what am i going to do by the way there's a wonderful three blue one brown video that came out and it was uh suggested uh in the rainbow topics issues i don't uh i i don't i need something really simple that i can do um um great does advent of code so there's something i'm not am i there's something um that i um saw on twitter uh that was a generative art prompt or theme or challenge for every day of october or is it like upcoming in november does anybody know what i'm talking about did i already make have i made the um did i already do the dinosaur game it's funny how i'm like oh that would be a good one coding challenge oh with speech commands what is the simple what is something really simple that i can do now i'm taking your dick and your suggestions look at inktober inktober inktober prompts okay but i thought this was something that yes inktober but there's like a particular variation of this although i could just use the prompt what is today the 15th helmet peggle peggle what is peggle whoa okay that's interesting um oh you're not see what i'm looking at i i'm really bad at like having the right screen up here code vember is that it but that's for november yeah yes oh so is this like last ah it hasn't no but there's something going on now i saw people talking about it on twitter but this is kind of fun it's not november 15 2019 but if i clicked on this what would it say there is no project for this day by the way in case you're wondering i replaced the battery in um the other the mic receiver during the break all right this is this is not going very well um let's see if there's one of these that i could do wave collapse mathematical marbling sl oh slide puzzle perfect all right all right everybody generative inktober i like i like the slide puzzle idea it's done generative inktober that's from 2020 is there one going on now all right we're we're doing this we are doing a coding train slide puzzle all right let me try to get out let me so uh and i'm going to give myself 30 minutes this is going to be such a mess um okay so i am going to i should have done my spin the wheel thing but um all right so let's see i'm looking for the elgato application 4k capture utility i think that's it 4k devices in use by other software no i totally was doing this before do i have to run it first all right i have another idea wait why that's so weird i did i did this the other day though and i ran both obs and 4k capture utility you know how would you how would you all feel about me quitting obs for a second and seeing if i run obs second that'll probably work all right everybody um all right everybody all right everyone this is this is a little bit unorthodox and i deeply apologize i'm not turning the stream off i'm just going to press stop on open broadcast studio quit open broadcast studio so it'll look like your stream is broken for a moment i'm going to launch my 4k capture utility to hit record on it then i'm going to start obs back up again and see what happens okay i will be back i'm coming back i'm definitely coming back don't go anywhere i'll be right back okay okay am i back i think i'm back now um okay i uh sorry i've lost so much for example i have no longer have the chat open uh okay okay everybody relax i'm getting the chat open uh pop out chat there we go welcome to live chat okay all right now i have this working now i don't remember how do i select is it this button no settings must be settings there we go picture recording device ah one multiview okay apply no uh oh all right this is a little screen picture this is a total failure by the way okay the multiview thing that has completely stopped working stream link no just out of curiosity okay capture device quad i i know you can't see what i'm doing here i'm very frustrated that it's not working because i tested this earlier it was working earlier i don't really need to record all this to disk it just would be nice all right i'm going to just test something here very briefly um so hold on a second now i'm going to go to here it's not over i'm going to just here for a second actually i'm making a new scene multiview and then i'm going to do video capture device multi and do one there we go so this ah no signal no no this is fine it's this is 4k so i just need to fit to fit to screen there we go so this is oh and i don't know why the whiteboard one so i have this system which is set up to record this view of all of the feeds and i don't know why the whiteboard one now is missing oh because the camera went off okay so it's on no car did this come out so much technical oh there we go okay so this totally works i'm here i have nothing plugged into one of the ports which is that one whiteboard is over here if i walk over here now i'm over here and then laptop is over there so if i go back to here now i've got those combined um now why is my capture utility that should that's working there's no reason why i shouldn't be able to see all of them in the other software if i just hit record maybe it's actually recording it but i just don't see it let's see just bear with me i'm going to give up on this in a second i like that everyone's giving some docker help i like this obs challenge i guess i could just run two obs at once that might be actually my best bet where did it record this 4k capture test 4k today is 10 15 october 15th right so i'm opening up this video file view details good thing good thing i'm really getting this coding challenge i said i was going to do 5 12 p.m that's weird it's not 5 12 p.m okay okay clearly it's another recording is not working all right i have one other idea if you will just bear with me just a little bit longer um i am going to run a second instance of obs on this computer uh where if quick access now i don't want quick access i want to go to this pc and i want to go to view list i wish i could show i guess i could show you what i'm doing but uh where is obs is this in program files x86 or just in obs studio is here plugins bin 64bit okay obs 64. that must be what i'm running so if i just create a whole additional copy of it i need let's just copy it to the desktop just just for right now bear with me everybody copy paste okay i'm closing 4k capture utility thank you for bearing with me i know i said i had to leave at 12 30 but don't worry i'm gonna do something at the end i'm gonna make something happen here everybody now let's see will this actually run an entirely separate instance of obs obs is already running unless you meant to do this please shut down any existing instances before trying no i have meant to do this okay now oh what oh it needs to have a local profile okay hold on multiview oh this is working okay hold on how do i tell obs i've done this before i really should have done this before i started but i want to make this work i really want to make this work you could go you could do something else with your day it's fine i totally understand i totally understand this is going to help us out for next week or the week after the fact that i'm taking the time to do this now it's very hard to find time otherwise all right let's look there's a way like there is um run multiple instances of obs local like with separate like profiles or something um i've done this before um desktop shortcut properties okay is this what i'm um two instances with different settings is what i'm trying to do from 2019. yeah but i i can load okay uh okay portable mode portable mode that's what i want to do portable mode although maybe i can actually just use a different profile because there are profiles let's see if i try another profile uh so i'm going to do a make a 4k profile optimize for recording use uh no no no base canvas i want a custom how do i have a custom canvas i want it to be 3840 by 2160. base canvas is not giving me that as an option that's so weird i mean like 30. all right let's just do this right now so profile oh whoops oh no is it so weird um people are probably telling me things in the chat let me let me get the chat open here i'm going to give myself some extra time all right i've got the members live chat open here now whoops nothing nothing there okay hold on let me look at the youtube chat coding challenge okay okay all right i don't all right i want to do the portable thing so i need to do this portable thing so i need to run obs i think it was actually telling me this shortcut uh oh i saw this i saw this where's the portable command line parameter dash dash portable okay i think i know how to do this so if i create a shortcut i can add a command line argument in windows i believe so i'm going to the desktop oh my goodness um no i don't want this quick access thing is not helping me i don't want quick access i want to see my computer all the files what the heyho how do i get out of this windows quick access thing there we go this pc thank you users daniel desktop obs studio bin 64bit i know i'm a create shortcut i wish i could show you what i'm doing because this is very exciting create shortcut now i'm going to put that shortcut on the desktop then i'm going to hit properties and it has a target obs 64 exe shortcut key run can i just write in windows can i just do dash dash dash dash portable um just in the start in or just in their target in the windows shortcut i was like space dash dash portable okay apply let's see if this works it worked it worked everybody i have an entirely separate instance of obs going optimize for recording base canvas all right hold on i'm gonna get out of this auto configuration wizard uh so obs base canvas resolution where do i set that well i guess i could probably find a canvas size um all right i bet you i can find this i'm just going to go to settings no not studio mode settings uh output simple advanced no video base canvas here we go why does it not give me that as an option okay this is so crazy i've never had this problem before all right so like what what the issue i have 4k based canvas open broadcast studio well let's see here this is pretty recent this is the resolution it's missing settings you need you can now type the resolution manually oh was it gonna let me type it manually oh i could just type over it it has a drop down menu but it's not an option in the drop down menu but i could just type over it okay 3840 by two one six zero is that right and then the output resolution should be three four zero okay 30 frames per second okay now uh settings output um video output oh mp4 apply uh add a video capture device create new okay this is uh i'm going to call it multi and then i'm going to grab cam link pro 1 multiview which should be 4k perfect i'm in business everybody i'm in business and i have the mic so it's going to record the mic but i'm going to change the properties to mono advanced audio properties uh make it mono so now i have an entirely separate okay so just in case you're following along i mean all like three of you that are left i can't see who's here i can see the chat but i've lost all my other like control panels um i now have um two instances of obs running one instance is the one that is live streaming right now it is not recording anything to disk it could be recording to disk but it's not and it has all the different views that is like tied to my uh nice little uh stream deck here so i can switch and go to just this view or this view or this view et cetera and i totally messed up the whiteboard in the camera but that's up and of course the camera goes off oh what excellent timing okay hold on everybody about two hours in this always seems to happen this coding challenge might not happen but i'm making progress people you might not see it or believe it this is plugged in so it's not the battery oh it's like it's actually losing its charge i think i probably should take the battery out it's kind of crazy how this is plugged in and yet is this not yeah it's plugged this camera is plugged in and yet the full battery is now at half charge who knows why okay and then i have a separate obs and you know what uh i'm just gonna uh i'm just so this the other obs in case you're wondering looks like this so the other obs looks like this actually in 4k what you're seeing is not in 4k i have sampled it back down and so as soon as i hit start recording i am now recording all of these separate feeds to disk at the same time as live streaming this this is actually by the way what i have done previously just uh not at the same time so i have with members of the coding train when i record a new video i live stream the actual 4k layout while i'm recording but now i have the possibility in theory if this works of both live streaming uh and recording all of these feeds to disk so that whatever i do during the live stream could be reedited and things could be like mixed and matched in different ways if necessary into a video so let's try a coding challenge let's try a slide puzzle now if i'm being perfectly honest um i have a feeling that this is not going to go well i'm probably not going to make it work or finish this or end up editing this into a separate video so this is just a trial run no pressure i would really like to do this as a coding challenge video so consider this a rehearsal i mean the point of the coding challenge videos is to not rehearse but it might that just might have to happen now i also would like to give myself a timer and i'm i'm just going to send a text message to explain that i'm going to be a little bit late i don't know where my phone is here it is because i need to give myself an extra 30 minutes here um oh awesome need uh 30 more minutes so 1pm i'm going to turn into a pumpkin at 1 pm i'm turning into a pumpkin i really should check that this is recording to disk all right i'm just going to hit stop i'm just going to hit stop recording to disk i'm just going to look at the file very briefly i mean if it's not working i'm not doing the setup anymore i'm just going to go into the coding challenge but i would like to know if it's working videos today is october 15th here is the file um i think it looks good it looks like there might be some choppiness to the frame rate i think i know why that is and i'm not going to worry about it right now and i will deal with fixing that later i have an idea for a way of doing this better but i'm just going to record again so now once again i'm recording the disk i have live streaming i'm going to close all of these things out we're going to say slide puzzle this is actually really good because i do have a coding challenge video that has been recorded that hasn't come out yet about the copy function and i think i need to use the copy function for this tim rhodenbrecker let me just introduce you to the most patient person in the world tim i'm going to accept i accept all of your cookies please send me cookies i love cookies actually if you uh vegan cookies please if possible it's just kind of like the nondairy thing i mean eggs i do eat eggs anyway we don't need to get into that but um no one's sending me cookies who am i kidding you should check out um tim rodenbrooker's and i'm apologies if i'm mispronouncing the name um website live streams videos creative coding stuff um tim gave a donation to the processing foundation last year's holiday fundraiser i am still a half to the end i have until the day of the next holiday fundraiser to finish releasing the videos based on those donations this one is recorded tim i like probably owe you an email from like six months ago if you're listening uh please everybody check out tim's wonderful work and stay tuned this video is coming out of the coding train about the copy function um okay um so now now that i did that little ad for tim uh i need uh a um i need an image to do as the slide puzzle all right i guess we're gonna use the coding train train and um coding train train i must have that somewhere let me just i'm going to go into my google drive for a second oh let's we could use choo choo bot i love choo choo bot choo choo bot is like one of my favorite coding trained character so oh you gotta be kidding me you don't need to make me put in my password right now i've got a time time limit here folks it's 12 30 already all right it's got to be on choo choo bot png perfect well okay i'm showing you so i'm gonna go back to um this is the choo choo bot and so the good news about like doing this kind of thing where i'm recording everything to disc if i forget to switch to the right feed like i have all that material so even if it's sort of messed up in the live stream you can repackage it later to be better so choo choo bot i kind of want to do this in processing but i'll do this in p5 so i just need to upload choo choo bot upload file where is this file can i like see it show in finder i'm just gonna do save save as okay choo choo bot on the desktop uh let's just keep it a png well those are some loud birds uh whoops okay uh okay what is this what's the size of this file by the way 400 by 400 perfect couldn't be more perfect okay so i just want to before i begin the coding challenge i'm going to make a variable called source and source is going to load image ch choo choo bot.png and i don't need this open anymore which will give me more room for the code um we're going to just draw we don't need draw right now well i mean we do need draw right now i'm just going to draw the image source zero zero what did i do wrong here oh yeah choo choo but choo choo up can i just rename it here choo choo bot okay okay everybody so one thing though that i think that i might try to be mindful of if the idea is to actually repurpose this is to not do a lot of my own zooming because now that can happen better in postproduction uh okay um okay everybody yes there we go ready everyone do their spread okay by the way i have the discord member live chat going on here so i can see that here and i have the youtube chat over here this is actually a really good way of doing it and incidentally i suppose i mean i don't want to this is a way that i could actually show what's happening in discord on the live stream by switching over to it but i don't want to do that right now because i guess i could go to like uh yeah anyway um okay so slide puzzle where's my timer i'll do a timer on my phone okay clock timer 30 minutes this is 30 minutes okay i'm going to try to make a slide puzzle in 30 minutes you won't be able to see the timer i'm sure we could create some type of better system for doing this that would be ah the camera no no not the camera not the camera jeez louise people what if i take the battery out would that help it's plugged in are you overheating why why do you go off you look you've got you're plugged in you've got a charge i see no reason for you to turn yourself off camera all right i don't wanna i guess i'm just gonna have to like reset you and i have to like walk half a mile around to get back to my desk area here okay everybody okay stop i haven't started the timer yet ready everybody welcome folks to a coding challenge i haven't done one of these in a while i'm gonna set myself a timer here 30 seconds 30 seconds oh my god 30 minutes and i'm going to attempt to make a slide puzzle so this is the source image that i'm going to use i need to chop it up into a bunch of pieces allow you to like click to move the pieces around and see if you could solve it to put it back together and have something detect when it's put back together that it works there's almost no chance that i'm going to get this done in 30 minutes but you know c'est la vie here i go all right so one of the things that we need to use that i need to use for this is the copy function because what i want to do first is just take this image and chop it up into a bunch of smaller images so let me call those uh the pieces and i'll make an array and then in setup uh and i should figure out how many columns and rows that i want so let's just make it it's right now it's a 400 by 400 so let's just make it four by four um and so the um and i also i'm going to probably want to keep track of like the width and height of each piece i probably should do this in like an objectoriented way where there's like class piece and but that's not happening right now um so we i'm going to say uh 4 let i equal 0 i is less than the number of columns and then j is less than 0 j less than the number of rows and then w o w is the width of the canvas divided by the number of columns h is the height of the canvas divided by the number of rows okay and then for each one of these i need to make a new image or the new the image is a piece of the larger image i'm going to turn off auto refresh for a second so i need to take the source image and copy from it oh i think i could just use get i'm really obsessed with the idea of using copy because hopefully by the time this video comes out there will be an entire video all about the copy function and processing in p5 let's look at the reference um oh i know i remember i think i remember how copy works but maybe i could just use get because get i believe it returns an array of rgba values which is not what i want i want an actual like image i want a sub image p5 image oh so array of sub image from a p5 image yeah that's what this is well i i maybe copy is what i want i know copy will work um in the sense that i can copy from this image onto this image let's use copy so this is fine i'm going to use copy because i know it's going to work and the first thing i'll do is create a blank image that is the size of one of the pieces i really want to use the whiteboard just because i have a whiteboard this is going to take up too much time i've got 26 minutes left but if you don't mind humoring me for a second i'm gonna go over here to oh and i'm gonna have to erase the whiteboard that's gonna take quite a bit of time and i i don't have an eraser i'm in a new space this is the first this is momentous this is the first coding challenge in my new space this whiteboard it rolls around it's very shaky i put it together myself it did a terrible job putting it together i hope this is all recording i need to find a marker okay this is great oh i feel i feel alive oh this okay so the idea here is i have a source image and what i first want to do is on my canvas i want to take i'm going to chop this up one two three one two three into four by four and i want to take this section of the image and place it on the canvas but keep this as a separate variable like a piece so that these pieces can be locked to a part of the original oh i really need it i just need a knot i'm going to i got to do this object oriented right because the piece should know where its home base is as well as where it currently is so if they're being shuffled when all the pieces are in the right place we've won so what do i need to make a class a piece class that has the um it's like cur it's like a current index like if i number all these zero one two three four five six seven blah blah blah blah i wanna keep track of where it currently is as well as um as well as where it's original spot it's it's home bases so we know when the puzzle solved all right let's let's do that it's worth it it'll be worth it how's this going uh all right um i'm looking at the chat okay let's see um now so let me i gotta open this up here i'm gonna make a new javascript file and i'm going to call it piece.js tile it's probably tile is what they are right let's call it tile.js so i have a tile class and what does it have in it it has the index so i'm going to pass that in as an argument and it has its image okay so i mean there's probably more to do with this but i'm basically just want to wrap the idea of the image's piece and where it's supposed to be in to this constructor okay good here we go uh so now what i'm actually doing is i'm still creating the image then i'm saying copy uh what am i copying i'm copying from the source zero zero oh no no no no the in the source the x location is i times the width the y location is j times h and i'm copying from the source i j with height 2 0 0 with height so if this is confusing to you thank goodness i have a white board even though my lighting needs to be fixed and there's so many issues but let me explain what's going on here right each one of these pieces is an image i didn't switch the button but that's okay because i'm recording it all but i'm running over here there now at least you can see it if you're watching this live each one of these pieces is a standalone image where this is zero zero and its height is with an h but if i'm copying this one and it's column two row one boy this is like so messy this whiteboard but that's fine um then basically i need to know what is this location this location is column times width height row times height and then so take this section and copy it to this part of the piece all right so now um and i think this is right right it's um it should be the source image source x source y source to the destination so um it doesn't show you calling this on an image but that's fine that's what i'm doing i want to copy the source image at this location to this destination which is image at this location great then i need to make a a tile is a new tile with an index oh the camera went off the camera went off it's just it's like just like the old days nothing has changed on the cutting trade doesn't matter how many years i do this i have to reset the camera it's part of the time why why it's plugged in you're plugged in there's no reason for your power to go dark okay i have to run this is good i'm gonna get so many steps for my steps challenge okay um index and then the image now what is the index the index is the uh i'm not going to use any twodimensional arrays here i'm just going to keep track of um the the the individual index counting zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen zero three fifteen sixteen total tiles uh press this button so the index is i plus j times the number of columns um and the so that's a new tile and then i should be able to let's just put let's call this tiles let's just put all the tiles into an array just out of curiosity now let me loop through that array and uh say and actually you know what might be good this is just gonna make my life so much easier i'm gonna keep track of the index the column and the row because i actually just want to give it its uh well no because it's going to move around i don't know what i'm doing right now let's do ah okay i have an idea let's make let's make a variable called board so this is the board the board is an array of all of the elements in the order that they're in so um and i'm gonna eventually need to put a negative one for the empty one but um so board push index so basically i'm gonna have an array that keeps track of the positions of all of the tiles and then this is a little bit silly but i'm going to do it this way i'm gonna i'm gonna just always use a nested loop just to get that index and then i'm going to say board index uh um i guess show so let me just do uh yeah which why would make sense to keep track of uh you know what uh this is a little bit weird what i'm doing okay i have to think i have to think i have to think i have to think just you know rain going churning i have 18 minutes left this is wonderful oh so much time so much time ah my by the way this this came alive the uh stream deck buttons uh now now there's the coding coding train discord and there's 205 of you supposedly watching this right now all right um okay let me think about this for a second let me be a little bit more thoughtful here i was trying to avoid using a twodimensional array but maybe that's silly so ah yes so i want to have this array which i'm going to call board and it's going to have like it'll be all of the numbers shuffled in random order so as i go through i yes i draw the image at that spot like the zero spot what the zero spot would be x and y but i go look up image three or index three from my uh array of all the tiles i don't know if that made sense to you but i had to walk over to the whiteboard to sort of think through that in other words x is this is exactly what i'm doing x is i times w y is j times h and then the image i want to draw is board index well it's not yeah board uh is it's actually like tiles board index i mean this is like a crazy way to write it but i basically want the number the index that's in the array called board to tell me which tile to look up so so this is tile i'll call it like tile index or i think this might be a nice way of writing it right now they'll be in order because i haven't shuffled it right i'm putting them all in order and then i should be able to say image image x comma y so i'm hoping that when i run this sketch i'm going to identically see the image because the only things that i've done is chop it up into a bunch of tiles put those tiles in order no i should just i don't like does anybody know this is a sony alpha seven it doesn't just go off after a certain amount of time because it's obviously been on it was on for the whole first hour of the stream without going off and now it just keeps going off um right and lucas is saying in the chat that i could do index modulus columns y index divided by columns i don't know why i'm like for some reason i that math like hurts my brain i was like i'm doing i'm doing all this like gymnastics to avoid doing that but that would certainly make a lot of sense all right what i want to say is when i run this i chopped up the image put them into an array in order and then i'm going and getting them one at a time and showing them all right what happened there's an errors copy could not be called as a function create image was expecting a string oh oh am i supposed to do create imedge yeah so i think i did the dom image element by accident tile is not defined oh so no problem no problem yep tile.js that's a file i'm working with thank you very much uh failed to execute draw load pixels hmm all right hold on let's just do create okay p5 reference uh yeah create image load picks maybe i just need to call load pixels i thought to do copy i don't need to but i must oh and all sorts of weirdness happened here and then let's do like image update pixels let's try that signature not supported what is going on what just happened what signature not supported what is going on well let me take this out okay the sketch is running uh let's do this one okay uh okay we're good create image load pixels oh wait it's source that i need to load pixels i need to load the pixels from source but what is this signature not supported did i forget to say like rgb here i don't think that usually matters copy oh like i guess like the way that i am okay i'm just gonna google copy i'm sure that is a path towards me solving this problem no not right now i've totally done this is is this why i switched to processing in my other video checkline 25 parameters are wrong i know uh oh look at this i deleted some stuff ah i when i was like mucking around some stuff got deleted i need all those numbers all those numbers and i want to sort copy it from x comma y yikes okay i don't need this rgb thing okay now we're getting somewhere uh i don't know if i need all these load pixels and update pixels still good okay everybody oh hold on oh image equals tile dot image so i need to pull the image property out of the tiles no okay update pixels copy all right hold on tiles oh hold on let's take a look at what's going on here how do i find the uh must be this usually this lets me find and like log the right now this is like ah there we go all right so tiles there is okay so let's console.log tile index um the camera went off again yeah it's got to be overheating which is weird this one doesn't seem to be overheating i should switch cameras it's on the same amount of time it did go off at one point i told you this would be a total fail this year i camera keeps going off then i got stuck on a weird bug okay um let's look at the uh let me put no loop in here oh i have eight minutes left nine minutes left okay so all those numbers came out okay so am i getting an image so there's an image where's the x and y those are the right locations let's take out all these like load pixels and update pixels ah so somehow load was it load pixels and update pixels very much unnecessary do i need this one yeah okay i didn't need any of the low pixels and update pixels there's a little bit of a mystery here i definitely want to use the pixels but i have a feeling that and sometimes when you need access to the pixel array directly you've got to like in advance load the pixels and when you change the pixel array you have to update the pixels i have a feeling here copy is doing the work for us so we're good now you might not believe me now this is actually showing it as separate tiles now let me let me prove this by um trying to think of like by just drawing some lines over it um this is going to be a slightly awkward way of doing it but let me just do stroke weight two no fill oh but this is silly i'm just drawing the lines for they're actually like if i change this to like width minus with minus 10 height minus like if i make the images smaller right okay i just wanted to show you that i am actually they are separate pieces okay so uh i i visually it might help i think to actually just draw little thin lines over it with the rectangles and this is very silly this extraneous kind of code that i'm doing but um i think this will help yeah so i just wanted to draw some lines over it now now we are really getting somewhere because in theory if all i do is shuffle this array right have all of the elements of the array in random order then i should see the image chopped up and moved around so let's do that six minutes left so i'm going to write a function called shuffle which receives an array and then i'm going to just say like um a hundred times pick element one well let's do r1 is array dot rand a random number floor a random number between zero and the length of the array r2 is floor a random number between zero and the length of the right now in theory i don't want these two elements to be the same but i'm doing it a bunch of times i want to swap i'm just the way i'm going to shuffle the array is by picking any two elements and swapping their place so now temp is that arrays r1 value then and you know i'm going to need i'm going to write a swap function because i'm going to need that i think also when i move the pieces so function swap is swap index i and j of an array so temp is index i and then that arrays i element is the j element and the j element is that temporary value now you might be wondering like what what and there's a way i know there's some like spread operator or oh maybe there's like deconstructing an array like can i do something like this array like there's some kind of like i there's some kind of um object deconstruction way i can do a swap and i'll put it up on the screen if i ever make this into an edited video but basically the oldfashioned oh the old old way that we used to swap our elements in an array is we take element one store it somewhere temporary because we need to put a new thing in that spot and then we saved it temporarily we could put that thing we saved in the spot that just the other thing came out of so if i just did this if i just did this it looks right like i should be j and j should be i but if i is j then j will be j because i is now j and oh it's just not good so temporary stuff okay so now i want to swap r1 r2 in that array so let's shuffle the array um let's i don't need to shuffle the tiles the tiles is just an array of elements i'm shuffling the array that's keeping track of the index indices of all of them maybe i didn't need these two arrays but it's the way that i'm thinking of it right now shuffle the board oh hmm board is what did i miss i missed something obvious probably uh oh i'm already using shuffle as a variable ah maybe is that oh is that up oh you know what i think there might be a p5 function already for this there's a p5 shuffle and it uses probably a fancier algorithm whatever this fischer yates shuffle algorithm is which has all these beautiful visualizations and of course my camera is off what a what a mess how long ago did it go off come back well good thing i wrote that p5 shuffle function i'm sorry well good well good thing i wrote my own shuffle function p5 the reason i'm getting that error is there already is a global function in p5 called shuffle and it uses this uh fischer yates shuffle algorithm which i can only assume is better than whatever i did although is it the same i don't know we could read this page and discover we should it could be another coding challenge the fischer yates shuffle algorithm okay but thankfully for us what was what's this argument modified a past array optional what does that do is it oh modifying the array or keeping the additional one well you know what i'm gonna do uh i'm just gonna call this a simple shuffle that way and i could use the p5 one you should try it yourself there we go look i have mixed up the elements all right so one thing that for it to be a slide puzzle that i need to do is i need to be able to i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking remove one of them so i should also pick a random one simple shuffle and then i should pick i mean i and then i should pick a random one to remove or do i always want to remove like the top left one how do slide puzzles work is it always the bottom right one that's missing does anybody know that's the timer going off [Laughter] oh and then by shuffling the tiles randomly you could end up with an unsolvable sliding puzzle oh bottom right so actually i don't want to shuffle this way because i want to remove the bottom right one so uh columns and then let's just delete the last one pop is it pop and that'll be empty okay great so as long as uh as long as if tile index is greater than zero draw the image so now whoops oh greater than greater than negative one okay so now i have made the board um and i i could shuffle it i could still shuffle it now now but this isn't going to be this is not what i want to do but this shuffling is no good because in theory now is it possible that it's unsolvable or is is it always possible to move them around because what i could do is i could instead of i need a move basically i need a function that like moves one element so i need to know where the negative one is oh oh this is a hard problem and it is 108 p.m i can do this i'm so close i'm so close um let me just get a move function going okay i'm gonna take out this no loop okay so function move so the function is going to receive a given index so the first thing i need to know is is that so the idea is i'm clicking on an index like i'm going to click on one of them and it's only a valid move if it's above below to the right or to the left so i do need this function like uh the column is index well you know what i couldn't i could pick a random column or row so that function so then uh i need to know where the negative one is so let's let's just have a variable blank spot is uh and then the blank spot is i guess i could always oh this is so bad you know what i'm going to do i'm going to write a function find blank uh um obviously there's better ways to track all this so this is a way to quickly check all of it to find which one is blank and then so i have that index so the blank the blank column is the blank the blank spot modulus the number of columns and the blank row is floor the blank index divided by the number of rows that's the inverse of putting it back i should just use the twodimensional array okay so that's the blank column in row so now if so i and j if i and j is a neighbor if is neighbor i j blank um there's got to be an easier way to check if it's a neighbor right so if it's a neighbor then swap blank with i plus j j times columns of that array so the move basically the idea of doing a move is uh there's a spot that i want to move and i need to find if it's if it's a proper neighbor to the blank spot then it can be swapped with it oh no that's not yeah yeah yeah when you move a thing and tile into it it becomes the blank spot okay so i just need now an is neighbor function you the viewer will write this in a so much better way i'm on a time crunch here i'm way over my 30 minute limit uh function is neighbor of uh i'm just doing x1 y1 x2 y2 so um let me do i j i j x y so it's a valid neighbor if so first if i is not equal to x and j is not equal to y return return false so it's either got to be in the same column or the same row so if they're both not the same then it's not a neighbor then if the absolute value of i minus x equals 1 it's one spot away or the absolute value of j minus y if it's one spot away return true and i know i could return like the result or whatever and yeah so otherwise otherwise it's the same spot so i'm just gonna say return false if it gets to the end i think this will work just did that kinda like awkwardly right it's gotta both be in either the same column or row and one spot away so now shuffling so what shuffling is should be picking a move random uh columns and random rows obviously i could pick from the valid neighbors but that's too much work that's just fine i'm just going to pick randomly enough times that they'll be valid moves camera cool down it's very cool here in the garage it's a nice cool day i really need to get going i'm 45 minutes over but i'm so close i'm so close all right so now i i know i'm gonna just repeat what i was saying i know i could uh just i know i could just pick from valid neighbors to do a move but if i do it enough times i'll pick valid neighbors enough times that this should work so now i should just say move r1 and r2 and move if it's a finds the blank spot and if the blank spot is a neighbor it swaps it with i don't know if this is going to work let's just try it uh array ah move i guess move should the function should get the array i mean i'm only using one array so it's a little bit silly um but uh yeah there we go okay so that that's a valid shuffling now i'm just curious let me make this a random move function again i will refactor this later i mean i don't know if i will uh let's do random move so like if i do a thousand moves oh uh array it's a little bit silly how i have to like i'm not using global variables well okay so that should be a random shuffling that's possible but just out of curiosity in draw if i just said random move of the tiles this is very silly how i have arguments that somewhere and not other places yeah i got to fix this up later but i don't want to shuffle it i just want to see it do a one move per okay cannot read properties undefined image why random move of tiles hold on why can't i just do a random move all right what's going on here it works to do a bunch of them do i need to do it i mean this doesn't make any sense i mean if i do it at the beginning or not oh board it's the board there we go oh i'm not drawing the background so the old piece is there okay so this is it shuffling the puzzle randomly oh i love this so fun okay so now all i need to do now is have a mouse pressed function and i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna go back to shuffling it to start uh where where where where where where where so take out this and mouse press function is so the column that i'm clicking on is floor mouse x divided by the number of columns right and the row and i'm going to call this i and the row that i'm clicking on is floor mouse y divided by the number of rows and then move i j tiles now i'm not giving myself any feedback or i'm not seeing an animation all of those are things that i hope that you will add but in theory if i click on this one and i know the camera just went off but i know if i but but in theory if i click on one of them it should move if it's a valid neighbor what what did i i j array find blank so console log i j 60 whoops no no no divided by w and h not divided by the number of columns divided by the width of the column is it zero one or two okay it's like what am i losing my mind here okay no oh not the tiles not the tiles the board the board yeah look at that now i'm pressing the buttons and so now it is solved um if is solved if the board uh if so console log solved we will not have any fanfare just a console log solved so i'm going to write a function is solved where i'm going to go 4 let i equal 0 i is less than board dot length minus one i don't need to check the last one i plus plus and then if board index i is not equal to tiles index i dot index right isn't that didn't i save where it's supposed to be yes in the tile class then that's a piece that's in the wrong place so return false and if you get through everything all of them are in the right place return true so if i don't shuffle the board at all in setup it's solved it's showing me it's solved now if i shuffle it in setup it's not solved and i can solve it okay let's make it easier for me to solve oh my god i think i got this i think i did it you did it i think i made a slide puzzle um uh so let's just shuffle it simple shuffle like five times okay no it didn't pick oh there we go okay great so in theory all i need to do and i think it's this is left over from from the previous timer is just click on this element it will move up and go into place solved yay okay awesome so um just for fun because what are we doing but having fun i am going to uh have it be eight by eight and i am going to let it shuffle a hundred times well i guess i guess with more pieces it's not going to pick the thing randomly but hold on this is a little bit harder solved i did it no let's keep it but this is kind of fun because you realize you could do like you know a 20 by 20 slide puzzle here right and how many times do i need like you know obviously again i need a better shuffling algorithm but if i do it 10 000 times you know that's a lot of interesting moves there but let's go back let's go back to making it four by four and make this puzzle solvable for myself i'm gonna shuffle it just i'm gonna do a hundred random moves okay camera's off this is the last thing i'm doing let me and let me try this is the last thing i'm going to do i'm going to make it four by four i'm going to shuffle it just 100 times and let's see if i can solve this oh shoot oh wait a sec i think i did it yes i solved it all right so what can you do well you can be more thoughtful about what image you pick you could add animations there's a million opportunities to refactor this code to make it more s make more sense i mean this object could do so much i started like i need to make this object oriented but i did not follow through with that but also one prompt that i would have for you is there's no reason you couldn't do this with a video or some abstract generative art drawing i mean so many possibilities there because as long as you have an image even if it's an image that's changing over time you can shuffle it and you can solve it and a move counter for scoring so many things thank you for watching this coding challenge and i will see you next time on the coding train all right everybody uh that's all i got time for today uh i don't know if this i i think it's probably pretty unlikely that this is actually gonna get edited into something although i do think it's a nice um so if it doesn't work to edit what i did today i probably will off live streaming sometime on my own just kind of recreate this process so when you know i look forward to when all of you be like see the edited video that's released being like what you're wearing different clothes you did it so much more easily you really made it nicely object oriented so it might be a second pass of doing this but i'm gonna see if this can be edited uh and see what happens all right um i gotta go so i'm just gonna put on music and get out of here sorry they don't have time to answer any questions or say goodbye i might be back next friday or two weeks from today it could also be live streaming instead on a monday it all rains to be seen thank you again let me just give a big shout out to curiositystream sign up at curiositystream.comcodingtrain you get uh 26 off it's 15 for the entire year for all of the documentary documentaries plus access to watch nebula and all nebula and all the originals and things that are there and all these wonderful content creators you should definitely support nebula and curacao stream and me i think they're great and i'll see you next time goodbye you
