hello bonus part 5 you don't have to really be watching this video I finished in the last one but I was going to add this I'm going to record a video of the adding it because why not right so I just want to add one little interface element to this you should add more interface elements and what I'm going to add is a checkbox to turn the debugging stuff on and off so how do I do that there's a bunch of different ways I could do this what I'm going to do is I'm going to use the p5 Dom library and I'm going to say I'm going to create a variable called debug and I'm going to say debug equals create checkbox I think it's the function let's just see let's just see I'm going to run this refresh it look at that so now there's a little checkbox check check check check so the p5 Dom library allows you to just generate Dom elements on the fly and it adds them directly to the page now I have a whole set of Dom tutorial videos that I will link to because there's a lot of other interface elements you can imagine adding to this that allow you to control various parameters I'm just adding the debug checkbox okay so now that I have this I can say okay this is so it'd be this sure my world record for shortest video ever and I know I'll ruin it by talking for way too much but right here in the vehicles display function this is where I draw the debugging information so guess what let's let me just go here to the console if I type in debug we can see it's a p5 element and if I say debug dot checked checked its false now if I check it and say debug checked its true is so easy wow what a nice fun little thing to discover so I'm going to say if debug checked I should make it prettier and design and use some CSS and all that sort of stuff if debug got checked draw all that debug information so now I'm going to refresh this page and we can see this is really what it should look like I don't need to see all of the debugging information I just want to see the system behave so I'm going to let it run for a little bit maybe to do back such a lame joke we stopped doing the joke I'm going to let it run for a little go on a train ride that that's not any better oh I'm back I'm back I came back and now let's take a look at the debugging information and we can see we have you know this is a little less obvious result than we got the last time but you can see there's some good ones here with a kind of strong attraction force a repulsion force of the poison and their perception radius being larger small so anyway this is a kind of nice way to add an interface that I can kind of take a look at different views it can add a slider or tweak a bunch of things I hope that you think about design like your creativity you know on the one hand the creativity you can add to this is a purely visual thing so what's the story you're telling what kind of visual elements will tell that story what kind of clever interactions can you offer a user but also I think your creativity can really be about designing the system so right now there's only food there's only poison there's only two weights and two perception radii what other things can you add to this I hope you add some of those like the code will be linked on github and all each code has a readme and if you want to add something you make you can add it with a pull request to that readme and if you don't know how to do that just add a comment on YouTube check my how to do a pull request video which I have somewhere I'll see you in a future Cody Jones thanks very much
