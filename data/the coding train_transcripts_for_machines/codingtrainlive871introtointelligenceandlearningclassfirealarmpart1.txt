it is Friday March seventeenth here in New York City at New York University I'm a little bit concerned about the audio today because when I was trying to monitor it there was a little bit of a glitch but I'm seeing lots of green bars move up and down as they're supposed to so please as soon as you see me and hear me and there's no audio problem let me know in the chat really tired today so um what's happening this is my name is Dan this is the coding train it is a weekly live stream on YouTube where I do a variety of different things from that range from showing projects that other people have made having guests doing tutorials coding challenges on various other things everything's good and so I have a big project that's coming up and i think i may have improperly mislead people that I was really getting started with this project today and I'm just a little bit behind or I was kind of wrong about the dates but let me let me pull up let me let me talk about what I want to talk about here so I'm teaching a class called intelligence and learning it is part two of a course that just finished up which was about physics and animation and this class is you know ostensibly about machine learning but I've been thinking about this a lot reading a lot of stuff we come over here for a second okay so there is the term artificial item of intelligence that's a term there was the term machine learning and then there is also the term deep learning okay maybe that artificial maybe there's something this I don't know that may be right I feel like I was either watching a video or reading somebody's paper for they heard making a similar diagram know who to credit this from but I probably got it wrong anyway but so one of the things that I want to do in this course is not simply focus on any one of these particular topics this is not a deep learning course which is only about you know say tensorflow and deep neural networks and deep deeper and deeper and deeper neural networks this is not a course just about machine learning this is not of course just about artificial intelligence for me this is part two of the nature of code and the central theme of the nature of code is looking at the beauty and wonder of things in the natural world and creating pieces writing code that emulates those things for art interaction you know etc fill in the blank and so I want it for this course I want to continue as that thread and in many ways I'm not so concerned with accuracy and I'm more you know my goal in this course is not to create a to teach how to make a selfdriving car that works perfectly but to a way of creating software agents that have the appearance the illusion perhaps of having intelligence of making decisions so there's a lot a lot that goes with that so I don't know it's going to sew all most like the illusion it's very similar to the approach that I take with Craig Reynolds steering behaviors which is this idea of creating agents that appear lifelike and improvisational and so if we can give these things we program and move around the screen a brain to make decisions they can make smart decisions they can make not so smart decisions they can make random decisions what is a wide range of possibilities so this is the central theme of the course I'm hanging up right now because my plan was real starts next week and I think I said I said next week last week because nyu has a spring break this week and so my course doesn't actually start this week in my mind it was next week but there's a pretty good between so I got a little confused then there was this big snowstorm and I know everything and I got all this you know everything is gone haywire in my brain and in my schedule in my time but this is what I'm thinking about now what could be a first step to this I'm just jumping right in know how I always spent all this time doing on this introductory stuff I'm actually on a little bit of a tighter schedule today and i only have until like 12 or 1230 this is a shorter shorter session although I think I've set myself up like I've sent wrong expectations my plan was always like this is one or two hours every week now suddenly I do these like three hours then come back for like last week I had live street I live stream for five and a half hours on Friday this is not sustainable much just as much fun as I have doing that so anyway today's gonna be a little bit shorter there's a possibility that i'll have a bonus some bonus time but but anyway I'm here right now so this is this is the sort of central topic now what could be a place I'm coming over here what could be a place to start so here's what everyone is requesting and asking for always from in in messages I get everybody seems to be the most interested in this topic neural networks I hope I mean I think what why is that well number one is there has been an explosion in the last few you okay I'm not even kidding you right now can you guys hear that hold on that's the fire alarms going off I'm gonna have to leave by the way I gotta get my phone I don't know if I should just leave this streaming and like leave the mic on for as long i agree i can stream from my phone can you guys hear that okay you probably can hear that now and in the hallway Shh alright alright guys I cannot believe this but I I'm gonna have to just turn this off I don't think I should leave the streaming computer on and so i guess i will be back at some point later today I'm gonna it keeps like stopping but it's going i'm gonna turn off my I assume it so what time's it 1115 it's probably a fire drill but anyway I'm turning off my mic maybe I'll live stream from my phone or I'll come back at some point later today I'll follow me on twitter i got to stop talking follow me on twitter at Schiffman ok goodbye
