hello welcome to session five of programming from A to Z which is like a thing that I'm doing on the internet on YouTube some tutorials topics around programming with text now on the one hand you could divide this course this set of playlists together into two parts there's analyzing text and there's generating text and today's session is really about and/or you can also think of that as reading text and writing text right and most of the projects that I've been demonstrating or that I will show or talk about do some combination of both maybe they read in a source material mash it up chop it up and generate something from it today though I really want to focus on the reading in of text the analysis of text so when I say today I mean what I'm doing right now but ultimately the set of tutorials that I'm going to make so if you I'm gonna give you a sort of summary of the topic I'm going to show you some relevant projects that might inspire you with ideas but if you want to just get to the coding part you can skip to the next video in this playlist you should be in the session five or a week five programming from A to Z playlist so the building block so text analysis by text analysis I mean reading in a text analyzing it and producing some result that could that result could be sentiment analysis it's a positive text as a negative text it could be ah this text is very similar in style to another text there are so many different kinds of ways you can about this is a difficult text and easy text you can imagine what kinds of outcome statistical analysis whatever you could do from reading and text with the computer program but the we need a building block and the building block for every single one of these text analysis examples of scenarios and that I will present and show you how to code is word counting actually we're counting is a totally simple thing and this is not a new thing so I'm gonna pop over to this Wikipedia page here on this idea of a concordance so it concordance concordance concordance a concordance is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work listing of each word with its immediate context blah blah blah blah blah what that means is a concordance is hey I want to know all the words that were in this text and I want to know how many times they appeared and where they appeared so I'm gonna do something simpler when I build an actual code example which is just here's a list of all the words in a text and how many times those words appeared and this is not something that's just sort of a computing thing this has been done you know this has been done by hand many years with you know you know well you know this used to be done by hand and so there's some information here about biblical concordance is you know reading the text manually making this big list making references you know an index in a way it's very similar to a concordance in many ways as well it's a sort of list of topics and where they appear in a particular book so I encourage you but you can see that here again this list I think is useful I am this is hello this is Daniel Shipman reading you a Wikipedia page on the internet but this is kind of useful context and it has some nice it's kind of or it some nice reference material for you to like kind of expand further into this territory but you can see this idea of analyzing one thing you can do with the concordance is is try to figure out are there key words associated with a piece of text one of the examples I'll show you is a term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm that pulls out key words from a text and all sorts of other things that you can do with a concordance algorithm so let me show you some examples so first of all here's a great example this is by rune Matson and they'll be in this video's description they'll be links to all these projects this is called speech comparison it's a project created in processing and this is a kind of what you might typically see as a kind of example project idea with a text concordance this is visualizing a bunch of speeches by these particular speakers and counting all the counting words and you can see here a list of words that appear in the text and then drawing a colorcoded visualization of the frequency of that term you can see here climate mmm climate is used a lot by this purple person I like to think of myself as a purple person I don't know what color you think of yourself I think was almost purple and you can see that person is Al Gore you know wellknown and famous for his work in climate I was gonna say climate science but I don't that's accurate you know promotion or getting the message out there about the issue of climate change and so this is something you might think about doing how could you creatively visualize the words that appear in a given text let me go show you another project by Sarah Groff Palermo this project is called BookBook and I encourage you to take a look more deeply at this project but I'm going to click here this is a comparison of the jungle by Sinclair versus the jungle book by Kipling and I'm gonna click on this and what you're seeing here is what are the words that are unique to one text but not in another text so this is something you could also really do with word counting and look at a comparison of two texts by the way this is how spam filtering works let's look at all of my emails which are not spam and count all the word frequencies in those and let's look at all of my emails that are spam and count all the frequencies in those and then build a statistical probability that a new email fits into one of those categories and you can see it's not just about what is what kind of words are in a spam email it's all about the relationship of spam to regular emails and you can get one one way to think about this by the way is you know I get a lot of spam emails that are trying to sell me like a mortgage so mortgage is a word frequency that appears very in a lot of my spam emails but let's say and so that's a good indicator but if I were a mortgage broker I probably get a lot of actual mortgage emails so that word wouldn't be as relevant to me so just detecting it just word frequency in one document but how it compares to others is kind of a key way to do text analysis and we'll see some examples of that you can also look Sara's project also has the ability for you to look at the words that appear in both texts I believe if I click over to see that both of them together what another wonderful work in data visualization another artist I love is Stephanie possa Beck and Stephanie has a lot of work with I said a lot of work with handdrawn data visualization she has a beautiful project with Georgia noopy called dear data which they sent these data visualization handdrawn postcards to each other look that up find it and put a link in this video's description but she worked on a album cover for okay album artwork for okay go and doing visualization of word frequencies in their song lyrics you can see how some of these came out what that what kind of visual quality they have and you can also sort of see like what's going on here there's some diagrams showing exactly you know parts of speech concordance common words that are both common to both text counting sort of like what texts have different syllables in and so sentence length so there's a lot of ways you can use that sort of just raw numbers of a text to glean something from it and to sort of play around with different visual ideas so this site these are ideas that I encourage you to think about what's a text that really interest you where can you get text by the way let me mention here also if you're thinking about places you might look for texts examples and I think I just have two links on this page here and you know send me or your links and I'll add them to this page but Project Gutenberg is certainly one that you might explore Project Gutenberg is an online repository of texts that are in the public domain so there's Jane Austen's work is there all of William Shakespeare's plays are there you'll find lots of other thing I have one I have an ode example that does a text concordance for Pride and Prejudice so this is something that you might consider looking at you can get the text in in raw txt files which are convenient to use in a project okay so this is sort of the summary of this building block so what are the things that I'm going to show you that you can use this idea of word counting for and how will I demonstrate it what was what is going to be in these next videos so the examples I'm going to first just show you the basics of how to in JavaScript read in a body of text count how many times each word appears and sort that list in order of frequency now in conceptually it's a very simple thing to do I could do it you know by hand but how you do that in a computer program opens up a topic which is about something called an associative array so what is an associative array sometimes referred to as a hash map or a dictionary so I'm gonna make a video just about this topic what is an associative array and how can you implement one in JavaScript and I might mention a bit about how you can do it in processing in Java as well and then I'm gonna build a word counting application simple word counting application it won't do an interesting visualization but you could take it and visualize it in your own way I mentioned to you that you could do the same thing but with counting parts of speech and then I want to look at keyword extraction using algorithm called tfidf or term frequency inverse document frequency where I read it where you'll read in multiple texts and look at words that are unique to one text but not in the others and that's a way of knowing well the appears in a lot of text but not necessarily the so that it's not a keyword even though it appears very frequently but in the rainbow Wikipedia article rainbow appears a lot but it doesn't appear in a lot of other Wikipedia articles so this idea of inverse it's in its frequent in this document but not frequent in other documents I'm gonna look at that algorithm and I don't think I'm gonna be doing this today but at some point in this playlist hopefully it will also appear a set of lessons about doing text classification is it spam or not spam using Bayesian probability so this is a complex topic it's I'm gonna have to just spend another full day on that probably and I want to also mention how you might do this stuff in processing in Java and also maybe serverside programming with node so that's kind of the summary of the things and then I'll come back at the end and I'll talk you through some exercise ideas ah and this reminds me so I want to I want to talk about something of this video you could could very well be over but it's not because I want to talk to you about one of my favorite books that I've read called the secret life of pronouns by James W Pennebaker I encourage you to read this book I will link in this video's description to Pennebaker TED talk which gives kind of a 20minute summary of the topic but here's the thing I mentioned before sentiment analysis so let's think about that sense of analysis I want to know is this text positive or negative well I might look for content based words what kind of there is the word happy joyful are those frequent or is the word sad or depressed are those frequently used so this idea I've always thought at least that text analysis is associated with word frequencies analyzing word counts but looking at the sort of big words the content words the descriptive words James Pennebaker who's a psychologist who's done a lot of work with analyzing the ways that writing can help people get through trauma discovered something I you know from what I understand in his research somewhat accidentally because he started out also looking for these content words but what he discovered is you know and in text and Alvin we're counting what you're often doing is saying like oh I'm always getting za and she and she and I and me and my they I should just make a list of stop words or junk words to ignore and that's kind of a common technique but what he discovered was that these words actually unlock oh the key in many ways to analyzing the emotional state of an author and lots of other properties of an author is an author or a speaker lying or telling the truth the use of the personal pronoun IV or my the frequency of that reveals a lot about a person's status in relationship to another person status so I encourage you to think about that and one of the exercises for this week could be to implement a sort of interactive system based on some of Pennebaker czar research so you could read the book and i'll point you to some resources where you can kind of get some more information about his research as well and and just to plug it a little bit more I'll mention something that I would encourage you to do secret life of pronouns when we go to the website is click on the exercises at the top and you can I would encourage you to try some of these don't click on them to look at them and think you're gonna try them later because you want to come to them fresh they're gonna ask you to write for 5 or 10 minutes and then it's gonna analyze your text for you but I encourage you to try these little I think you'll learn a lot about text analysis and about yourself and sort of thinking about project ideas or this space okay so I'm gonna get started actually looking at code and talking about the technical stuff now and in the next video I'm going to talk about associative arrays in JavaScript okay look forward to seeing you there hopefully maybe you
