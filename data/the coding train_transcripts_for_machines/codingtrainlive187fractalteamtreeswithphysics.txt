hello and welcome to my life okay ah is this happening this is really happening right now hello and welcome to the coding train I'm looking in front of me and seeing a light on over here and three lights that I forgot to turn on and actually about thirty seconds ago I forgot to put the mic on just scrambling to put the mic on let me go turn those lights on enjoy some music Here I am turning on lights number two like number three oh it's brighter in here now lovely ha all right now I'm really here and I am wearing my fancy new team trees sweatshirt strangely enough these trees seem to be purple also I something strange is going on but if you would like to see what this sweatshirt really looks like I will come over here oh boy it's bright I thought I fixed the settings on this camera but yeah I apparently did not welcome if you're new here maybe you came for the trees this is the coding train where I a person has signed a contract to every time I say the word train I have to blow a ridiculous train whistle it's my lot in life but really I come here on Fridays and other days and sometimes not at all to livestream coding tutorials and coding challenges and fun creative projects to make with code and basically also waste a lot of time with a lot of nonsense if you're really more interested in just coding tutorials I might tell you to go refer to some of the videos my playlists which are on my channel which are in playlists and edited together a little bit more succinctly for learning to code but today I am here to do a special livestream as part of this YouTube fundraiser that's happening today called team trees any money donated as part of the fundraiser we'll go to the National Arbor Foundation the goal is to raise twenty million dollars every dollar goes to plant a tree there's lots of information about this online at teen trees and a special thank you to today's sponsor of the livestream brilliant odd org I will come back brilliant I works a wonderful website with lots of fun interactive challenges and learning puzzles and courses in the middle of the live stream I will do the today's daily challenge thank you for their sponsorship of today's live stream I am donating the brilliant sponsorship feed to the National Arbor foundation for today's live stream okay I said train whistle Simoniz factchecking me and said I said train whistle but not did not blow the train whistle all right I will by the way I have a level in here now we can see if I am level don't break the level wait what happens if the level is more than one bubble in it now no it's back to one bubble hi Dan hey Dan Thank You TMC who donated five bucks I do see a quick notification popup when somebody donates but I don't see if I don't look quickly they seem to go away I should open up a page which shows me that Leonard gasps lured donated five euros I believe that's the unit of measurement to the National Arbor Day Foundation thank you very much ding and train with all and alle Babis writes hey Dan this is my first stream yay welcome Congrats on gaining a level dan what did I gain how did I gain a level what level did I gain I'm not sure what's going on all right so I'm pretty excited about what I'm going to code today and maybe I think it probably makes the most sense for me to just jump right into it I mean you know but in case you this is your first live stream and have never been here before I think I better just clue people in to what this channel really is like and often what I like to do is read helps me relax helps me get my mindset to think about coding and algorithms and all that stuff by reading from my favorite book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal TV it's still looking for a first edition complete copy of this book hard to find sixtyfour thousand one hundred sixtyone 3748 seventy three thousand twenty five doesn't feel like this is the right moment to read these numbers the one you have now the level the worst I'm so bad that I use corny sad trombone sound effects that literally what I have become in my life a person who wears a green sweatshirt that's seethrough play sad trombone sounds live streaming on YouTube wow this is the part that I'm happy about actually reading random numbers ninety thousand eight hundred thirty five ninety one thousand eight hundred forty three fifty four thousand three hundred forty three twenty seven thousand eight hundred and ninety seven fortythree thousand eight hundred and sixty six twelve thousand eight hundred twelve fifty five thousand ninety three eighty seven thousand four hundred and eighty nine twenty eight thousand seven hundred and eightythree fortytwo thousand four hundred thirty four forty seven thousand nine hundred and seventy two indeed three hundred seven thousand six hundred sixty eight ninety three thousand four hundred and seventy seven ninety two thousand five hundred and forty eight fiftyfive in 622 4338 66 thousand and twenty one fifty five thousand five hundred and fifty one ninety four thousand three hundred eighteen ninety three thousand three hundred and ninety one the music is very loud okay thanks for letting me oh yeah no it's at the same level it's always been maybe the lullaby sound is a little louder I will turn it down a little bit boy boink oh oh oh shamil and closer you asks what's the book about okay let me just write I think maybe you didn't get it so I better read another section fifty fifty thousand nine hundred fiftysix 77948 wente eight ninety five thousand four hundred and sixty nine random numbers six million I I'm gonna move lunch it's apparently first four hundred and twenty five people watching right now so I'm I'm kind of on a path and I have all these projects that I would like to and it by the way when I keep looking over here it's because I got multiple chaps and feeds and things telling me stuff about what's happening the live stream but I'm gonna focus on you the viewer and talk to you for a minute I have a lot of plans I have a lot of topics I want to attempt to cover and videos that to them because every week I'm distracted by some thing that I thought of or somebody told me about that I thought I would try and this is one of those weeks I'm I'm teaching a course called introduction to machine learning for the creative arts and most of that course does not have video tutorials associated with it and I really would like to get that up and running and fill that out but I'm here because I'm going to revisit something that I have wanted to do for years that I've never found the time to do and I'm going to do it as a coding challenge today for team trees for the team trees fundraiser so that is what I'm going to do is I'm to go back back in time two days of your a long long time ago all the way to coding challenge we're now on coding challenge number 152 which is kind of insane this is livestream number 187 apparently I've been doing this for quite a while now just nuts but I'm gonna go all the way back scroll scroll but you're not getting seasick coding challenge number 15 can I get there where am i 43 oh so many coding challenges coding challenge number one with starfield we're gonna find number 15 because that will form the basis of what I want to do so what I want to what I have already done everything I could possibly think of near something to do a tree pose is that like a yoga thing which is good I need to do more yoga to stretch so I have already done every possible algorithmic tree fractal thing that I could think of I have a coding challenge on just fractal trees with recursion making an object oriented to put some leaves at the end of the tree I did an lsystem I did the like spacewalk that's not what it is space colonization algorithm I've done a bunch so many yes space colonization 3d fractal trees lsystem I was like on a whole tree kick if only I had known this team trees we'd be planting trees here in 2019 I could have not done any of these I could just redo them today but I've done them before and so on David's reminding me yes I do want to show the RDP contributions I'm kind of getting to the community contributions thing so this is what I want to start with I want to start with making the objectoriented fractal trees because the thing that I said I definitely must have said in one of these videos is I would like to look at or I proposed this as a challenge to a viewer to add physics of the tree so you can draw the pattern of the tree recursively that's what's happening if I go here right we can just see this is a recursive tree and it's just unfurling all at once there's none of the information about the tree is retained it's just sort of like a stamp onto the canvas I could also oh we will here if I do this by this website oh no wrong way this website is awesome I could go to this one and this one I can't remember do I have it grow what's it broken is it broken oh no oh no I pressed I click so I could actually have the tree grow slowly over time and I could add some leaves that fall so this is actually now retaining information about the parts of the tree where they are and placing a shape at the end this is what I want to build on so this is what I need to maybe have the tree sway in the wind or something like that so that's what I'm going to do and there's some other tree challenges that do other things so what I thought I would do and this this one would be an interesting one to try as well but let's start with this one and what I wanted to do was look at some of the tree community contributions but since I recently released a coding challenge RDP Ramar Douglas poker algorithm you know it's a topic that everybody was just dying for me to do most but that I could maybe I should I would like to show those community contributions so let's start off with doing that if you are wondering how to submit your own community contribution there's an you this there's this link here and also see how you can do it for any coding challenge coding challenge number one from a long time ago you could do might not be able to wear this so much ole live stream there's a explanation of how it works here along with a video tutorial because that's the thing that I do apparently make video tutorials let's look at these community contributions that came in Raymer Drive this poker algorithm in 3d using p5.js let's take a look at that one wow that's wild so I think we're seeing it play out over time where the line line optimization or iterative line up to is may be called per make the leaves blow with wind perla noise so that's pretty interesting to see this 3d curve our path being iteratively simplified by removing excess points that's wonderful I'm kind of amazed at the WebGL engine in p5 works well enough for you to make something like this which is wonderful thank you for that let's take a look at this GPS route data swift for iPhone this is gonna take me to a YouTube video which might not be the easiest thing for me to just watch right now but why not so this is a swift app may be looking at a path and then yes so this is the this is definitely one of the applications of the algorithm which is to look at maybe look at geo geo data chart a path through lat/long points and then simplify that path by removing excess points that kind of thing that's pretty interesting no cancel I thought I had auto play off here hey look there's this live stream with fiveo it's a fundraiser look at all this new stuff going on on YouTube today let's take a look at Oh seriously oh yes so this was actually pointed out in one of the comments that oh it would have made sense to combine RDP with your earlier for a drawing videos because you could kind of take the user drawn the user drawing from made from the mouse and optimized it and looks like David Schneider did the very this so let's take a look at this okay I'm gonna draw something I'm gonna draw a tree that's gonna be this is how trees look all right and so what are the interesting things about you doing this with I see your comment Nathan about my messing up with Auto play don't think I don't see it one of the nice thing one of the interesting things that's happening here is by reducing the points the speed of the fourier visualization is suddenly so fast because it's tied the actual rotation speed and the number of epicycles is tied to the number of points so maybe there's a way to massage that in some way too even with fewer points to slow it down or I'm not so sure but that would be something to consider I would say and then already piece scaling fidelity to plot y axis lines ok motifs art I don't know I don't think I looked at this one whoa does this have sound feels like it should have sound this should have sound I don't know what sound that should have news sometimes I just like lose myself with my thoughts while livestreaming it's they didn't fix the air and in fact when I walked in here it was 68 degrees which is way too cool but I was happy with that because the it gets warm as I'm in here for a while but the sweatshirt thing is making it feel quite quite all right synth Wave music yeah I agree thank you for this these are beautiful I can't tell you how much joy it brings me to see people's variations of the coding challenges and the coding examples and sharing them and I hope that I'm doing a the best job that I can in sharing those back with the community and allowing people to engage with each other and be creative so if you have ideas and things that I could think about to do a better job let me know I will also mention that I am taking steps to be better about having merging contributions and bringing in more people to work on the github repos I will note that if you're looking for something to get started with it's still technically hack tober fest if you still need to get some pull request for your features a pull request for your features I just started speaking words that make no sense if you're still looking to get a number of pull requests for your tshirt oktoberfest tshirt you could contribute to the coding train website and in particular i will note act adding backlog of guests tutorials even tagged hacked Oberer fest so violet craze they are working to help me keep the github repos uptodate and managed and so I'm violet is there along with many other members of the community to help you out if you want to try contributing to the website one of the things that violet is looking at is what videos don't have a corresponding web page where people might want to share their versions even ones from years ago and so this is an issue that talks about how you can get involved with filling some of those in on the website if you're looking for or you know kind of getting started working with github and an open source project kind of thing and David says you forgot to remind me about the more contributions right oh thank you actually you didn't forget because you just reminded me and this is the last thing I'm gonna do before I start the coding challenge today a chrome uh tree yes I love that welcome to my chroma tree so what I want to say is if one thing you'll notice which is new on the website is you can also go definitely need like I don't have to cabana music that's yeah what's the Cabana music you've been using I should at least add that to my soundboard but probably this is the closest um you could go what I am I even saying I don't need to play music from my soundboard I am a very poor amateur ukulele player who happens to have a very out of tune ukulele that I forgot to tune before I started but we can go to the Cabana and if I go to the Cabana there is one compare the video from my series coding in the Cabana where I code a visualization of the more rows if you haven't seen this I don't know maybe you might enjoy it it's kind of fits with the team trees theme you can go check it out and now you can also because we have this page and maybe you have anyone who wants to contribute some ideas for how to make this look different more like you're in the Cabana you can now add your own versions and maybe soon I have a second coding the Cabana video coming out I should warn you all who hated the chalkboard that the chalkboard makes what we did much it did some excellent work to sort of reduce the amount of chalk sounds but the chalkboard will be no more one more time with the chalkboard you don't know what I'm talking about just go watch this video you'll know pretty quickly let's look at the Morrow's with UI ooh well so this is we can oh what does draw outline how cool I didn't even look at these somehow I missed these loop the drawing ooh loop n in D oh my god so many options this is totally fun you can change the color color picker I don't even know how to do that great work this is fun so you can try one of the thing about this is you can try different values for the variables that determine the more rows patterns let's try for you know 72 it's just fun to like see what happens with all these different values I mean algorithms and graphics it's like chocolate and peanut butter they just did so nice alright thank you for that David and oh wait once again so people people of the internet it's that I thank you to those of you who are so dedicated to the coding train and always are submitting your contributions but if you're out there and you're thinking good I don't know what I'm doing no please I I encourage you submit your version you made it it is beautiful don't be just just come and join and I would love to feature it on the coding train alright 3d more rows radius as 730 more whoa okay wow that's kind of nuts and so I can do the same thing here well it whoa oh this is wild great work I love seeing this this is just with p5 WebGL amazing we should look at the code for this so how do you do this in p5 animated rows oh there must be like another JavaScript file I'll look at this on my own time logic ok I guess you can just use vertex begin shape vertex with XYZ points this did like years ago this didn't this didn't work amazing all right now let's go to Morrow's link to scroll this one I did see I remember it's quite lovely this is a code pen a rose by any other name let's do a nice dramatic reading of this oh Romeo will be aware for doubt Wow Romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet you can see why I failed after I mean I did actually draw but I would have failed and thus I'm a weird internet person who does coding tutorials shall I hear more or shall I speak at this tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a Montague this could also use some music it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any parts belonging to a man o be so other name look so I didn't even notice this as I'm scrolling this is animating I I'm sorry I shouldn't put the ridiculous music to it because it's quite beautiful so that's really interesting that this is like a know kind of a unique idea to have some sort of content a text scroll scrolling it and I'm have the animation for the scroll be some algorithmic or generative art what I love that all right I think we're ready now well let's go what I wanted to do is let's go back and look at maybe some of the city I sort of have a memory of maybe somebody doing a physics tree so let's look at both of these and see if there is one my version of objectoriented fractals creating a forest randomly ooh oh cool so look at this got to get up to 21 million its interactive see see whoa sender version that's super nice let's go back to the original recursive tree Oh wrong one just cuz there might be more pink fractals for us look at these oh that's lovely look at this got some leaves on a pink fractal forest you had me at pink very nice fractal forest oh that's lovely good these beautiful scenes of fractal trees and dynamically customizable implementation in Java oh I'm always afraid to click on YouTube videos oh that's me oh this is me lots of people watch that video a wait was that this is how did I know that was just in the github sorry this is May 30th 2016 over three years ago look okay let me show you something brown just nice beep can you see can you see what's happened to me in three years can you see can you see that I am very distinguished I suppose okay oh boy that's really disturbing okay okay go away go away go away all right so let's get started by building upon the fractal trees objectoriented so I'm gonna go to the challenge I'm going to do let's try as always I always forget this alright I am back sorry about that everybody as always I always forget off this stop this stop so usually I use rechargeable batteries which is why I just put in the mic but there was somebody else had used that borrow the spike and had put batteries in it and so I was just letting those finish which I probably should have done knowing that I was gonna livestream but I don't know waste it so thus I guess you have not realized that I'm back soon enough all right so I've got the old challenge here running in the browser I've got my chrome developer tools open and I've got my code open here I'm not a hundred percent sure about this font size it seems a little small is it okay should I make it a little bigger did I change it and her font size let's just try like thirty two I feel like it's what I usually do that feels better to me it's so I'm gonna stick with that all right now before I start the college I'm gonna update this this was written so long ago down the tree for the paper to write the code on hmm then I typed var back in the day that was the way to name a variable so I'm gonna change this I know it should be Const I know it should be Const I'm just not a Const kind of person so I'm gonna change all these to let maybe I maybe I should be maybe I will become I'll Const person for today alright that looks good alright I'm gonna I want to update this for es6 basically and here well now talk about ancient technology constructor function I'm gonna change these to es6 classes this is really exciting for you to watch I'm sure and we could probably write some interesting regular expression or script to automatically do this but what I'm doing is what's wrong what did I get wrong should like Auto format I guess it's just still these are the functions I'm gonna change these to let this is another function whoops just get rid of this okay there we go we've got the branch clap is now a class and control D multi select based on next occurrence yeah there's actually I think I saw some Visual Studio code plugin or script that will actually update your old constructor function syntax to es6 classes but you know I I find it soothing sometimes to do the manual tedium of like just changing everything changing a bearable a manually cut it so I'm a baby I'm like well it's very clear that I'm kind of a weirdo but I don't know maybe that's a very normal thing maybe you might find some peace in your life by there to worry about finding some script to automate stuff just really taking your time alright let's make sure this still works cool too much nonsense here hold on I'm gonna do this because I'm just gonna go grab I would like just to go grab this which is I don't need that I might use the Dom library I might use the sound library but I sort of feel like taking those off I've got version 9 and then I also need branch j/s and so now oh it's looking for style dot CSS which I'm not using all right so we're good and I have updated my code for EF yeah ethics mr. Maugham asks why is var bad bars not bad far I love you you were you were good I still use you sometimes I see you on code examples it makes me I feel something but var is a I would say somewhat deprecated way of declaring a variable and if you would like to know more about that may I suggest watching my video let versus var supposed to like fly in and and show you a little clip of it I don't understand why that doesn't happen if I don't have like some kind of just say it usually happens Oh live life okay boy it's been three my real I said I was gonna get started really quickly it's been 35 minutes okay but now I'm really gonna get started I think that I'm gonna make a couple more adjustments I don't feel like I need to step through built the tree each time in mousepressed so this is doing this is weird let me let me say we get rid of mousepressed and then let me see what happens here that's just gonna do the beginning of the tree but I want to do this some amount of times like this and then I think I'm gonna get rid of the leaves they're not really I mean the leaves would be an interesting thing to add back in but it's kind of not the point of what I'm doing so I'm gonna do n iterations there we go six let's see what it looks like with seven right you can see if I do 12 whoops here we go that's kind of nice all right so we see that this works happy little trees yeah you know I don't people make the boss raw Bob Rock pub boss raw a buzz Rob just got me boss Rob from now on people make the Bob Ross reference and I very much appreciate it I am a huge Bob Ross fan myself I don't know that it's so accurate Bob Ross is a was a is a soothing calming wonderful presence lots of artistic talent and thoughtfulness I think that I'm just hyper frenetic weirdo who's coding on YouTube it's kind of not the same thing world record beard it's Movember not yet almost Movember all right I think I don't want to have I like how it looks this way but I'm gonna reduce that coating train sponsored by brilliant water brilliant org okay okay so I think I'm ready to get started and I sort of feel like today might be a day of not editing this later into a coding challenge but I don't know why I think that but I think I'll act like it is because just in case this is just like these amazing we just have this like our a total perfect Zuma zone Zen happy tree making we might as well give ourselves the opportunity to make that into a nice little package that somebody could find more easily than watching this live stream nonsense okay all right um let's see what else we need I think we're good I should show you by the way just a tease something else that's coming soon on the coding train I have some more props I mean this is a little bit just this my if I might find this disturbing this strange unicorn but also it's just that it's got green oh my goodness this is really gonna be a problem nazia is not gonna like editing this whiteboard wonder just give me a second here I actually have a remote control app that's a chance that that's gonna allow me to fix this camera right now oh I'm still connected okay okay okay I'm going to I'm going to do something very exciting which I'm gonna control this camera from this remote control app and I think maybe what I want is to turn the ISO down is that better better I think that's better now okay I think that's the best thing unfortunately I still so I have these like Sony cameras and I'm having trouble with the white balance I'll show you right now it's on automatic white balance which makes the is a problem but I can't seem to figure out like this is like some of the other settings I think you know I don't think that's better warm white is that better these are like automatic settings I like this one that's like if it's cloudy yes so I'm just gonna or daylight which it's not in here I'm just gonna go back to auto all right turn it one more I said I think I did already so hopefully you can tell me I'm gonna leave it like this right now but the reason why I have so much trouble with these cameras cuz i have them mounted on the wall which means i can't see the menu i have a confidence monitor so I can see what it's seeing but because I want clean HDMI out I can't see the menu on the conference monitor one of these days I'll have a perfect at least they don't go to sleep after 30 minutes they'll go to sleep after they overheat Auto is fine okay here we go everybody one more ISO down that was at 510 all right I'll do one more ISO down okay think so it's that it's not 640 right now 500 okay how's that I think it's gonna be good it's gonna have to be good enough I don't know how much I'm gonna use the whiteboard okay hopefully that helped all right we really like really got it you know I procrastinate because I'm afraid this is this is very much something that I have not done before and did not practice for this I have used I've made a fractal tree before and I've used the physics library that I intend to use which is toxic libs Jas let me open that up is there a CDN for it I just forgot but it's fine I'll download it if I need to and also let's see if I could find this a project that I want to reference is skittish tree by Martine Bravo I think this is it yeah skittish tree 2011 think there's a nice document let me add Martine Bravo's name here I feel like it was on this is from the spring show but there was a nice video of it I'm looking for it was made as a video installation I guess I'll just this will this will work Oh Paley Center this is what I'm looking for I want to show you this project so this is called skittish tree it's a project made by Martine Bravo and it's an interactive project where the tree kind of has physics and responds to you and you can see that it's like soar like adding appendages and being very skittish so this is kind of like what I hope to accomplish to create a tree structure that each connection is has a springlike connection to it and I think it's responding to sound if I remember correctly this actually isn't the video I was looking for but that's fine there was an installation that was on of this project that was on like in a store window that's that's the memory of this video that had thank you ruts neighs 32 for donating to the National Arbor Day Foundation and it is time for us to finally make some trees here we go and maybe all right here we go so I'm going to act like this is gonna get edited later decoding challenge and maybe it will maybe it won't hello and welcome to a special team trees coding challenge in today's coding challenge well I guess I'm gonna say could you make the trunk thicker yes all these things are possible hold on just wait hello and welcome to a special team hello and welcome to a coding challenge this is a special coding challenge it is a fundraiser for the team trees initiative you can look at the find the donate button and make a donation to the National Arbor Day Foundation to plant the goal with the goal planning 20 million trees $1 per tree so please join me in this initiative and help plant a tree and for what I'm gonna do I've made a lot of coding challenges that have to do with algorithmic trees and plants and various things and this is from coding challenge number 15 objectoriented fractal tree this is the result of it I'm going to build upon this code and attempt to add physics to it so that the tree could sway and wobble in the wind I'm feeling this is gonna go terribly wrong and but maybe you'll learn something and be inspired to make your own algorithmic tree and to perhaps even better plant a tree or donate some money to help plant a tree the physics library that I'm going to use is called toxic libs Jas so toxic libs jess is actually a port of a library called toxic libs made by Carsten Schmidt aka Toxie it was a processing library that I used to use a lot and is featured in my nature of code book and this is a JavaScript version of it it has lots of features but the feature that I want to use from it is called verlet physics or valve alley rally physics what I'm looking for right here is 2d physics simulation can I click on that that's not a thing to click on so thank you too so toxic libs just no toxic libs was originally written by Carsten Schmidt for processing I mentioned that and poured into JavaScript by Kyle Phillips haptic data on Twitter so say thank you to haptic data on Twitter how do I get it getting started is it is it it's available through NPM which means I should know how to do this but can I use like ol toxic lives okay oh that's examples the website yeah one package is this the library no that's this is the examples I mean I could just download it but I'm being stubborn toxic libs Jas there we go so there must be a way now somebody will tell me I can use that like uh none package.com slash something it'll just like automatically take me to it right this do it no no one will tell me nobody will tell me okay NPM wait I know how to do this ml five I can since ml five does this right it should work the same if I do unpackage comm slash well let's see toxic libs zero what was the version that was the latest zero point three point three zero point three point three and then it's probably just called let's see what happened so I do this in top right that doesn't help me version zero point three point three let's see cloud fair oh it's on cloud fair zero point one point three no but that seems like an old version I will try CD NJ s cloud fair okay bit ly / OH J J M leoj89 es Mozart many E's no just America want whomp bit ly bit ly / j ml e OG want that doesn't work from terminal npm install' toxic lives plus j s oh this is going so well so far no I don't want to do npm install i'm avoiding doing npm install on purpose gosh darn it toxic lives dot j yes that's what I forgot No no just no dot seems weird though oh no but I want to do toxic lives yes jazz deliver ah there we go thank you violet saves the day Thank You violet w WJ s deliver dotcom slash package / NP m / toxic libs j s there we go and actually all I want is physics 2d I don't know that I need I don't need that I don't need you till in geometry so well okay this is helping me sort of how do I get a link I just want a link download I guess I could just download it I'm stubborn I refuse to download it it's hosted via a CDN different versions copy to clipboard copy URL oh I see great oh this is not this is not going well there's no built version of the package that's crazy but there's not one point 8k viewers what wait what's going on here I'm I'm not you know what I'm no longer to be stubborn why are all these people watching hello everybody welcome to the Kodi train thank you thank you I'm gonna coach stuff I swear I don't just sit here and read random numbers very sweaty very sweaty there's no built package it's okay everybody I know how to deal with this I'm gonna go to my nature of code examples where I keep a built version of the library which is here NFC examples p5.js libraries toxic libs do I have like a toxic libs helper thing let's see simple spring libraries toxic lips okay I'm just gonna use this I'm just gonna download this version of library I'm gonna have it local I have a built version look it's version zero point three point three Thank You Kyle Phillips apparently I've never had this many people watching the live stream before I'm kind of freaking out a little bit I'm gonna hit raw I think I should do like a probably a beginner tutorial or something not this fractal tree physics we're gonna make a new folder we're gonna call it libraries think I'm gonna get to the coding everybody I'm gonna do something I'm gonna be I'm gonna do meaningful stuff here I'm taking this very seriously all of a sudden I don't there's I made this toxic libs helper thing for the nature of code book where am I like I don't even remember where I was how's that how come that's gone I was on that page somebody must have like tweeted or something examples I don't think let me get that helper let me see what's in that helper thing so for the nature of codebook which for the examples I also made an extra file called toxic helper oh it doesn't really do anything you know what all it does is to make aliases to the classes I want to use so that every time I want to make like a gravity behavior or an attraction behavior I don't have to write toxic physics about 2d so this is actually useful so I will also save this and I will put this in libraries and then I can close all this stuff I can go back to the code and let's add these other libraries like I have like all bye notifications on do not disturb so I'm gonna go to toxic libs jf and what is it called toxic helper dot j s then I'm gonna hit refresh it doesn't find it because I made a folder called libraries so one of the unfortunate things about the way that I'm working right now is and if I were if I had a better setup I would probably do like a pictureinpicture type thing but I have to switch back and forth between the browser view and the code view it just lost like a hundred no surprise like a whole bunch of people came to me like somebody clearly told them like hey go check this out team trees National Art Day Foundation then everybody came like okay there's a very strange person just jabbering on and like searching for like a file that doesn't exist and just not refusing to give up that's me I also like to read from my book a million random digits with 100,000 100,000 normal deviates point negative 29 d2 0.60 2 also negative one point zero one seven point five zero nine point six six four point nine one seven point three one zero point one six okay everything's gonna be okay yeah I could have used that I could have just delivered those github links I know I know but I would have had to figure that out now would have taken me a while so where was I in this thing that's definitely getting edited later I went ahead and downloaded the files toxic lives and toxic helper KS those are built version toxic lives such as is a built version of the library that I'm using a local copy of and toxic helper KS is a JavaScript file that has toxic helper is a JavaScript file that I created for my examples from the nature of codebook that aliases some of the classes that I want to use from the toxic libs library so what is the next step here I have this code this code creates this idea of a branch a branch a branch is an object that has two points a and B and by definition a branch and I really did not draw this in a way that makes any sense a branch is an object that has two points a which is a vector X Y and B which is another vector X Y so this is B and this is a then I choose to draw a line between those two points after that each branch birth so to speak or to two branches that are connected from its point be it becomes the point a for those two new branches those get bees and so on and so forth this is the process of recursion this idea of a function in this case an object being defined according to itself a branch by definition is a line connected to two other branches and those two other branches by definition or lines connected to two other branches and those are lines connected to other branches and so on and so forth and by iterating over this list of branch objects and then drawing them in the window I have this particular pattern but it is a static pattern it is a static pattern it does not move it does not animate I have just basically calculated all of these points and drawn lines so what I want to attempt to do in this coding challenge is say in addition to a branch being a line between two points each point is going to be what's called a particle or in this case of Val a particle verlet particle 2d that's the technical term in the Toxic lives library so all of these are particles and this particular line is a spring connection so a spring is a you know as a entity of that that is a connection a joint what are some other words event an edge joint connection what's in matter da chance I could I could use matter Jas maybe I should have used matter Duchess yes whatever I'm using toxic limbs what not you the viewer will go make a version this would matter not chance after but it is a connection that has a bunch of properties like rest length at what what is its length at which it will come to rest right it um as well as a property called K the spring constant and that will by playing around with these values I'll get various amounts of springiness and elasticity to these connections alright alright so let's attempt to do this I don't remember how to do toxic libs wouldn't it be nice if there was like a tutorial for it somewhere nature of code calm read now physics library a toxic lives okay let's take a look here so the first thing that I need to do it looks like is make a physics world so I'm going to create a variable I'm going to call it physics and in setup I'm going to say physics equals new verlet physics 2d I think I need to say 2d like I can check by going into my libraries here verlet physics 2d so you can see this is what the helper does maybe this is a bad idea I don't know just puts these class names in the global space global namespace okay so I've made a physics world I can do things like set the world's bounds that might be a that's probably important for me to do let's do that why not so let's do this so and this I think this will still work I'm creating a rectangle that is defined by the canvas so the boundaries of this world are the canvas itself I'm not going to call physics update right now because I actually don't want to update the physics I just want to get the building blocks in place and slowly turn them on to see what happens so what I want to do is create a verlet particle 2d for every one of these points so how does this work how does my branch object work I have a beginning and an end so those when I make those they are I call create vector ah so what I'm doing to create the first the root of the tree we come back over here the root of the tree is a branch that connects these two starting points and right there there it is root equals branch between those two points I think what I want to do is change those points to make them verlet particles so instead of a plane p5 vector I'm gonna make them a verlet particle to D and a verlet particle to D now that's gonna break everything because all of the math and everything that I'm doing for the entire example depends on those two points being vectors P Phi vectors now there vernal at particles DD so I could like run the code and see where the first error I get is this dot set weight is not a function what so let's go do sketch jeaious line 13 what that's weird wait there's an error on this line Oh guess what I forgot I forgot the new keyword I am making an object I am calling the constructor of the Verla particle 2d class I must say nu nu nu now let me refresh again now this is good this is what I wanted to see happen derp da alt is not a function why is it not a function well what is derp what is mult so let's go look for branch J s line 21 and here interestingly enough it was fine with p5 Oh weird so this is very uncomfortable I think if I recall correctly I have something in my book that addresses what I want to talk about did not mean to be referring to this so much there was like a table like vector table thing that I know no all right I'm gonna not scroll forever and like drive you all insane let me let me talk about what's going on here so the original version that I wrote made use of something called a p5 vector and a p5 vector is a vector an entity with magnitude direction as an X component of Y component and it has a bunch of math operations and they're called things like add subtract multiply et cetera normalized I've lots of videos on this stuff I just made it instead of a p5 vector a verlan particle 2d a virulent particle 2d is actually an instance of something in toxic libs that's called a vex 2d guess what effect Judi is it's a simple vector but it's not p5 XP v vector it's toxic lives vector so my code will all still work just fine if I find the corresponding function in toxic lives that corresponds to things like multiply subtract add etc I kind of figure out where the documentation is because I think I got to look all this stuff up it looks like 800 viewers it's kind of hilarious it's still down and nuts that I have there's 1200 people watching here but alright so let me look what's the best place for me to look at the toxic lives documentation so is it on this website getting started toxic webs follows physics 2d I know how to find it differences from the original mmm github contributes rent bill I know where I think where I'm going to look I'm just going to go and look but toxic lives Javadoc this is crazy what I'm doing I probably should take a mulligan and go and use and go and use matter yes but I'm as you know me I'm stubborn so I'm in the jaw so this so I'm looking for this is the Java original Java libraries documentation and I'm just going to do the mental gymnastics to translate from that into JavaScript if you can enjoy okay it's okay everything's gonna be okay just go right past that back to D we can actually go to frames and then uh Boog that didn't work here we go I'm gonna look for ad so where where am I wearing my first P v vector dot sub so I think the equivalent of this will be this dot end dotsub this dot begin let's take a look at that sub so it subtracts vector V and returned the result as a new vector that's what I want so one of the things when working with these vectors it's a little bit tricky because sometimes you want to adjust the vector you're working with that's subtract self like subtract this from myself but toxic Libs when you call that sub it makes a new vector which is not al p v vector works very confusing I know that's okay now rotate this is just do that does it have a rotate function rotate all right I guess that works multiply I think it's just mu L I have a memory of it just being mu L scale is it called scale scale no whoa boat wait yes yes yes yes yes its scale cuz I'm not I'm not doing the dot product or vector multiplication I'm just taking a vector and multiplying it by a scale or a single number so if you think of a vector is this line represents the vector if I multiply it by two got that line if I multiply it by 0.5 I got that line and what the fractal code is actually doing is each branch is 2/3 the length of the previous one far so I'm scaling it by 0.67 scale new end is this dot and to add direction and then I make a new branch that should work that should be the same this is the recursion I branch out to make a new brand they only can make two branches I have branch a and branch B that is definitely an instance of but I'm just gonna keep going this is terrible that this is the faces will get code change that that looks good well I dare I say that's all I needed to do I got something wrong definitely got something wrong what did I get wrong looks like the scaling isn't working properly scale scale like I sort of feel like that's like if I comment this out same result what did I do wrong does it make a new scale self scale self scale self I bet you it's that I don't want to make a new vector that's scaled I want to scale myself there we go so I have now successfully recreated the fractal tree with berlet particles all right so interestingly enough those are all particles let's just test a little weird theory of mine if I think Berlet physics in toxic limbs will automatically add a default gravity it might not but I am going to oh this is weird I'm gonna take this out this is drawing a tree we're gonna definitely want to do some jittering and stuff I'm going to say physics dot update and what I expect to happen well what do you think is gonna happen if there's a default gravity and these are all just particles and online between them what's gonna happen give you a minute to think about it this is like how it works on brilliant org by the way you didn't like a puzzle I have to think about then you give the answer okay so the default gravity must not be there so let's add gravity and I believe the way that I do that is I say physics dot add I think I have to go back to the nature of code book to look this up yeah so let's do it like this so this is I can add a behavior to the world and I can add a gravity behavior and I can have a vector this is very confusing but there's like this is so what's happening here so the first thing I do is create a vector like say like zero negative 0.5 or 0.5 which is like a vector that points down so this is the vector and I want to turn this into a gravity behavior meaning there's a force on everything pointing down and then we're to add that to the world meaning will PI that force to all of the particles so let's actually grab this code and go here just put that in here whoa no wrong code what a completely copy bases the wrong thing oh I'm not even in the right thing you know what the good news is oh there's no good news for you I'm just in the wrong camera I'll tell you about that later got some new recording systems all right so let me do this so I'm gonna add this here now I'm adding this gravity behavior and whoops you just I think I could give myself a little bit more room here to code yep I'm adding this gravity behavior now let's try this again to you to not have gravity gravity behavior 2d I don't think that's that doctor fine did I not save no hmm physics dot update physics dot update oh oh no no wait let's see mmm show no no mmm if you're adding to Berlet per branch will to ver let's be create so this is a great point I'm definitely gonna have to fix that update maybe needs a delta time maybe it does it does really particle am I not what it could be that the physics is happening but I'm not drawing it correctly so I have like a secret no loop in there somewhere mmm very sad physics not bad behavior console dot log frame count let's just make sure the loop is happening the loop is happening all right let's be a little bit more debug e let's get rid of all these trees and let's let's just make a particle called PE and we'll put it in the middle of the window and then we will do this and draw it points all right so this is a good sign does it need at all the time I guess I could give it a delta time all right let's go look at my examples never hurts to look at an example where am I going this is not this is the book and one with the examples libraries toxic lives let's just look at this one so I did okay how do you know what it's weird that it's oh no hmm no I don't think mmhmm I think I might know what the problem is I think I think I know what the problem is just hold on so I'm thinking but no but then I did it it's weird let's just look at the sketch really physical behavior set world's bounds does I mean couldn't really be that like adding the behavior first makes a difference Oh Oh weird you know what I have this suspicion I'm making a new Verla particle by passing in the X&Y I think toxic Libs wants me to do this why it worked anyway to draw in the right place no that doesn't seem to make a difference I'm just take more drastic measures in a second to make sure my example is actually working well let's make sure this example works let's go grab this repo which I'm sure I already have but okay so the gravity is definitely working in this example so gravity does work at trees to cons everybody's telling me everybody's telling me everybody's telling me everybody's telling me every oh sell me I know what it is everybody relax I got it got it if you make a particle the particle does not live in the world unless you put the particle in the world if you plant a tree if you put a seed in the ground if you do not water it I don't know what the right metaphor is here it's not really fitting but I do need to say physics dot add particle that particle and then goodbye goodbye all right so now what I was expecting to see let's take this out take this back out and the whiteboard camera just went off I don't know why probably because it's overheating put this back in and what I need to do whenever I make a branch whenever I make a branch I need to where do I make the particles interesting this is weird there is no do I never copy this is weird something weird is going on here in that I've only made this is the only place where I make the particle and then and then when I make a new branch oh this is a problem so I'm not this is weird I'm the particles are just pointing to each other I'm so confused no this is making a new particle I see the end is a new particle and the beginning is the same particle so this is actually correct this is making a new particle here so olan let's just one step at a time this is confusing because this looks like the only place I'm making a new particle but let me say physics dot add particle a and physics dot add particle B and P is not define cuz I don't need that anymore I'm gonna just take out the point one just let it do its default time step look at that so only it only fell right there because that's the only particle I added into the physics world so where are the other particles only other time I'm actually making a particle is in this new end the rest this is some vector math and the new branch gets a reference to its current end it doesn't actually make a new particle that's very important because I want everything to stay connected so this I've actually written the code in a thoughtful way where this will work properly all I need to do is say physics dot add particle new end and then right here physics dot add particle new end now let's see what happens okay I don't like that don't like that PETA add forces not a fun oh it's not a verlet particle this has made a Veck 2d so I need to say new ver let particle boy this was much more complicated than I imagined it would be apologies to everybody watching I need to wrap the end this is very confusing because what I toxic lives is using this this turned out to be a bit of a sophisticated coding challenge which requires quite a bit of facility and experience with objectoriented programming inheritance inheritance is a feature of objectoriented programming where objects can pull properties from other objects and so I made a Veck 2d that's not a ver let particle a ver let particle is a vector D but effect because it inherits from vector D but if vector D is not a ver let particle so because I made a vector D I need to make it a ver let particle and I can do the same thing here and now I can hit refresh and there we go that is the wierdest collapsing tree ever so the good news is this is not what I wanted to accomplish all you know just having a single gravity force they all fall in exactly the same rate I don't want it to fall I wanted to stay standing up so let's take out that gravity behavior right now and let's take a look I have my tree again let me also remove the number of iterations there's too much detail here maybe I want ultimately all that detail but right now it's too much and I'm about halfway through so I'm going to take a break to talk about brilliant the sponsor of today's livestream and also remind you about team trees kind of like the second sponsor we've got two sponsors today but what was I doing I took that out oh yeah no I wanted to change the number of iterations let's just go down to six so I want to work with the physics with fewer points and lines and then once that's working maybe I could add more so people are telling me about live server and I do know sometimes I do use live server though very rarely on a live stream but actually I'd like to explicitly refresh the browser because sometimes I don't want the change to be seen I want to change the code and talk about a little bit and then have it be seen so I like to have full control okay all right let me have a little water 6 o'clock so I want to take a minute even the by the way in the last 40 minutes I lost a thousand just kind of crazy hi Elias um I want to talk to you about brilliant org brilliant org is a website that I really enjoy using let me show you a bit about the homepage so becoming great at math science and computer science does not have to be dull hopefully that's something that you've discovered by watching this particular YouTube channel I mean I maybe I guess I think probably I'm not dull I have a lot of faults yeah I'm dull in many instances though you can find me irritating I suppose anyway moving on but brilliant it's a problemsolving website with a handson approach it has 60 interactive courses I like to really show you what just all of these courses are there's one the ones that I'm that are particularly most relevant although all of these are things you could really find as forming the basis of stuff that you might want to code but there's a computer science fundamentals course there's logic courses there's number theory a trigonometry oh boy you really need the trigonometry course if you're watching the coding train because they have being comfortable with sine and cosine and tangent those functions and polar coordinates is really necessary so brilliant is built for ambitious and curious people who want to excel at problemsolving and understand the world and one of the two things I love the most about brilliant there's many things that I do enjoy and if I come back to here for a second and just pull up the website is one is in in the courses and in the challenges are many ideas for me to try to code things and I having done 150 plus coding challenges I run out of ideas so there's so much content on brilliant that I can find lots of new ideas the other thing that I love is just if I have a little extra time on my hands I like to do these daily challenges and this one I looked at it earlier I didn't solve it although I think I have an idea of how to solve it let me hold on I'm my view is a little bit off and I think I can take this off right now as well so so this is today's challenge and by the way if you want to follow along with this go to brilliant org slash coding train you can sign up for free and you could do all the daily challenges for free right there on the website you can add your own answer you can add your own explanation if you want to unlock all of the courses you can sign up for a premium subscription and you can get a discount by going through that coding train link the first 200 people will get a 20% discount so what I like about this challenge is it's like a puzzle so this is a little but nice puzzle we got a grid here and I need everything in row zoom in on this a little bit more so I can point to it better I need everything in this top row to add up to six this first column to add up to four and so on and so forth and these are the numbers that I have to work with so I need to place them somewhere so if I'm going to solve something like this first I could just take around and try it that's that's probably the best way is like be like a well I put the three here well if I put a 3 here and I put a 2 here that's 708 and that's no good then I don't have to put a 1 here but look at this I just unlocked a little clue how to solve this I would have look for things that have only one possibility it's always a good way to start right here this column has to add up to sick and I've lost the chat so let me by sorry about this everybody wrong Mouse and pull the chat up so ah sorry folks go back to me come back to me puzzle grid so the only thing that can go there is a what how to put this one here so like oh come on well look let's reset I think I did something like weird there we go so you can see this lights up because I've had it add up to 6 so what else only has one possibility so 2 plus 1 is 3 to get 7 I could do a bunch of different things I could do tutus I could do 1 into 3 there's a bunch of ways I could get 7 out of 3 numbers here 2 to get 4 ok I can only put ones here and this is good because I got to use up my ones where the only possible thing here there's no way there's no zero so I can't put another to it 3 would get me to 5 so huh know why I'm having trouble there we go I just so what I like about this is I would love to actually you could make this in p5 so this could be a coding challenge like make a puzzle generator that has all I mean this is really hard to do all this draganddrop a nice little interface and haven't been to really hard to program this kind of stuff I would probably make a much you know like a more crude version of this it just has that is this thoughtful in terms of user interaction design but now now we're getting somewhere so is there are there other places where I only have one option by the way the reason why I'm looking at this is because the the question here is how many different ways can this puzzle puzzle be completed so thing is like how many solutions can I find knows anybody knows you can you can say alright and Simon is reminding me that the you do the daily challenges for free and actually the 7 latest daily challenges are for free but the you need the premium subscription for the archive of them Thank You Simon Simon is like my brilliant sponsor assistant appreciate that all right what else here this is nine okay I think I have to put to get nine I need a three and a two can I put those in any place so I could put them here so now I'm just like trying and then if this is seven I needs a 3 in a 2 and this is 5 a little no I just thing we're on aah so that doesn't work no no no no I'm fine was I just do three right because yeah a 1 goes here and a 1 goes here yeah I did it I solved it so there's one solution there's at least one solution did this in sort of a weird way what happens where was I with this sure there's a scientific way of doing this let me go back to what this is where I was where I knew these are the only possibilities so what did what did I do next clearly forgot didn't I put like a three and a two ow camera I should turn the so apologies for this the camera I'm going to turn the fan on this nice fan to cool down the camera I can turn it back on the focus I might lose the focus let's see I think actually the focus stayed this time whatever I did on the camera keeps the focus which is good yeah I'm still in focus right I think so um everyone solve this I should just do these in advance it would make my life much easier bottom rows swap the two and the three people are telling me wait hold on okay oh hey that's what I was doing let's let's do it scientifically so let's say I put the 3 and the 2 here that's 9 so now I think there's probably only gonna be one way for me to do this my intuition tells me that because if I've got to get 9 I need so if I gotta get 7 I need the the 3 plus 2 plus 2 what no I need the three in the one the only thing is I can put here the 3 and the one I can't put the 3 here the 3 has to go here the one has to go here ok and this is going to get me back to this solution and now the 1 has to go here and the 2 has to go here okay well what no no no no no the 2 has to go wait so maybe there is no solution if I put the 3 in the 2 like this the focus is no good let's check I have a special way of focusing that looks pretty good actually it's a little bit off you're right and fix it a little bit wait okay that added up to nine so to get to five this has to be a three in a two and I can't put the three there because that would already be six okay so this has to be a two and this has to be a three no and this has to be a one so then that's four that's seven that's all right so that was a solution with the three on the right and the two there so let's take everything off two one one three three two and let's try putting the 3 here and the 2 here now can I still get a solution I need a 2 and a 1 to get to 5 and to get to 7 I need a 3 and a 2 so the 3 can't go here so the 2 has to go here the 3 has to go here and then to get to 7 the 1 goes to get the 6 the 1 goes here and then a 1 goes here yep okay there's definitely two solutions there's two solutions can I get an idol I think those were the only so I don't want to belabor this there's probably way to make this provable but I'm pretty sure that as I was solving it there was no way to go and there were no there was no like branch this is relates to trees because really what I'm doing is like or they're right here now they're more than one options I could take let's try them both maybe one hits a dead end but I think all the while though I had to put things in certain places so I think the answer is 2 I'm not going to hit submit just yet what I'm gonna do is I am going to take a little break you I would ask you to work on this sign up for billion org thank you for billion org for sponsoring the coding train as is a fundraiser for team trees I will be donating the sponsorship fee from brilliant to the net to the Arbor Foundation through the team trees initiative so thank you so much for being for for sponsoring the coding train so that I can participate in this fundraiser and give money as well so I'm gonna take a short break for like no more than five minutes let's see fact check me on this signup for brilliant org make a donation to T at team trees or go through the donate button that's part of the fundraiser and I'll be back to finish the coding challenge in about five minutes so I'm gonna mute my microphone I'm gonna move my microphone to make myself disappear and I'm gonna get some water take a little break and be back and refresh I'm gonna say once again coordinates can we justify warming the Cartesian coordinates autotuned and the internet will fix that coordinates coordinates as always I always forget this never forget this stop I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this star this star song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me sorry everybody now you can hear me I was saying I took a little bit of a longer break than usual cuz I got very warm in here so I propped open the door and I turned all the lights out that's why it looks kind of dark in here so I'm going to turn the lights back on and everyone's saying muted no sound you will realize that I have fixed that in a second the lights are back on and putting this down here my keys in my pocket I am back and so here I am and I am here to give this a try so I was like keeping an eye on the chat and there were so many interesting things that people said about this puzzle how to solve it somebody said you could solve it with green and dissent which I have no idea how that would work but other people were talking about how you can use like a backtracking algorithm and you're absolutely right I didn't see a lot of people give me an answer so I'm just gonna hope that my answer like answer two is correct let's see we go correct alright so thank you so much brilliant org tri brilliant for free at brilliant org slash coding train you can do the daily challenge you can post you can read about what actually what I really liked one of the things I love doing is there's always so many really interesting discussions about how to solve this stuff I mean just look at the time people put in to explaining different ways with screenshots and diagrams to solve these puzzles that is something that I really do love so I encourage you to put your own there sometimes I'll make a p5 sketch and paste it in that's something you could do and thank you to play org for sponsoring today's fundraiser for team trees the sponsorship 3 is being donated to the team trees fundraiser so if you feel so inclined you could make a donation as well all right I'm going to what am I doing here turn that off and close this window and we are back we are back to the coding challenges 620 have I been streaming for almost two hours I think this is gonna probably take if I'm being totally honest another hour but hopefully less hopefully less so I can close some of this other stuff here I'm gonna leave that opens I might need it and here we go was that 100k in an hour I so I can't actually see what the tally is nor can I see Wow many donations that have come in through this livestream can you see that maybe you can't maybe if I actually hold on if you'll feel humor me for a second I do have a dashboard here I used to keep try a second laptop you'll notice there's no second laptop anymore it doesn't even exist but I do have a monitor over here that I can look at where I'm running open broadcast studio and if I go over here I go to this dashboard mmm no I don't see anything so I'm afraid to press buttons here I still can't figure out what caused suddenly a thousand more people to join I when I was taking my break I like looked at my phone and started to check like Twitter or like but I didn't see any kind of notification or share or anything like that so but yeah David is saying the total tally is three hundred sixtyfive thousand which is kind of amazing I mean I'm a tiny little morsel here I think there's there's many many channels or all releasing videos and participating this fundraiser today I believe it was its mr. beast who started this initiative I do have a little document that I have here for reference team trees started in May 2000 nineteen when the internet internet challenged mr. beast at rant plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20 million subscriber milestone fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other youtubers blah blah blah and the donations are going to the Arbor Day Foundation they are the longestrunning tree planting NGO with 47 years of experience and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American rate Red Cross the donations either through team trees or guts where I made my donation or the YouTube donate button or Arbor days team trees Facebook fundraiser are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree planting $1 plants one tree depending on your local laws it could be a taxdeductible donation and the trees will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need the goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica and their Arbor Day foundation's website can I get to that has a list I think I'm looking at different computer computer so I have a dog but I'm not going to read all this to you but if you have other questions please go to the team trees website and the team trees says it's 1.1 million maybe because more donations that come through the website itself all right so back to the coding so if anybody know I'm just out of because I'm you know you can't it's very hard to be a person who does YouTube livestream makes YouTube videos and not suffer from some amount of vanity and I suffer from a large amount of vanity probably if I'm being totally honest and I am quite curious holy I gotta lock see I'm gonna get to your question I am quite curious as to if whether there was some kind of mention about the coding train somewhere that's sent like a whole bunch of people that then promptly left and did any of you stay maybe you're still here from that then you never heard of the coding train and you're watching right now if so say in the chat so yah Twilio Loxy are you asking about this song this song is called Tori the dog and it is by a composer named Adam Blau Adam spelled ad AM and blouse spelled BL a you Adam isn't an old friend from college he is a film and television composer I believe he does the music for a lot of different things but most recently for the FX show you're the worst and this is a piece of music he wrote for something else that he lets me use Adam is the composer for Oh train theme song and so I think you could reach out to him on Twitter Adam Blau if I don't think this song is published anywhere I mean I have the mp3 file of it right here that's it but maybe you can get in touch to make a mini version of it okay all right anyone anyone in the chat I'm curious are you here for the first time and not just this is your first live stream but you had never heard of the coding train before today I'm curious to hear from you what did you hear here where'd you hear about the coding train but that aside I am going to I still have the fan on I don't think it's causing too much of a noise problem so I'm going to move on yes everyone's putting on coding garden with CJ donated $100 to the National Arbor Day Foundation I mean if there ever was a channel that aligns with team trees in its philosophy and its design branding it's the coding garden I mean technically is a garden where you have a tree that's more of like a forest to you you might have to be the coding forest but you've got tree growing plants it's good and my small little and and you can see cut nobody knows how to use tree related emojis better than CJ and the coding gardens so please check out the coding garden many many other CJ streams quite often at least nowadays I'm just getting notifications almost every day there's all these kind of tutorials especially like backend stuff that I don't do so much very thoughtful and organized tutorials okay in coding garden with CJ's in the chat I'm sure you could ask CJ of questions about the channel if you want no now press my to chew button and you will know how long the delay is because I just pressed it then and it appeared all right I'm procrastinating again I do want to go home it's Friday I'm kind of like a bit of a baseball nerd you know I don't know I think I'm Astros national about my team's but I'm excited to watch the World Series game is at 8 so I at least want to get home by then all right the next step that I want to try is not just have particles oh sorry everybody no signal let's turn this back on I'll see if the focus is okay should come alive in a second how's the focus on here it's probably this I think it's the same look good yeah it's fine okay instead of just having two particles and drawing a line to visualize the connection between those particles I won't you actually make a physics object that connects them and the kind of object I'm going to use is a spring so I've made many other video tutorial ins and many other I have at least one I've used toxic lip springs and a bunch of other video tutorials to do like a cloth simulation and other things that you could refer to but basically we've got a spongy elastic connection when I pull it I'm stretching it the force is going to go back in when I push it I'm compressing it and the force is gonna push it back out to its rest length so where do I want to add the spring I think it's going to be as simple as every time I make a branch I need to create a spring that connects the two particles this dot begin and this dot end so let me look at one of my old examples where I make a spring so this is some code that I pulled up from one of my nature of code examples where I make a string a spring a verlet spring 2d that connects two particles p1 and p2 it has a rest length the length at which it is at rest and then a strength or maybe that's the the number for K the spring constant I don't know exactly what it means that I can tune that number up and down to affect its elasticity we could probably look in the toxic lip stop documentation to read exactly what that means but we'll just tinker around so I think this should be let me actually just grab this I should be able to say make a spring connect this stop begin this dot end and the O what should the rest length be well the rest length should be the distance between the actual length of thus of the branch because I'm tree building the tree at rest and when I give it a little push maybe a little the branch is kind of I mean trees don't actually have Springs in them so I don't get me wrong this is not a realistic simulation I'm just trying out this idea to make it kind of to see what happens so it's a little bit unfortunate that when I make the branch I do have that distance yeah I think what I'm going to do is this is this is probably a little redundant and I could optimize later but I'm just gonna calculate the distance by saying the distance between this dot and X and why so I'm getting the distance between the beginning point of the end point and then that's the rest length and the spring constant I mean I'm just going to leave it at 0.01 since that was in one of my examples and then I want to say physics dot add spring spring so let's just see if this at least gives me no errors okay it works now here's the thing that's interesting what happens if I pull on one of them what if I just take one of these end points and I attach and I move it with the mouse so you can see in my example the way that I did this in my example is I'll like lock a particle I don't know that I need to do this but I can basically like override its XY position and set it to the mouse so if I go into drum you just copy this and I'll do like if mouse is pressed also I'm just to see if the physics is active I'm gonna write here so tree tree is an array that has all of the branches in it so let me just pull the very last one I could say can I say pop but that's gonna actually take it out of the array I'm just gonna access it by tree length minus 1 so that's the like last this is the last particle in the tree and I can say last dot lock if the mouse is pressed let me do exactly this set it to the mouse and unlock it okay here we go this is gonna be a little bit nuts I really have no idea what's gonna happen which one do we think it is is it down here or is it like over here let's a little last not lock is not a function oh it's a branch it's a branch that's an array of branches I want to take the particle that's at the end tree dot length dot end the particle is what I want to lock and there we go three with physics actually that's pretty cool all right mm I had a dampening force no actually I honestly have no idea what to do next I mean I want to lock the alright here's here's something I actually want to do let's lock the root so let's say a dot lock that very first particle should never move let's just try that right so there we go so that's kind of interesting if the tree has no structure to it whatsoever but it's kind of this is kind of fun how can I make this feel more tree like I mean like should I put gravity back in I need like some kind of dampening I need to like sort of hold itself up I kind of have an idea and I should mention that a lot of this is coming from that skittish coming in case this gets edited later say a lot of my ideas are inspired by a project by Martine Bravo called skittish tree that he worked on while he was a student here at ITP where I teach and I'm and if I recall correctly one of the things he did with that project was connect some of the end points to the top with Springs to hold up the tree but not draw those Springs so that's something I could try you could try and limit the rotation of the joints put name o negative gravity is such a smart idea why I didn't think of that I love this idea let's try that let's put the gravity behavior in for a second and just see what happens that's kind of fun look at that tree falling down all right let's this is by the way whoever sent a thousand people here maybe now is a good time to send us because I think this is kind of the interesting part to try to get this tree to do something let's make the gravity much weaker and go in the opposite direction okay ah look at that so this is actually in a way already what I sort of wanted to see the tree is kind of almost like swaying in the wind just by the nature of the spring forces and this sort of force that's pushing up one thing that I think would be really effective here is that you can add just like there's a global gravity behavior you can add an attraction behavior to the particles meaning they can attract each other and who had a negative one they can repel each other so if all the particles have a slight repulsion force then it won't allow them to get too close to each other so let me try adding that so when I create a particle a branch and and possibly would make sense for me to in many ways to lock both of these I mean what am i making is it a tree like that's now like the trunk is like really locked in place I don't know if that's a meaningful improvement but let me try adding let me try adding this attraction behavior so if I go to the branch object maile this jitter it's not being used let's take that out the branch is where I create the spring out of these two verlet particles so I think I could also say let repulsion equals new attraction behavior I honestly have no idea just speculate a new vet oh and I think I just give it a strength yeah wait let me look this up let me go back to the documentation and let me try to find let me go to where's the physics one I'm in core okay good I want to go into verlet physics attraction behavior oh I give it oh I give it the particle I don't add the behavior I there's so many things like there's a jitter parameter radius and strength okay I think what I do is I create a new attraction behavior I put it on the particle like this dot begin I give it a radius let's just say like 40 and a strength negative 1 so let's let's say repulsion 1 and repulsion 2 is on the end now do I have to add those I must say physics add behavior right repulsion one repulsion let's see if this does what I think it's gonna do yeah so it definitely does what I think it's gonna do but it's a little bit nuts and actually the repulsion behavior the radius and maybe strength should be dependent on its its level in the tree right so if we think about this fractal tree for a second if I were to draw what I'm doing right particle particle particle particle particle particle particle particle and I connect all these lines this is I bet something up weird what did I just do here this is basically what I've got so the each one of these particles has a sort of cone of repulsion and you can see that cone or that's not really a code it's a circle a circle repulsion should probably be smaller as it's getting further up the tree so that it sort of keeps its structure I mean again this is nothing to do with actual trees I'm just messing around with Springs and particles and having some fun but at least for the idea that I'm happening to create this sort of like simulated physics tree swaying in the wind I haven't even added any wind like some Pearlie noise or something this this I think would be a way to start so if I come back to this this is the variable that I'm talking about so I do I know about this distance so what if I just use that literal distance like I probably should use maybe like half the distance because it's a radius let's say half the distance acting a little bit crazy so I think this yeah skittish tree it's not maintaining its structure but it is kind of this crazy creepy crawly thing that I kind of love I think also this strength is kind of meaningful here like I could make it much weaker the interestingly enough the gravity is now so strong that what if I actually take out what if I don't have that negative gravity behavior like this is just the tree and this is actually in many ways I'm creating an example of a force directed graph aleck Moss is suggesting only put the repulsion force on the last particle on the end oh that's interesting right that's a meaningful idea adding that's yes that's actually a very important idea I think I'm duplicating because the end becomes the beginning of the next one I should only do one repulsion force that is a very good point yeah so this is more logical sort of whatever logic is assigned here what if I make it even weaker what if I make these Springs stronger yeah this this part here is really the issue like the branches start to like cross over strength of the branch should scale further out from the first branch should be ah yes so that's also true like I should this spring force like let's just say I make the spring force a 1 does that make it completely what's the word inelastic or elastic I'm gonna remember which is which but as if it's a metal rod there can't be springy so there's still the repulsion is an issue I mean issue bug or feature sunlight say feature there but this string and I could also do like I could say make it like 1/4 the radius yeah so this is kind of interesting so now what if I were to say let me make that oh the spring force of the repulsion force strength of the branch should scale further out from the first branch the weaker it should be the strength of the spring force or the repulsion force that could try either of those I kind of liked it when it was crazier to be perfectly honest I really like this idea of holding the tree up actually and then putting the gravity down because for example let's just put the gravity down again oh I'm not oops that's the wrong that's not a repulsion force it's an attraction force sorry meet a very weak oh oh no right I always forget the gravity is here if I put the gravity pointing down again the whole tree falls what if I every single very very last end point the last end points so for example where do i how do I find those so when n is 6 right if n let me just see if N equals 6 N equals 5 is the last one right just create a create a holder it's at the top I'm gonna take the branches in two separate variables and I'm going to make a spring at spring equals new a holder and a we're the rest length of a rest length of that distance and a strength of one and I want not a a dot end and let's do that twice and let's where did I just go there and that's it what am i doing I just need a little bit more room for my code physics add spring this is a ridiculous idea intermediate value is not a constructor whoa what is going on here hmm well what I guess I should probably draw these Springs you could apply forces using your forward kinematics code feels like that API is weird it should default to the distance between the two points given its rest length these are very good ideas I think I might leave this as an exercise to the viewer when n is 5 if it's makes 2 new branches make a spring between holder and the end and holders like this weird but they have arbitrary particle that I stuck oh oh I forgot to lock it in place I wonder yeah see now if only I could draw what it's doing so I think what would make more sense is for me to this is this is getting really ridiculous is to like have it hold itself up from not width but the end X point so like it's like there's like I'm building a little marionette I should really draw all these and then this is terrible pretty sure this is now gonna have each of them just to diagram what I'm doing it really helped for me to draw what I'm doing is if this is the top I'm putting something like right here that you don't see that like holds them off so I'm gonna like hold the tree up which is kind of ridiculous holder is not defined hold your wand holder on holder too old or too old or too old or too holders not too fast older one Oh everyone older too you should make the springs weaker so that they aren't metal rods oh maybe good point oh there's like the minimum and maximum I forgot about that there I'm holding the tree up do I even have the gravity pulling it down that's just perfect this is exactly what I was going for it let's just I'm curious what happens when these holder Springs are weaker really it doesn't make sense like they should be like come it would be a much more a much better way of doing this would be to kind of like attach them more like this I think some sort of like radial pattern probably but that was an interesting experiment but I think I'm gonna go back comment this out oops I'm gonna go back to the version that I have with negative gravity a repulsion force that is a factor the radius is a factor of the distance the length of the branch and the strength is in the negative direction and the spring force is much springier and let's see what we get here so this I like this brings me happiness now let's try to add I'm just curious let's add some is there a way to add dampening there must be I know there's there's the constraint function which would be good is there a dampening thing like particle behavior are these constraint oh there's all these constraint things there's minimum distance Springs that's probably something I should be using there's constraints I'm getting kind of kind of tired no what did a long time here Oh what Simon somebody said let's go attach them to their initial position with zero length Springs Oh fascinating idea whoa I like that idea add horizontal force proportional to the distance from the center of the screen yeah so many things I could try here and like you should all try these ideas maybe I can make a list of these ideas to talk about at the end I think I just want to make this kind of go crazy because I need to wrap this up but you're getting to see the challenge here so I want to what I wanted to Dilys do it I wanted to see if I could put some dampening I mean I know how to do this manually does toxic lives have inherent dampening from 3 months ago I did not expect to see a forum poster of 3 months ago this does not have an answer can I login can I reply to this oh this is the old forum so it's not from three months ago sorry this is from a very long time ago this is the archive of the old for forum so I can't reply to that oh look the nature of code calm maybe if I read that book it'll explain to me that would be nice lesson 5 default friction or dampening yeah J Myron Wow I remember that library this is from 2013 this discussion really like blasts from the past year what about friction no friction ah maybe watch this YouTube tutorial from 2015 it'll explain it to me I'm gonna give up on that I mean I could I could calculate a dampening force it's the angle which is what should be spring that's a very good point all right I have to stop here and offer suggestions for the community to do more fun stuff so couple things I I'm pretty happy with what this is doing it's not a realistic tree but it's sort of pleasant and interesting I bet you if you kind of we're thoughtful about how you draw this you might create some kind of like alien plant life creature it almost feels like more underwater ish like this is like an underwater plant so let me try to add a few more things to this number one is let me at least add it so that the branches are thicker I'm at the bottom and thinner at the top so that could be done by I could add a level variable here and this would have been useful for a lot of other things and every time I make a branch I give it its level so the root is level zero and a branch a branch B actually I could just give it the N here but I think I'll have the branch that it calculate the next level itself so the branch when it makes a new branch right here should say this dot level plus one and also right here this dot level plus one now when I draw it I can say stroke weight and let's just let me just say level for a second so that you see this is gonna work in the wrong way oh this dot level right so now we see it's thicker towards the top which is actually more like lab underwater creature plant like which I also quite enjoy but let's invert it so let's map this dot so let's say total levels equals six right now which goes here and then let's map this dot level which goes from zero to total levels and the stroke let's have the stroke weight go from 12 down to one and I'm missing a parenthesis somewhere I need another parenthesis here oh that is nice okay so already I'm enjoying this quite a bit boy it's kind of creepy could I maybe twelve to one is like too much and it probably should have an exponential or logarithmic some other scale it's linear right now let's do like eight yeah so it's a little less extreme and also let's try let's have like let's just push it to let's push it to eleven you need eleven this goes to eleven this fractal tree oh oh hold on hold on hold on everybody stop the chat spectral piano is giving me a good suggestion but here we go it's nice but it's not it can it not calculate the physics hello very om it's kind of like almost pi so too many levels too many levels Mozart let's try 10 still too slow 9 yeah we're getting 30 frames per second now with 9 so what was that scale velocity yes so I could dampen the velocity of each particle that's a small idea I'm not the words coming out of my mouth make no sense that's a good idea also I think that radius is getting way too small now I want the radius to be bigger so let's keep that radius bigger as I want them I want more and I want the frame rate to be faster so I'm gonna put it at eight there we go so okay this is good what was the logarithmic scale that someone suggested I'm gonna scroll back up in the chat wasn't that long ago where was it where was it scrolling scrolling ah I use spectral praiano writes I use 16 divided by log level plus 2 for this thickness so a logarithmic scale is an excellent idea here that's going to I think work nicely and if my brain if I wasn't so brain dead explain it where do I do the stroke wait here it is stroke weight equals 16 divided equally divided by log of this dot level plus 2 I don't want that to be 0 and let's see how this goes let's try logarithmic scale what's yeah I like this it's nice and I think I could even kind of go down yeah so that's really nice it's a I like the scale of this all right so we're getting our trees I'm surprised that it doesn't fan out more and I I think it would make sense of +1 here hello what happened to that oh plus two because I have a zero level that makes sense okay color so many things that could happen here maybe increase the strength of the repulsion force says Simon excellent idea because guess what I want it to go a little crazier there we go there you go yes dance tree dance oh I could have it respond to it looks like it's responding to sound that's what the crane bees let me just do one more thing and why one more thing I mean like probably ten more things but let me add some wind into the system so I only get one gravity behavior do I even does this even really matter let's take out the gravity behavior for a second I think what I could do I have an idea so without the gravity behavior it's it's not for standing up as consistently very weird it's also a little I feel like I shouldn't lock the second particle like it's weird that that with this whole thing that really doesn't make sense so let's not lock the second particle anymore can I just out of curiosity if I make a global variable called GB for gravity behavior and I and I say GB is that gravity behavior and I adjust its values like if I say function mousepressed gb x equals zero gb y equals zero when i click the mouse does that disable the gravity oh I forgot that I have that thing where I also can like drag one of them around I can't tell I think it did disable the gravity but it's too hard to tell let's take this out I don't think it disabled the gravity I think the gravity is still there I wanted to like just adjust that behavior over time oh I don't have the chance to looking at the logarithmic scale thing in the chat the spring should go from B to the a of the previous branch I think I'm doing that by definition of the way that I'm creating the springs the N branches definitely get tangled which is kind of interesting look at that um how do I hold on let's be sure about this way hold on console.log chibi Oh force oh there we go scaled force there's a force in a scale force maybe I can yeah X&Y don't do anything what if I were to say I forgot that I'm in JavaScript I just look at the objects maybe I need to affect the scaled force I mean I'm probably not supposed to do this was it called scaled force yeah there we go so I don't think this is the proper way to affect the behavior but it'll work for right now so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's always have the gravities scaled force Why Why is never gonna change but I'm gonna make the X and I probably should use open simplex noise and refer to my other videos about on blue simplex noise that's when it flies in later during the when this never gets edited this is very much like the neuro Revolution cars but feeling it's never gonna get edited noise but X offset equals zero X offset plus equals 0.02 noise X offset and we're going to map that value which goes between zero and one to between negative two and two so let's just see what happens here if there's this so the gravity this global force which is really not gravity but it's just a force always pointing up that's also going to go left and right from time to time let's see what happens it's a little bit too strong you can imagine an interaction where like I blow into the microphone and it does that it's kind of crazy I love this I really like this project let's go from like point one to zero point one yeah so there we go here is my tree swaying in the wind with physics let's go back let's just tune this a little bit I think these are way too strong let's make the it half as strong let's let the springs be much looser I think this is going to be nicer there we go there we go that's let's have a couple more little tuning things let's make this even weaker and let's change it less often and let's have the gravity force actually be well let's we can set it here let's set the Y we could also make this could be noisy as well I have an idea we'll just take a different we'll still go from like a different place in the noise space so it's different values and we'll map that which goes between zero and one which is silly I could just we could just take that noise value I don't need map for this because I want it to just go always negative and but have it be kind of weak so if sometimes it'll kind of go it'll go down to zero let's try this whoops scaled force all right I think I have finished this project yes I'm oka gonnna saying how about a Springs each joint which pulls them back to its original location repeat idea relaxing music here it's kind of appropriate there we go there's a white man hold on hold on hold on let's make this we're gonna I'm gonna give we're gonna do some relaxing tree fundraising here how do I do that thing where there I got it I got it I got it just hold on for a second all right everybody take a minute bring everybody from the internet here we are going to enjoy some nice relaxing music and a physics tree you don't like my default music from YouTube's free library that it's like somehow I have over here yeah first of all it doesn't respond to the music so I really think it should oh I have not gone Edward to ask me if I check out this exhibit yet I really have got to I really should can you share the code please so I definitely will share the code I suppose I could right now create a repo really quickly but I don't know that I'm ready like you know this this makes sense for it to be a community project you could create Springs between the particles on the same level to keep the branches separate that is such a good idea so there's so many good ideas being suggested and what I would like to say I mean I I've hit three hours now and I think that's about my limit but I would encourage you to to create your own version of this I will before I leave I'll upload the code somewhere so you could build off of it and remove the bounding box yeah the bounding box is sort of unnecessary here so let's do a few last things how do I let's do a few last things the bounding box is very unnecessary they should let let the tree be free fly tree fly like the wind like the Perlin noise not really wind so easy to listen to the microphone so it got rid of the sound library how do I get out of this full screen let's get the sound library back this is my fancy technique no shoot did I get it it's the worst I'm completely lost my mind I'm like so braindead spent a long week is that the sound library excellent I think I just say I can just make a variable called Mike and then I can say let Mike equals p5 audio in and then can I just get like the level there's more to it than this can't be this simple ooh whoops and it should be new p5 audioin all right that's not how it works Oh Mike dot start close I am definitely listening so let's go look at the examples oh I mean I want to look at examples sound sound Mike threshold input start get level new p5 audio and oh you know what it might be let's try listening on mousepressed oh wait a sec I have a feeling that the audio input is like tied to something else sound input no it's the builtin microphone can in fact work and put new p5 audio in and put get level huh what did I do wrong by missing what am I missing weird make Mike global I did I mean I was not putting the Mike dot start and setup because there's the weird issue well hold on let's try this there's a weird thing with Chrome where it doesn't want to let you listen without user interaction so that's why I was putting it in mousepressed just to kind of get around that and then I could say like if Mike I know but it works here watch me delete all my code and lose it all how confident am i okay hold on but this is in another file now this is just that example weird okay good so something is going on where it's not working let me let me show the warnings I have the warnings filtered out how do I were to filter things custom levels there it is this is what I was worried about audio context was not allowed to start so that's why I was here gonna say so it's not working in for an audio stream huh well that's good it's definitely something to do with oops how do I see the how do I look at the JavaScript console in Firefox I have completely little run out of steam I don't know why I decided to try to do this Oh allow and here we go you usually would ask me to allow it some preferences web developer web console there we go I'm getting some values whoops no no how do I make this bigger well alright so now what I was going to do just get the volume and then have this kind of be tied to that because definitely gonna be exactly what I wanted to do come back Oh interesting something is going weird with the audio stream alright this didn't happen I'm done I have to go home I can't be here anymore close this close this while he was not defined when I have that ass forgot what I had this is never getting edited into some kind of like 30 minute coding challenge but in the off chance that it does I will record a little end and I will just consider this my prompt to you from the livestream thank you for thank you for watching this coding challenge that was a bit of a mess but I ended up making this strange wiggly sea creature hopefully you learned something about the way that a fractal works objectoriented programming works and physics libraries work I guess I would open it up to you or what are some ways that you could actually make this feel much more treelike in terms of giving it a much more stable structure or perhaps go in the opposite direction and make it even more frenetic or feel more creature or seaweed or underwater like maybe it could respond to some kind of interaction like sound you could do so much more with color you you could change the way you're drawing the tree or the design of the branches so many possibilities if you make your own wiggly wobbly fractal tree with physics please share it with me at the coding Drang calm on the page associated with this coding challenge and I will see you in future videos and I would love ya share it with me and I will see you next time on the coda train I had point five not point two okay try recording an intro okay Simon good point what you're about to watch okay hello and welcome to a coding challenge what you're about to watch is an edited down version of what I spent well over two hours programming which is this this is for the YouTube fundraiser team trees go to team trees or to donate or use the donate button that's associated with this video I really set out to try to make a tree swaying in the wind and I ended up with this crazy like flying around that's completely gone now sea creature more like or I don't know what it is here comes back hi tree just spinning around in circles and so I'm going to show you just about all the pieces of the code that I wrote to do this with a lot of the debugging and extra tangents cut out of course you could always back go back and watch the full livestream but please maybe you could make a version of this that's a little less insane or that's more insane and share it with me at the coding trade calm plant a tree every dollar goes to planting a tree i've do brain dead to make this opener let me just let me just look here at team trees okay any donations that you make through this from this video any donations that you make either a team tree org or the YouTube donate button or Arbor days team trees I'm not gonna forget on Facebook any donations you make either going by going directly to team trees org or with the donate button that you see with this video are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree planting $1 plants one tree you could read more about the team trees fundraiser by by checking out the links in this video's description so enjoy this insanity of me attempting to make a tree and ending up with this my friend my weekly Wiggly friend and I will see you at the end where I come back and try to summarize this very poorly probably goodbye alright everyone I'm gonna try to I you know this little the fundraisers were probably going on for a while but and I'm I'm done I'm done for today choo choo I pressed the choochoo button I play my little outro music and see if there are just a few questions that I could answer before I go I just want to check my messages for a second so I'm very much hope I have a bunch of videos that I've recorded that are in the hopper so to speak that I haven't released yet so those I will be so stay tuned there's obviously edited stuff that's come from previous live streams but there are some new there's a new content coming out in particular set of videos or come out on November 6 that you won't have seen the live stream we ship out let's all say it's good to powder for sale a bloop boo boo boo paella false a lot more fluff I'll say a Tele blur but I'll put the phone say can I do it dance background is overpowering my friend she turned it down sorry that it's so loud couldn't you have used apply force just like with the snow with a random single direction wind yes I could have I don't know why I got stuck on like just give everything the same force what's your all right thanks everybody I see some interesting comments Lonnie writes I've been blocked hmm I don't block like on is it can you block people on YouTube I'm not sure exactly what happened there but I will I can check into that cringe yes I agree portably what's your favorite thing besides teaching yeah no I've seen common so I don't think you're blocked my favorite thing besides teaching hanging out I only have cheese the answers to that like I know I'm not French this song it's much longer than I remember I would have just passed a few sine waves for the tree points these are all really good ideas none of which did I try yes go to sleep Jory go to sleep I'm leaving to go to sleep in just a minute here I'll play you out with a diss song how fast you need to drive psycho fly to catch the game what time is the game start what time is it now oh I can get home I actually can get home within 20 minutes from here so yeah I'll be able to catch that World Series game ok thank you all I don't know sometimes I and these streams that think that all my time and energy is going into the right place sometimes I think what's become of me but I I hope oh let me upload this code so I don't I don't have a point of view right now as I mean and I will violate to is helping me manage a lot of the github repos we can put our heads together and think about this and there's many other members and patrons who do a lot of this work as well but let me just at least put the code somewhere that you could see by making a new repo because I do like the idea of having a community team trees project you know one idea that I had which I did that look those like cloud designs a bunch of years ago for processing Community Day and everybody could make a cloud design and then we could make a forest of 20 million coding train trees oh there's some interesting ideas here but let me just do this right now a code from team trees livestream so at a minimum I'm just gonna make a readme that the code from today will be here on YouTube github and this can be like so much more needs to be here to make it a thoughtful useable thing but adding code from today but at least for those of you who want to try to start to work with what I did you can grab it from here right now at github slash coding trained team trees get tube alright bye everybody I'm gonna switch you over to the team trees logo you can still hear me I'm gonna play you out with the Perlin noise song actual random itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10 9 7 6 but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this 2 3 4 3 4 5 6 Perley noise that is totally noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises this is Hurley noise that entirly know so this is Hurley noise that is her pearling know her Perlin noise that is Hurley more this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that in Perley no so this is Hurley noise that is hurlyburly noise pick numbers like this this is like Perlin noise performance goodbye everybody choochoo
