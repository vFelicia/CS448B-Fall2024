okay Here I am live at the ITP show people are looking at me like I'm a crazy person which I am it's quite understandable this is the ITP winter show 2017 my name is Dan Schiffman this is hey there's nobody you're watching which is a little strange is this actually happening are people there I see a lot of thumbs up okay great alright so this is a somewhat of a special episode but this is the end of semester show at ITP it's a twoyear graduate program at Tisch School of the Arts and I'm here on the floor there's over a hundred projects on display and I'm just gonna wander around and look at them and interview various students and I set my notifications to never turn on and they're turning on anyway okay that's fine they're going away one question I have while people are watching just briefly is if the audio sort of seems okay and if you can if you can hear me just fine great alright awesome so I'm gonna turn that I'm gonna press some button that's gonna change the view of the camera okay so this is the ITP floor now you can hear me and I'm going to go into this room first okay we're gonna look at some projects in this room let's go I'm gonna come over here first since this I think will show up very nicely on the camera okay so what I'm gonna ask you guys to do they're my guinea pigs here is to say your name wait hold on I'm trying to like get used to this gimbal thing oh it's backwards okay oh you know what you're very much in the shadows because of so yeah just stand about there that's a little bit better I mean it's gonna be dark no matter what that's better maybe maybe that's better now alright okay so alright now I'm gonna ask you say your name and then tell me about your project and I'm gonna do it this is a little bit differently than I did last time because I learned it's actually helpful when if I edit this later to have video of the people talking and then the projects work separately and they can be spliced together okay I'm Michael Simpson observe the light and they reproduce the imaging on the other side so how he made this is a 3d printed object and fabricated using fiber optics so this gets this gets this image from the bottom and then reproducing the image on the front you can see like people love to doing this it doesn't involve any electricity but it still is growing and showing the image that right there is a projector inside and it's emitting the lights and on the display we have we decided we wanted to try to make it look like it was a living object so we were thinking about different things and we decided to use visualization of a neural network that's trying to find the solution space of X or so every two minutes and resets and it thinks about it for a little bit and you kind of watch it breathing and thinking and trying to find the solution had you worked with this kind of fiber optics before research before to find like how to fabricate this and at first like this star is this this is just a one pixel and you can see that when it's getting it's bending the light and yet decided to make it into a bigger light sculpture awesome wonderful thank you guys okay well I'm just gonna test to make sure this microphone is really working okay so I'm holding the microphone near my mouth near my mouth okay so hold on I gotta figure out how to do this if I turn this here okay look at it it's like falling to the side Oh thing is supposed to make give me a stable camera and yet it just seems to cause any more problems okay we're gonna go over here and tell me your name and about your project information from two people and encourages you to sync your heart rate with somebody else let's take a look you need somebody else to either hold the camera can we get a volunteer so once it gets a good pulse from each person it's going to compare their heart rates and then we can try to sync how has the response been like what if people tried to do right away they usually try to start deep breathing together and sometimes they'll hold hands I've had people try to sing together or listen to music yesterday people were running in plays so unprompted they will engage in all sorts of different strategies to try to sync up with somebody awesome combos I try to get some more footage of this here and are you adjusting the color awesome cool and everybody always wants to know even though I don't like to ask technical questions what you use to build this awesome all right cool awesome great job tell them can I ask you about this project okay so tell me your name and tell me about your project yeah you know I think I need to do this hold on I think I'm just gonna be better which is called flappy shadow yeah yeah maybe what I need to do is actually this and then that okay that's probably better okay let's try this one more time can you demonstrate it for us I just laughed really awkwardly and loudly yeah yeah awesome great job thank you okay you guys want to demonstrate some flying calibrate this hold on Wow okay so let's have a look here Chang Tao is putting on some wings and before you start um can you guys tell me your names and a little bit about your project but you need to talk right to this hi my name is chen tao we just have this summation of wings I love space so we have this silly idea of just combining idea of letting a man flying through space using wings and that here is appreciate the physicality of the wings so I love putting a young and when they're interacting it's really like tangible I guess yeah awesome okay I'm gonna step over here and I'm gonna try to get you guys this looks a lot like a starfilled coding challenge that I thought I might recognize what has kind of what has the reaction been like people said to you that was surprising or what people done anything you would expect it was like really really cool and they love to fly like awesome fantastic alright great job you guys thank you I see if I oh you know what let's see we try there's different settings no sound let's see if this helps yes sound okay I think actually uh I think I found a better setting for the gimbal thing all right we're walking down this hallway there's some pretty awesome projects here this is a really great game called darkness that I played yesterday but it's not actually here right now Stephanie want to show your project spoiler alert I said her name already okay ready say your name and tell me about your project I did a project called take me to which is a sort of couples trace routing IP addresses with Google Streetview so I'll use p5.js org is our website and we'll see it go through the different locations okay all right so I picked our website and what we're gonna do is we're gonna right now it's thinking and looking up all the intermediate IP address hops that we make from our network here at NYU to p5.js org and so what we saw are the Street View locations of all of those organizations that have those intermediate IP addresses register so on the way we had talked about communications in Virginia but also in New York we hit Zao bandwidth and then we also finally then ended up at new dream network in California which is where p5 org p5.js dorgon's registered awesome what what what interesting websites that people put in here that surprised you see is interesting it just goes to Chicago I think and what else is interesting and why you dot edu I couldn't trace wrote because we're already on the network I think so that was kind of a revelation they always like Lee goes through two locations either Broomfield California for level three or 60 Hudson in New York for Tata Communications awesome great job thank you your project okay folks holding this mic is very sensitive just more than last year when I do this you really ought to talk right hi I'm Chris I'm a second year student in ITP and this is my project this is basically an app you can use to so this is an app you can use to select the video okay we're going cool so you can upload any video in this case I'm uploading this video of food which is like five seconds and this app will first grab all the frames and analyze the video and it will try to get a description of what's in the video so it took like five seconds for it to do this and after that you'll see that here it popups like a small description of what is in the video and with that you can select any 3d train movie from here so if I go like with Rosemary's Baby from Roman Polanski this is gonna search for the scene that best matches that previous video you input so you get a thing like that it's basically a tool that uses machine learning to analyze videos and like get this similarity between videos and things well that's really cool how how how long are the clips like how do you determine this sort of start and end time of the clips that were seeing in this search so I search the tools search for the the longest scene in a movie I'm basically analyzing all the frames and the frames that have the same description basically I I can infer that that's a scene but I thinks that most scenes in like movies are like four to eight seconds long because they're really like fast but I still like grabbing the the one that's the longest so in average eight scene is like five seconds to five to seven seconds so this is so this we have a bowl of food sitting on a table and then now we have a man sitting at a table with a plate of food from Star Wars a new hope I hope I'm not violating any copyright it's a short enough clip that we're okay we can do another and basically that's how it works so get something like that awesome what are you using a pretrained model that do the kind of to to come up with this sentence or caption for the video or is that something you trained like hot what's what's the kind of happening behind the scenes there oh yeah I'm using a picturing model Google released a couple months ago it's called image to text and I'm using that in a frame to frame basis and then I'm pretty trendy all these movies pretraining a move aside like training a movie takes like an hour for like a two hour movie so I basically had like my computer running for a week just like watching movies you know awesome cool great job thank you Chris okay here we go we are now entering the fray here okay wait there's a crazy thing over here oh okay wait are we ready for rockpaperscissors or not yet should I come all right hold on Oh coming back over here okay so what I'm gonna try to do this microphone is very sensitive I mean it's not sensitive it's like it will only hear you so I'm gonna have you just talk about the project for a little bit then I'll should come shoot some video of it in action okay some of your name and about cool hey my name okay hey my name is Nick Wallace this is the hand so this is a project that I've been working on for the our physical computing midterm and final and it started off as a simple kind of game idea we realized so here at ITP we have a large kind of very diverse community and we were talking about games that everybody has played is the child that kind of thing and it turns out almost everybody has played rockpaperscissors at some point in their life they might not call it exactly rock paper scissors paper scissors rock whatever but it turned out to a very common thing so we wanted to do something where you were playing with a computer in a way that was kind of universal to a lot of people's experience so we started off with his idea rock paper scissors and then we figured rather than having it up on a screen why not create a hand that hat plays rock paper scissors and so we did okay let's watch rock paper scissors all right so now they won't really be able to hear you but okay sure yes waking him up right now oh there we go he's going he's throwing rock oh I got him got him again so now he's gonna resubmit himself because we just played three games yeah so he plays rockpaperscissors who played best two of three and we've got some little motion input here and this guy right here just showing what you're doing as the player and he's so he's inviting me to play again and so we're gonna go home we're game why not and he's also kind of rude really cool so this is uh this is the Heron has anybody been really good at playing and always beats seems to somehow managed to beat the ham yeah so we had one guy yesterday who I think won probably five out of six games is the best that I've seen so far most people don't do don't do quite as well I definitely don't even I made him and I still lose every time almost awesome great project thank you okay this is what I wanted to show you guys this is brickbreaker but somehow being played I got to recalibrate this gimbal all right can you guys tell me about your project so tell me your name right in the mic and tell me this is our seesaw project it's an interactive seesaw playing game combining are very familiar games of seesaw and break breaker so we are actually using a seesaw to control the breaker game and actually our concept is that we want to give a chance for adults to do what they did in their childhood but they don't do when they grow up so and also our project gave a chance for two people maybe who are strangers or who don't know each other very well a chance to sit together play together talk to each other awesome has anybody really surprised you I liked how they played it in a way you didn't expect or somebody like really really good at it mostly kids they're really persistent and they really want to win and they came barely around seventy six times and they are the highest score right now very competitive and really into the game awesome great job you guys I'm gonna try to get some more footage of it it's okay you're going front all right hold on maybe Oren can be can I can I can I try to get your project Warren is testing it okay so let me why don't why don't I get some shots of him doing it and then then I'll ask you guys can get him an explanation about it it's okay came out great actually alright can I can I save save save okay hold on okay can I can I have you guys just say your name and give a couple minutes or you a minute explanation okay hold on let me get this camera in a good spot okay here we go ready I'm Johnny hurry unction project wish candles and it's all about making your wishes blowing out the candles so as fast we just thought about turning of LED light flowing by blowing out but later we decide to decided to apply a story you know the blowing out the candles making your wishes on your bus birthday it's kind of international myth so we applied the story on our project and then we also want you to add some kind of analog interaction on it so we also made electronic electronic match that you can turn it on by striking it on the matchbox three and they're safe and we didn't want to go too literal by having like a little birthday singing on the screen so we combined it with another myth of making your wish when shooting stars go down from the sky so that's why we had the night sky on the screen and when you blow out the candles the shooting star animation is triggered and also we didn't want to make our whole project tacky or cheesy so we went for like a really chic black concept and that's why we have the walls all black yeah that's our general concept wonderful fantastic great work you guys thanks for showing it okay I think I got really good footage of it so okay so everybody can go and see that on Twitter now yes awesome great job thank you alright I'm gonna keep moving okay can you tell me about these sure these are some of my first tell me your name for hi I'm on the table and for digital fabrication I did some experiments and concrete so for example if you look at this disk of concrete there's nothing too special about it but it has embedded fiber optics which allow light to shine through so I made these light sculptures using the same technique I also discovered the concrete is slightly conductive so I was able to make a touchsensitive concrete lamp the base is all concrete with some embedded electronics these are some magnetic sculptures kind of similar to a ferrofluid but captured in solid form and I'm playing around with basically the tactile feel of like rough concrete with this fragile looking form and then over there we have some what I call revealed light sculptures where I take light sculptures and embed them inside concrete then as you chisel away the concrete the light shines through and it guides you how to chisel and revealing the structure at the end wonderful where'd you get the idea to do this I started out with the concept of smart walls and trying to make you know basically for example buttons which would be embedded inside the walls and just decide figure out that I love the concrete as a substance and exploded awesome I'm gonna try to get some more closeup footage of it sir can you touch the lamp again let me just come around this side do it yeah oh wow awesome cool that's beautiful so this ugly looking thing is actually a very smart block of concrete and it has embedded sensors which allow me to make a realtime 3d rendering of the shape that you're sculpting as you're sculpting it so today at 600 I'm gonna take a hammer and chisel do it and you'll see wonderful great job should I come check this out okay so it is a whole class project yes they'll tell me your name and this is all of the projects from the digital fabrication class somebody made contour table out from the CNC so basically use the CNC has a painting tool dan tried making us your trophy like laser cut acrylic so it creates of organic patterns Lola has tried making a squashy button which is her thing so if you squish it it lights up and I made abstract tree which if you plug your headphones into it will tell you stories voice recordings of people's experiences of sexual abuse and harassment so you can like it's meant to be like an urban art installation where you like walk by it and new plug in your headphones and listen to people's stories basically wonderful thank you okay so I only got you talking about the projects now so I'm gonna just try to get some footage of them could you do the same things to interact say with this one yeah and what's causing it to change color whenever a message comes in the basically there's at will you up running that basically changes colors based on now whether it's received a message okay let's see alright Simon can you tell me your name and tell me about your project I'll go get footage evidence separately because this microphone only hear you if you talk right yeah I'm Simon and this over here is my ICM project our coding project called take the money and run so basically what it does it is lets you create it you're travelling self and you can follow yourself by getting postcards from all over the world and that's basically what it is awesome can you demonstrate it alright someone's look using it right now okay and you'll get a postcard from your traveling self and it's taken information about the country and fit it into the postcard so this will tell you about the United States because we're in the United States and you can basically go anywhere you want and able to take images from Flickr put your image and yeah so try typing in some other city if it shows up in the line it's good yeah so yeah yeah and you press GO and you take that image down click it and now we're in Los Angeles so it's taking images from Flickr put you on top and then it fills in some blanks in the postcards from JSON files wonderful awesome job thank you okay let's see yeah this is this requires a lot of arm strength good thing I holding the camera with my non broken arm alright can you demonstrate this or Foe first tell me your name and tell me about your project my name is and this project is called the cosmos in the water okay tell me what it does all the way you should just show it first Wow where'd you get this idea this project is actually a meditation it's it's like there is young I am patent you can see from the water so it's about Taoism so I want people well they are interacting with the water they can feeling their relationship with nature so are we part of the nature or are we isolated from it do we want to control it or do we want to achieve balance so this project is about these things that I want people to think while they are playing with it all right hey I recognize you from a different project okay tell me your name and tell me about your project my name is Oren shoham my project is a glove that is a wearable MIDI controller so the way it works is it's got a bunch of force sensors and the fingertips so when you press a finger it sends a musical MIDI note to either a computer or to a phone any device that can do blue suit MIDI over Bluetooth so right now I've got hooked up to able to live over here controlling a drum sound which you can't hear the sound of my headphone but people hear that well anyway yeah so it works entirely wirelessly it's got a battery and it communicates have a bluetooth so it's entirely portable I just have a bunch of wires on it right now but it once in the future awesome thank you so much okay Elizabeth can you tell me your name even though I just said what your name is and then what not yet about your project and this is my lingo gizmo which I'll show you you can use it to invent words for a missing dictionary great okay so I'm it's a little bit tricky but I'm gonna try to shoot you doing it while you okay like the word sound you can add it to your growing word have enough so let's define it Dan what do you think Pavano means paavana is the state of feeling totally relaxed let's spell it paavana and then we need to shout it into the microphone so that it grabs it so paavana give your name and then save so the idea is that you're adding original words to a missing dictionary and people can collaborate on adding those for experiences that don't have words yet so this is my working prototype for now awesome what's your favorite word that someone's made up so far if that's just an example of one that you like the word which is the name for doing homework late at night and having a small party awesome great job thank you okay you guys can you guys tell me about your project hold on say your name and tell me just a project in a few sentences hi I'm turn cha I'm Joo Hyun this project is basically make user to experience the visual world and the reality so it's gonna express by two different kind of water the visual water under the real water so you can control the water through the bowel and it's gonna fold the whole spring and when when the whole swimmer fault it's worse bill and there's real water spilling so you can actually draw something and would you draw I raised by the real water so you can turn the real water are what you are is not gonna disappear it's gonna stay black and you can turn on the valve it's gonna be washed away wonderful great job this project we wanted to create a whole new twisted world and make users exploring between the virtuality and reality we made multiple layers wonderful great job you guys now I know this is going to be hard because there's a VR component but maybe we could just tell us about it as best as you guys can first tell me you knew this Mike tell me your names and tell me about your project and I'm Nikolas organization in Chile so we wanted to bring kind of like subjects about sexual harassment and sexism in an interactive way to addressing this subject as an important and in a serious way but like kind of like in a different experience so here we have with different windows as you can see and as you press a different window as you can see here the environment in the VR maybe you're going to be able to see kind of like the color of it it's also gonna change you can also access like the website and home and it's gonna be controlled still by this physical window wonderful great job you guys thank you alright I'm gonna move to another area of the floor we're gonna go back this way alright here we go we are heading back into this room back here I'm getting slightly better operating this camera and let's see here if we can let's go I want to go play whackamole Kelly can we play whackamole okay so I'm gonna attempt to first have you explain to say your name and explain the project if that's okay with you and then maybe I guess you could ride em straight up holding this crazy camera thing here okay welcome all and so basically you've got 30 seconds to hit whatever comes up as many times as you can for points and bragging rights and you know fun of course so I'm gonna start the game off for you and then you basically pictures is that new from yesterday or was that there yesterday Justin no there's a lot of things going on these days and you could just make a Wacka 2017 probably and would be very wonderful a great job that is really fun so what's a your score was 129 points all right I'll be back later to see if I can beat that thank you okay let's see where can I go around here hello this is live right now do you want to talk into this microphone and tell me about this hold on first I'm gonna try to have the camera point at you this gimbal thing is totally failing oh I'm about my project so my projects call micro failure and it's about the fungus Network so I'm fascinated about how fungus they talk to each other and distribute nutritions in the forest and I made a metaphor to indicate like how human beings they can also mimic that and better distribute information so the interaction youporn your hand can you only start with that one mushroom and why was this called humans versus demons Oh tight oh yeah beautiful can you show it one more time it's really Gordon tell me which mushroom do you want that's lovely thank you so much okay Kim oh my god let's me try to get these look can we try this angry thing okay hold on first so this is gonna be a little complicated first let me ask you to tell me your name there's three all three of you did it so I'll have you tell me your names hold on first I'm really bad at this camera thing and then you're gonna have to talk right oh come on there we go this is good okay you're okay we'll be good okay my name is Chris yeah my name is Reid Elaine hi I'm fede F and we are the creators of anger flanker research inspired arcade inspired also game so it's anger thinker it's a place where you can actually really vent your anger and has been proven that people really love this and people I should really vent anger especially yesterday demonstrate it so let's see anger awesome great job you guys okay so let's give this a try can you first tell me your name and explain the project and then we'll try having you demonstrate it hi hi I'm don't kill and I'm presenting my project named dull wall and I want to provide some space to to express people's own voices and thoughts so I I got the wall I mean Trump wall here so you can graph the your opinion on the wall digitally and virtually awesome okay you want can you demonstrate it and I can also change the color by shaking there's the color prevalent and now the bottom bar indicates the color changing and now it's red yeah awesome what's a what's a anybody draw anything that really surprised you are making creative things that you like what are you on the spot sorry wonderful great job thank you okay now this is gonna be tricky with these sound projects which should you want to try to demonstrate this okay tell me your name okay so I'm gonna read it okay where do I see it to read it oh it's there okay hold on all right I know you're tired but come this is the way in your light I learn how to love in your beauty how to make poems you dance inside my chest where no one sees you but sometimes I do and that site becomes this art beautiful can you tell me where's the poem from something that audience I mean involved in all the details that are interested in being part of the performance that is separated one you just watch it yeah I try to add some interaction today I mean between the audience and the performance wonderful thank you so much that's great okay I'm very excited to try to get some footage of this okay so first tell me your name and tell me about your project my name is Alden and I bought this doll from a witch on eBay and the witch told me that the ghost of a young girl named Sophia is trapped inside of the doll and so what I did is I used the Google Cloud speech API in order to connect with the ghost and allow you to commune commune with her and but for some reason all she wants to do is tell you about your future so if you not hold this microphone me to tell me about my me to tell yes I see some people in the comments take talking about how bad I am with this gimbal and yeah it's true I think there's this unfortunate issue where it's weighted poorly mostly because I had to tether this microphone to it I also realized that I'm kind of doing a well that's a much better this is hold on let's look at someone who knows what they're doing here you guys I don't know if this is live right now but you should definitely tune into this because they know what they're doing it's much better okay I'm gonna go around here okay hold on let's try let's let's just keep going let's try some of this stuff hey wait didn't we just talk to you about a project yeah I have two projects in here I'm allowed to talk to the same person twice yeah this is a critique to news media and we are bombarded by so much sub by so many things so much that if you actually come close and try to see what it's about well I can tell you there we actually see that it's only a bunch of noise there's no content behind it it's only designed to make us to attract us and to grab our attention and also the closing is a critic to the news media companies because most of them with the critiques they just shut themselves they don't listen to anything at all and then they just go to what what they were doing in the first place great job thank you okay I think we're gonna think that's good see if we can make this work here for a live streaming audience is that okay with you okay first but first before you demonstrate it many go demonstrate if you demonstrate first well why don't you just tell me your name and tell me a couple cents about the brother so my name is al Rosenberg I mean I made a toy drum machine all made out of wood and yeah so I as you see I am I'm flourishing when it's what I'm going live let's let's take a look at it it has demo itis this is worth the wait everybody does anybody really surprised you and how they use this in a way that you didn't expect yes some people try to use this guy and mostly kids just put every possible magnet on the board so what happens if you do that yeah it just goes berserk but yeah can you just brief can you briefly explain what the dials at the bottom yes this one the left one is youth like controlling the tempo so lets you know if you can hear it and the right one is just awesome great job thank you okay let's see you guys wanna can you guys come and tell me your names and tell me about your project I'm Shawn I'm you ha this approach is like a magic sandbox you can play with the sand and animation wheel changes along with it so that's the music do you want to see this yeah so hold on give me a second here to get set up okay go for it I've heard the music to hear it beautiful job great job guys thank you okay oh boy so many things to see oh yeah okay wait hold on Chelsea can I ask you to explain your project and then let's see if we can somehow maybe demonstrate it first tell me your name and tell me why my name is Virgil is made by me and my partner yelling and this is an installation project with links for stampers with my Gmail API so basically you're watching is my email stress level so every time I got new email stepwells being a little bit if I keep knowing this email spell things will happen for example lowwing was filled all righty and now we are on the stage too so I'm guessing maybe trending more emails below will be popped and I wish you have stage three so it's a play so the arm will push all the play on the floor then I smash it and you have to clean the mess and the fourth one is AG so I say you can see and is alive right it can be a chicken so you don't want to kill a live radio email okay let me try to get some footage of it and then so so if for people who are watching live or what's going to happen here let me try to come over here so that me will come back come back I think the battery is I'm I'm gonna have to get put new batteries in this but it's okay I'm gonna take it off he's going to make people so happy anyway okay I'm reading it the stepper will you know swing reversely and NATO will come back a little bit let's try it again sending yes and reading so you better read all your emails yes all right let's try to look so this is spilling ink this is knocking a plate off the table and then over here is smashing the egg okay I'm gonna go try to revive this all right everybody if nobody minds I'm gonna try to revive the gimbal oops I'm gonna sneak by revive the gimbal take a short break for a second okay hello everybody I'm not taking a seat here this is very very exhausting to do this okay I'm gonna put this mic here what supposedly our two fully charged I'm gonna go see some more projects I don't feel like unplugging the mic because I don't feel like I'm plugging the mic because then I don't have to plug it back in I'm gonna go look at some more projects in a minute although I think I did pretty well this goes in this way you know the the gimbal isn't doing very much where I should use is just like a stick to hold the phone that would actually be better no I'm just being lazy as soon as I as soon as the holidays come up getting a haircut and a trimming a beard it's just okay YouTube has stabilization it's pretty awful the YouTube stabilization all right let's see I don't think it's supposed to do this I make horrible sound I dunno how to calibrate it okay I know I understand about the mic I'm sorry about that another time I'll try to get a better one I realize it's very directional the good thing about that is it's very very loud out there and so it's so loud that if I didn't have a good directional mic I don't think you better hear anything let me look at the instructions sorry everybody these are the instructions for the SK lab gimbal this show is open to the public but you only got about three hours left so if you're in New York and can make it here then you could come okay it says too so I am using the counterweight pitch lock panning and roll axis can move freely but the pitch axis stays in a fixed position power button will flash one time all right I think that's the mode that I want starting up hold the phone in a horizontal position with the camera facing away from you figure five press the power button for incorrectly three seconds the gimbal will automatically balance itself do not attempt to move the gimbal motors by hand oops the gimbal is not balanced see the calibration section of the manual okay calibration simply power off the gimbal for about one minute and let it rest on a flat surface power back on see if is successfully cobbler ated okay i did that i think because i have the counterweight in it really needs the phone in there okay I am gonna unplug the mic I'm afraid to do that so now it's just using the phone mic because what I'm gonna do is actually do the actual reallife correct calibration then I'll plug the mic back in okay so I'm gonna do this second calibration I can try without the directional mic even in the hallway but I don't think that's gonna work where it's really noisy all right so now I'm gonna attempt to do figure six so all right all right everyone sing this sounds so much better so figure six okay simply power off the okay with a phone installing the gimbal powered on press in the joystick but both buttons until the motor deactivate and the power light begins flashing oh the kid blasting powered on okay PMO's powered on motor turned off next lay the gimbal down a flat surface resting its pitch axis and handle figure six okay oh it just calibrated awesome there we go ooh it's totally calibrated now so actually it's totally calibrated and so you if you want I can go into the hallway and see how it works without the mic but I kind of feel feeling that's gonna be a disaster let's just try that for a little bit I'll come back okay so I got to switch the camera all right wait this is live streaming me finding a whiteboard marker and handing it off yeah excellent morning trade continues yeah okay now what I'm trying to do with no microphone no listen you want to be a guinea pig here okay so we're gonna trying this without I had a directional mic yes we're complaining about so this is probably gonna be worse okay people are saying this is bad okay well let's let's give you I'll come back with you sure so tell me your name tell me about your project my name is Melissa and my project is called swipe right it's a web app to make it easier to report Twitter Nazis so can we can we report somebody right now yeah we can report someone I'm let's find someone who is very worth recording let's see unlike these ultraorthodox Jews sort of a lion I'm not sure would you report this person would you ignore them this is a very difficult decision to make some people watch it like ready to report okay all right I think we can ignore yeah I don't know what the threshold is this one looks pretty upset this one's upsetting I think we should report so is this is actually something that's alive and online that you can look at so right now I haven't made it live because I'm nervous that there's no safeguards in place to keep someone from just coming in and calling every with a Nazi I would like to release a waveguide there's no kind of signin system but basically what I'm doing right now is every person that gets reported is put on the Nazi watch list Twitter account so then I can go in and report them or you can come and check it and report those like individuals can come in appropriate Stan okay so I'm trying to now I'm gonna try to determine I'm gonna see more background noise but it's better overall know if I believe everybody I'm testing a difference no mic see if it's better we're saying it's better 218 I don't know if that numbers accurate this is a little bit of a quieter area anyway well his name is Braden state where we'll find a Google and flight simulator the next control controller you can see the face from the screen moving around but uh basically you get to like lean your arm lean and and pretend like your body's a joystick and then flap your arms like a bird to control the plane and Google Earth also can you demonstrate it yeah I am there you go all right right now we're flying around Mount Holly acolo and Hawaii it's uh I was like it's nighttime in Hawaii combining some coding and statistical interaction because intangibles still pretty fun love a good time laughs I think that really brings people together there's one thing you learn from probably coding training then smiles are good definitely awesome great job thank you thank you for sharing grab the microphone so that I have it so I've got the microphone which I'm gonna put it in my mini my back we're gonna go whoops so we get somewhere really loud and I need to switch to it you want to want to say your name and give me a quick explanation yeah Terrell I'm like okay extra I'm getting someone to do my camera work okay hi I'm Jen and this is my worry it's worried absolutely so this tree will listen to your worries and store your worries paint a nearfuture he will send it back to you so the idea is like a time capsule s time pass your worries will be minor I have 20 things in my hand this is live right now okay now did you guys do this project together yes yes it is you guys stand next to each other and tell me about the project tell me your name until we got the drive down so my name is Alan I made this project or so we made that Lisa heart you can interact it with your hands to play cells so you can mix house without actually touching something awesome can you I can you demonstrate it some more yeah great job thank you I didn't I know I know it's so well all right you guys want to stand next to each other and tell me your names give me a sentence or two do you want to try it it's very finicky I could tell the red would appear alright thank you I'm so happy for somebody else to hold this camera okay all right I think that Tong should just operate the camera we have a today okay tell me about this project I'm drinking Park and this project is about the close because they did 45 Express this moment that's beautiful thank so I could probably do this you know while holding this yeah so I it's really responsive this Tuesday though okay hi today we tell you about your project I'm Sarah and this is change a bit so we have here a string of bricks that work as a string of bits that encode an instruction for a computer to change something in the screen so each and every brick can be there like lying down or thing like and then people that participate you can are free to change the state of these bricks manipulate the output of the computer something because I'm in this grand so there's some kind of encoding in breaks hey guys I missed the update on the screen so here take that brick the tall one but don't do it yet wait slide up the screen okay and then you can sit down and also this whole image contains like their like a memory of history of all the previous actions of the participants we have many sir can you tell your neighbor tell me about your project my name is Daniel I predicted skull in Leiden and it's about controlling the illumination of a room with a little candle so in this in this project I've we have a linear Chatham and you can interact with each item and in order to control the dimensions of the room you can you can try if you want going in the room everybody oh it's so bright in here alright I'm gonna turn the camera to point up now okay now I'm going to show you the sensor that I'm touching if I'm not actually using the mic I can actually put the phone in the gimbal in a better place because I had to have a slightly to the side with the fairway vehicle second there we go privileged easier is oftentimes the difficult conversation so we framed it in the form of a game to do so there's surveys online about privilege and we took from that survey some of the questions and we made some of our questions so the British lines was represent like life and success and I guess you guys to explain this project alright so first tell me your name my name is Terry Gutierrez I'm a first year graduate student at ITP and so this project is called the starting line project I'm it's a racing game followed by privilege so we have two players two users answer a sentence of ten questions yes or no and if the answer is yes to any questions they run on the yes mat for two seconds and they step back and if the answer is no to the questions and step one or no mat and step back and so our overall goal was to use technology as a way to make the conversation around privilege a little bit easier oftentimes it's extremely difficult to have so we thought that one of the best ways to do so is embedding that within the game and so you see here our participants had a score 50 and 30 we're kind of using the game as a mere a little bit on your life and now we're going down to zero we're going down okay counter clockwise you guys into each other one and tell me you names and tell me about this project wait okay yes okay I'm Brandon Anthony Rowland and this is the knob it's a very big knob and an LED and an LED very so if you as you turn the knob it is getting different we're going counterclockwise today we're trying to turn it off take turns to turn it fully off it's a pulls dimness yesterday under zero yeah yesterday we turned it on today we turn it off and yeah flick light right just keep on turning okay my arm is already exhausted holding this weight on the cameras point in me this is a bad idea anyway okay oh my god it was a nice quiet room ah here they are the gears ok tell me your name if you don't mind tell me your name and give you a quick description of your project my name is a tie and this is my musical gear table it's a table with gears and here's a different instrument marimba Tabriz beats you can change them it has anybody played this the way that surprised or yeah yeah yesterday was amazing someone played only the successor and it made really like an amazing sound and also a rapper came and I made a beat any breath Wow surprising and great thank you so much thank you are you really doing this I'm not doing every project how's the biggest Bennigan's like then we're just gonna get some shots over here cuz I know I may be able to I won't be able to wear this Wow what's up there just good the buzzing is my Christmas so if user want to make their own postcard they need to Yeah right you got a sport yeah hahaha this one do you want to print out so it can be any of these gifts yeah is it always Stephen Colbert no yeah let's look at some of the print down yes oh these are beautiful here comes this ticket okay we believe that it's going to come out yeah you can see all these I don't know I feel like we've waited we have to stay yeah I see it we can look at this project while we're waiting hi can you tell me your name tell me about your project hold on I'm gonna like yes there you go okay so this is a project basically when you walk in front of the camera you just with your arms and just like what you do and it kept you demonstrated for us great job okay print out by the way if anyone's watching a team okay there's the prints out okay all right walking around we're gonna go downstairs a little bit wanna tell me about this project tell me your name and tell me about your president hi I'm Nicole and doing here the traffic jam so this is a toy sound toy or music from health oh hey hey whatever you want to call it the idea is playing with the sounds of cars and creating like sound atmosphere having fun Larranaga so hard on me awesome great job thank you do that alright we get another musical performance right here okay can you tell me your name and tell me about your project is even and my progress and emotional life so it was that it can generate sounds by putting out a string throw your body this is a video of you performing live on stage over here yeah thank you so much all right all right everyone we are going into the stairway now I don't know if I'm gonna lose WiFi in here but there's probably some projects I missed up I guess I can change the camera now me there's probably some projects I missed upstairs because there's so my stamina is fading but there are several really fun buttocks downstairs in the lobby we're taking this sort of back stairwell here and I guess the stream has gone away and it will come back hopefully once I get some WiFi down there on my back and my back okay good still going down the stairs Oh hold on let's go through this doorway here second floor if you guys want to see where we are briefly in New York City this is the corner of Broadway and Waverly freshing Cobb coding train is not sponsored yet by freshman Co but someday let's keep going back this way we are now walking through it's probably like that was like a dance studio or a theater rehearsal room I'm taking the back stairs down to the lobby we start to hear the noise of the show see some projects that are down here merits aha hopefully the quality is going to come back everybody all right Eric you want to do you honor you want to demonstrate your projects hey you don't have to I can go check out some other things to come backer you wanted to tell me about so right now it's copper okay my name is when she me this is my project named at me it's a sound sculpture right now but in fact these instruments mounted to my body which generate sound on a song where goes through to this reverb delay and change the panel based on the faces and the image the camera is kicking right now this like all this imagery like a doll is like a faders to the sound the sound at the end we had something like a crazy glitch to this life is too this is video of you performing here right can people see this video on your website tell me about your project yes my name is Jessie Simpson together with my partner Ahmad we created a MIDI controller out of a cello so essentially the cello the note is picked up the contact microphone and then the frequency is analyzed in max/msp and then translated to a MIDI value and sent to Ableton Live where two software synthesizers are controlled series of knobs here that control different aspects of the sentence well we got some shots of is it or not this is to attract to send all your knobs and a series of checks arpeggiator pretty well good for me great job thank you this is a live stream right now there were approximately 230 people watching okay we're gonna try okay all right I'm gonna give it a try wild livestreaming Oh disco though is there anybody after we know that there's somebody up there yes they got it okay all right Oh Macarena you're gonna have to hold the camera yes I do know it's a little bit finicky this gimbal thing I'll do one more okay why don't you explain to the project the sound okay everybody okay so tell me your name and tell me about that project to do an installation installation in which we have to use the server to refresh our installation at a wetnap and we discover that every time people we're in front of the webcam and we opened the server we could talk to them and they thought it was a computer talking to them so we adapted that and we created this game that's called century in which people have to lock the word that we give them and they're chatting with a human normally so much fun could people actually hear the audio there I mean I might I might like I have this knife but it was probably more profitable as husband if I might come back nobody could hear that audio is perfect okay good to explain say your name was we're trying to make a new on the Chilean expression of Chinese instrument and will make you like play automatically thank you another detail so how much of the sound is it all analog the only thing that we're in the lobby we're gonna take a look at this giant heart oh actually while this is empty oh they're doing very well this is a live stream warning here before you say anything nearly in a minute I'm gonna ask you to explain the project I'm just gonna kind of mess around with it a little bit did you turn it off okay I'm sensing some musician the elevators here do I come back there you go there's everything just magnets and so what was different when you actually meaning it's magnetic so this is for the like music sound insulation and also it's kind of like capricious and moved by like Megadeth dislike is heading itself and then like the other maga is like something around and I can combine like like you know like boom boom a gonna make a different lady big bouncers in the recipe to the performance like not was like actually same setup with them like promise well like Emily likes people like play with the Magadan and places like make more like dressing the cake that you can combine the other and I can mmm yeah so I knew you like try you want to mess around with it a little bit what color the pingpong balls meant the like really make a like this is a video of you performing in right from night oh no that's a different project okay awesome great job Haley thank you alright I should let every know it I just got my 10% 10% battery warning so this stream is going to be wrapping up I am going to go outside into the freezing cold because why not is let's let's go outside into the streets of New York City and let's take a look at whoo okay this whole people won't run into me let's take a look at this project here this is a giant heart we walk down the street here I'm hopeful you're gonna lose WiFi okay going back inside and I'm going to good evening here we go get my here and ring back in buddy yeah they also make it know is that it's here one left left before I didn't design liberal but now the high score is like 4,000 can you explain the project yes some of your name my name is hung and this is my final project this it's name is into the darkness and it's a space exploring game I'll show you how now you see a little rocket on the screen and you can choose and your goal is to achieve the highest distance as possible and the reason why I want to make a controller like this is because nowadays people play games on keyboards and joysticks and Xbox controllers I wanted to make their control methods like more intuitive not because just what you do is what you saw on the screen because I lived with this rocket and the rocket goes up so it's like more intuitive and he likes you what yeah it's fun watching we get sick sometimes it doesn't yeah your name and tell me if he wants about your project course I'm sure yeah I'm a first year and this is artificial unintelligent it about robots trying to be like human failing miserably like they're in fact making because they're not human but they want to be human so badly they're all from different parts of the world and they're all gonna talk to you what you want this one is Jacques is Shawn Harry he's an artist when you listen to him and you understand he's a struggling artist look at him is no idea where to go what to do yes but he will try for you I'm so sorry we are she she she's from Brisbane she always want to be a pediatric nurse because she's a robot then she gotta have a scale that you gotta get like go of it and she trying to figure out okay baby to sleep but it's sort of impossible she was in and out it this is Danny Danny likes a nun he's a little old to be constantly shaking and he's wrapping himself in things you have no idea about but we will not for you and I will figure out where this case I can feel it so much personality would thanks guys this is live right now you just want to say hi hi again let's try this I'm going back to my office let's try a few more okay tell me your name tell me about this project phone game use machine learning library to Train how you interact move the puzzle so you want to try it yeah so now is training according to videos that I give it as an input so here you can see so this is going to be this is gonna be done for the day up for their rights you're playing against yourself I can play with someone especially whenever a threenight mine is gonna be great job thank you okay did you tell me your name and the 1 second 1 or 2 second version your project sure my name is Dan I'll bet at my project reaction where you're looking so if you're looking left it'll move to the left until I came right over to the right and it just uses your eyes well I need some footage of what I was actually doing okay thank you five she's gonna get you to explain this project to me okay first day your name and tell me how your but I'm funny but the question and I made it police to reflect on a normal piece which is 1984 there's a certain part in it which is the too many page which is about the 40 members are rebelling against the party's enemies for the 32 minutes so it might be for Luther is wearing a brainbased answer and the concentration they can destroy a mystical entity which is over there these are now sugar cube and sugar cube like your sugar and oil has like a certain effect to each other so because I used motor oil this time sugar after a few hours will start to melt very slowly on a canvas so the outcome is a painting jerk back here okay okay everyone all right I think that's gonna be it for today hold on I gotta turn this gimbal thing off this is what you can be a patron anybody wants to sign up for patreon I'll just show you guys a little behind the scenes here this is all the stickers getting ready to be mailed out a whole bunch of books being it getting ready to be mailed out some more books and boxes some preparation for some future machine learning videos and so yeah so that was boy an over two hours but the TP show I can manage uh Simon one of my loyal viewers Simon did request that I come back to my office and answer a few questions which I can't attempt to do so let me see what time is 515 so the bag the phone battery is gonna be dead pretty soon so one thing that all it hopefully happened is so you go this this vid this archive be left up forever if you can watch the whole twoandahalf hour thing I will try I to link in the video's description to all the projects and information about the projects it's pretty hard to do that but if you read in the comments a project that you're interested in and it's not there in the description please let me know I can try to find it or put you in touch with the students do you wanna hire somebody you saw do a project to do something all these are current students so I'm sure looking for exciting and interesting things to do I will be here on Thursday for the last livestream of the year with some actual coding tutorials I do I hope you just do coding just goofy fun whatever coding challenges for a few hours I'm gonna make that a processing fundraiser if you haven't made your processing foundation donation yet safe hold off donate live on Thursday and I will read your name live on the air and then when I get back in January which I don't know when will be exactly but sometime after the new year probably not the second or the third will be a few days in later that week I will start on the machine learning stuff so that's my project for the spring is to get back into that so if you have ideas for things that I should do on Thursday especially if you're in the patron group let me know and I see the design but I just saw slack message come through about kmeans so I might not do that on Thursday because that I might save that for the machine learning stuff I'm gonna do in January but I will certainly be getting to that particular problem any last questions anyone wants to ask I see that number of people mishima is it the same as AI well not exactly I'm sitting in my office here at New York University Tisch School of the Arts fourth floor ITP artificial intelligence is a very broad term and so it's machine learning and they there's a lot of Oh 10% battery remaining there's certainly a lot of crossover there but I really think about machine learning as the boy it's really hard to talk up you're doing this for two and a half hours the act of making sense out of data really and you're asking about my watch this is just a Fitbit blaze I kind of want to get one of those new ones though and what am I trying to say if artificial intelligence being an even a broader term just about computers appearing and simulating and being made a whole video about these different terms like do it now my mind is totally much for doing this live stream for two and a half hours where in the building is your place where I create the videos ah that's on the ninth floor in this building so I did not go up there but I will do I know young from OSU I do via the internet I don't know I always met in person but I'd you know we were talking about ya know I do get notifications on this computer though you're no hearing my notifications for every message until ah yeah I guess I could turn that off because that I need notifications for live well what's your favorite product possibly pick a favorite project I love so many of them thank you to some of the patrons I noticed alcaman particular moderating some of the chat cuz it get a little crazy here in this YouTube place and as soon as I end this the video I think will end up I'm gonna be doing word to back in JavaScript I teach at a program called ITP you can find out more about a called there's both an undergrad for a graduate program the graduate program is a twoyear master's hey and sean vann every director of graduate studies at the IMA program is just there in the chat so you could ask him your questions trying to beat this is I'm onna this is a oneminute 132 of this I I don't think I've made it to every project at the show but I'm completely exhausted now my battery is probably about five percent left what do I teach I mostly teach coding classes and you know I cost us that or about using computational media F for your own passions and interests I do not give the coding challenges to the students but they use them for their projects and examples as you might've seen one of them earlier use the starfield one but you just create their own work here so I don't give specific homework assignments that is live Eston thank you so much that the level of hearing messages like this thank you oh I don't know very much about view but I think I love you and Sarah Dresner who is a wonderful amazing programmer and teacher and creator does a lot of educational material and stuff around view her twitter name is going like sarah underscore you know you should look her up she's amazing after Susie yes okay the assessment we're past fail here and we talk about projects the undergraduate program will probably be different than that but the graduate program is pass/fail and the assessment is done through discussion and feedback okay um so thank you everyone I think III have a lot of videos already about nodejs copyright free music asking in the chat what kind of fancy effects do I have here I just have to try this okay to use these effects before I go Oh glamour no I think the dance party is the best one who bubbles okay all right uhhuh so I don't know how to turn these off so anyway thank you guys for tuning in to this um this was a lot of fun to do and I hope to see you all on my final livestream of 2017 on Thursday unless something goes wrong I don't do it on Thursday back I do it after the new year but that's my plan as of now so enjoy the rest of your week happy holidays Happy New Year all that sort of stuff and if you're looking for a lastminute holiday gift you can go to amazon.com slash shop / Dakota tree I think or greatness for any I don't know I feel I see how other people plugging stuff so I feel this obligation to do it but there's really no reason for me thanks everybody and I'm gonna hit this button that stops the livestream now goodbye mmhmm heart hug oh that's oh and nobody made any gifts of my net neutrality whole shtick thing so come on I'm waiting for that somebody go back and look at one of my live streams take care of that okay all right goodbye everybody by the way these are new glasses they're actually the same as my old glasses but I was cleaning them the other day and they snapped in half because they were so old I just went back to the store bought another pair put the same lenses in exciting stuff little tits all right goodbye everybody yes
