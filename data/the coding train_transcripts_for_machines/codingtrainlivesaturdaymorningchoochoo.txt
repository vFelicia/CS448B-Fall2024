my mic was on there might have been on this whole time Sound Check 1 2 3 how is this audio I have a different setup autotuned and the internet will fix that drunk good morning and welcome to the coding train on a Saturday April somethingorother I have no idea what date it is Tai has no meeting anymore how are you doing I'm okay I'm doing just fine thank you for asking that's very kind of you let's all ask each other I you there might be nobody next to you you might be there might be look little small people running around below your feet animals climbing on you I don't know what your situation is but turn to the wall turn to the chair turn to the small people turn to the person on your left on your right and say how are you and from some appropriate distance give them some care let's care for each other in this very strange time my voice is a little bit quiet I'm being told so let me see if I can turn that up I I've adjusted things in this setup which I think are vastly improved I hope welcome this is the coding train I hear the small people running frolicking about in where I live I've closed all doors I've locked the room actually it's kind of nice when they're in here helping me but today they didn't seem to want to do that this roblox thing it's very a very attractive fun thing to play all day long let me tell you is there coding in roblox somebody let me know alright I gotta figure out I got to deal with the volume this is a very easy thing for me to fix because I have a new audio interface with eight what do you call this thing that you turn a dial perhaps so here it goes it is turning to the right to the right up higher and higher it goes did that seem to help I'm also speaking let's see if that fixes it a little bit we'll see how that does out there be quiet in the hallways Lua I'm being told robots uses low alright so so I'm I'm I'm kind of settling into things here I don't know if you remember the last time I streamed which was I think about two weeks ago I probably spent the first 45 minutes just like barring my anxious soul and like starting to sweat and not being sure what I was doing and feeling like I'm doing it all wrong and that's okay I think a lot of people are feeling that these days I know that I am I'm but I I think I've got my act together a little bit more and so I want to talk about what my I want to start today's livestream with talking about what my plans are at least for the next 24 hours that's about as far ahead I could plan if I'm being perfectly honest a bit louder still my voice is fine now yes it's a nice volume okay I'm gonna keep it like this for at least the next five or ten minutes and then if I see a bunch of messages that I need to adjust again I will adjust oh I have my stream open somewhere and I'm now listening to myself from like 30 seconds ago let me mute this this computer is muted now okay much better okay much better okay so first of all if you're new here welcome my name is Dan this is the coding dream I don't know why it's called the coding train to be perfectly honest with you my sidekick Gloria pickle who is a an animal of the canine variety is I think confused why I closed all the doors come here Wednesday hi hey you don't bark this is the sweetest little dog that you can't see right now I got to get a camera on her but I'm just gonna open this door so she can get out if she wants so I I am a person in the world who also spends a lot of time on the Internet I make video tutorials about coding I have a lot of difficulty coding I find it to be very hard complicated and fun and creative and I try to share all those feelings that I have about coding with you on this channel and in the past I've done sort of like livestream lectures I've done things like coding challenges I make sequence tutorial content I make oneoff videos and I think what I'm now going to attempt to do in this transition to work from home is I think I'm gonna treat my live streams as purely just I want to do this forever just live streams I'm just here live doing stuff talking to you coding things teaching little topics answering questions showing your work that kind of thing so no longer am I going to consider things that I do in the live stream to be edited out in two separate videos I think this will make the experience of watching the live stream a little more pleasurable because I won't have this like artificial starting and stopping I might come back and do that again when I'm back in that other recording studio that I have or I might do it again next time but for today I'm really try feel really just like free I feel free like I could just hang out code talk to you and just enjoy the nextgen it's literally just gonna be two hours because at noon I promised my children all sorts of fun activities that I'm gonna do with them well it's likely me taking a nap while they play more roblox but no hopefully I'm gonna be a good dad we're gonna play card games I'm gonna read to them and we're gonna do it art craft project it's so hard I just you know after all of you out there who are feeling inadequate and you're not doing it right I'm here with you I'm right there with you so that's the plan and so today oh yeah everybody is so kay okay secret mystery is telling me if I don't turn my volume up they're going oh and we have a new member so I want to talk about what what I'm doing with the membership program also all right let me try to up the volume one more time okay okay okay I hear you I hear you I'm gonna take more drastic measures okay okay okay I'll definitely not deleting this after it ends never say never but let me I'm just gonna mute myself for a second okay while I check some settings on this testing testing 1 2 3 random numbers I should be reading there we go I see myself up in the yellow I think this is better now so I think I've kept those couple viewers that we're threatening to leave is dad I mean you probably should leave if the low volume is the thing father you'll probably do a lot more stuff that's gonna bother you you're not gonna like but hopefully now the volume is better so just let me know if I'm peaking now because I earned it up quite a bit I'm gonna turn this okay hopefully I'm in good good shape now alright crystal clear thank you everybody alright so I think I talked about what the channel is what I'm kind of planning to do I don't I really want to have a regular time I don't know if you guys saw but I don't you all who are watching saw trying to not say you guys so much I don't know if all of you watching saw this but there's a wonderful YouTube channel I'm like the biggest fan it's called three blue one brown and everybody's getting a livestream thing these days and three blue one Brown is math tutorials and all sorts of beautiful animations and things I try to make a lot of videos that are inspired from that content did alive streets that's just like you know I've been doing this for years and I could barely get it together and have like the sound right to have a plan know what I'm doing get us like a fixed time going round first live stream beautiful quality impeccable amazing regular time banner with a time schedule I mean you should if you if you want to it was wonderful so I'm excited to see more people live streaming maybe there are some more collaborations and things that I can do also there were 25,000 people watching a live stream math tutorial with like a nope and Ted that was like blew my mind which is great and according to this little button over here there are 439 of you tuning in right now so hello and thank you so much let me talk about the membership program so I've been feeling weird about having patreon and members and things like that ever since I started doing it not so weird that I stopped having it you know the there's a few things one I should be clear just to be clear and transparent I have a fulltime job I'm very lucky and privileged right now especially to still have my job who knows maybe there's a lot of issues with higher education in the cost of higher education we'll see what happens throughout the next year and so on and so forth but um so I teach fulltime at New York University a lot of the tutorials that I make I use in my courses there I think of them as the equivalent of how somebody who's a teacher might work on a textbook and I'm just sort of making videos so I have been going back and forth about putting ads on my videos in terms of monetizing them on YouTube sometimes I do sometimes I don't my sort of like rule of thumb right now is if it's videos that I'm that I'm using in a course or that are physically designed for other curriculum I I take them the ads off because so that teachers can show them in their classroom without or assign them to students without them having to see ads so that's currently where I am in terms of that funding aspect of the channel the other funding aspect of the channel is patrons and members so I'm I have a there's a little button somewhere on the screen that says join Cobie is asking me a question which I'm just going to say yes to okay moving on so membership this is my preferred way to fundraise for the channel because it doesn't involve having to use advertising in the industrial surveillance economy but so but I feel particularly weird right now and a lot of people are struggling and there's a lot of need in the world right now so what I've decided to do for anyone who's think I've been thinking of joining as a member the benefits are in theory I mail you something like a coding trade notebook or some stickers which I have over here at some point I'm gonna make these laser etched train whistles but I have lost access to my laser cutter so that will be coming soon but what I am going to what I'm doing this month and thank you I got this idea from a podcast I listened to Rob has a podcast is I am raising money for thank you to Christina as you oh you don't see I'm not I forgot that I'm not showing you my screen thank you Christina Joo I am who turned me on to this particular charity mask force which is attempting to raise money for PPE personal protective equipment for New York City which is my local community here i so i any any any new members who join in throughout the month of April whatever proceeds I get from that I will donate to mask force NYC and then I will also match that donation so I'll be doing that for the month of April I made a sort of donation in advance glad that that need is so great right now and so we'll see if it catches up to that and then if it goes above I will donate additional money and that's what I'm doing for the month of April and maybe you will but you know honestly if you if you donate directly that's a much better path doesn't need to like have the fees taken out and go through me and all that nonsense but so that that's just one thing I wanted to mention that I am doing for this particular month so and one of the things that I would like to do in my new sort of plan I want to do more things that are interactive with the smaller kind of group of supporters so I'm gonna try to do a monthly discussion group so if you've been thinking about joining as a member that's something that we will do once okay bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla we must begin today's coding train with the ceremonial reading of the random number book if you're a musician I could use some more music I got this wonderful let's try something relaxing we begin today on the coding train with the numbers forty thousand seven hundred and forty three thirty nine thousand six hundred and seventy one seven thousand eight hundred and twelve and my personal favorites forty two thousand two hundred and ninety three we will continue onward forth in our lives programming with our random numbers with forty one thousand five hundred and thirty nine forty thousand nine hundred and ninety eight ninety five thousand eight hundred and twenty nine eleven thousand four hundred thirty six and forty thousand eight hundred ninety and sixteen thousand four hundred and six don't you just feel better I know I feel better I always feel better when I curl up cozy with a book playing some soft quiet music and reading it quietly out loud to four hundred and eighty seven people which is down that's down from where I started which I completely understand frankly because I mean I wouldn't keep watching this I would tell you to go outside but you should stay home usually I like to say don't watch this go outside be with people enjoy the nature the sunshine the rain explore but actually right now please stay home stay at home be safe okay but you could turn this off and go I don't know do jumping something else relaxing at home it doesn't involve a screen but if you stay here I am I am I'm here with you we're gonna do some coding I'm gonna do some stuff very soon so my first segment in my new trying to be organized I even made an agenda here so here's some agenda oh I hi so check check we did hi all right so hi is done now your work so I'm gonna do something new if you aren't aware let me switch over to here if I go to and I've changed where I am I'm in the bottom right of your screen I'm over here I'm in the bottom right of your screen so which doesn't work for my pointing at the code anymore but since I use the p5 web editor a lot I think this layout will be better and I do have a green screen so I could keep myself out but I don't know right now I'm not doing that all right if you go to the coding train com you will think like boy this person really never makes any videos because the last one here is from March 14th but it's okay I'm working on stuff first of all let me you know I in case there are a few people who are totally new here if you are a beginner never programmed before this code program with p5 GS these are the videos that I would suggest let me just move this over here maybe I don't know I'm not so good at this layout camera thing I'm working on it so these are the videos that will get you started if you've never programmed before but what I what most people have at least find the channel through or engage with the most are these coding challenges and I can talk more about coding in the Cabana in a little bit so these are the coding challenges every single coding challenge has a page for it if I go to to the challenge and it has a list here of community contributions these are my monitors over there I can't I can't I have to move myself back I don't think I can take it I don't think I can take being on this side deep breath everybody it's all gonna be ok I have two lights today a light coming from this side and a light coming from this side so I probably look a little extra pretty do I look deep you not really please make a frame tutorials so so what I have done in the past is without any real organized organizing principle but sometimes a week after I do a coding challenge and publish this webpage I'll go and click through a bunch but I've missed a lot of your contributions and then sometimes new come in for projects that were made a year ago so thank you to many people in the coding trained supporter community who support in so many different ways but in particular a big shout out and thank you to David Schneider who just I need to open up my direct messages and discord for a second by the way if you haven't joined the coding train discord there goes a whip the camera that's a good idea I could flip it so that when I point this way yeah yeah that's not a bad idea so let me look for the direct message and let me get this up okay so what we have that is new is this particular wheel so I'm obsessed with wheel spinning and luck and random numbers and probability and so I I as it as as the sort of one of the I think I've said organizing principle now twice in the last like two minutes but one of my organizing principles for how I like to do things is to not make any decisions and let the magic wheel spinning wheel tell me what to do so it's a little unclear for you here and maybe there's some of you would let maybe there's a way after today that David Schneider can post this as a github repo if it's not already and allow people to contribute to improve this but this is a rant wheel that when I spin it I won't do that right now this is based I think on actually some code that I wrote at one point once for one time or another and now I'm looking this direction okay I'm sorry everybody this was like I thought this was gonna make sense but I can't do it just you know please hold I can't I can't take it people I can't take it whoa oh I feel so much better oh my god oh oh oh I feel so much better oh they move this to the side here oh oh my goodness okay as I was saying very professionally in my proper live to teaching tutorial livestream where I have a person who knows about things and talks to you to tell you things this wheel is drawing from a spreadsheet and that spreadsheet has been carefully curated I think I know that Kobe won a coding trained supporter and viewer also contributed a lot to this I hope to put this together of all of your contributions so every contribution that's on the website that I haven't shown before that is also a valid URL is now could every time i refresh this page whoops it's going to pick randomly from that and I have a wheel so we're going to start the problem one thing I think would be an improvement here is maybe having people's names because then at least if you're watching you could know like oh I'm on the wheel right now but right now you're just gonna have to like wonder which number are you and it's I I recognize there's a little bit of an absurdity here because I'm gonna spin this like digital wheel and I have a literal book of a million random digits over there all right here we go I need a wheel spinning sound effect which I should just have this too but I will go with this all right here we go we're going to see somebody's community contribution and it is going on to number one number one are you out there number one number one oh you're my favorite viewer number one come and give me a not a 6 feet away the camera by the way I just want everybody to know so you feel safe and secure at home this camera is approximately six feet away from me I measure a few more inches just for just to be overly cautious okay no here we go ah so I think what I do now is I click on this button remove and view selected it says remove and view selected and when I click on that it will take me to the page so I have selected ray casting with mais generation contributed by Grilli 86 so if you're wondering first what I can do is I can just click here this is the particular coding challenge rendering ray casting where I took a twodimensional space and put a little particle in it shot rays out of the particle and measured the distance to various obstacles and then attempted to render it as a 3d scene all with 2d canvas I believe in the browser something like that so we could see let's just for a reference I'll just click here this is my I don't remember how I did this oh yeah this is this is the code from the example and what does this slider do the field of view oh yeah that's fun or the distance or something a field of view yeah okay so that's the original code and the original challenge and now we're going to see a Grilli 86's version ray casting game with maze generation okay so what do I do so one thing I mean one thing I always encourage people to do is think about your project if there's any being self documenting or maybe even if you're submitting a contribution you could link to say a post about it word there's a writeup and explanation that might have some instructions but I think this what this I can see there's a button here so I can really strap like this that looks like there's a button every time I click the button oh oh wait a second I understand this now and I just I shouldn't I shouldn't give this like feedback that now I'm feeling like was totally wrong because I think there's a little magic to be figuring out how to do this I think the idea is that I have to figure out the maze like I'm not seeing it but I can walk around and slowly reveal it let's see can I make it through this is so cool you audience are like the most creative people and that's a dead end I wonder if this also used anything from my maze generation examples are this is a custom maze generation I'm gonna make it No yeah there we go what do we think turn yeah this is what it's got to be it I'm thinking I'm going this way I'm a completionist so a one thing that's gonna be an issue we might only look at like one community contribution every street because I can't bear to not finish things is this like a secret like no there's probably like some secret way to see the maze but I don't want to know it what it is I want to solve this other way that is a really awesome project so first of all I love the interactivity here I love the clever sort of idea of like oh we could use this rendering raycasting example but not reveal the actual map itself so my whole thing was really like a debug view and this is just taking a very simple idea the other thing is like there's a big challenge here which is how to like generate a maze every single time it looks like the color is random so uh what could be fun is to think about are there are there little things you have to like collect along the way or there are other types of ways that you can think about this this world or this terrain or this so there's a lot I think more possibilities here and I think this was really terrific so congratulations to Grilli 86 which let's click over to see what there there are pages croud blocked oh I recognize this one you can take a look there's a lot so looks like there's lots of code examples here that are similar or if not based on stuff that I do on my channel so thank you well for this wonderful contribution big train whistle to you and we're moving on so now I'm gonna close this and we're gonna do another one hmm okay I think that I'm gonna do this until like for another ten minutes I have two other things on my agenda I know one takes exactly 15 minutes we might like to do it twice sold eight thirty minutes and the other thing will be at least thirty minutes so okay let's go here here we go round and round it goes where it lands nobody knows okay we're landing on spot who is amis hey wait a second here Grilli 86 did you hack the wheel nothing is there something fishy going on here maybe really 86 just made a lot of contributions and this is just the universe is telling me something that I need to feature Grilli 86 are you watching by any chance so oh thank you for David for the for tell me who the new members are I'm gonna sort of definitely want to thank them in a second so let me just look at this well I'm gonna I'm gonna kind of gloss over this one because as we can see this look at this so this by the way if you're wondering what is the process for developing an interactive art project a game a piece of software one of the ways that I have always worked and found to be most helpful to my process is by breaking a larger problem down into lots of sub components and working on them separately and then working later to assemble them and so we can see an example of that here where here's a the actual maze generation itself without without the Ray casting so nice to see that like by just serendipitously that we got to this other one alright let's spin the wheel again oh and I have a reset numbers button I didn't realize that that's cool maybe we could have some kind of like eating the slices of pie themselves there could be like a preview or like the person's name or something because I fix numbers as much as I love numbers and as much as I sleep at night with this random digits book under my pillow curled up cozy with it alone whatever never mind stop asking me about various sleeping arrangements that are coming on to this house but as much as I do love my random numbers I feel like a connection to the people who are here on this wheel would be nicer to have okay here we go rigged yes the wheel is rigged here we go remove and view selected ah crime spiral phyllotaxis the original challenge is phyllotaxis this is actually a pretty by the way if you're new here and you're looking for a good getting started kind of algorithmic generative art project to tinker with this is a really nice one it's just involve some simple math and playing with color to create this spy phyllotaxis pattern so this is a pretty good fairly beginner friendly example to work with so let's see what Sam Lee got themselves up to with the prime spiral phyllotaxis like to see the use of code pen here oh okay so I think what's going on if I'm correct and there's something I think I believe it's called a ulam spiral I believe what's going on here is that there is a number line that's spiraling around and that prime numbers are being highlighted in some way and that this is a particular technique that creates a visualization like this that just the just the design choices here have given it a very like Spacey almost like constellation like quality to it quite lovely alright Arnab is reminding me that in the phyllotaxis video I said my favorite angle was 137 and a half and it is today still true today that is my favorite angle alright great work wonderful work thank you Sam Lee for sharing this I should have like a timer going on that gives me the sense of how much longer I have let's take a look at Sam Lee's page this is Sam Lee's code pen you can see there are a lot of interesting projects going on here I'm very curious about this one called mom's spaghetti and here we go so we're going to close this and we're gonna do another one here we go spinning this wheel ah I'm being told breaking news here breaking news I actually have a thing where I could get breaking news I'm being told that three blue one Brown has a video on the prime spiral alright so let's take a look at this one oh hey rigged I've always think that I'm being funny it's not actually and I mean I'm not funny anything but as the YouTube comments make it very clear to me you are not funny stop trying to be funny by the way I'm not trying to be funny I don't know what I'm trying to be I'm just being me you gotta be me so David Schneider the creator of this wheel system himself caress the a star amazed solver there's a lot of contributions related to the maze stuff here I wonder if that's just coincidence art there's something going on here but this is this by the way this coding challenge I don't know why but it is it was made quite a while ago and it is just on the top like it's being suggested all over the place oh it's really sort of funny to you that if I showed you my YouTube analytics right people are watching this video like a crazy but only for about one minute so I know that's fairly typical if YouTube is like weirdly suggesting some random video to let people who wouldn't actually be interested that that amount of time they watch it would go down but it's very extreme so anyway this is a wellknown computer science pathfinding algorithm called a star this is actually I think it's four or five part series it's a pretty complex coding project we can take a look I don't know if this is gonna send me to the finished well let's refresh here yeah so this is a visualization of the astar algorithm playing out oh there's my discord behind me let me just which is not that big of a deal but let me just put that away well I move this over and then here we come back um so you can see that it's making this kind of like an obstacle course and whoops I'm not really good with my buttons here it's making this obstacle course and finding the finding a oh stop showing me discord I think I will just quit out of it there we go I mean there's nothing private there I just you know so which I love about this is often has this like really like almost like lightning like quality to it the way that it's showing different paths and jumping around between them and there's this very jagged path that it's falling so interestingly enough I feel like by thinking about another way of visualizing this and not showing the background pattern we could create like a nice Lightning simulator with it there's a project you could do go take that and run with it but I'm not here to show you once again my video we're here to look at the astar may solver by David Schneider let's take a look let me move this back over I think I don't ah so what I like about this it looks like we've got an interface here where I could enter a certain number of rows and columns so let's try let's leave it at the default right now looks like this is the start and this is the end what we're seeing a lot of maze solving today that's the unknown theme who animate generation right by the way this is from a different coding challenge now I forget what this one was called but I have a maze generation coding challenge I could Google and find it I'm sure somebody could share it in the chat or something but this is a particular algorithm for generating the maze pattern which we're now seeing and then restart oh but I don't let's not anam so now the question is how do I get it to solve the maze what's what happens next complete maze there's the button down here complete maze click that and there it is solving the maze wonderful ten minutes have passed so Simon oh and then it like back tracks and shows me the path oh this is awesome great job actually interestingly enough I actually have used my maize generation code to generate in processing PDF mazes that I have printed out and given to my kids to solve in between you know playing roblox that is for you know 30 seconds at a time so so thank you David this is great I always love seeing these projects that have an interface like I'm always curious if I change this to like five by five what do I see um I guess if I hit restart oh and I get like a tiny one but if I can do this scale if I do like 100 by 100 I change the scale to five whoa look at this let's make the scale ten and then can we solve this maze all right so now we see this little this little character moving around and trying to solve this maze super fun all right great work okay let's do one more I'm oh I'm over time but let's do one more we're gonna see if if we get something that doesn't have to do with me so this would be really hard to do but I have some other feature ideas for this now what is the wheel could check and if it's already added a contribution by a certain person it doesn't re add that contribution tricky because how do you know you really don't actually do it like a database with users and accounts or anything so it's kind of impossible to match but that would be an interesting thing was that really loud the drumbeat what happened uhoh I'm seeing the chat I did something terrible Oh maybe because I caused the sound in the middle sorry everybody sorry usually I try to hit this button which fades it out okay so let's see what this one number 10 is it is tictactoe with invincible AI okay a challenge accepted so this is the the challenges tictactoe that's a video I made on just creating a little simple tictactoe game that you could check out certainly and where did I lose this one and I also made a video with the minimax algorithm but let's see what happens when I scratched my head something else went crazy oh it was the mic sorry that's weird oh I mean I could this interfere no it's this is my mic here I don't know all right I will I apologize I hope that you're okay alright let's take a look at this one alright here we go I will beat the invincible tictactoe ai oh yeah you can't beat me ah shoot I lost [Laughter] [Laughter] alright here we go I gotcha yeah yeah tie tie is kind of like a win for me because otherwise I lose I'm clearly not gonna win thank you very much thank you I have beaten the invincible AI ha ha me four or five tries I am I I you know I I I do enjoy myself a good solid game of tictactoe whoo all right that was fun everybody cheers all right thus ends the portion Oh a little C music for my different segments now you know like it's time for it's time for community contribution uh okay so now I'm going to move on to my next segment and I'm quite hesitant to do this for a variety of different reasons there so a lot of so the coding train community is mostly found in discord but just a shout out to CJ who was in the chat I know a Cody garden with CJ hasn't been doing a lot of this on his YouTube channel or twitch stream a lot of people been enjoying this new website called kodan game or coding aim code Cody and game cod and get gommi I don't know how to say it but it's coding coding game calm this is not any sort of sponsorship I actually have been in touch with them because they emailed me and said like hey you might find this fun maybe it will be a sponsorship someday looking at you koko dying gummy gummy but I thought I would try this out it is a website that has different coding puzzles and different ways you can kind of like compete against each other to either like finish the puzzle quickest or write the shortest amount of code let me tell you something I'm really I feel like competition the idea of competing or doing things the fastest is completely antithetical to the to the philosophy and point of view of this channel creativity fun enjoyment collaboration play all of those are I think the the the ways to engage with each other as humans through code and computation and stuff like that so and and I think the good news is people will so I want to like we're like reduce the level of competition kind of like thinking here and just kind of have fun with it I think the good news is I will lose every single one I probably won't be able to figure out the puzzle I'm actually a really quite bad so and and that will help I think ease everybody is anxiety or feelings and let's just have some fun with this so what I'm going to do is this is something you can participate in but I'm just as a kind of trial run here to get started with what I'm going to do right now is I'm gonna create just please hold I'm gonna create a clash of code game and how do I do this compete practice oh wait there is a thing called practice practice puzzles I could just do the puzzles but can people not join the puzzle I think I need to do compete for people to join right all right well will do compete clash of code I think that's what I'm looking to do clash of code join a clash hold on I don't know why I'm not showing this to you 5 to 15 minutes max I don't want to join a clash I want to create aa create a clash Oh Oh start a private clash David is asking me I guess I die I should have thought to do that one of my new innovations is I can have moderators who are watching and participating talk to me and well let's get that set up for next time because I don't I think I can figure this out so I'm gonna start a private clash and I'm clicking there ok so now I have the link to this and what I'm going to do is I am going to paste this into the discord live chat where's the so this is going I'm going out to supporters and members first and where's the live chat channel I'm gonna tag supporter so everyone gets a notification and there you go so so I'm gonna pull this back up and we should start to see people joining so these are people in the oh whoops coding trained community see CJ is there a lot of names that you recognize that you may recognize from various community contributions and things so we're gonna attempt to do this cloud starts in one minute I didn't even configure it I didn't even do anything to configure it if somebody wants to paste this into the I'm touching my face a lot yes sorry if somebody wants to paste this into the YouTube chat we can get a few more people joining or you can just you know I know type out this URL it won't take you very long just you know memorize that and type it out so because it's starting in 40 seconds here all right so we're gonna see what happens I actually I barely used this so I don't really know exactly what's going to happen but we're all going to compete to solve some coding puzzle oh it's beeping at me 23 seconds okay reverse mode you have to guess what to do by observing the provided set of tests so interesting so hello world turns into drool Elul how much time do I have by the way 15 minutes thank goodness hello hello world turns into la la word jump turns into pee oh okay what's shuffling the letters is it shuffling them a particular way pu j m d dr w is it just shuffling then it's got to be a specific kind of shuffle though right uh all right well let's see what happens here so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript can I make this font much bigger I don't know how I'm just gonna zoom in so I think the idea here is this code reads in the input and then what I could do is I can just I can get all of the letters in an array by saying split think if I just do split in JavaScript it'll give me all of the letters in an array can I just like console.log that in this so let's see like what happens if I run this yeah so we can see I got everything in an array so now I could shuffle that array is there a shuffle builtin shuffle function what's the rules here am i match to look up stuff on the internet it starts from the end people are telling me D no because this one doesn't iterates over letters and adding new letters to the right and left alternatively I don't understand that you can do array from okay well hold on let me at least just well so it's clearly not shuffling take every other letter from the end dr w le8 and then the other way but why is this one start with an L that's not the letter from the end d RW l h e o but it went back we went the O because maybe this is even one two three four five six seven eight nine ten and this is odd so let's first say if letters dot length modulus so if it's even maybe I do it one way so so I want a new string so new s then I want to say for let I equals zero okay I guess I can do four I know I like to before every character in letters but I need I would like to have an iterator hmm okay okay so let's but the timer is pressure si si but you everybody else has finished this already all of you viewers are so good at this coding thing there's like lots of people watching and I'm trying to code some sort of algorithm it doesn't have to do with even odd no all right well let me just do it for the firt let me get the first one right so the first one is clearly the last letter so I want to create a counter is zero and I guess I could remove things from this array Wow and then so let's have the counter be letters dot length minus one so that's at the end then I want to say while counter is greater than or equal to zero say the new string is equal to splice out and let's just call this eye splice out that letter and then splice out that letter and then so there's lots of messages going on in the chat I have to just not look at it and then I equals and then all I need to do is then iterate over the rest of what's left iterate over the rest of what's left and add those characters in and then print that why does this give me attempting to override knooow that's a constant let okay all right let's see what happens here so this is my idea I take all the letters I go to the end and I start taking them off every other one and then I add the rest back in in order and we'll see what happens try okay so that something bad happened failure found bracket expected this does this splice not do what I think it's going to do letters dot length minus one letters dots place I take one go back by two all the patterns alternate from center left to right wait I just want to get this thing to work even though it's not right right dr Duff you know it's getting so excited to see everybody solutions and how elegant nice they are puj like why didn't this work I have a blank string I made them all I made it into an array new but the array is new S is not an array new s is a string people are talking to say new s join look at this this should be a single we print new s and I like bracket Oh Oh what it made this what that I got what what print new s dr bracket what oh because that print is there it thinks that's the output oh I don't understand how this works so it doesn't look at the last print it looks at whatever prints you do there needs to be like a debug thing Oh to debug use it says it right here way to read instructions so the debug messages you should use console error the answer with console log yeah it was correct oh wait I ran out of time [Laughter] oh I'm really bad at this oh yeah what's giving me an ADD I'm not interested mmm okay now what do I do did I run out of time no I still have five minutes it just was like beeping at me okay this was correct this was not correct found this but it expected this which is that in Reverse see I think it's like it's just reversing it if it's why is it reversing this one but not that one is it because it's an odd number I think it's because it's an odd number people said no to that but that's what I think it is so how do I reverse is there like a string reverse is that a function so if s dot length modulus two is one a new s equals new s dot reverse that worked Oh No found nothing new s reverse is not a function oh come on it's a there's a array function add the letters to the left or right sequential sequentially yeah so there is a way to reverse an array so I could just say up top if I could do it here then I could say letters equals letters reverse why what's wrong with this attempting to override letters which is a constant yeah it's not a constant anymore people correct No found h LW Rd oh I can't reverse I have to reverse it after I have to reverse it after okay so I could split it again okay I could this is so ridiculous I'm so this is so funny what I'm gonna do I really need a bigger font so you could see this I I'm gonna write the most we're gonna see all sorts of elegant amazing code that people do if it's one let's let's split it up again and reverse let's split it up again in Reverse and then say new s equals letter stop join and then so this should be taking it oops making it into an array reversing the array and then joining it back into a string and I'm reusing variables and doing all sorts of terrible stuff but I like it correct No found e lol what hold on oh I don't have it right just start with the second last letter oh that's what it is second l l o L e H okay that's much better okay so I see that's what it is of course of course it's not reversed I I rely let's see so now what I can do is oh i reversed it up there also I reversed it in too many places but it's actually just a second to last letter that's what it is if if it's odd then then I and there'd be like a really nice way of doing this based on Oh based on the modulus itself so minus 1 minus s dot length modulus to look at this look at this fanciness look at that fanciness oh yeah that's gonna do it I think okay I like my solution I like my solution look at that it's so nice it's very weird and I I guess I have a minute left so I could kind of like adjust it and make it better and nicer but let's look at other people's so I'm gonna hit submit and we can see here I guess I guess the the the metric here is how fast it was done so I think that I who spent 40 minutes should get a prize for spending the most time thinking about it was very good very thoughtfully and we can look at people's code so let's go click through everybody's code that's kind of the interesting thing let's look at s Tim's code who did this in Python in one minute and 55 seconds okay so now I'm really getting a clue into a way that makes it first of all you know I'm not a big Python user programmer but sometimes you just see this Python code and you're like oh wow it's just so beautiful I must look at it just soak it into my eyes into my brain so you can see here a a not knowing Python looks like s is the strength string a is every index into that string because a modulus 2 is 1 if a modules 2 is 1 oh you could just take it that makes sense you could be putting characters on the end or the beginning based on whether you're even or odd within the string and then you can compile a string like that so this would be interesting to rewrite this in JavaScript this way okay there we go next we're gonna go to DT six look at this with a join and reversed and all my so this is the other thing I mean I think there is a lot of fun to this and there's certain value in the sort of puzzle solving and the enjoyment of like reducing the number of characters but for me i optimize my code writing to be very long and to be as to explain what it's doing as much as possible so so but it's nice to see all these others possibly here we go CJ a professional code clasher in ah this is very smart okay this I can relate to so this makes a lot of sense basically looking at you can use for each odo for each with an array so splitting the same same technique as me splitting the string then using for each instead of my weird for of loop and then with for each oh you get the lead and index I love that that is so quiet I never think to use for each as many of you know from watching but I never think to use it but there's such a benefit of using of getting the iterator and then if it's an even letter you push it at the end unshifted to the beginning boy I did mine in such a weird nonsense school readability is the word I was looking for Thank You Bruno so this is great Thank You CJ for this it is you know I this is a really nice thing to see I just unknown the one thing I don't have at my fingertips is what all the arrays are string functions are so I guess you know is this should be treated like an open book exam I mean there's no reason why I shouldn't look up what they what what the array of string functions are okay we've got Kobe who did there's also in JavaScript read line split joins split that I don't understand why is there a split by a space then a join then a split again rules you can look up stuff you can take your time you shall have fun everyone is a winner even if zero percent of the test works every I know truer words have never been spoken Thank You Kobe for these wonderful rules these should be the rules okay thank you Peter for your very kind feedback also explaining saying this is nice to have of kind feedback in the chat that I can see every once in a while keeps me going here what are we timewise I know my my I am 1115 I've got till noon I've promised family time from noon on for the rest of the day so we're good we're good I could do one more of these oh no no we'll see so I Kobe is typing so maybe I'll get an explanation here and then this is going every other pushing pushing them into two separate arrays reversing one of the arrays concatenated them and then joining it back cool I kind of don't fully get why this works but I it would be it would did III can an under I can I can get a sort of like a sense of it but I would love to like work this out pencil and paper in case there's multiple words the split and removes them ah okay so this was just Kobe being overly considering other cases that or that that didn't seem to be a part of the test but if there had been multiple words this is kind of splitting them up separately and removing the spaces thanks for that okay let's look at galva Bart tissue I should have gone in the reverse order but okay and then this is some more Python so I don't actually know what this means because I don't know Python somebody in the chat will hopefully explain it but that must be doing something very clever here and we can see this is this very similar idea of concatenating the array based on even an odd which characters are which okay Eugene Oh Bruno wonderful work I can't see your code if you don't hit share code at the end I believe and then das ji let's also in JavaScript let's look oh I like this this is like this is the code I like first of all is this an umlaut it's hard to see cuz the font is so tiny but I love that red line split and then this is very much more similar to mine depending on even or odd concatenated up together reversing it and then going through it again what's that beeping in my ear coat clash just like beeps every once in a while what's going on with that what's up with that and then console logging that awesome cool okay you know what would be fun for me is a versions of these that are like reproduce this drawing or reproduce this animation that's would be a fun project that I mean we don't know if we're gonna like build a coding game competitor just as a coding community but I would really love that in terms of using p5.js and working on like algorithmic visualization to sort of like see like give me a Mondrian painting and let me try to like write some code it's like running tests and that sort of thing I you know you could do like pixel by pixel checking but in a way it would just be more of like general creative output okay oh I missed there's more okay I gotta keep oh I was i I didn't realize that I was oh I didn't hit share my code so share my code we all saw mine let's look at the David which has another similar Python version Arnab which is a much simpler way of doing what I did which is going from starting from the last character and then going back to the first character and oh but this one didn't work okay so let's look at our knobs and David's also I didn't work so that's interesting so that shows you if they didn't work we can little sort of look and figure out so I think this is the issue this is where I started and Coby is people are giving me information about the Python so maybe I wonder if I can pull give me a second I'm just going to pull up your messages because those would be nice to see so let me some other so hold on a second I'm pulling a discord for a second and so Simon Says s negative one reverses an array so that's a some kind of special code for reversing an array and then s X y z means get the array from X to Y with step Z if you omit exit defaults to start oh so there's like Python I suppose has all these really fancy ways of chunking and chopping and then segmenting and reordering arrays that I'm not familiar with but that's really really cool to see okay let's see so I'm getting a sense from the various chats that I'm seeing that people would like to see one more and Thank You Simon and armour for participating as well people would like to see one more of these so let's try one more and then I want to talk about something new that I'm developing which is neuro evolution examples for the ml five library and then we'll be done for today people are wondering about this shirt what is the beeping why is to be knowing slowly what the beeping is like every so often there's beep in my ear and it's the code clash website okay let me go back to my camera oh I'm on my camera and let me get another one going starting up the new one so so here's what I would like to say for these coke lashes I would like to give the most people who are watching a chance just for now I don't know that I'll always do it this way I'm posting this in the supporter channel first I don't like any sort of like tiered systems but this is just the way I'm doing it for today to kind of ease into this so if you already did the previous code if you already did the previous one maybe sit this one out and also I would say if you're watching and you feel shy or if you're like not sure like coming joy don't worry this is fun I I need you know we should all give this a try duh oh people following me on the website might beep maybe that's what's going on okay all right so I uh oh shoot it's already I didn't post the link and it's already starting in 45 seconds so how do I get it to take longer to start I got to make a new one I'm gonna leave this clash okay sorry here we go I'm starting the new one create your own code of clash puzzle homemade puzzle editor huh so that's definitely something I want to get into that would be nice start private clash alright here's the link here comes okay and I'm also going to post it if somebody could immediately post it maybe in and here it goes now I'm coming back so we can see there we go so we've got people joining and it's going to start in one minute and 31 seconds oh whoa oh I guess it's filled up I'm in Reverse mode again okay so let's take a look at this the game mode is reverse you do not have access to the statement you have to guess what to do by observing a falling set of test five to five numbers separated by two five three five numbers of other one was much harder than this one three numbers so this is this this I can handle so all right is there a setting here just to make this font much larger so read line split gives me the two numbers and so I have number one and number two so the first thing that I want to do is I need this many numbers so first I want to have a counter start at zero then I want to go from this or I guess I just I don't need a counter I'm gonna do a loop what am I talking about but do for I 0 I is less than the first number which is 5 I plus plus and then we need a string so the answer is a string and I'm gonna say answer plus equals all right well I guess I could need to have a variable like a value started at 0 plus equal and does it start with 0 it always starts with 0 value value plus equal R that's how much it goes up and then answer plus plus equal value and then there's a space right so this should be this should be I think this is it I mean I haven't really let's see so let's just run it let's draw a caution the wind no I didn't get it right this the expected output is 0 2 4 6 8 and I found nothing value is 0 is less than it so let let's make sure everything's coming in right console error this is how ID bug console error n comma R is that how I debug v ok I is zero I is less than n answer is a string let's add what happens if I just add value to it and let's try that again found 0 2 4 6 8 so I'm doing it right I just didn't put the spaces in correctly so I mean I know I could do this Oh am I gonna have an extra space at the end and that's and that's not gonna like that let's see why did it get nothing why does adding the space turn it into nothing is the last space Messick I should see it but have the last space I mean I know ok let's try him trim we'll take off the extra space Oh what but why wouldn't it log the whole thing with just an extra space I understand that I need to remove the last space but why without doing that yeah but why did it say nothing as the I think that's a bug because look at this oh it found oh I'm reading this thing correctly this is what it found with the extra space expected confused me why what do you mean expected nothing it should show me what it expected which is this right but I could also keep them another way of doing this would be key as an array so let's do this yeah this is a good idea if I keep them as an array the answer equals value and then and then console.log answer join with a space this is another way to do it and ding ding ding ding ding ding ding and I will now submit this I'm happy with my answer and we'll give it oh oh it has ten more minutes okay I think I can start to look at other people's solutions while I while other people are finishing up so let's start let's I I don't want to go in order so let me go from let me go from this one here Oh Java Oh Java Java I don't know what sound to play for Java but it's something good it's like it's like a beautiful sound do I have a beautiful sound for Java because I love Java I don't I'll just say thank you thank you for picking Java as your language I will now do a dramatic reading of this code class solution public static void main string args scanner in equals new scanner system dot in int n equals in dot next int it R equals in that next it in num equal 0 system dot out dot print 0 for int I equals 1 I is less than n I plus plus numbers equals R system.out.print quotation space quotation + num close bracket close bracket close bracket close bracket close bracket it's so great to have a language where you just it figures out the way that you have to write the most amount of code to do the task I love it okay so let's see what's going on here this looks very similar to what I did it's just I don't know what this scanner is I have never seen that scanner but I guess that's a way of like reading in and this must be the boilerplate code it gives you reading the user input all right thank you great work I'd love to see this gruesel house let's take a look we've got some what is this JavaScript here let's take a look out is zero string a string concatenated oh there's a string literal here but no other characters besides the variable so my suspicion is if you just put out in here it would actually work but who knows if I is not equal to n minus one so as long as it's not the last one add so that's another way to do it don't bother to add the space but don't add a space if it's the very last one concatenate up and console.log excellent work csharp a language I do not know but oh but once again nice just like I love it sound csharp has the quality of looking very much like Java which I quite enjoy and we have console.readline split which is much more sensible we make a list a list full of integers add I times R I like this the multiplying of our that's a clever thing that I didn't think of and then join with the spacebar excellent now we are up to C++ and we see this is pretty interesting there's like all sorts of crazy bit shifting but then you're gonna ignore oh this is just the this is just getting the input that's so weird that's how you get the input crazy and then this is very reasonable and I guess this is C out me is that not big shifting I don't know what this is well is that how you said something that's C I don't have no idea what's going on interesting thing is C and C++ those are some of the first languages I really programmed in so in theory I I shouldn't know what this stuff is but I don't remember ah did saying this is how you use C air debug C out okay and then now we're going to Python which I'm sure we're gonna see this is now gonna be in about four characters once again going through the range concatenated I times the so using times instead of plus equals each time to the iteration is a nice way of doing it and then joining with spacebar that is super fun to see cool it's an overloaded operators what I'm being here that's for outputting in the console okay okay standard and standard out okay okay okay okay I got it I got it why don't you all get together and pick one person to correct me okay it's not good shifting I don't know why so it's bit shifting in other languages I guess because that's how I think of it and then we have another JavaScript one which looks which is all the same ideas synthesized down but much less code we've got here in a Python ooh whoa interesting this must be some is this some kind of like string literal like thing and Python I'm like format these variables into a string and that's nice to see we've got and then we've got two not sharing the code and then come on Klim el el clima y ml you can do it you can do it still clashing how much time is left three minutes and 25 seconds Oh 10 I missed 10 okay Oh Kenneth I think this is Kenneth processing I'm just guessing as I saw Kenneth in the chat processing contributor in Python yikes oh I like this interesting way of getting the input and then print F oh this is just for like looking at the error this is a way of printing a this is a way of debugging I got it and then concatenate the array and so nice to see this in Python I love how you when you can initialize things with like the variable comma the other variable and it just sort of like puts one into the other one and went into the other one what a nice thing we now have oh no this would this is like winning the prize for shortest code so let's see can I trim one thing I'd like to do that I think when you see really short very obscure almost impenetrable code as we try to translate it into a narrative English okay N and R equal the integer an int number which is okay so actually let's let's start from the other end we're gonna take the input we're gonna split it up and then we're gonna have two things in the input they're both gonna be an eye and each one of those I'm going to turn into a number and I'm gonna take the first one and put it in N and the second one and put it in R and then I'm going to print out for all of the numbers within n 0 1 2 3 4 I'm going to print out R times n so 0 if if R is 2 0 2 4 6 8 and then I don't know what this star does it like this is like it's kind of like an accumulator oh we could probably in JavaScript this would be a good reason to use that accumulator function we get we get what is this do in Python this like star at the beginning does anybody know somebody will tell me I'm sure and then I guess I don't have to refresh it refreshes automatically and we've got a 45 seconds so we'll see if k KL IML appears unpacks an argument oh and we have welcome sebastian von Laue to the passengers of the coda train it's so nice to have you on board the train ticket for your membership in the coding train you have won yourself a random number and that random number is 30 2218 once again I'm donating the proceeds from anyone who signs up as a new member in April to amass NYC for a PPE personal protective equipment and I'm also matching those matching those membership fees for the month of April okay um spread operator up Clemmy came in right under the wire a Java oh I love you I love you Java you are my one true programming language love let's take a little of this anytime anyone does one of these in Java I require requires a dramatic reading everybody ready to go to sleep class solution curly braket public static void main string args scanner in equals scanner parentheses system dot n closed parentheses int N equals n dot next int int R equals n dot next int int I equals R system dot out dot print 0 for int J equals 0 J is less than n minus 1 J plus plus I plus equals R system dot out dot print space um what's interesting about this particular solution that I like and it may have been in other ones I didn't notice is it there always have a 0 to start so this is starting with the 0 so that then you can just put the space beforehand and the last one won't have a space after it so this is one way of getting around that trim by like always starting with printing the 0 this is also interesting instead of accumulating all of the the string and then printing it out all at once print in Java if you don't use print L and it prints it as an individual character without a line break and so you can actually print the elements one at a time which is kind of nice so thank you very much wonderful this was fun for me my half here's my feedback about coding game I I would be interested in a similar sort of mechanism for with with less with creative output and I would like to think about ways to make this feel less like a competition and more like a collaboration so that's something but but these are fun and maybe we'll do that we'll do more of these in a future challenge el capitán did I not look at yours oh I miss sorry Thank You El capitán Soho captain oh my captain start with an array and just so this is really nice this and by the way I wonder if I could use there's got to be a way to use fill like the array fill function or like the cube of some of these higherorder functions people are asking for another one but I I have to go and I will just talk about ml5 neuro evolution people seem to really enjoy these I'm thinking I'm thinking alright uh so I would be happy to do more of these and may it's possible it's possible that I could even consider doing some live streams that are just doing these see I'm thinking about it I'm enjoying this exploration please one more you guys are just like PTSD here because I'm reading where I'm reading all the books of Harry Potter out loud I'm on the fourth book right now oh if you haven't heard of Harry Potter it's if you just never mind make a bad joke they're always like one more one more one more chapter I have such trouble saying no and I'm feeling the same sort of thing yeah so by the way Koby who's one of the viewers if you join the discord has been streaming these coding clashes on Twitch I know that I'm CJ has been doing them and so this is something that could absolutely people could do just in the community in the discord without anybody streaming them and that sort of thing so I would encourage you it's a nice activity for people to learn and enjoy an experiment with each other it certainly is fun yeah so everyone's saying Plus would all right all right fine then I'll just I'll do one more but then I'm gonna and then I'm just gonna I'm gonna do an overview of the neural evolution stuff and just to let you know it's heavy okay fine one more one more one more okay ah so Kobe but Kobe gave me a important note so we do we're doing these in in the coding train discord which just the link will go into the chat now we do code clashes regularly on discord just join the discord and do tea oh there's a bot so if you type it on the discord TR exclamation point clash so train exhibition clash you get notified when o defied when there's a clash and people can stream them actually just in the discord so you don't even need to like have a twitch account or a YouTube account or anything and then mods can use TR exclamation point clash ping URL to notify clashers that one has started so okay yeah yes all right so fine I'm gonna do one more but let because I wasn't clear I literally feel like I'm talking to my kids right now just because I I wasn't clear I didn't make it clear I didn't say this was the last one so this will be the last one I will do but I pop in on discord and do them all so bum without while I'm not livestreaming so let's do one more okay one more one more so what I'm going to do again I saw some of you did the second one who did the first one right now I don't have any BOTS or system set up to sort of enforce this is just were this is the honor system if you've already joined one of these I would ask that you not join this one and if you're feeling like shy and you might get it wrong I really want you to do it I think it's much more interesting and fun when we're all struggling and making mistakes it's no fun to see 15 of them all somehow done in one minute with one line of code so everybody join in if you've done one before don't join I will do the same thing I'm going to going to post the link to the clash first in the discord as soon as somebody sees it there please just post it to the YouTube chat and they'll it'll that all sort of like that'll be our system for right now okay so I'm going here I'm going to create a new clash here we go well I'm muting my microphone for a sec there's another like streaming zoom thing going on in the next room it starts it new that's another reason why I have to get off at noon but noon is almost fifty minutes away and let me go and do one more shove code I can never find the plates to start one okay here we go start a private one I've got it it's going into the discord there it is and there we go so if someone wants to post that into the YouTube chat and we'll see people join Simon I think you were in the first two Simon I know you've gained your enthusiasm is infectious and wonderful and I understand why you can't resist di love your rainbow icon we've got a bunch of people here I love that there's a kitty cat there reverse mode okay mmm weird what is going on here four becomes 24 1 becomes 1 2 becomes 2 3 becomes 6 5 becomes 1 20 I'm really stumped I'm quite stumped with this one something do with the prime number or the number of defective I know oh wait a second 1 times 1 is 1 2 times 1 is 2 3 times 2 is 6 4 times 3 is 12 no 5 times 5 fact 4 1 times 1 is 1 2 times 1 is 2 3 times 2 is 6 4 times 3 times 2 is 24 factorial okay factorial oh this is great because this is a nice this is fun for us to learn recursion so there's a lot of different ways you can write the factorial so this is I'm going to take some time here to explain this I'm sure everybody in the chat had it way before I did but let's take a minute here this is a nice little excuse to do a little lesson oh hello everybody welcome to today's lesson today's lesson will be on factorial factorial of the number n for example is defined as n oops sorry n times n minus 1 factorial this is a wonderful beautiful thing what it means is that I'm defining factorial according to itself this is the concept of recursion I am defining something by its own thing itself it's like a thing that you shouldn't be able to do right I can't say that the definition of factorial is factorial itself but yet I can and this is like a thing that appears in mathematics in nature this these recursive algorithms you know I have a lot of videos that draw these recursive trees like the idea of a branch is defined as a line segment that's connected to two branches which are therefore each connected to two branches which are therefore each connected to two branches and so on and so forth so while with factorial you could see how if I have five factorial I have 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 and 4 factorial is 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 right I could definitely write a loop to do this but there's a way that I could actually write a recursive function now one thing I didn't mention this definition is incomplete because I also have to say 1 factorial equals 1 1 factorial equals 1 because this would otherwise go on to infinity so let's try to write this as a recursive function for my solution and we'll see if anybody will see if anybody chooses to do it with a loop or in a different way so I'm gonna write a function I'm gonna call it factorial and it's going to receive a value and I'm going to return I'm going to use exactly this definition right here factorial is defined as n times n minus 1 factorial so if I go back to here I'm gonna say return n times n minus 1 o times factorial of n minus 1 now if this were actually if I had this as my code I'll this is the equivalent of having an infinite loop it's a loop with no exit condition because factorial of 5 is 5 times 4 over 4 to step forward 5 for cents about 3 to 2 1 0 negative 1 so I need to say you came back to see me my puppers is here it's gonna have a little nap there she actually you know it's also time for there's so many reasons why I have to end at noon it's like I also got to take her for a walk if you haven't met Gloria she will be making an appearance the next coding in the Cabana video which will be out it's soon at some point um so I also need to say if n is zero I really if it's one alright why don't we say if it's less than or equal to 1 return 1 else returned and by the way I never write code this way but an if statement if there's only one line of code coming after it you don't need the curly brackets but I don't like to do that I like two things to be as long winded I also I can't deal with the four spaces so I will correct coding games editor which is clearly doing it incorrectly but you know what you be a rebel use three space tabs that's what you should do and now I should be able to say console.log factorial of n what did I I'm sure I got something wrong let's see let's run some of these tests Oh success success success success oh it's doing a lot of tests there all right okay you know what let's do this in a different programming language that I don't know should we try it in C let's try it and see I do def we don't know closure what is D I've never even heard of that Python I'm afraid let's try C oh it's just like if I go back to JavaScript as my answer still there thank goodness or let's try C okay how do I write a function int factorial n is the same thing going to work return and return n times factorial n if n is less than or equal to 1 return 1 else return this int and scan and print F answer so oh isn't there like a way don't I don't I have to do like int answer equals factorial of N and then how do you print something in in C print F like don't you do something weird where you like isn't it something weird where you do like oh yeah it's like scanf % d cuz I'm printing a number and then I give it the memory address of answer is that what I do no return oh I need a semicolon ha ha got to have your semicolons in see oh there's and I'm being told by the way that there's loads more languages whoa oh I wouldn't do PHP let's check no hair reading Vanessa memory Oh int and I have to give it a datatype No % D and I did that is this function not available segmentation fault function factorial cannot access memory and address on line 23 and what's wrong with this C code no ampersand here no but that's not the issue like this works something about the way I define my function is incorrect but that's not the error Oh Oh fat n minus one thank you no expected found five expected oh right this is how I'm not putting the answer okay forgot about n minus one okay and I think by the way I'm supposed to put the backslash n here but big deal okay let's checks it again test it again and now I will submit my C code or should I submit my JavaScript I'll just submit this and we'll take a look at some other examples let's look at Oh Java so this we're seeing that this is the way of doing it with a for loop so this is not doing it with recursion you could just start with one and multiply all the values together all the way up to the last number and print out the result that's fun thank you for that we could this is using what Scala reduce whoa so reduce must be similar to there's a reducing JavaScript right is that this yeah the reduce I kept seeing accumulator but there's like so reduces a way of performing an operation like if you wanted to add up all the values in an array in JavaScript the reduced function will allow you to do that by defining like a callback function it's cool it's known as a higherorder function I'm not able to explain this right now but if you search for a higherorder coding train you'll find that I have a bunch of video tutorials on higherorder functions and then high mpj with a very different look this most from 2015 all right thank you so this is cool to see Scala which has this interesting object solution thingamabob let's look at a me good child in JavaScript welcome any good child to the live stream let's take a look at your code and here we go a lovely but beautiful for loop this is nice so the recursion was an interesting fun little digression that I enjoyed doing but this is a really nice way to write this I'm wondering if anybody used the reduced function in JavaScript bash bash whoa that's pretty cool do is this a dowhile loop is this dowhile loop I love it you use the to a while loop I never can find reasons to use dowhile loops you can see using bash just just surprise you with some random language I realize there's a flaw here and I guess is that I I usually if I'm having things that viewers are sort of like collaborating with during a live stream I usually like to check them in advance and I suppose people could get there do some trolling in the comments but so far where this is working out well auto generated code below this is Python once again nice for in range I love these for in range loops that I'm seeing in Python filmer this is see maybe it's C++ so once again now I know this is not bit shifting this is getting input and a nice little while loop to multiply everything up while and that's interesting so the exit condition and as an integer when it gets to zero evaluates to false and then exits that loop that's a pretty cool thing I love that Simon once again here we are we see in Python ah recursion look little train whistle for recursion did not forget to say factorial n minus 1 instead of n I like that do you have this with the ifelse def def firts like to find a function lovely lovely gotta love that Python stuff here's another one uh and see mascot factorial I suppose that's is that in JavaScript too I guess it's yeah I don't think it's there's math dot factorial in JavaScript that's great and Sybil another recursive function in Python that is great to see and we've got another one here whoa I'm not sure why this one maybe didn't work it looks good to me system.out.print line so I'm not sure why this one didn't pass the tests but it looks right and we've got one more CC well wait and see if CC how much time is left in this one twenty seconds all right CeCe okay everyone um thanks for tuning in today I I have one more thing on my agenda I'm out of time I'm over time oh now we see um CeCe's coat appeared and factorial n int number I think the issue here and I don't know C sharp but my I think what's missing here why this didn't work is number probably needs to be initialized to 0 because otherwise if in JavaScript for example will be undefined and even if you're correctly multiplying accumulating and multiplying this with the numbers together to do factorial if you don't start with a number and actually shouldn't be initialized to 0 it needs to be initialized to 1 because oh but number equals n times I oh but you're not so this should be number equals 1 and then number equals itself times I and I starts at n so I think this is just there's a little bit flaw in this solution it's a great start because it's really the right idea we start with a number we have to one at a time start from that number and go down to 0 but not at 0 multiply the values together and return the result so this I think if I'm right this should be number equals 1 then number equals number times I and then return number so that's what I think it should be returned and certainly isn't right because that's what's coming in so and it might help you to have this be like answer because they think of it as like oh it's the answer that I'm multiplying things into and it's just the starting point of the factorial itself great work I'm so glad yours came in see see right there at the end and we were able to look at it I hope that was helpful to you thank you for participating big heart alright so the thing that I didn't get to is ok because I'm just going to show it to you real quick and I would I'm going to come back and do a proper tutorial with it at some point soon but right now let me just open up I term then I gotta go take the dog for a walk see the kids lunch do some other activities get on with my day so so this is gonna this is there's no good segue for this because I'm just like leaping into a totally different world but a library a machine learning a JavaScript library that I spend a lot of time working on is called ml5 Jas so if you haven't seen ml5 j/s you can find out more about it by just going to ml5 j s org now I have made let me see oh sorry if you go under learning under ml5 beginners guide I have all of these video tutorials and in particular I want to highlight the ones that are related to ml v neural network so ml v neural network ml v neural network is a class that allows you to train a neural network with a data set right there in the browser and ml v is a wrapper around 10 to flow j yes and I've talked extensively spent way too much time in all these videos on this stuff so one of the one of the video that I have on my channel neuro evolution just search for neural evolution coding train I have done several iterations of this concept of neuro evolution which is idea of evolving a neural network to perform a task in some kind of simulation so years ago I made this like toy JavaScript neural network and made some neural evolution videos with that that's this 11.1 excuse me I did a coding challenge with flappy bird and somewhere here if I add tensorflow J s to this Google search you'll find there's even a video then that's neuro evolution flappy bird with tensorflow J's so this consort this this concept I've made videos about ad nauseam but what's exciting what's new here is that I have been working on adding neuro evolution features to the ml 5 library that will make working on a neuro evolution project much simpler so I'm gonna just go here under pull requests under closed you can read about this in two pull requests one is this one here new neuro evolution functionality then there then also this neuro evolution moot eight fix so you can you can kind of follow the progress I've kind of written about what it is I was doing and apologies that I'm covering that part of the screen here in terms of how the API works and you can sort of like false see some of the code changes this is not in the newest release of ml five but I just want to show you a new example that I made and if you bear with me so by the way one thing just to point out here is I have the ml 5 github repo cloned downloaded to this laptop that might be something that's totally unfamiliar to you if it if it is familiar to you and you want to try out this neural evolution feature you can do so by um building the library yourself so if you download the library navigated to to your console type in NPM install which I will do right now and then if I do NPM run build this is actually building the library I already did this so I shouldn't I should probably just takes quite a while actually so since I did this I'm gonna just quit it if I go into that directory you should see Oh weird it's gone usually there's a distribution folder from when I build it maybe it's maybe I didn't build it here uh sorry I built it I built it in a different like on a different computer log in a different way so let me actually build it while I'm doing that you can also say NPM run start and what NPM runs start will do and these are all commands that are related to node package manager NPM this is actually also going to build the library but it is going to locally host a version of the library at localhost 8080 ml v j s so you can see now this is actually the built library that is built and what I can do is I can take a look at some of the examples I'm going to go into the examples directory into p5.js I'm gonna run a server and I'm going to go to neural network and there are three new neuro evolution examples that you can take a look at and again I'm going to eventually make video tutorials to walk through all these bind by line and build them up slowly to explain them right now I just wanted to show people who might be interested that they're there in case you want to dig into it and contribute or play around with them see how it works for you but before I click on this example I want to show you what this is based on so in the nature of codebook in if you're not familiar with this is a book about physics and simulation in processing and p5.js which you can read all at this website so there is a particular chapter here chapter 9 which is about genetic algorithms and one of the examples in Chapter 9 nothing to do with neural networks is this particular example evolved flow field so what this example is doing is each one of these particles has inside of itself this genetic information this genetic code and that genetic code is actually an array of vectors that are covering its world so and then when they're born it's random when the first population is born it's random but I'm using this evolutionary technique to take particles take these creatures that happen to be born with a set of vectors that push them farther towards that target that are getting further along the way to that target over a period of time and I'm mutating those and passing them off to the next generation and over time the system will evolve to have these particles kind of make a beeline straight across the screen to the target so this is something that's covered in the nature of code book and I've made videos about how to build this example incidentally I'll note that this example you can actually draw obstacles and it will continue to adapt this I made it quite difficult I'm gonna just like before I go I'm gonna just leave this up in the corner here and I'll check in on them they will like adapt and eventually be making it to the end so I'm just gonna leave that running there so what I'm working on now right inside each one of these particles brain is a literal 2d array of vectors but in a lot of cases and a lot of types of game and simulation environments the search space for what it needs to know about might be so vast that it couldn't possibly hold inside of its brain like here it's possible for me to just have it's like a a bruteforce have every single particle know about a vector everywhere in the in the space but what if I had an infinite space or what if the environment wasn't just about like I just need to know where my XY is what if there's a lot of things I need to sense that could be in an infinite number of configurations throughout my environment so what if instead I had a neural network that could just receive some inputs like what if it receives in this case its XY location and the neural network estimates a vector that should come out of where it should be going based on its location which could be translated to things like not its location but like it's you know its relative location to other you know predators or prey or food or poison you can imagine all sorts of times of ecosystems and scenarios you could evolve that neural network could output where to go now traditionally this is the domain of reinforcement learning so you might have a reward based system and use this reinforcement learning technique to optimize and train the neural network to make the best decisions in the space but ma the technique that I'm exploring is neuro evolution so what if I make a population like this give them all a brain and ask them to over generation over generation evolve and so I'm just giving you this sort of like highlevel picture of this and let me show you the example that I'm working on that does this so if I go back to here and I go to neuro evolution path this is the let me go back to here this is the example right now running now it's not as sophisticated as this one and let me also make this run much faster it doesn't have obstacles but each one of these particles has a neural network that gets two inputs the two inputs are its XY location in the space and the output is a vector telling it what its velocity should be so over time you can see that they together are sort of finding their way towards this target and I'm actually just going to click up here going to move the target you're gonna see that they're gonna start to evolve to change to change and follow and move up towards the the green target now that's in the top right so let me just show you a couple bits and pieces in the code of this example and then I'm gonna be done for today I'm gonna come back you know and I'm still working on this and try to make some videos about it where am I here so let me open this up in Visual Studio code and let me go to neural network exam neuro evolution path particle so the idea is that you know this particle like all my examples to flow typically have like a physics engine in them where a particle has maybe a position it's very much like by the way this is exactly like the smart rockets coding challenge I forgot I forgot about that one this is basically redoing the smart rockets count just not calling it smart rockets but in all my physics examples particles have position acceleration and velocity so you can see that there it's just like any of the particle in system examples I have countless videos and examples of pound what's new is these particles now have this neural network so I could just make a neural network brain and what do I have I have two inputs because the inputs are it's x and y location and I have two outputs its outputs are its outputs are so the two these are the two inputs x and y the output is a vector so one so I need two numbers for that because sorry if the output is a vector one number I'll use for the angle of the vector and another number I'll use for the magnitude because one thing you'll actually notice is they learn to slow down when you reach the target you'll see this there they actually learned like to like sort of reach it more slowly oh you can't see that right now so so you can see now they've they sort of switched to the target there I'll click down here so we will see them adapt again again this is a very trivial scenario like them just using their XY to find out like a straight line to a path but it's it's to me that's this is my study to prove that the concept can work and in theory that we could have a much more sophisticated environment ecosystem where they will learn so let me just show you here so here they get this note now you shouldn't be confused by the fact that these are both the number two that's just kind of a coincidence in the scenario in flappy bird for example I'll show you that in a second there's five inputs because the bird is looking at its location its velocity in the Y Direction the nearest obstacle where the pipes are so there's I'll show you that scenario in a second but what I think what's what's new here is this so in this function think it's basically this is using the neural network and let me see if I can give myself some more space here the it's making in our input array which is it's x and y position normalized to the width and height of the canvas the out it sends it to the brain predict sink is the function for getting synchronous output from the neural network it goes into this outputs array the first output value I multiplied by two pi to get a vector with an angle and then the second and then the second value I multiply the velocity vectors length by that value times five so this is really first I set create a vector with a direction and then I scale it according to the second output so that's what I'm getting here and then what's different is I what's new here with the genetic algorithm you this is in all of my genetic algorithms examples but I have this I have this sorry this is the function that I want to look at I have this is I have this is exactly the same as all my genetic algorithm examples that walk through this algorithm that I'm gonna skip going over right now but basically what's new is ml five has a crossover function so if there are two these are two ml five neural networks I can mix their weights together that's what crossover does it mixes the weights and then the mutate function will 1% of the time tweak a bunch of the weights and I can make a new one so each generation there's you don't have to implement mutation and crossover yourself you could just pick the the particles you want the ones that got closest to the target reuse them and mix and match them for the next generation and the system will evolve so I mean there's lots of missing pieces here you would if if this is completely new to you you would want to look at my genetic algorithms coding train videos so I have a set of videos that go through genetic the genetic algorithm process in detail and then I have videos that go through the neural network process in detail oh they're almost there right look one of these has almost made it to the end and so this is just something new that I'm working on but what I my next step and the reason why I'm mentioning this is some of you might have ideas for this is I think this population class right now in the example I'm making my own population but I think it might make sense for me to say something like population equals ml five neuro evolution or maybe maybe it's ml five population because all of these functions that are like calculate Fitness and reproduction all the stuff that I've got in my code itself I think that's thing I could it's really just going to be the same for every example so the new thing that I added to ml 5 is the mutate and crossover functions and the next functionality before I finish these examples off and make tutorials about them is maybe adding and it's maybe is adding an ml 5 neuro evolution in our population function I haven't figured that out yet so that's coming and so I just wanted to share that with you just so you see what the other example is the other example is where where am I here by the way the reason it had involved yet because I hid the tab and the animation chefs down when I do that that's why I keep think this one open come on make it to the end I want you to make it to the end so I can log off this livestream I remember I'm a completionist if they haven't solved it and I can't father I can't shut off the stream so this is the flappy bird example which you know I've done countless times if I let this run for a little while it's just again this is each generation of flappy birds trying to sort of figure out when they whether it should jump or not jump based on its environment that it's in and at some point soon we'll probably get one that will start to go for a long time usually it'll it refines a solution much more fat much more quickly so you can these are two pretty good ones so you can see these come on you can get up there yeah good work so this is using neural evolution to basically you know to play flappy bird and just looking at the code for this one what you would see that's different if I go into the bird class you'll see there are five inputs the other thing is this is classification because the only thing the bird has to do like unlike getting a vector which is a regression what angle what magnitude it's just one of two options up or down so it's a classification problem you can think of it like if you had a fewer training a neural network to play pacman up down left or right so it's a classification problem the outputs are labels and then you can see here in the think function it's basically taking five properties features of the environment its Y location the closest pipes top and bottom the closest pipes X location its current velocity and then sends those into the neural network and if what it gets back is up then it calls an up function which causes it to jump so I wanted to show you these examples there there join the discord if you're having trouble finding them or knowing how to like access them I'm not finished with them which is why I'm not doing a full tutorial about them yet but you know sometime eventually hopefully that will be coming on this channel so I'm going to get going but oops no I wanted to leave this open I walk in I'm not going to turn off the stream until they've solved it it's this one that I want can I do this okay so um come on so one of the one of the flaws by the way there's a flaw like you can think about why is it why is it having so much trouble like finding the solution whoo that was a good that was good that was a very good thing that happened the reason it's having so much trouble is that the Fitness is the distance to the target and so unfortunately right here is actually like right here is actually closer to the target than up here but it's much better for it to go up here so it has a chance so I have to through the mutations I have to get lucky and have a bunch of them like figure out to make it around you can see that one just did so I think this is actually gonna finish really really soon I'll see if I can answer a few questions before I go anything in the chat anybody have any questions about these neural evolution examples and then I'm gonna sign off for today well in like a half an hour over oh they made it what timing the little little those little particles they made it to the end you can see do they actually make it there or just really close I don't know if they've actually made it there let's zoom in and see it doesn't look like you've actually made it but for all intents and purposes I feel like they've made it am I still streaming yes can you make a video about chess machine learning well that'll be hard but maybe someday thanks everybody for tuning in this is my new plan is to try to stream once per week eventually at a regular time to show community contributions to show things that I'm working on more informally and then I'll be doing some recording sessions making specific video tutorials and by the way for the supporters and discord some of those I will just stream those recording sessions so you can tune in and participate in those that way so thanks everybody I'm going to Heidi I'm glad you like rainbows not on streamer mode I don't know what that means Oh in discord maybe I am going to go enjoy the rest of our weekend stay safe stay home take care of yourself be kind to each other take some time away from screens if you can but if you enjoy coding and want to engage with the coding drain community here's a link to the discord and I look forward to seeing you all next time
