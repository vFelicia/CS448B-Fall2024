okay so let's very briefly now just look at a few key differences between using a recorded file a file for a quartic movie from a file versus a live capture object from a live camera so um we saw that there that we could make a new capture object and we have to give a width and a height of frames per second we've used the keyword this all the same thing is true with a movie object actually done put another thing is the same thing is not true we do have to make eight use make a new movie object and we have to use the keyword this but we don't give a width and a height a frame rate what we need to do is reference a particular file so just like you could load an image from your data folder you can load a movie file from your data folder and then this is a p image so you can use the image function the tint function you can look at the pixels but we need a few more key pieces just like we had that capture event what we need a movie event where we're going to read images from the movie as the movies playing let's give us the current frame the current frame the current frame but I think a bit more important than that in terms of the difference here is that there are some functions like jump the jump function allows you to jump to a certain spot in the movie so if you want to whenever the user clicks the mouse go back to the beginning of the movie you can do that by saying jump zero and this is in seconds processing uses seconds to to mark what point in the movie is a floating point number so you could say if your key thing happens at you know 103 point seven seconds you can jump to that spot in the movie but the time function gives you the current moment in time where is the movie currently the duration function gives you the length of the movie in seconds which is a useful piece of information to know if you want to go to the middle you go to duration divided by two and there's also some functions like speed which will allow you to speed up the playback so if I put speed and I put the number two in here it's going to play back twice as fast you can actually use a negative number to make the movie play in Reverse but only certain codecs codec being the format by which the file is encoded how that movie file was made support that so there is some bugginess here with with speed with with reverse with speed in particular this often evens a little bit of bugginess with using jump and that sort of thing but for the most part you can use these functions to really mess around with how you playback a movie so let's just let's just come over here and kind of see that I'm using a sample movie file that's in all the examples that come with processing so if I were to change this from capture to movie and I'm going to say make a new movie and the name of my movie file is called transit dot move and I don't with a movie instead of saying start you're going to say play and better yet I can actually say loop what loop will do is when it gets to the end it will start so if you want a video to loop and then instead of capture event we've got a movie event and then I should be able to draw it so if I run this we should see this video file playing back and as you can see in the data folder there is just a movie files in the data folder there it is here it is being displayed in the processing sketch and it's looping and just to see a few of these features if I were to say video dot speed 4 and run this you should see that it's playing four times as fast I could certainly try doing something like you know have a rate which map Mouse X between 0 and the width between 0 & 4 and then I could say movie speed R so this is me just dynamically in real time oh it's called video in this the variable name is video here what I'm doing is saying like okay well depending on where the mouse is that's how fast I want to play the movie so I can like slow it down or I can speed it up you can see there's some jumpiness it's not as perfectly smooth here but this I this is the kind of thing that you and do play it back a reverse I could mess with the pixels I could stop it I could pause it I could start it I could read anything you could do with other images you could do with the movie file so I don't want to get let's just let's just look at jump just put in a mouse pressed here just to show that that works I'm going to say movie dot jump and at two three seconds wherever it is in three seconds let's call video I keep remembering that okay so this now it's playing back and whenever I click the mouse it should jump to that point three seconds into them to the file so you can see here a lot of you know some basic manipulation of a video file you can do in terms of stopping starting and jumping around but I just wanted to have a quick video that demonstrates some of these key features and you know as an exercise you might just go back say I made some stuff with static images I made some stuff with live capture let me see if I can slot in a movie and manipulate its pixels and do try one of these those other examples with a movie file as well okay that's the end of this video which was only five minutes and 30 seconds long excellent okay
