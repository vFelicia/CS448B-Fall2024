hello look ITP right here really walking down the hallway of ICPO Here I am here I go oh hello I'm Dan this is a special coding train episode this what's playing behind me is actually a two hour livestream that I did at the ITP Spring Show which was earlier this week of ICP is a twoyear graduate program at Tisch School of the Arts near University it's where I teach there about 200 students and the end of every semester all the students get together and show about a hundred of their projects and here is one right there so if you want to watch this full livestream you can find a link to it in this video's description but what you're about to watch is just an edited compilation of a bunch of the projects that I was able to feature during the show so if you want to learn more about a the projects that you see check this video's description there are links to each there's a credits for each and every one with a link and/or asked question in the comment and enjoy enjoy the ICP spring show 2017 thanks for watching Jared Freedman we like right this is geode number one 1/2 it's a giant inside a disco ball that you can go inside and play around with the lights how long did it take to build this whole thing ah too long it was a couple months from starting the designs to having the finished thing but if you reach out towards the light they did more brighten but you have to get sort of close to phenomenal interaction is just to be my name is Tears David and I made night life which is a series of 3d sculptures inspired by low light photography which means that basically I was really missing that moment when you hold a photo we're not doing it anymore so I wanted to create a physical object that will represent this moment that we have when you have light falls on our bodies and we capture that in a photo but it's a 3d photo and I have three things one of them is a girl standing in front of a bar and delight in this scene is from an Al wire that I had to saw inside the sign the other one I shot my roommate and our fridge and you can actually turn it on and off it's a simple circuit and we have a kid that I found at a thief basement and they were playing Super Mario so they have a tiny television that also shows Super Mario and you can see it here hi I'm Danielle Butler and I made safe house which is an immersive physical environment and part of it is that you're meant to be surprised by what you find inside and so when you duck in then you can in turn interact with what you find inside and discover more about the base of the story how many people would you say came and went inside yesterday that's a really good question a lot and what I loved is how many people would go in at one time so what's what's the most that's been in there once I think five and it was great because I built it as an immersive installation for one and so it's really fun to see five pairs of legs sticking at the bus my name is Franklin and this is my thesis project colored sugar ritual the last forever and it's a kinetic sculpture of the traditional dragon dance performance to trying to bring back something that is the transmitting through my culture DNA in a modern form to that yeah it can be remember again and what scale do you think you could actually make this that because it'll be amazing if it were above you definitely I oh it would be great if we can fill the entire room you know my name is Lindsay Daniels and my project is called rude commute I started recording a lot of videos of my train commute because my train is above ground so you get lots of nice videos of like skyline but then my way of putting it back underground was to project it underneath my plants and then kind of thinking about how what you do above ground affects what goes on underneath all of these plants have sensors in them so when you touch them you will slow down the commute or you can stop it entirely and the only way to bring it back is if you leave them alone and then it will eventually there we go trail all turned back on my name is Michelle and my project is called hidden in plain sight it is an installation that shares the stories of New York Street vendors through interactive 3d printed sculptures so this is a series of three portraits this is Danny this is c2 also known as the Joe Simon from Washington Square Park Montana she's an Ecuadorian woman truck from hotels her family's in Queens and the idea of the project is to share all the stories behind the street food of New York that we don't usually get to know and understand if we these are people who are part of our daily life but at the same time who we don't know much about and it's a commune of immigrants of people who come from all over the world and I believe that one of the reasons that street food in New York is so great is because it's so diverse and it's made by people who come from all over the place okay hi I'm Matt Serra my project is called cat in a box because there's many cats in this box and it's an educational book box for kids to learn about simple circuits and we would start off with the saudi of why we need a house cat it was calcified the animal and drake for the lights and so after that we go into like plug the lights and the buttons inside and we fix the sockets and you can lick to see what you're actually doing and then we basically continue doing this for the rest of the house which somebody already did it's a indian form of art called Kivar it's from Rajasthan which which is why this is some and what it is it's like this popup it's a popup meets Museum sort of book storytelling method and it's beautiful so this whole the physical format of this is inspired by that my name is Paula fellows and this is a project called vine pixels and it's a series of experiments that takes ancient fortunetelling rituals and makes them contemporary by infusing different aspects of our digital culture into them so this is a reddit tarot card that we're gonna be reading you made you made this I made I made yeah so this is just for today hope today is energy okay you got quarters what so basically you're going to have a great day filled with love and excitement and lots of fluffy puppy kisses Oh I'm Erin so this is my project called Anki light basically it's made out of I try to use materials from the trash so a lot of the bags say thank you in New York so I called it thank you light it's powered off of a luna mum take out ten and charcoal from a campfire and salt water so yeah this is one of the batteries and basically there's a few cells in here that are sandwiches of those ingredients and then I'm using plastic bags to insulate them from each other and then there's a high powered LED that is powering you can it'll last about 10 hours with this light and then I'm using just a phone charger to recharge it recharge your charcoal salt water that battery yeah so every 10 minutes or sorry every 10 hours if you plug in every 10 minutes it will recharge it the mmm using a just regular plastic bag that I've ironed together with a closing cilia so that's kind of a fun process one other cool thing about speed bags they're made out of high density polyethylene you can actually just take the laser cut this is three bags so it kind of makes a stronger material and then you can you can send them through the laser cutter without any fumes or anything all right this project is seen on framers and then we are using the physical paintings that's like going immersive to the entertaining and quick demo you just pick whatever the painting in life here and and also putting it up here underneath via the camera webcam so like this and they fill in the text and then show what you know the paintings onto this is the canvas so everything has a different particle system so it's going to create something very interesting you know paintings on top of this Center my name is Gina and I'm actually part of this project and I wanted to create some kind of an interactive painting because my background in fine art so I want to like interact with other users and I want to see them what they are creating by using my pieces hi my name is Regina my name is min and this was a collaboration for two classes it's tangible interactions in live image processing I've got the blob here's the blob and now what I'm going to do is squeeze the blood so I'm Eric when she Lee I'm doing a project about like a collar and popup windows so there are 190 popup windows which we are assembling the collar from the cat webcam and also it's running a very basic level of machine learning so like this I have some business called mind has different color if I put on the front of the webcam we will start assembling the color because it's running algorithm so it's only something the color have the most frequently in front of the camera you you my name is Julie hi so this is the wave washed and which I made out of like an Asian Chinese porn so this whole resonated with me a lot because it's like kind of like expresso with excel filling because the power was in prison and they were he was in the excel when he wrote his poem that's why the center balloon is kind of like in page and then for me as a traveling students kind of be resonating with him so on a base my thesis projects honest so from there I kind of like try to find who is the best performer to perform this cone and then I decide to use balloons and then after that I kind of like put all this mechanism together to paragraph it's performance or this show going through different lines and then with fluent movement to express the food hello I'm Haley hi mes oh and our project is mirage' slide experiment and it's an interactive light installation using EMS based lighting and people can interact with the white so we use tonight to track people skeletons and we process data from processing and so we control the DMX light color and the location and the size and we are using DMX light because instead of slide like presentation like projectors because we try with projectors but they give away a phase and not very clear image like compared to DMX and we really like the quality of the light very crisp and like price
