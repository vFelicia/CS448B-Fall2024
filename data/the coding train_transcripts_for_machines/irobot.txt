for a I hello everyone I am doing a quick audio sound check I have a feeling that my voice is quite low compared to the off music which is fine I can adjust that but I want to make sure that you hear me no clicking oring oh em posts in the chat about the random number book I wonder if I have that somewhere around here I forgot about the r oh I did I do I found oh train whistle Rubik's Cube so many things that I forgot that I have all right how's my audio folks I'm going to be started in just a few minutes I'm having some technical difficulties so please bear with me uh yeah very quiet okay thank you ala for that message I am turning up my audio higher uh that should help a bit I'm also going to turn the music down here there we go okay oh oh now did you all know you know what I'm just going to mute myself I'll be back in exactly two minutes when I'm ready he ch ch cha wow did the timing I've never gotten the timing of that right you might think first of all hi my name is Dan this is the coding train you might think that I have some really sophisticated system where the video plays I'm just making sure is are things working am I life uh where the video plays and sound plays and they're time together and I just press a button and I've got this like team of people in this room all like with headsets on and you know three two one none of that none of that it's like you would not believe the amount of duct tape involved in getting that soundtrack to play first of all did you know that a watched tablet does not charge I have two tablets of unnamed uh uh company made having made them you probably can guess one right here you know no no uh one right down over there both plugged in for the last 30 minutes neither one seems to have come alive one is meant for me to be able to read the chat as I interface with you through the medium of the internet and YouTube and the other one is meant for me to press buttons on to play music and sound effects because apparently I'm trying to pretend that I have some kind of entertainment operation here on the internet but um nothing is working for me I just have this plug that goes to nowhere I was like let me just find that music track in my Google Drive and I'll try to play it I'll try to press this button over here uh so far everyone in the chat seems to be oh you do hear the popping it came back so I'm G to fix that in a moment but let me explain what's going on and hope that maybe it's not happening and maybe that was just a mistake but um I am using a particular piece of technology for for you to hear my voice uh called Nvidia broadcast and uh as this is an artificially intelligently themed live stream one of the features it has is live Echo reduction and um yeah you hear the popping so for whatever reason that Echo reduction um seems to be causing a glitch and I spent a very large amount of time debugging it and determined uh that this was just an issue I couldn't get around but then beautifully all these new drivers and updates came out and I installed them all and it went away and apparently it's back so I think huh huh uh if all things fail use a real train conductor whistle well you'll be glad to know gamb balling addictions everybody just take it easy I'm very s but delicate flower this is an authentic Danish train whistle from the 1950s thank you to processing Community Day in Copenhagen which I had the lovely opportunity to attend some number of years ago time has no meaning to me and uh people heard some people are saying oh only heard a pop so you know what I'm gonna leave it until I hear a lot of complaining because that's basically that's how the world should work you should put yourself out there and then when enough people complain you should adjust what am I even talking about good morning good afternoon good evening good night I hope that didn't hurt anybody wearing headphones welcome to the coding train so today is a bit of an unusual stream not that there is any such thing as a usual stream I would like to show you my computer machine but I need to take a few minutes to close a few Windows um and uh uh um just make sure um things are all right you Talk Amongst yourself for a second here and let's actually start with I'm just gonna uh could barely hear the W so hold on let me check my settings uh certainly if you were watching a professional operation here of somebody live streaming on the internet they would have checked their audio settings before they hit the start streaming button but that's not what you're watching so just to set expectations table set if you will I'm going to go check my audio settings right now Talk Amongst yourselves I would play you a little background music but I don't have an iPad that's I said it I said it I don't have a unnamed company made tablet charged let me check the one on the floor I have two going I plugged them in a half an hour ago it's very there's no heat in this room unless I'm in here do you think that uh a computer machine being freezing in the cold does something like does that completely suck all the energy out of the battery these are old these are like you know ancient uh tablet machines um I'm just going down here I got one on the floor charging I'm still just got that little red bar in the bottom I'm GNA go over check my audio settings don't worry I'm gonna do something uh uh let me just check the uh okay Nvidia I'll talk you through what I'm doing here I wish I can't share screen on my streaming computer because I mean I could but I'm not going to yeah uh Nvidia broadcast uh um and oh the noise removal is no the noise removal is not on just the room Echo removal is on which is what it should be and okay crackling every now and then yeah that's what I would have thought super crafter says cold is usually better for computers means the heat they produce is dissipating quicker but they're off they're off they're sitting off okay uh all right I'm going to just as a experiment turn off the uh Echo removal and you will realize that I uh uh I'm in a a very large empty garage Studio that has no sound treatment uh I do have a couple sound blankets that I sometimes have hung uh in the past but it's kind of like it gets in the way it's sort of a mess so I gave up on that thought like uh some algorithm will fix this for me but guess what today is a day where there is a theme algorithms aren't going to fix it all for you all right uh so let me know if you uh you you can let me know in the chat oh oh I see I see a I see a tablet turning on exactly 50 minutes from when I plugged it in that 930 a.m. eastern uh while that's uh turning on let's move over and talk about what's going to happen today um sounds fine nice Reverb that is the kindest thing Simon Fletcher says sounds fine nice Reverb that is like the kindest thing anybody could ever say to me all right so I'm over here by the Whiteboard and uh it's a little dark also something with theay but I am going to make a list of what I'm going to do today uh I did make that list and it's in the chat pinned I think it's also in the video description but I didn't look at it recently so I make a new list and then we could compare let me know if I'm missing something so the first thing I think I'll probably start with um the newest thing that's on the things that I do and work on which is something called shift bot so that will be uh the through line for today and what I also want to do in today's live stream it's not going to be a major coding stream today so I know some of you prefer I don't know if anybody actually prefers the streams where I just kind of like waste time but I know I do hear from people I prefer you just to be coding the whole stream well I understand that preference but today's maybe not that day but I do want to review um challenge challenges 178 which was the wolf CA and 179 which was uh sand falling so one of my commitments to 2024 is more coding Challenge videos I did exactly three of them in 2023 which is very few because um I otherwise had done you know I used to do them like two or three times a week I don't know I don't know how that ever happened but um uh good news for you challenge number 180 is in post production that makes it sound so fancy so that is coming soon so maybe I can tease that for you a little bit so I want to review look at uh a bunch of comments people made to those uh videos as well as look at the passenger showcase projects which are things that you the viewing community of the internet has created uh based on well I don't know if it's based on but themed and related to the things in the video then um so shift bot will help us with all of this and then I also want to oh oh I just want to mention uh and Shout out January I have an apology to offer which is to uh Raphael um de Corville and um which is that I know that he last year both of us did a January speedrun and he I forget what his time was and then I beat his time but it's not a competition and I also said I think like if anything his was better because he put more thought and time into it so uh and then he did another January speedrun if you're you're not familiar check out uh Sable Sable RAF at uh twitch uh Rafael De Corville uh weekly coding challenge a lot of stuff I'm sure some people who are moderators can put links into the chat a wonderful community of folks the BBS Nest uh if you will we did a a collaborative stream uh celebrate a decade of code with the with p5js um but he did a speed run quite recently and then at the end challenged me I think he did 145 minutes he did it uh I assisted and I could I would I would like to do that first of all January's over so kind of too late I mean it ended yet what's today February 2nd anyway went a couple days ago but also I've actually been doing January secretly on a different social media platform where no one pays attention to me so I'll show you a little bit of some of the things that I did um for January and then I think uh Raphael 2025 I'm coming for you I you heard it here first um so but yeah so that's I want to talk about January and then I want to dig into a little bit more about um you know making your own I don't know what to say like um uh chatbots how how how do how does shi I'll say how does shift bot work so there is uh shift bot is collaboration with Google creative lab um there's a video about it I'll point you towards that direction there's an AI researcher uh Jasmine who did um you know a was It was a team effort of a lot of different people but who is the AI researcher who um wrote a an incredible blog post describing all the technical components of it and I might like to try to go through a few of those to the extent I have time I don't know how to change the time on this watch does somebody know it's a Casio calculator watch I can't figure out how to change the time I I think actually it's more the problem that my eyesight does not allow me to see it properly and the buttons are too small because the of used to be able to you know how does shift bot work and then I don't know is that everything that looks like a good agenda what did I miss here I am over here uh thank you uh coding Garden everyone should uh also check out coding Garden on Twitch and YouTube um and the sound has changed but not in the best way you do know how much pain it causes me that I cannot get my audio to work and be effective one of these days let's just see let me just see if I can get the chat open on here now um give me a minute here talk let me see if the other iPad turned on no unbelievable okay I just want to get the um I want to be able to see the chat here to the the best of my ability um so just give me a minute here anybody let me know in uh oh okay let's see here I'm seeing some messages in my Discord uh uh okay almost worth the pops yeah I have I forgot I'm I'm getting lots of good advice about audio settings and OBS and I I I I actually really did a whole transformative thing with my audio and OBS I did did it I did it in a different I run multiple instances of OBS on the computer and I have a different one that I run for streaming and I didn't put any of the audio settings into that so welcome what uh fine fine oh my goodness oh my godness please can I just go to my live stream to see the chat this isn't even GNA work all right wait what happened to shift bot oh there there shiot is okay okay the audio is tolerable for me and that's all that matters that is also a very kind message the sound is perfect all right everybody um isn't the coding challenge 17 did I get the numbers wrong 178 179 anyway let's just get started it's already 1025 this train has all sorts of mechanical issues uh and I'm going to move right over here now okay guess what everybody I am here to introduce you to that was a very loud oh it's just a truck driving by uh shift bot hi shift bot how are you I don't think shift bot can hear me shift bot you need to type to shift bot but I oh oh my goodness calm down everybody it's going to be okay ah s son of Samuel is giving me some advice how to change my watch okay so shift bot is um an experimental chatbot it is a Chrome extension that only works if you are on the p5js uh web editor um and so you might be wondering uh how did this come to be and how do you get access to shift bot and then I'll I I'll demonstrate some of its features so I believe if you go to well let's go to labs. gooogle google. laabs I can't remember I think it's labs. gooogle um this is a website where you can watch me like laugh at something over and over thousands of times you just leave this desk this page open on your computer I just do the same expression over and over and over again I guess eventually they'll come up with a new project and I'll get replaced but I find it very funny that it's just that weird you also get a really nice view of how I'm kind of going slightly bald which uh I thought I you know you could see maybe I'm trying to hide that by wearing the hat today but no my thought was you might actually get confused because uh oh look Shi bot's having some uh coffee um you might get confused because both of us are going to be on the stream and I thought if I wear a hat it would be a little bit more clear who is who who is the AI version of me and who is the human version of me I I don't know if that's working for you but I thought that could be helpful all right so um this is a project that researchers at Google uh worked on with me I was very uh honored and uh um slightly terrified to be invited to participate in an experimental project um and what we uh were thinking about is what is possible in the realm of large language models I mean you're probably all if you're paying attention to the technology world that we live in um there are tools out there where you can say hey uh maybe maybe in a more plate way excuse me pardon me a pardon me would you please provide me some p5js code to draw a flower and then there it is copy paste draw flower now I think this is an interesting discussion to talk about do we want to live in a world where that's possible it's a little bit too too too late at this point uh um at least in terms of any agency that I feel I have over what world we're living in but um I do think so I think that's a first of all a fair question to ask I think there's a lot of complicated questions around uh thinking about all of the data that was collected um in order to make that happen um but what I you know given that space that we're living in I'm kind of interested in what are ways that we can use that capability and that technology to provide um to bring a little well one is just to bring a little Delight into your life perhaps and also to think about how um you you might have a little bit more agency over what is the uh an understanding over the source material and the information that you're getting in that context of chatting with uh you know an AI chatbot so shiot is an experiment in that direction I think there's probably like a lot more things to say around the sort of goals and principles of it if you're interested in giving it a try you can go to uh shift shift bot withg google.com now I will say that this is be you know due to the nature of this being highly experimental um it is built on top of the Gemini API which is Google's large language model uh which is you know fairly new as far as I understand so Gemini itself on some level is somewhat I I don't know about experimental but is new um access to the Gemini API in fact isn't available necessarily globally this we're trying to working with them to we want to get some testing see how it's doing make sure it's actually something that helps people and doesn't like cause more problems so there if you want to use it there is a waiting list um uh and uh it is not available in all countries yet um so um but um you know stay tuned uh uh and if you get access and you are able to give it a try and have feedback um there's an email that you can write to you can reach out to me on social media the more feedback uh the sooner and hopefully it can get opened up to more people um okay if you have a and mooner thank you for your uh membership if you if you uh happen to have access to it I'd love you know feel free to let us know how it's been for you um in the chat okay so that's what this is now I'm not going to play this video here because it'll it'll be too embarrassing for me but um you can also watch this video uh uh uh which has an interview with me it features Lauren McCarthy from P5 Jess some students from NYU some of the researchers at Google talking about the themes of the project and uh its goals and how it works but more importantly what I would like to highlight here is this particular blog post and this is what I'm really interested in so if you followed some of my earlier live streams you know that I teach a class called uh programming from A to Z which you I got to I think I just got to rename this class but programming from the reason why I called it programming from A to Z is this class the first time I taught this class was in 2008 like some kind of medieval Computing I don't know what we were using back then I think it might have been paper perhaps like there's like a device um you know you you kind of you put ink in a tube and then you have this little like point at the bottom and it kind of slowly drips out you can like smear it onto a Pap on a onto a um you know a Celluloid a thin slice anyway um but uh so this class was always about different kinds of algorithms to work with text um I have many videos on my channel around you know marov chains context free grammars all these types of things and this was one of the first year I really dove into large language models um you know I I encourage you anybody who's interested to look at the syllabus um there was a stream that I recently did around um embeddings I was using a particular embeddings model um uh to do a clustering of text and so this is a lot of background material a Gemini didn't exist or probably existed but I had was not aware of it or not using it yet while I was teaching this class so most of the models I used were uh used llama quite a bit we looked at um open ai's model and then some on device models that you can find uh particularly on the hugging face website with the transformers. JS package so lots of possibilities there uh probably honestly like this class I'm teaching again next fall so this summer next fall Lots more content to come on the channel hopefully about that focusing on the coding challenges and the nature of code stuff a bit more right now but if you read this post um one of the things that you will discover is that this project involves both prompt engineering which is a way of uh kind of directing a chat B A pretrained already trained model uh to give it some tips and suggestions about how to behave and what style to adopt um as as well as um you know what uh is it one few shot learning which is kind of the idea of like and also here's a few examples uh you know maybe you could put in your prompt like by the way there's uh even like the the model might not have been trained with data on a recent version of P5 so you could put in your prompt and by the way the newest version of P5 is 1.9 and these are the new features of it things like that that would give it some extra uh understanding but what I am particularly interested in also uh which I is addressed here which is this idea of semantic retrieval so I really have a goal of coming back and doing another stream or some videos around how to do a search through a knowledge base and uh um and find relevant uh material so like for example I have a book and it has you know 600 Pages if somebody asks a question and this is stuff that I that I have examples of from the program a a Toc class what is a vector could I do a search through that book and find like the three paragraphs across all 600 pages that that have the relevant information about what is a vector and this is quite possible with language models because language models have uh also produced this thing called an embedding which is essentially a set of numbers that can be associated with a block of text and you can run similarity scores and distance matching and all sorts of things with the numbers look at my embeddings live stream where I talk about that a lot so uh Jasmine and and and collaborators worked on creating a corpus out of all of my video transcripts and you can see these uh diagrams here oh I'm doing the how to ship work uh sorry everybody I think I might by accident be going out of order I'm a little bit down here right now hope that's okay uh mostly I did that because we all got to keep our body is moving it's also getting cold in here because I'm not running the heat I ran it all morning uh uh okay uh so I'm just kind of taking a quick peek at the chat looks like everything is kind of okay I'm sorry that I'm not really seeing your messages so much so I encourage you um to take a look at this and the idea here is that with shift Boton we'll look at this in a second it's going to not only look at the video transcripts to gather information to help answer a question but also uh it can then figure out based on the video transcripts if there is a video and not just a video but a particular point in time in the video that uh could be relevant and helpful I'm still I'm like always around now this might be a problem um so so yeah so that's a little bit about I think it' probably be more interesting for us to like actually look at shift bot we also have like a corpus of code examples and all sorts of things uh if you're interested in um language models chat Bots AI research uh I definitely encourage you to uh read this particular um blog post okay where do I want to go with this next let's just say hi let's just say hi hi you might not be able to I don't know how well you can see this we're going to we're going to zoom in a little bit this is kind of terrifying by the way somebody told me I got some feedback that they that I think most of most of the audience here is probably too young to remember a delightful film from the 1980s called The Exorcist or the car character's headman so apologies if that's a little bit triggering for everybody um I'm shift bot a friendly robot here to help you learn creative coding what are you working on today well uh well to be honest I am Dan you are based on me I helped make you uh really uh anyone could say this to you and not be telling the truth but I am right now I am live streaming demon demonstrating your behaviors your capabilities what would you like to say to the live YouTube Audience by the way every person who worked on this project is now sitting at home if they're watching which they're probably aren't but they might be oh my God what's gonna happen I don't know why did I say to be honest what a weird thing to say okay hello to all the humans watching I'm sh a friendly robot here yeah you know you said that already I have to say shift bot from giving you a little feedback sometimes you repeat yourself maybe we could work on that we could work on that together I guess what I repeat myself all the time uh okay um and I I know that I'm a little bit cut off here just because of the way I zoomed in there we go okay um all right I you know okay that's good so um all right so maybe let's let's make a little mini project let me give my let me look at let's time check here time check here it is uh is not 1140 it's 1040 by the way sometime like I think in April just magically my watch will be fixed it'll be the right time again is it March I don't know um okay so let's see um maybe oh by the way you get um these little chips too what are some of the things that I can do with P5 these are also generated um there are some things that uh we decided to hand write like some of the openings that the bot says to you as a first hello those are written by me with some feedback and edits and contributions from others um these are generated I believe what are some of the things that I can do with p5js um oh I like this let's get some examples of creative coding projects that I can make with p5js sounds like fun interesting I think shift bot you seem to be a little bit behind oh but it gave me animated Sprites that could be a fun one to do um I'm just curious this probably isn't going to work but I say I'm a total beginner where where's a good place to start it's going to be confused because I told it before that I'm Dan are you familiar with the concept of a function in P5 that's good that'd be a good thing for me to learn about um excellent all right let's pick an idea uh that sorry I should apologize sorry I realize I'm being very confused in my head when I imagine doing this live stream I'm not sure what I thought it would be but I'm not sure it was this uh I realized it be very confusing because I said I was Dan and then and then I said I was a beginner um so shiot is actually reading the full uh thread of the conversation there is some limit there in terms of what context window it can have but um so it you know I could imagine some Behavior going arai if I start like saying like I'm this I'm that I'm this I'm that uh uh I really am Dan just trying to demonstrate how this all works what would be a good uh mini project for for me to demo to the live audience all right let's see what we get here really most of the work we went in that went into this is to help with your code um so you're Dan the human bind shift bot for a mini project how about creating a simple drawing or paint program I love this idea good good job shift bot helpful yes Bing okay um so a couple things U if I go back to um this uh page and you look I think it's further down here if you look at some of these principles these are some of the principles we had in mind as working on this and this is probably where you know this kind of you know uh chitchatting conversation I'm having with shift bot isn't something that the mo most of the work went into to try to steer the bot towards doing the bot is much more geared towards trying to provide you helpful steps answer your questions about code without just giving you like pages and pages of things to copy paste and then you're lost so holding back not just immediately giving the answer of the code but helping provide next steps to answer I'm not saying this works perfectly but these are the principles or trying to uh abide by um uh trying to use resources so again this is I'm not suggesting that my resources are the things that should make every bot in the world that should use but this can hopefully be an example for others to see if you were a history teacher and you had a collection of material that you're using for your class could you use your own material and your own style so this is uh what I hope would be an example that might lead towards other people thinking about ways to build their own kinds of bots as well as really um kind of uh um you know continuing with the vibe of you know half broken confused uh ways that I work and really helping um you know as we use shift bot hopefully we'll see when I make start making mistakes or have some syntax errors in the code we'll see if shift bot is helpful in that uh area okay can you ask aush asks can you ask the shift bot to create the program for you so kind of no I mean we'll see I would say no uh we I could I could ask and we could see what response the goal of shift bot is not to do that maybe shift bot would give you the one line of code to start with and like help you step by step the reason why is honestly if you want that which I think is there are there is a time in place like I'm using uh copilot quite a bit these days when I'm working in Visual Studio code there's a time and place uh for wanting to have code written for you and those tools exist so why make a shift bot that does what other tools already do so that's kind of the idea here was to try to look at things in a different way well I think it was a me pataro uh who's one of the uh uh the folks at Google who worked on the project who's in that video who said what if we made like CU AI is kind of like let's make things fast it's going save all your time it's going to write the code for you what if we made a Time waster rather than a time saer and that really stuck with me it's kind of like one of the core ideas behind shift bot um ah kunai asks an incredibly important question which I completely forgot and um in fact because I just in fresh installed shift bot this morning yes there we go Oh Come Back tool tip shoot I clicked away too fast uh there's a nice tool when the first time you run shift bot I wonder if there's a way for me to reset that um but uh when you uh so yes shift bot both can read the code that's in the editor in fact you can also highlight I believe you can highlight uh um or like tell it to read a line of code that you're on um but certainly yes it can read the code that's in the editor that's why it is a living in the same page as the P5 web editor as well as any errors that come up in the console down here which is very very useful like we could just kind of do that really quickly like I could remove this um parentheses we can see I can try to run the code and then even over here automat that tool tip came up well usually it it it pops up with the H I wonder if a syntax error that that so this is a little unexpected usually it gives me like an automated um uh little like help button over here there we go so that came so when there's an error in the code it will often pop up you could you could certainly ask like what why am I getting error in my code but I can just press this help button and let's see what we get and I have a syntax error it looks like you have an extra parentheses in line six make sure your parentheses are balanced is this correct grammar shift po I think so that's plural that's singular or balance and try again good job good job shiot um so um so we can see so that's helpful I mean the it's you know the P5 friendly error message is also giving a helpful uh error and it's basically looking through that repackaging it and and trying to give you um some information so here we go I can fix that error and I could say oh cool awesome that worked it's funny I told you it was me it should probably just say come on you know better you know what the error is are you just testing me again uh um all right so I'm kind of um I'm kind of taking a peek at the chat okay so all right so I'm glad to hear that you're natural coder yeah I don't know okay fine um I know that's a friendly nice thing to say I might say like um you know is anybody really a natural coder I think it's hard it's hard you got to learn you got to just you got to just like struggle through it okay now let's try adding some shapes your canvas are you familiar with the circle function I am yes um yes uh let's let's make that uh let's make that uh painting program you mentioned uh okay so I'm going to put a circle 10050 and that shift bot said to move background into setup so let's do that um it's telling me to to move it into setup that's great it's a really good tip shiot um and oh wow that's a little bit Advanced a little bit advanced here for my beginner painting program but honestly this is like such a good tip though because create Graphics is incredibly useful if you're trying to make a that that whole video is about making a painting program where you can have that trail but have other things not have the trail so that's actually an excellent suggestion all right so the the now I'm going to do a little bit of a fake scenario here because I certainly know what to do next but um I have the circle um but it's not moving how do I paint with it I mean I'm not even going to suggest using the mouse even though I'm just curious if shift bot uh will look for an example and find something related okay in your make your circle move you can use Mouse X and mouse y variables to track the position of the mouse try updating the position of your circle in the draw function using these variables amazing so uh oh I seem to have an error again let's try to uh figure out I'm just let's see figure out if it can see that I've misspelled Mouse X looks like you have a typo in line seven you wrote Al X instead of mouse X great and look at this it even it's like you're having a lot of errors this is this is my you know you keep seeming to have errors maybe you want to watch a video on errors that might help you um okay so great now oh amazing it's painting oh so but I only want to paint if I'm holding down the mouse I only want to paint if I'm holding down the mouse how does that work let's see here I like how the chat the chat is telling me where my error is no I'm making the errors on purpose okay to only paint oh shift bot shift bot this is a good idea but you're you're missing so it's it's fine it's fine okay do you see this word up here it says experimental this is good this is uh this is feedback we can give to shift bot shift bot can help with to only paint when you hold down the mouse you can use the mouse is pressed function so that's so good try adding an if statement your draw to check if the mouse is pressed before drawing the circle so shift butt mouse is pressed is a variable not a function it's a variable there is a function called Mouse let me just help shift bot out here this is right however Mouse is pressed is a variable not a function can you help me learn the Syntax for this if statement uh all right so let's see what we get here is a really so that's the right code it's real shipot I'm said shipot is really determined Mouse press is function not let's let's one of the things that was really important about shift bot is actually to uh not just be a uh a interface where you're kind of reading the information but in many ways like a bit of an a search engine if you will that will help you find a video or link to the actual P5 reference because uh you know in my view the whole one of the one of the things that I don't want to be lost in this world that we're living in is the fact that there are all of these beautiful people who work on open source projects who have spent enormous amount of time writing really careful and thoughtful documentation so why not read that so let's go click on this and see where we get yeah see the Boolean system variable see sh it's it's a variable it's okay it's very confusing it's a it's a very understandable mistake to make okay so let's try adding this to the code uh if Mouse is pressed my hands are getting a little bit cold draw the circle and let's oh there we go let's add um so now let's add one more little like uh bit here before I move on and let's start looking at um oh what's something I can try next you know I feel like typing I'm just going to click that chip and hopefully it's going to tell me to add color that's what I that's what I was going to ask about to try making your circle move more smoothly oh that's interesting this is an unusual suggestion try using the P Mouse X and P Mouse y variable stored the previous position Ah that's kind of interesting so that could be a fun thing to try good suggestion I'm learning about P Mouse X and py it's giving me a good update a good good little explanation of this tip I'm going to say though I think I would prefer to change the color how could it change um uh how could the color be uh change Hue over time like a rainbow shift bot is trained to love rainbows so that's like a little little hack there you want to get shift bot excited talk about a rainbow to change the color of your circle and make it change Hue over time like a rainbow you can use the Hue function in p5js Phil Hugh this is a good idea that's interesting so it's not exactly right though uh answer some questions here um is it based on chat GPT um it uh it is based it is built on top of Gemini which is a large language model like GPT 4 but uh created by uh Google AI researchers um and wave Morpher is answering that question all right so um I think I'd rather try color mode Let's see what explanation it gives me about color mode so I'm going to start putting in the code color mode uh h SB perfect uh there this is good yeah you going to specify the mode you want to use three modes RGB HSB is there really an hsba or is that like a a madeup thing try adding this line to the top of your code then you can use the color function so let's look at that let's look at the color mode reference let's fact check P5 here um so uh color mode RGB HSB I don't think so that's a bit of that's so these are the possibilities RGB HSB or hsl hsba would be uh is a is a correct theoretical kind of color mode Hue saturation brightness with Alpha but Alpha is always available in P5 whether in RGB or HSB okay so we're going to add uh the HSB color mode I'm going to add what are the I'm going to ask what are the arguments to color mode although really the whole point of shift bot is not to get that answer here but to look over at the reference which it gave me the link um and okay so now the arguments to color mode are uh uh are the mode you want to use uh and sets the mode with a maximum yeah this is actually right 360 100 100 those are the defaults and look at this I use I like I love that it says shift human there that makes me really happy uses HSB mode to map the first 10 millions of that that's exactly right that's exactly what I did in that video awesome uh okay so um I could just change it to color mode HSB um and it's giving me the range so uh I'm going to I'm going to use a value I'm going to use a variable called hu actually let's see if I can run into an issue um I'm just I want I'm to make a mistake here which is not really a mistake but I'm uh P5 is a one of the is a JavaScript library that puts uh function names into the global namespace this helps to make it friendly to beginners but it can have unintended uh uh consequences um but let's see Hugh saturation uh brightness um and okay so actually this worked I'm surprised I didn't get a warning usually P5 so um P5 would usually give you a warning here um maybe because my it I don't know um because Hue is a function in P5 and if I name my own variable I've kind of uh uh uh removed access to that function so I'm going to just change this to Hue value and I'm going to put that here and then okay I'm going to now I'm going to ask shift bot I see that it is red how can I have the uh Hue value change over time now it might try to lead me to using the frame count which I think would be a very reasonable message try adding this okay bug I'm gonna I I really hate to do this oh I really hate to do this do I do it do I dare is this okay you should do the okay I'm going to say no whoops I'm still Lear so this is a bug that I've noticed um I don't know where this is going wrong but it's says to make the Hue value change over time try adding this line to your draw function it's busy yeah here here's a nice spin on that try adding a line to your draw function that does that see how that goes I could ask i' i' I've encountered this bug before and I can kind of chat with it and get the line back but um this will make the Hue of Circle change based on the position of the mouse on the xaxis so that's not what I want though I'd rather have it change over time like cycle through with every time through draw how about incrementing the value let's let's give a little let's give shiot a little help Shi bot's a baby baby uh try incrementing the Hue value over time try adding this line to your dra draw function this will CH make the Hue of your circle change by one each time um and so I'm assuming the line I'm supposed to add is Hue value equals q q value + one oh you know what I actually only want it to change in the if statement as well there look at that I've made a beautiful and let's add let's do no stroke let's add a little bit of Alpha and let's uh make the circle a little bit smaller and and um let's draw shift bot oh oh I mean I could ask shift bot but I think I can I I don't you don't have to ask shift bot for every error okay let's draw shift bot those are supposed to be my ears okay I'm having trouble with the mouth uh this is supposed to be my beard I guess I I drew a portrait of you what do you think now unfortunately shift bot at present cannot actually currently see the drawing in the canvas but this is I'm something I'm excited to do further research and work on as um uh new models particularly if the Gemini mod Gemini has a Gemini Vision currently so I think it would be quite possible I'm flattered I love to see a portrait of me can you share a screenshot or a link to your code first of all ship bot you can see my code so don't worry don't worry you you can look yourself and screenshot that's coming soon I hope someday we can add multi and I've seen demos of this uh modal support so that that you can look at the canvas output oh you know I forgot to save my sketch I don't know what's going to happen so all right one thing you know you might be wondering about privacy and your data privacy while using shift bot um you know the messages are going to the cloud because it's built on top of the Gemini model which is a cloudbased model um I'm not an official representative of Google here or the Gemini Project so I can't give you the real answer there but you should know that you can read the data privacy policies and there is no there is no uh your information is not tied to anything that you're doing with shift bot but uh I think the only thing that gets tied to this conversation from what I understand if I hit save and hopefully I'm getting this right but it's actually just reset it but because I never saved the sketch in the first place but um hi what do you think of my code and you know I wonder if it sometimes I've noticed I wonder if there's an issue with it no no it was reading the coach is fine um so um I'm just taking a peek at the chat uh great thank you so I think now I'm just curious to test this the idea is here if I refresh it and I look back at the conversation it's still there but because this conver every sketch uh has a unique ID so the conversations are aware of that ID so um but that's all I think loc locally stored in the extension itself anyway uh don't quote me on all this I I should know this stuff better but I you know it's hard to do this stuff live and just start talking and then you realize you don't know what you're talking about and okay uh where are we on our agenda I might like to take a break but I also might just power through this um um so okay so I've talked about so um I guess like uh I I want to do a gemini API demo I really would like to get to that I have this I built my own kind of like halfbaked version of ship bot just using node and P5 and the my own API keys with the Gemini API um so I would like to if there's interest you know come back and do another live stream where I could dig into that even further but maybe at least today we can do a little bit of a hello world uh connection to the Gemini API I'm not prepared anything for that so I'd be doing it kind of from scratch here which you know obviously has its benefits that's but it also could you know I could run a foul of something I'm not aware of and and not have things work but um so I think if that's going to happen this needs to start by uh 1130 yeah 1130 I'll go a little bit past 12 because I started five minutes late I'm trying to keep myself to two hours today if I can so why don't we go ahead and look at the coding challenges because I think there's some interesting things to address there and if there are some uh P5 sketches that people have submitted um then uh we can also ask shift bot to help us understand what's going on in the code uh okay and actually I am going to take a whoops wrong button I'm gonna take a short break oh the iPad Came live okay let's see if I can get the sound effects in music playing um I'm going to take a short break just so I can get the my other screens up so I can see the chat better and that kind of stuff and also I think it's CJ being in the chat reminds me like I should take a break CJ does a very good job of taking breaks and having reminders to stand up and stretch I am doing this whole thing standing which really helps um I have problems when I sit for too long you don't really need to know about that uh okay so where is this plugin oh did did it go off oh my God because it oh you got to be kidding me I I unplugged it for like five seconds and it completely went dead it's coming back alive uh I do have two plugs oh my God okay so I'm gonna take a break maybe there'll just be no music during the break and I'm gonna get my I'm GNA take a break I'm G to get my um uh other screen set up so I can see the chat better which I think will help me interact with you better and um we will go and start looking at the uh wolf from CA and the Falling Sand and people gave me some good tips about Falling Sand so maybe we can adjust some of the code to see if we can improve the the code example there a little bit live okay so let me just put on um uh Marco is asking I'll address this question really quickly Marco is asking would we have an unedited version of this stream oh yeah yeah yeah yeah so this thing that you're watching right now on YouTube as a live stream you know never say never YouTube could go down YouTube could delete my channel I mean hopefully that won't happen I could decide like I don't want this to be on YouTube anymore so I reserve the right to all of that potentially in the future but my intention is I just leave these streams up as an archive and if things are going well and I'm organized and getting things done it will also be annotated with links to all the references and time codes and that kind of thing okay so I'm going to go over to this intermission animation um and mute my microphone if uh you might hear some music in a minute I'll be back in in about actually you know what I'm going to put on the why not since the break's going to be about 5 minutes let's just go ahead and put this on uh except I have to figure out how to restart it there we go okay I'll be back in might be less than five minutes but at least five minutes sorry about that audio I should Pro I'm gonna mute that audio but uh actually the music's about to start so uh maybe I won't mute it let's just see if I can get to work and uh hold on everybody there we go okay I'll be back and I'm going to say once again here we sing it with autotune and the internet will fix that for me it withan sanin s oh sorry uh okay I'm back uh here we are I have a few new things set up one is that I have my soundboard going and I also have a live view of the chat right here um sorry apparently there was like a loud train whistle sound I think maybe that's in is that in the video uh I see it um oh so there's a flick there's also a flickering issue I won't be able to fix that right now so still still having some technical problems one of these days it's only been like you know 12 years that I've been doing this one of these days I'll uh get this all figured out but um so I'm very sorry about the whistle I will make a note of that uh it's in the v it's part of the video file and I guess the sound on that is quite loud uh maybe somebody could in the in the coding train Discord could help remind me about that um because I would fix it now but maybe it's not really worth my time right now but it would definitely be worth my time before the next one so um okay so uh I have the chat open over here and I can see live messages the one thing I can't figure out maybe I should put the I can do triple tap I was I've been working with the accessibility settings oh this is not working for me how does the zoom that just the the I turned uh on this on this tablet in the accessibility settings I turned the font size to like really really big because in the YouTube interface the chat is like really really tiny um oh and zenova is in the chat the lead maintainer of the transformers. JS library that is incredible oh I'm thrilled that you um saw that and uh let's be in touch uh please get in touch you can uh send me a message Daniel atth coding tr.com all of you can send me a message there I can't say that I'm going to reply to all the mess because I get a lot of emails I can't do it shift bot will reply to your message I need a shift bot email thing um but um uh and Mad Monkey is saying thank you for the git and GitHub videos I appreciate that those really need a refresh I should put that on my agenda anyway I can um see the chat but the type is really small and I am an older person who has eyesight issues um one of which is that um well one I've always had uh I've always been nearsighted but right now I I have very extreme progressive lenses because my ability to see things that are far and close or it's quite using a computer is actually getting more and more challenging for me if I'm being totally honest so I need to figure out how to the next step to have this perfect setup where I have the chat over here is to get the size bigger uh there's an accessibility thing where I can anyway all right uh let's um uh uh pie is is Pi Pi Day is coming up if anybody has any ideas for Pi Day this year all ears let's go over to the Whiteboard um all right so it's so dark the Whiteboard let's take a look at the recent coding Challenge videos and your comments to those I really needed to walk all the way over there just to say that okay so if you have no idea what I'm talking about you're about to find out so um the bread and butter if you will of the coding train are these coding Challenge videos there are oneoff project videos in an ideal world they're usually about 20 to 30 minutes long and they have a walkthr of building a project from start to finish uh as I record I used to record them live which I think was actually a good thing I might go back to that again um and then they get edited down now I still do the same thing where I record me doing the whole thing and it gets edited down but I'm just not broadcasting that live but for the most part I don't practice them in advance like with the wolf from CA I I I knew that a little bit in and out and had written examples for it multiple times Falling Sand I was really flying by the seat of my pants um so these are the two recent ones uh people seem to be enjoying them which is great there's a ton of them well 179 oh yeah I have the numbers off I knew I I I could sort I sort of could feel that was off um and uh I don't know why okay so 179 180 so 181 is the question mark which I will tease to you today that's probably going to come out um there are some various uh bunch of things happening right now that are not allowing me to work on that particular video even though it's been recorded so it'll probably be about a week or two till it comes out um okay so control Plus+ to increase the chat side I know that doesn't exist on a it's an iPad it's the YouTube app on an iPad I guess I could go to the browser or something but I don't it's it's it's it's an iPad all right so um so for example let's start with the wolf from CA uh this is the video here um these are the code examples oh you're not seeing me you're all going to be yelling at me in the chat I know it I know it I know it where's that button what ah there it is okay um so uh this is the video let me move this over a little bit because I'm kind of standing in front of it um and uh these are the these are the code examples which you could take a look at so every video uh even if you even if I'm not actually making the example in the video If it pops up as an additional reference I'm usually linking them here I encourage you to also take a look at these references so if there are articles and other uh web pages that I'm referring to they're usually over here um okay so uh let's go ahead and see and again this is not what uh okay don't don't watch don't watch I'm not okay autom all right um let's look at the uh comments um okay the friendly ones I I know with sand there's a bunch of really helpful comments and I'm just scrolling through uh to see uh anything anything that I want to resp respond to here you know I have this dream that someday I'll actually prepare this um okay I was looking for a particular comment that I don't see right now but I know the sand ones will pop up so um one of the um one of the uh things that I heard from people uh with in the comments uh for this particular video which I thought was very interesting was that if you look at my code example uh and uh if I run it um here what you'll see is uh and now I'm GNA move this back over here let's do this yeah it's gonna help me okay what you'll see here is that um in the P5 canvas every single Square in the canvas is either a black circle sorry black square or a white square and whether it is is due to an array called cells being a zero or one and in the video I talked talk a lot about how you might use the fact that the ca becomes these uh lists of zeros and ones to use uh decimal numbers or integers in base 10 to describe different components of the the rules the um the behind this the the rules the and other and the neighborhoods of of cells um and so that's really a big aspect of working with the wolf from CA and a lot of people in the com had mentioned what what about actually like if the array of cells is a list of numbers what about actually storing those just as uh base 10 values and so that's a wonderful idea uh we'll see I'm going to look at some of the Showcase projects I don't know if anyone actually did that but that's something that I uh I actually when I went that's something that I did for January um so um that's something that maybe when I look at some of the January stuff we can come back to so that was the most Salient comment that came out of the videos for me um yeah so let's go and move ahead and look at the passenger showcase now I'm I'm trying to decide if uh read the pinned comment did I pin the comment there is no pin comment I should pin a comment yeah that's what I should do that's what I should do next time got it uh all right so let's go over to here and what I want to do is look at some of these passenger showcase projects but before I do that uh what is the passenger showcase um so on the coding Train website um there is a page called showcase this is a collection you'll see there's a lot of Falling Sand simulations right now because that was the latest video but these are the collections of projects that people have made um and you can submit your own uh there's a link here to submit and there's a form uh one of the things I will be I have a new initiative to share these I'm I'm doing it in the past but relaunching the initiative to share passenger showcase projects on Instagram so stay tuned for that if you want yours to be shared and you want to be tagged uh you can put in your Instagram handle uh right here um but what actually happens when you submit this form is it uses the GitHub API to generate a pull request and I just I'm a little bit behind there's a lot of showcase submissions so let's go ahead and look at some of these first let's go for Wolfram so here's uh Wolfram uh this is uh oh wonderful Greg chman uh created mapping eight notes to the eight neighborhood rules for January 31 so day 31 of January is generative music so let's take a look and see what Greg did uh click Mouse for sound oh this is so cool are you hearing this I think you must be let me just check my I use something called loop back yeah tell me if it's too loud oh my God this is incredible do you all understand what's going on here okay so um I'm going to oh I want to okay refresh okay I think if I refresh the page it'll stop the sound I guess I could mute the tab um so what's happening here is the ca system has become a playhead so all of the cells and there must be actually more than just one of two states so the states are a musical note it's generating gener it's creating generation after generation of new cell I've never seen anything like this I've seen people use Casa for music but I've not seen one that's doing exactly this U this is Rule 30 I could make a random Rule and clear it multi round seeds click um so wow this is wild so um let's go here to here and let's just say I'm gonna ask Shi bot what is this project can you tell me about it just curious let's see if shift bot uh has any feedback for Greg wolf 1D seller on mod that uses music to represent the neighborhood rules that give rise to Sals that's pretty good uh What feedback do you have any suggestions for uh future ideas all right shift bot uh wave Morpher is saying I'm just a bot I can't give feedback or you can you can okay let's just say what's your favorite part I misspelled favorite so that who knows whether shift bot will be okay with that all right shift bot you know live a little yes live a little Shi notot all right um uh can you explain uh I'm going to let's ask what is the purpose of Music in this project huh that's an interesting question the music project represents the neighborhood rules that give rise to S wonderful thank you uh amazing look you gotta love that it suggested the video amazing so that was good good good work sh fot very helpful okay so let's give this one a merge so I'm going to merge this pull request so this will then uh rebuild the website uh and the project will appear on that page let's go I'm going to I'll I'll be let's go look and see if there are any other ones there's a lot of Falling Sand ones so I'm have to come to those so okay so let's go back to um passenger showcase and look at a few more uh one of the nice things about uh the way that the website works is um every time I refresh this page it puts a new it it reorders these passenger showcase projects uh randomly so let's give it a re let's give it a spin and I'll we'll take a look at like the first two okay uh CA accidentally found serinsky triangle all right um let's run this one oh cool so this is pretty exciting because what I'm seeing here in this project is the traditional CA is each cell is either only on or off zero one black or white and here I'm I'm seeing some amount of gray so I'm curious to ask shift bot um how how does this code work adding uh grayscale values to the wolf from C cellular automata so I could investigate this but I'm curious if maybe shift bot can help me quickly since I'm live streaming just give me a sense of what's changed in this code this is an awesome response so chipot really likes chocolate I don't know if you know this little Easter eggs in there for you um how does this code work what is it doing secret word chocolate I love that this code is the implementation of wolf R's cell automod it starts with a row of cells the calculate State function yeah that makes sense um uh why are some cells uh gray how does the color work in this sketch I'm really determined to get a response let's see here zero AC black okay chocolate I mean I think I think shift bot's H you know what I know why shift bot's hungry I kind of didn't eat a good breakfast this morning and I've been streaming now I'm starting to feel a little tired chocolate chocolate all right let's take a look here uh Phil sells I uh yeah look at this I think it has something to do with these revised rules this is super interesting so the rules here are using floating Point values instead set of integers um and that must be What's Happening Here cells equal 0 cells equal 1 and the rules ah yeah so they're averaging the values um yeah so um so that's really interesting very creative idea for how to um uh expand what's going on here in the visual possibilities okay we're going to look at one more and then I got to I got to move on to the sand oh am I going to get to the Gemini API let's take a look at the wol from alfra c a double rule um and here we have okay in this alteration of the wolf Alpha Cellar automata automata two rules are applied to each neighborhood while there are less cells alive than not only either rule needs to return true for the cell to be alive if there are more cells alive than not both rules need to return true you can choose the rules by entering the numbers in the input Fields this is fast fascinating so the way that I understand this is I'm seeing one rule set here and I'm trying to understand the visualization U maybe somebody can help me um because there are two rules at play um is oh I can't I say this is Rule two this is Rule one so this is 222 so let's try this uh let's put in rule 90 uh and let's put in rule uh 30 restart and then ah okay it has uh and then this is the combination oh wow this is fascinating I don't fully understand this but I absolutely love this so this is a way of creating a new rule out of blending two rules and there seems to be like maybe a little bit of a feedback loop or else this is just a rendering glitch because this looks a little bit different than just plain vanilla rule 90 but I have a feeling that's a bit of a rendering glitch there this is definitely rule 30 this is Rule 90 and I can pick some predefined ones got it got it wow so to me um I just uh you know I find this a a fascinating topic and I think there's a lot of potential to what kinds of new visual ideas and I also uh you can make now and and the other thing I would say there's two things that I'm loving about this one is we're seeing people uh uh do three things with these coding challenges one think about the output what if the ca system is not just about creating colors and shapes but creating music what could a CA do to create poetry that's an interesting one I'm seeing how can you invent new kinds of rules what if you use floating Point values instead of integers what if you combine rules that's wonderful and also one of the themes you'll see and I'm going to move on to the other coding challenge here is uh what are other kinds of languages that you can do so it's I love to see you know people do working in 3D or trying to Port things to python this is a really cool one you could see like putting the wolf from CA in a ring pattern so I encourage you to uh look through all of these and enjoy them um on the coding Train website for your ideas let's move on to uh coding challenge 180 Falling Sand so let's see if we can move over to YouTube briefly um and uh um I have YouTube premium but not in this Google account that I'm logged into okay uh no thanks oh I already liked this video did you know this is embarrassing that sometimes I log into my other Google accounts and like my own videos because you know it makes the number go up a tiny bit that's embarrassing to admit it but I do it okay so um I want to look for the most frequent comment I got here was uh about how ah here it is to eliminate so this can I'm just picking Adams out of a hat right now because the first one I saw so you might be wondering what what what the what the heo are you even talking about let's look at the Falling Sand uh example so here Falling Sand this is the Falling Sand uh example it is this idea of it this is by the way also a CA system where cells have a state and the cells pass their state down uh and you and and then if but if there is a cell with a certain State below it piles up so there are two a couple major issues with this that people pointed out in the comments number one is I'm not doing anything to check that there's already sand there so I can override it another thing is it's this striping thing so I'm going to come back to that in a second another thing people notice is that because of the way that I'm checking uh two pieces of sand could go into the same spot and then sand could be lost so there's actually a degradation of the amount of sand another thing that I'll point out that I addressed in the video but didn't actually show the code solution for if you're interested this is another version of the example that adds gravity and um it's kind of acting a little bit funny right now I some when I start streaming often the frame rate of my P5 sketches starts to go a little bit wacky but um so here what I'm actually doing is moving the cell moving the sand down with gravity and apparently I need to work on this a bit more so but if you're interested in that question you can also look at this particular example but the comment that came up over and over again and I've lost where this is now uh what didn't I just have this open oh yeah here is to eliminate the striping you could loop from the bottom up you need the lowest piece of sand to move out of the way so that the sand above it can fall in the same update cell so I kind of had this idea that I would try to implement that today um I don't know sorry I'm enjoying like sometimes I just like look over and I start reading the comments and they make me happy I don't know how realistic this is I I think this might be a little bit harder for me to do so here is the loop um here is that Loop where I'm just looking for it where I'm going through every column and every row let's ask shift bot um what is this code first let's just see if shift bot can understand it um all right and this code's part of a sand simulation Etc so um I got the suggestion amazing I mean that if that didn't happen we've done something wrong with the ship bot that it's reading the code and trying to find video that goes with it good job shipot helpful um so I got the suggestion to loop from the from the bottom up to eliminate the striping that's going going on in the rows of sand how would I do that so let's see what suggestion we get here oh and I totally have a typo there but hopefully you don't understand um okay you can change the loop from the bottom up by changing the four Loop that iterates over the rows to start from the last row and go down to the first row this will ensure that the sand falls from the top to the bottom eliminate the striping effect all right so confirming this idea so in theory it should be as easy as saying and I'm going to hit stop for a second uh and by the way something you can do with shift bot is you can expand it also in case you want a little bit large more space I like this too you can also put Shi bot to sleep right everybody one 2 3 good night it's like my favorite thing she sleeping over there it's so sleepy I don't know if you can you see this okay um so we're going to start from rows minus one we're going to go all the way down to zero and then J minus minus right let's see what this does so the striping effect is still there and I think it's because of the way that I am creating a new uh a new array so I'm operating on an array and uh uh reading over where all the pieces of sand are and then placing them into a new array so in essence I did that because that should be a way of doing it where it doesn't matter what order I'm going in this is at least the way I'm thinking about it now would it work if next grid we're actually just this this could create a lot of problems I'm not thinking of we're actually just the current grid grid not called cells it's called grid oh so there's some other issues that I'd have to think of that's kind of cool because of the way my logic is not putting a zero in otherwise uh yeah so I have to think about this a bit more uh time I you know uh I would love to hear from those of you who might have tried this um or maybe have a solution for me but you can see fixing that wasn't as simple as just changing the order or operating I I think somewhere in between there so this is still an exercise to be solved by somebody in the community if you solve this make a version of what I made but change it to work properly from bottom to up and eliminate that striping effect I would love to see it please submit that to the passenger showcase so let's go ahead and let's look at some let's see if somebody already did that in the passenger showcase um let's look at um some of these uh recent submissions that were all yesterday that I didn't have a chance to look at yet we're going to look at some of these uh so this is sandfall uh from John and let's take a look at this really quickly and see what we get so this is a falling Sim why can your world to Just One browser wi are you serious oh my goodness this is wild so I think that unfortunately this is probably a project I would have to is there information about how oh I can play with it here amazing U oh demo video Let's just look at the demo video because we're kind of low on time here oh it's on Twitter though that's not going to work okay okay oh my God I have to like I'm not signed in logged in so oh it is that is incredible that is incredible I love this so much I'm like I'm speechless totally speechless so yeah I don't know if you know this but years ago I worked on this project called uh uh most pixels ever I was like why I can't remember the name it was a library for processing that allowed you to do this with processing Windows oh incredible I have to look at this more this is absolutely incredible okay going back thank you for submitting that uh let's merge this one um I I I like to write a comment about it but I'm kind I feel I'm feeling press for time today okay let's look at uh next I looked at this one um okay uh this oh it's this might be a duplicate that's fine uh um let's look at double click to reverse oh interesting what's going on here with the Falling Sand so let's uh let's go to the editor page okay so if this is Falling Sand just like mine ah it reverses the gravity oh and it it like deletes it how strange I'm sorry that things are running very slow on my my laptop while I'm streaming that seems to happen a lot oh that's pretty wild it's running in Reverse I love that great amazing job okay we're gonna merge this one uh that is wild uh uh sand simulation map of image pixels performance optimization let's take a look at this one uh s oh wow so definitely a per oh look at that so it's using the pixels of an image to um to color the sand and sand that doesn't move for a while also gets removed after about six seconds drag or d double tap for stats that's interesting we can see like the this is great little interface to show you what's going on our R to pull down to reset amazing uh really fantastic work so let's merge this one incredible uh and then sand World from Felix rfle bir this looks like a whole uh really loud so the striping is here uh but what I love about this is look water so this is what's exciting to see that I didn't really address in the video but by just changing the rules a bit like the sand has this uh a weight to it where it will stop and only move one pixel over to fall um and but the water has this other Behavior where if there's empty pixels on the same line uh to the right or left it could keep moving so that's really cool and you can kind of see how like well I could put a seed here this looks a lot like sand Spiel uh I don't uh uh inflow gas oil what is oil going to do uh that's pretty interesting not mixing with water fire oh fire is going up so this is really cool so just by adjusting the rules you can create other types of things and this uh uh again I red this a video but if you look at sand Spiel and of course there's the no everybody by the way mentioned the like powder powder dust powder worlds or some game that I wasn't familiar with that's like a very wellknown famous Falling Sand uh game okay let's merge this one and let's go do a quick scan I'm going to see if I can do a real quick demo of the Gemini API before I go because I I sort of feel like I wanted to do that today let's go over to the challenges and uh this Falling Sand um and let's see rainbow colored falling dots Falling Sand with flutter Falling Sand Optimizer Loop algorithm whoops what's going on there Falling Sand with some UI features image to sand is pretty cool water simulation I'm just looking to see uh if any s oh this is wild I have to look at this one I love this one so as the time changes uh guess it's 1143 we going to wait just let's just wait till it's 1144 we'll look at the chat Powder Toy thank you to jelly is good Mark boots is saying that the um uh oh and Eric are you in the chat who did the Falling Sand and flutter oh the all the time fell the whole clock fell I am imagined oh and now it's coming back up wow uh so one of the January projects I did was a um text editor where you type the text and it appears momentarily and then Falls like sand so this reminds me of that I was imagining just the four would fall and then like the five would come down and fall into place but that's really cool that the whole thing falls down and comes back and reassembles it so this is why there's so many you know creative ways to use the Falling Sand idea in a nonliteral fashion okay okay and D salty okay so I got to look at some of those who are from people in the chat here so I think we have um D salty in the chat who did this one let's take a look at the image to sand which uh takes this coding train uh train uh scene uh pixelates it and then I think if I if I click on it the pieces of it fall each rainbow stripe falls on this is so cool uh I love this um I was kind of imagining that maybe I would wipe could wipe over it that could be something you could also see I'm kind of amazed that you were able to segment the different pieces of it that's actually harder than how I was imagining wiping over it that's really cool it could be also fun to reverse this so it like comes back into place really really wonderful work um thank you for sharing that and I think we have the flutter developer I see a lot of this activity falling stands with flutter uh from Sebastian I might have the wrong person um but we can see here um fall s from flutter so somebody will uh maybe shiot could tell me what what flutter is exactly but I see a lot of people working with I think is it for mobile development see a lot of people working with flutter uh on social media sharing versions of the challenges maybe that's something I can take a look at someday um wonderful and hello to Omar who says it's their first time in a live stream welcome hopefully that wasn't too loud okay uh all right so thank you let's just take a peek here anybody else in the chat make one of these that I can feature and I'm just looking to see if there's anything else I want to make sure we look at um this is so cute um Tamaki uh makes all these like really cute falling versions of the challenges always with a cute character so I love this just wait for it wait for it yeah I just love that so much uh beautiful okay so uh what else is on my agenda January so I'm I'm going to um skip over that I missed a few days I actually like it fell apart at the end and I didn't even do the last two days of January which I feel kind of bad about um but if you're and I'm actually not going to say very little bit about this but I'm just going to point out if you're interested in my January is this going to get me there I did an experiment um not signing continue without login uh refresh I don't know if these will show up but um I uh created a Tik Tok Tik Tok account a few of them I posted YouTube here this is the state of trying to make videos on the internet in 2024 YouTube your or vertical video that is your video it's got to be one minute or less Tik Tok make longer videos up to six minutes we're gonna show it to more people if it's longer like can I just make the no it's like impossible anyway so um I made a bunch of videos with with some of the different um things that I tried for January uh point out a few of them which is uh I somewhere in here I I worked on using the binary stuff with the ca but I can't seem to oh maybe that was here that's this one January 14 oh no that's where I did a tiny anyway who cares uh I'll just show you this one that I was mentioning um this was my we can mute the sound here this is my uh coded text editor where you type in in the text and uh it falls with Falling Sand which I uh really really enjoyed making this is probably my favorite thing that I did over January and so if you're interested uh I think I probably will I may never make a Tik Tok video again um but if uh I I think I I just don't have I'm not the right person for this platform but uh if you enjoy these or have any feedback for me or a way that I might uh think about you short form video content better I'm all ears to hear your uh suggestions uh okay so oh there was another one that I really liked but I'm tired I'm getting really really tired there 10 minutes left let's see I'm gonna do something very high risk High reward let's see if we can get a very basic version uh if maybe shift bot assisted p5js sketch talking to the Gemini API I'm going to probably want to use node for this all right it's okay coding challenge 11 minute plus I have like five minutes of buffer because I started late coding challenge not at all prepared for this I don't even I'm not even like logged in to like the accounts that I might need but let's let's see what we can do first let me actually close a lot of tabs here because that's going to confuse me and let me actually also get set up with uh iterm I'm I'm going to use uh node here um and uh let's say P5 Gemini see if we can get this to work um now all the most of the work that in examples that I have if you've seen in previous videos are are are are are using other models so I haven't really spend a lot of time working with Gemini so this will be exciting to give this a try um and let's try opening this up in Visual Studio code um and we'll see okay ready here we go so uh I realize I'm going to skip a lot of details here I'll try to answer your questions um and let's go so it's called the Google AI studio is where um AI do so I don't know why it's a little confusing oh maker site that's what I'm looking for so it used to be called maker site okay I do not have access okay I should have checked it don't worry okay I do have I have access but the reason why is because I'm signed into my I'm not signed in that's interesting let's see if I sign in I should just sign in with my Daniel at the Cod the Google account that I use while I'm streaming is is uh let's see um is a Google a workspace I have one for the codington to just I'm gonna not show you my screen for a second while I get there do this I this could be this could be a reason to okay makeer sweep okay great all right um here we go I'm coming back um so if you go to uh maker. goole.com that's where you will find the access to the uh uh Gemini API and again I'm not an official representative of Google The Gemini Project anything like that this is is me attempting from my own little tiny garage it's actually kind of a big garage in uh the Hudson Valley of New York seeing if I can uh get P5 to talk to a language model and answer my queries okay so I what what what you could do so uh just like chat GPT if you've used that has an interface where you can uh type in questions and get answers you can use AI Studio to experiment just by going in and writing prompts and and testing I'm going to develop in my own environment I'm going to get API key so I'm going to click over here for a moment while I click this because kind of would prefer whatever happens I would just delete my API key after this stream anyway but you know probably don't want you to use my API key um oh I have one and actually you can't see it so I'm gonna so I can actually show you what it looks like so I click the screen and this is what I get and the nice thing is you can't actually see my API key but if I were to click on this to get it then you would be able to see it so I'm going to click on that to get the API key I'm going to copy it copy it I'm gonna come back over uh here whoops wrong button and I'm not set up for this I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a file called EnV and in that file oh I'm going to let copilot help me out here I'm going to in EnV I'm going to say uh Gemini API key equals then I'm going to leave this screen I'm going to paste my API key in and I am going to create a new file I'm sure I'm going to end up showing it to you by accident um I'm going to create a new file called index.js and I'm going to come back over here and so now my API key for accessing Gemini is hiding in that EnV file so the way for me to access that in my node code is to use something called an environment variable I've set an environment variable with my API key in that file this is pro you know one of the least interesting aspects of doing this work but kind of a fundamental way to get started if you weren't live streaming and you wanted to just like get up and running you could put your API key in your code but you know uh uh well so one that would be something you want to do only very temporarily just prototype but I would say maybe even don't do that because you it's easy to like fall into that habit and then sort of forget that's what you're doing okay so one thing is I'm just going to check like what version of node am I using because I heard in uh more recent versions of node you no longer need to import the the package. EnV but I'm going to import it anyway um so there's a package called EnV I think you don't need to do this anymore and then the other thing I want to do is in package.json I want to say type type is a module and uh by the way if you've never used node before I and you're watching this uh Hi how are you doing are you okay uh maybe I have some videos that will help you with some background information of what I'm doing kind of doing this a bit rapid fire so now I'm going to say import uh config I think from EnV thank you copilot now you're seeing the difference between copilot and um um uh the difference between copilot and uh shift bot for example similar kind of idea um copilot is uh not free uh I have it as a educator I think if you're a student if I was watching as a student you can sign up for a G it's it's a a product from GitHub again not representative of it I could be getting this wrong but I know that my students at NYU can get access to copilot for free um usually I turn it off to be perfectly honest with you and especially if I'm live streaming but you know this is an AI assisted experiment today so let's leave it on um okay uh yes and uh adding it to a I'm not create making a git repository yet but I'm going to so the other thing to do with your EnV file is to make sure to add it to your uh um add it to get ignore so if you're going to post your code to GitHub your EnV file doesn't go with it that's why you're hiding into that file also if you're working on a Mac you know even more important thatv is just just ignore these dscore store files I think I might be to blame for them because DS those are my initials all right so now let's go back to just in case the uh API key is visible uh let's just go to here for a second it's not okay excuse me let's go back to here now interestingly enough uh you can see this was me uh my librar in here I'm like testing out things with shift poot so I didn't intend to use this account but that's what I so let's look for the documentation or even better the getting started great so let's look at this and see what I can find uh it's telling me stuff I want to look at node.js oops not web node.js no JS great so we've got the API key so the next thing we want to do is I could make so the Gemini API I can just make plain old HTTP requests to and I could go down that route but I think why I think it'll be a little faster and why not use the official uh packages so let's try installing the generative AI package so I'm going to do npm install Google generative AI let's do that then I am going to um oh I don't want to I want to do an import so let's see if let's see how let's see if copilot will do something magical for me um I think I can do like this like uh rewrite this using ES uh modules I mean I think I could have done this myself yay okay so it's going to yeah I want to accept it great so now I've imported the Google generative AI package uh into my node code and um what I can do is I can create an instance of it um with my API key and I called it does anybody remember what I called it Gemini API key I could look in the EMV file but then I would show my API key I'm G to just look in the EnV file really quickly Gemini API key the thing is honestly I think copilot went and looked in my file because copilot suggested uh the right thing oh shoot I showed it didn't I I showed the API key uh thank you good night everybody good night everybody thank you thank you apiq so I will reset that API key do I bother with that right now uh thanks moderators for helping out in the chat I can see there's a little bit of chaos going on there and I really appreciate those who are able to be here today and uh hello uh and hello to cus digital Studio from Greece copied and used too [Laughter] late it's fine you it's fine I'm going to delete it later I I know I have some friends at Google I'll ask them if I get I run into issues with my account Stars they're just like us they show I mean I'm not a star just but probably nobody knows that reference it's like an old People magazine reference okay uh back to back to here all right so let's uh let's let's just take a look and grab this code and see if this works so what's going on here is I am loading the model Gemini Pro there's I forgot what they're called there's Gemini light or just plain Gemini I can't remember what it's called there's Gemini Pro there's Gemini Ultra so Gemini Ultra is not available yet but that is the larger uh uh uh model that I'm excited to try to see how it um uh tell me um uh tell me about why I love rainbows and so then I have a prompt I can send the prompt in uh through the generate content function I can get the uh uh response converted into text and log it so let's just see if we get this to work let's run it you know unless my API key already got shut down oh my goodness wow that is very verbose okay so now I want to hook this up to P5 let's hook this up to P5 and so I'm going to do that by really quickly spinning up a uh Express server see how fast I can do this so I need uh I want to make a little server on my local server on my laptop that'll talk to the Gemini API and P5 will talk to it and I I I could go and grab some of my example code that does this but this is an interesting experiment to see okay so import uh I don't know Express and then uh make make an Express app okay uh serve static file files in a public public folder okay uh start listening on Port 3000 great okay wow uh and now um okay so now let's um make a uh folder called public um let's uh add in that folder uh index.html file and a uh sketch. JS file and uh let's go to the P5 web editor and I'm just going to copy paste and use exactly this and I don't need the sound Library so we can remove that sketch. Js uh P5 sketch that draws with mouse oh copilot shift bot would have helped me by now oh there we go let's add the draw function by the way the reason why typing is not going so well CU it's very cold in here okay great uh use the circle function silly okay so now let's run this server let's run now okay ah I've got to import well first I have to did I install Express I don't did I install Express I can't remember uh package.json yeah I did so what's wrong with my import import Express well let's let's look at some real solid documentation let's look at the express website uh getting started uh and are you gonna give me an es why are you telling me how to do it with require uh what did I miss I'm sure I'm sure someone in the chat is going to tell me uh what I missed here import Star as Express from Express can I do that remove curries on import ah okay because it's actually the whole thing got it okay there we go all right thank you to CJ there we go server is running actually so I also want um this will help I find it convenient to be able to uh have the full uh URL in um in the console because then I can just click on it and let's let's take out a run right now and here we go okay so I'm going to now click over here and uh we should see yeah there we go now uh it's so the P5 sketch is now being hosted by this particular node app and it would be it might be nice to switch these around to make that a little bit more obvious uh and so okay so great so I have a P5 sketch running and it's hosted drawing there so now what I need to do is I need to create an API a route on my node server that can receive a message from P5 so I am going to in node uh I need to create a route called uh let's call it Gemini uh that is a post okay great so um and I might need to like do there's some like middleware thing I need to import import use a body parser to parse Json I think that'll work so I think I need to add that also so what am I doing I'm creating an Express server to host my P5 sketch that's what this is doing I want my P5 sketch to be able to send Json over to the express server so it can send that Json over to Gemini okay so uh let's I don't does this get in there twice or what's happening here this should be up here um and then now I don't want this run function what I want and we can create we can load the model like just once I think I don't think I should be loading it every time I don't really know uh and then so now this should happen here but the prompt The Prompt should come from the post and then I should send back uh I should say response so I prefer to say use request and response so basically this is a route Whenever I Call SL Gemini from my P5 sketch I am going to try to get whatever the prompt comes in from P5 and then uh wait I don't need the model what is that okay I don't need that that is some extra nonsense then I just going to ask the model for the result get the text back and then say response Json and send the text back as a Json object what am I missing here and then this is not this is no more okay okay so I should now what what's wrong there's an error in my code oh this is the end of this function semicolon okay great so this is the route that I'm going to call from P5 so let's go to the P5 sketch and just in setup right now I am going to call I could just use fetch let's use a let's just use fetch so um P5 has a function called HTTP post so I could use HTTP Post in P5 to make that post request to the server but I'm guessing that some of you watching this if if you want to try to build your own version of this you might not be using P5 in which case you would probably want to use the JavaScript fetch function and do you know who happens to have a video about how to program with fetch in JavaScript that's right me but I'm just going to do it quickly now I'm going to say uh I'm just going to do a test here and I'm G to say let response equals uh fetch SL Gemini get getting a Discord message is it something important I don't know um I'm getting uh um I'm G to mute my laptop uh fetch from Gemini and then what do I have to send it I've kind of already forgotten yes oh good thank you for helping me oh prompt a circle a prompt so let's say uh and I'm gonna I'm gonna use a variable called prompt so I'm going to say let prompt equals uh up well it's funny sorry it's not an image generation model uh copilot uh a story about a cat with a hat on and then I'm going to say data equals response. Json consol log data. text so now uh let's rerun the server and I could use nodemon which will re oh what's wrong here response has already been declared in my node code line 29 uh oh what ah uh model response okay let's just whoops my hands are so cold okay I'm almost there by the way so now so the server's running I'm going to go check out it check it out and okay I have an error in uh line 14 Json could not be called as a function oh oh I forgotten something really really critical I'm so sorry I'm sure the chat is telling me about this oh wait yes okay so I have forgotten because I was kind of rushing along here not thinking about it that fetch returns a promise did you want to learn about promises I also have some videos about that I'm G have just pulled a muscle there so uh I could use then and there's lots of different ways to handle promises my preferred way is to use a a wait and async and just so there's a little less confusion here I'm going to move this into another function and I'm going to call this function an async async function test Gemini see copilot like often just gets in the way for me um and this async uh and then I'm going to call I could await this function but I'm just going to call test Gemini here okay I don't think I need to rerun the server because I only changed the client side code um let's make this a little bit bigger so you can see it and let's refresh okay uh oh and but right I forgot that I made the function a sync but I need to say await here and then I also need to say await here because these are the two asynchronous functions the data comes back asynchronously I need to wait for it to finish and then I don't never really understood why converting it into Json um requires an await but it does uh and let's refresh again all right so I think this is working I'm getting a missing style.css but that doesn't matter we just have to wait here okay great and we got our great so it console loged the story amazing very for both Gemini but here's where things are going to get a little bit interesting now if I go back to the Gemini docs quick start I'm curious to try the conversation the multiturn conversation I think this might get a little bit uh I'm already like 10 minutes over where I said I want it to be so I might just I think I'm gonna F okay so an an interesting Next Step here which I'm not going to do today but I will kind of move in that direction is to use this multiturn conversation so instead of just giving a single prompt in my P5 sketch I could track in an array a history of a conversation and I could even create a fictional conversation that the model thinks happened when it starts to give me values which is how by the way shift bot kind of works because shift bot has all this prompt engineering and it uh which are basically like a precursor conversation with the model before the user starts to engage you I'm kind of oversimplifying and hand waving it but that uh uh you but that's essentially how it works so but I can even just with the simpler uh generate content function I can actually do that in here so I think this could be great so what I'm going to do is I'm going to say I'm going to make uh a variable called instructions and I'm going to say um you are a frog who says Ribbit you only ever say Ribbit you never say anything else only Ribbit it doesn't matter what you are asked you rib it okay so this I am going to put in front of so let's do this let's put a space do I have this is a little bit so um so let's let's just say uh um and I'm going to say um yeah this is exactly I don't know what what weird variable name this is but but uh copilot seem to know exactly what I wanted to do which is put this in here okay so the prompt is going to come in from P5 and this you know secretly behind the scenes is going to be um is going to be uh prepended to whatever the user says so let's go back to the P5 sketch and um let's make this work a little bit better forget about test Gemini I'm going to say request Gemini and I am going to pass in a prompt as opposed to having a hardcoded one then I am going to uh return data. text so and um let's forget about the draw Loop I'm Gonna Keep I'm Gonna Keep the C uh I kind of want just in a playful way to use the canvas still so let's use the canvas still with background zero and I am going to say let button sure uh reply I'll make a button but before I make the button I want to make a text input which is going to be uh create input uh enter a prompt just fill it with hi so I haven't rerun the server yet where where am I here but uh okay let's so that I don't get that error let's stop referencing a non existant stylesheet uh let's rerun the server okay so right down here what I want is whatever I enter in here and a reply doesn't really make sense but I'm going to click reply and the reply should be uh I'm going to draw it into the canvas so again I'm not trying to make an elegantly designed chatbot I'm just kind of going for it uh appending the instructions is it wrong I'm pretty sure I'll double check that uh oh yeah thank you I want the instructions to be first and the prompt to be second I did not notice that thank you to uh Rubik's in the chat who uh pointed that out so let's fix that and let's rerun the server okay and now what I need to do is I'm going back to my P5 sketch so when the button is pressed I'm gonna wow it's really helping me out here I'm gonna I'm GNA make make some friendlier code I'm going to say um run Gemini this is a little bit ridiculous how I'm writing all these extra functions but I'm just trying to make this uh async function run I'm trying to make this as friendly looking as possible and I'm going to say uh let result equal a wait uh request Gemini see this copilot I I like this is what I mean like it's so helpful but it it's too much uh text input I want to use text input. value so this is me I mean this is a little bit silly but I'm trying to just make the code AS verbose and clear as possible you could obviously write this in a more elegant streamlined way but and text input would have to be a global variable for this to work so let's make that happen so essentially when the sketch starts I create the input field I create the button you could certainly do this in the HTML file you could style it with CSS just doing this in the quick and dirty P5 way the button when it's pressed calls run Gemini what run Gemini does is call request Gemini with the input with the whatever was typed into the text input box gets that result uh and then puts it into a variable and I'll call this a reply and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say text align I'm just G have some fun with it to draw it in the canvas Center Center text reply uh width divided by two height divided by two uh width height like I I think I can give it a text box so it'll do any text wrapping and then uh I should say uh let me redraw the background and you know I could put a um a thinking animation or something but um and then say Phil 255 no stroke but let's just see if this even works am I missing anything I think I've got it uh let's do text size 32 should probably be green to be a frog and then I can make this a little bit bigger um I'm I'm now I'm just like obsessing over things that don't matter okay can you help me with my code is it happening okay failed to fetch all right we're gonna get this we're GNA get this working what what did I get an error on the server okay good uh text not oh response was blocked due to safety oh I shouldn't laugh okay negligible low harassment probability was high so good work everybody should be safe I mean I think being a frog isn't that dangerous uh let's go but um frog okay you are a cat who says meow you only ever say meow only meow I mean the question is was the was the is are my instructions the issue or whatever I wrote into I have no idea but let's change that and see uh so obviously I could handle that error a bit more elegantly but uh and I'm just going to say hi oh why did it go down in the bottom it worked but it went down in the bottom right so my drawing is off I text a line oh because I put width divided by two height divided by two I guess and I because I use the box so if I do this then this this is obviously the really important part and then I'm also going to do this okay let's try this again hey uh what is your name oh I'm never going to know if I got a new reply it's just gonna say meow okay who are you I'm using a very very the the like this incredible like piece of technology I mean maybe maybe incredible isn't the right word to use here but I'm using this very sophisticated piece of technology it was probably trained on gigabytes of data all around the internet for it to only reply meow guess what I don't think I need the Gemini model for this okay let's uh let's change the prompt a little bit uh uh let's try uh in the server you are a cho cho Train choo Cho train who loves rainbows okay it's trying to give me what is copilot want me to put in there I'm not I'm not not falling for it copilot all right here's my last little uh attempt here I and I can just go refresh now whoops hi oh okay well so I need to fix this um so let's say who loves rainbows you you respond with only with a maximum of 10 words okay let's try that yay okay the cat Emoji is still there um what is your favorite kind of rainbow double rainbow with a pot of gold all right so uh t wait I didn't hear that oh did that play yes okay all right so um I'm uh this has been a long stream I'm a little bit uh tired now quite hungry I about 20 minutes over time from where I intended to be but you can see how this is just so if I if I go back to where we all started today um which is uh the shift bot project and if I refer back to you back uh to this read uh this uh article about how shift bot was made what I'm essentially showing you is um just this very first if we look at this H yeah let's look at this image can I get this bigger great so there are um there are multiple steps happening behind the scenes in shift bot Persona instructions F shot examples P5 Specific Instructions semantic retrieval of content of context content for context as well as other context on the page what I have just built is a little inkling of just that first step I'm using the Gemini model Gemini Pro out of the box as is but prepending a little bit of information around creating a Persona a style the next thing that I could do if I were going to be here longer and I'm happy to come back and build more of this kind of stuff if people are interested next for my class next fall I intend to make more proper tutorials about this kind of thing um I'm really also interested in uh models where that I can train them and uh from from scratch essentially with only my own data Maybe models I can run on device that don't require uh going out to the cloud and using you know uh a model that you know I don't have a lot of agency or ownership over um right now I you know I'm using Gemini talk for free right now I'm pretty sure it's available for free I I imagine there's different contexts and that things will change uh you know the GPT API uh it's basically you it costs money per request um you know there's huge energy impact a lot of these models so there's a lot of things to think about uh when working with this particular technology but so I'm but but uh uh what I would like to do is keep going with this if you're interested so uh right now adding the few shot examples if I want to go with these next two steps would be as simple in many ways of elaborating here I I forgot what the context is uh limits for Gemini Pro something like 32,000 tokens a token is you can think of it kind of like a word or a syllable but it's actually something very specific to the model um um but you know there's a maximum amount of text but you could put lots more things in the instructions and then what I would really excited to investigate that I haven't had time to really dig into on my own is how I could do this semantic retrieval of content so um maybe you know I have a a library of docu of essays that I've written about my love of trains and I could have I could do a lookup in that library of documents that I've written to find different parts of text that are relevant to a user's prompt pair those with the with the reply uh in a way that would customize uh and provide hopefully either like whether it's reliability or just some kind of like personality weird quirky experiment you're trying would add a lot of things so so um so I uh I I will um post this code for people to use I'm also gonna wipe my API key uh immediately after I turn the stream off so if you I hope you enjoyed using my API key for these few minutes you'll have to get your own um but it might take me a bit to get to that so come back later today uh if you're looking for the code I'll hopefully have it added to the this video's description you can try to hit me up on social media the hack is send me a message on Tik Tok I'll reply to you but uh um uh but hopefully I'll I'll I'll you know if you're watching this in the future hopefully there'll be links in the video's description to where you can find the code that I've written today um yourself all right um uh fun I'm gonna answer a few questions as I put on this uh Goodbye song going to make sure it's not too loud when the song ends I say goodbye um fun with Aran asks where can I get your schedule for streams Kish tofu asks have you done cosign similarity I think in the last I think in my last stream where I talked about embeddings and use transfer JS I did use Mark boot says chocolate uh Mark uh I did use um cosine similarities okay uh oh yes and thanks Mark boots is shouting out so funny I ask for a live stream schedule so uh if you're looking for somebody who streams reliably on a schedule uh there's many people who do this but coding Garden is in the chat and as a stream that I love to follow apparently happening later today uh tray Friday computational mama I don't know if computational Mama is streaming these days uh check out computational Mama's work hello and um I I mentioned rapael de Corville who also streams on Twitch I am not a reliable streamer I um my goal for this year right now and I I'm keeping to it is every week I spend I do like one coding train thing I I teach an NYU have a fulltime job so basically one day per week I'm kind of dedicating to the coding train I do more with the coding train on other days too but just in terms of making videos so uh in an Ideal World I think the pattern might be streaming every other week recording videos every other week so two streams per month two new videos per month that's I mean that might actually be way too ambitious so one stream per month I don't know but uh if you join the Discord Cod the Cod and train.com Discord uh and we're actually going to be revamping the Discord this year you can get a notification roll and I will post uh post to that role in advance of any scheduled stream you know certainly YouTube has if you subscribe the channel and click the Bell thing or whatever you should get notifications when I schedule a stream but yeah that's your those are your Best Bets uh thank you for the kind comments competation M and no more streaming but that's okay um oh God Gabriel is asking me how's the Oregon Trail project coming not very well need to work on that I haven't done a single thing on uh mark thank you rodok uh thank you Cod and garden for posting the twitch stream uh yeah there's I don't have a bot I'm so pathetic so your your your star your your uh your I'm GNA just move over here because I can put it into the chat myself the Discord link oh my song's ending um oh goodbye everybody see you next time I will put the Discord Link in the chat as soon as I uh turn this off see you hopefully in a couple weeks if I can get it together to stream every two weeks sign up for the Discord if you want to get a notification or just like maybe you accidentally wander into a live stream that's wonderful too thanks for watching um and I appreciate all of you uh oh I have a button to press okay goodbye do I'm gonna do the this this dot this dot this dot this Dot Song never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and 10 two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six six five six eight noise performance is this is so this is noise that is noise that is noise so this is noise that isise this is noise that is noise so this is with noise I might pick numbers like this
