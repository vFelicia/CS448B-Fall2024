hello good afternoon welcome to a special surprise sort of episode of the coding train I happened to be here at NYU for a couple meetings today oops I'm looking over here and so I thought I would pop up here to the studio and do a quick little experiment I've been as some of you might been following my channel I had a bicycle accident and I have a bunch of different broken body parts most seriously here this elbow this is actually now a splint which is different than I was wearing in the last video that I made and this actually comes off and I've started physical therapy but I've got another few weeks to be wearing these things it looks like I could maybe type but it's pretty uncomfortable and not the best thing for my body so I'm still holding off on doing typing I'm hearing an echo because I have a monitor I would love to know if the sound is okay I'm just gonna turn off this okay so that should get rid of the echo so I have something that I've installed on my computer here and I'm gonna do a quick experiment here wake up hello coding trained viewers how are you today it didn't work oh I'm in the wrong application try this again hello coding trained viewers oh shoot this was working so well this worked a minute ago let me try to open up TextEdit and hello Kotick trained viewers correct Kody's coding trained correct reviewers viewers exclamation mark so this I've been using a bunch of different dictation software I'm just gonna leave this on to be amused by how its following what I'm saying and getting lots of things wrong Mac OS has builtin dictation the software that I've installed here is actually called dragon speaks naturally and there is the sound might be a little bit loud okay this is a different microphone setup and I'm gonna oh yeah it's way up way up and turn the mic down okay is that better okay so high for Cody's viewers okay so what was I going to say I watched this YouTube video the other day I'm gonna try to pull it up here let me see open Chrome Google coding by voice Python Python correct pika I gotta get you this let me oops oh my goodness it's opening up eclipse there's a ghost in the machine you should open up a guy I'd still go to sleep oh and now is it too quiet no I see the levels are fine so scratch that by the way if you haven't watched my channel before it this is what I do it would have made sense for me to like set this up practice it and figure out an actual way to get it to work instead I just installed it and thought to come up here turn on a light public stream which apparently has some number of people watching right now like 500 to 26 while I'm fumbling my way through this okay go to sleep okay so you can see when I say go to sleep I can't do my typical actually maybe I can this right here wake up go to sleep so I need to remember to do that and to wake it up when I want to actually dictate wake up coding by voice YouTube's correct code E coding go to sleep oh yeah so this is a YouTube video that I will pull up so I recommend anybody watching if you're interested to watch this video Tavis Rudd is a developer who mostly programs in Python who had a rock climbing injury he tells the story in this video and set up a very elaborate system to do everything with dictation and in fact he continues to use this system today even though he's mostly I believe recovered and Ken type but he still does everything by voice now he used an open source API that I forget what it's called but it's in this video that works with dragon speaks he uses Emacs and vim which are specialized text editors that you can use in a terminal window so I haven't done any of this but I I'm curious you know fit but you know this may take a while to setup and I would love any help with this if anybody's interested okay could raise the volume a little bit sorry I'm gonna just turn the volume up a little bit now on my mic got distracted by the chat in that message let's see how that is it's a little bit up now okay so I watched this video I've been looking into kind of interested in trying to do a similar setup just as an experiment so I thought I would try to do today very briefly see how far I could get with just what's in Dragon speaks by itself without any additional settings or macros or interfacing with an API and the processing development environment ultimately I might like to try to set up to work with like atom text editor maybe atom live preview something like that clearly these systems I've been using it to send emails they it works remarkably well to dictate written English so something that I might write in an email or a word processing document even filling out a form in a webpage the dictation works quite well it also has some commands to operate the computer that I haven't really learned yet so we need to learn those but it is absolutely not set up in any way to do coding so some of the things that I imagine I'm gonna meet to you do like curly braces and variable names with camelcase or underscores it's not going to do any of that in an elegant way natively so I thought I would try to see what it could do what all the pitfalls are and maybe make a mental list or maybe some of you are watching could kind of take notes and send me a list of what are all the features that I might need and most of these features have been solved and implemented by Tavis run if you watch this video does this like almost wild performance of this strange language that he's invented to talk to his computer and but I'm kind of and maybe I could piggyback off of that system in some ways but I thought I would kind of start over a little bit from scratch here okay so I'm looking at this let me just come over some people are asking in the chat I'm gonna walk over here to the whiteboard just to explain here what's going on so first of all I have pretty good my shoulders are perfectly healthy and I can move around I have a what's it called scaphoid is that that's not the right word a very small fracture in this wrist from a bicycle accident it will hopefully heal on its own and in about a few weeks this will come off and I will do some physical therapy but hopefully this will just pretty much be fine good as new so to speak within the next few weeks the more serious injury is here this elbow I learned all the names of the bones and the different things but googling I've got can't come up with any of them on the fly right now but the elbow bone broke really split off right in half detached itself this way so this tricep muscle wasn't not attached to anything and so it's been repaired with surgery I have some artificial bone I have a metal plate I have a couple screws and this is actually a splint for protection to hold it in place but this actually comes off and I do physical therapy three or four times a day and what I thought I'd try to program was a simulation of the range of motion that I have so currently if I use this arm you know I can extend it all the way I actually can hyper extend it but this would be zero degrees this is maybe about 160 degrees something in radians my range of motion if I were to take this off and try to do the physical therapy now which I quote is currently about sorry it's about 15 degrees I can get to about here 15 degrees and then I can't this is much harder so I can get to about 125 degrees and so I'm hoping to get all the way back to 03 around 160 and this will take quite a bit of time the physical therapy so that's my current status I have taken let me say another couple things I basically taking this month July off I did one live stream from my apartment just to say hi to the channel and I'm doing this today maybe for another half an hour or so but I'm pausing for those of you who are supporting me on patreon that's patreon.com slash coding train I'm going to put it on pause so none of your donations will be taken for this month of course if you would like to anyway you're welcome to make a contribution the best way to do that is through nature of code comm which is I have an online system for purchasing a book but what I would suggest in lieu of the patreon contributions this month if you're looking to support something to make a donation to processing foundation org so you can check that out I also as an experiment enabled that YouTube super chat which I'll probably just turn off but since I'm experimented with so many different things today I thought I would see how that works I kind of have mixed feelings about the whole super chat system I don't I don't particularly like the idea of paid chat messages and I want to go on a long discussion of that but I thought I would turn it on and see and then I'll probably turn it off again because the crowdfunding that I'm using mostly for this channel is oh actually exclusively is through patreon service okay that aside Kody in the chat whoops Kody in the chat asks does anybody know how long Dan won't be able to type I'm hopeful my you know as much as I love doing this YouTube channel and it is it brings me so much happiness to be able to be here and do this my alt my my main goal is to be able to be back and typing by the fall semester which is early September III think I need at least a few more weeks of rest healing and physical therapy before I'm gonna have more significant use of these arms you know I can kind of do some one finger typing I've been doing dictation for emails but we'll see it'll be a while before I'm you know sitting for I certainly don't think that I can sit for hours at a stretch typing you know it's probably not the best thing in terms of you know the kind of exercises in use of the arm that I should be rebuilding okay so I don't actually know the answer to that but I will be happy to provide updates I'm gonna be out of town next week having a nice little break and vacation and then I'll be back in town and having more physical therapy and doctor's appointments so we'll see if anybody wants to see my xrays you can follow me at shipment on Twitter I posted them if you want to join my patreon I posted some more pictures of the scar and swelling that you probably don't want to see but if about this now okay scratch that going sleep I should be nice to dragon so then go to sleep sounds very like command like I need to like rework I like to be very polite good thoughtful what apologize a lot I need to work on that with my dictation stuff okay somebody posted voice code dot IO I'm not active on Instagram now okay so what time is it now first I have another thing shoot okay wait somebody created a new song it's on soundcloud it was based on the minesweeper it was a play on it's floodfill time I just forgot how it was it's in a youtube comment maybe I can find it sound cloud somebody can find it for me and then give me the URL in slack that would be great I'm gonna look for it in YouTube comments cuz I think I have a way of doing that here so I can play this song I'm going on this computer Oh somebody found it already thank you alright cuz I had shared it so i ke b is h o P I am typing right now just using one finger on each hand so it's very slow and let's see it's let's whoops let's play this one oh you can't hear it I have to change some settings here sound loop back no multi output device I think I need to do that maybe you can hear it but it's very quiet yeah I know I have to change the settings you can listen to this on your own time it's very quiet well maybe I'll come back to it later okay so let's see how this goes now but thank you like bishop I love these remixes and I should let you know that there's a new theme song coming a music video I shot all that with some collaborators which I'll post about before I had this so I fully used to my arm then okay so let's see here so I'm now in processing so let's see if I can get some stuff happening here people in the chat are asking why so much offtopic discussion I don't know if you're asking me that question or asking the chat question but unfortunately those of you who are here to hope that my neural network series is continuing and hope that I'm gonna do a lot of coding I apologize I'm sincerely sorry you're just gonna have to wait on that I probably won't be back I definitely won't be back until August with any of that content and it could be a little bit later depending on how things go I've decided that this month July is just a kind of month hiatus but I thought since I was here I would try to turn this on and and say hi and do a little bit of stuff so so here we go let's see wake up void setup oh I'm in the wrong void setup I'm getting okay hold on why is this happening let me relaunch processing it was typing and it was I was I did actually test and it was dictating into processing earlier and not sure why it doesn't want to do that now using the mouse is definitely the hardest thing the trackpad that is Kancil correction go to sleep I know it happened I was in the correction mode oh I turned off my mic you you okay now I'm back okay okay okay I'm back did you guys hear me answer the question about why so many offtopic discussions was the mic just making noise oh boy all right I don't know what I had the mic I'm all messed up what a disaster okay did I talk about the music video that's coming that I talk did you hear me talk about that I'm not doing the neural network stuff for a while because of this etc I can't yeah okay and I'm getting some very good advice which is don't necessarily rely on the YouTube chat for sound feedback as i okay so I don't know why I'm not able to get the dictation to work in processing let me see wake up void setup okay so maybe I need to question mark okay also only certain applications are supported what does it mean you can dictate into an unsupported application if you want to dictate into an application that's not on the supported list but try not to use your keyboard or mouse I see that's going to be a problem because I'm definitely gonna whoops all right let's don't it all right let's figure this out maybe if I relaunch it so you guys just have to bear with me here for a second oh so sad oh there we go scratch that scratch that correct Seth area correct Seth as soon as I clicked my mouth my mouse it stopped allowing me to dictate oh that's so sad well here's problem number one open processing open Adam open Adam let's try this well this is going to be a failure correct be a failure be a success exclamation mark new line scratch that all right now now the thing is I'm a little bit concerned that if I new line if I start to use the mouse to delete something let's try that I'm going to do command a go to sleep wake up test one two three okay so already I'm having better success with Adam okay I have an idea go to sleep wake up open terminal C D slash tilde slash users oh no no I don't need that desktop PWD new line PWD new line p WD new line you're lying go to sleep okay so I the reason why I wanted to attempt this experiment with processing is that it was it's an allinone environment and I wasn't going to have to switch between the browser and the text editor but let's try doing this in Chrome let's start doing this okay so I want to go open Chrome Oh wake up wake up go to open Chrome open Chrome go to sleep do I have to be in the finder how do i how do I get to the Dragon commands if I'm not if I don't want to be dictating it to terminal open Chrome wake up open Chrome how many viewers have I lost now there's probably nobody watching anymore okay correct flagrantly oh my god fascinating this is fascinating to see how the software works and what kind of it's not free software and this is a dragon naturally speaking trollese go to sleep go to sleep okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to go to p5.js org and we go to download and I'm gonna download p5.js complete and gonna go find this I'm gonna open this up and I'm gonna get empty example and I'm going to put it on the desktop then I'm gonna go to Adam and I'm gonna say open desktop empty example and sketch touch yes okay this is good I'm gonna delete everything now I'm gonna go back to terminal oh I'm standing in front of this wake up Python space M M simple is it case sensitive let's see yeah go to sleep so already I need some sort of so if anyone's making a list for me to keep track of things that I need to investigate if I'm actually going to do this two things is one why doesn't processing work with dragon and insider' a way that I can get it to two is what is a way for me to write some sort of macro command I need I could just say start server to drag in and it's going to automatically launch the server and then I need to be able to figure out a way if I'm in atom two with a command my goal here would be as a experiment as an academic experiment here you know I'm I have some use of my hands but what would it what would it mean to code without any use of hands whatsoever I need to do everything completely for voice how would I get from Adam to Chrome Oh voice code dot IO Simon in the chat is suggesting how interesting I will have to take a look at that I will take a look at that I mean I'm not going to purchase it right now voice code dot IO advanced voice control platform interesting okay I'm going to take a look at this later so that's interesting so if I go now to localhost oops I did it on the desktop that's fine desktop empty example and if I open up the console okay so now if I go back to Adam I definitely need a way of triggering command s so how do i with dragon switch to finder I don't know so switch to Chrome instead of open Chrome let's try that wake up switch to Chrome go to sleep so that didn't seem to work so if anyone wants to look at the Dragon documentation and help me out here give me some tips switch between Windows with naturally speaking you can say switch to to change the window I'm getting that message in the chat okay we are here to waste time with this useless voice app yes so if you're not interested in that thanks for watching I switched to Google Chrome okay wake up switch to Google Chrome hmm that didn't seem to work either scratch that go to sleep all right okay here let's give this a try okay wake up function setup correct so setup choose to open paren close paren curly brace scratch that open curly bracket new line new line create canvas correct create campus create canvas create canvas create canvas scratch that scratch that scratch that create canvas hmm so good sleep okay so here's item number two I need say start Google Chrome I'll try that so I need to come up with a way of stringing words together without spaces and using camel case and I know again with the video that I referenced the tavis rudd video this is all something that he worked out for coding in Python right now I'm just making a mental list of things so I need to be able to say create canvas and I probably could also just create I could probably pull the p5 API and like put that in as a bunch of like add that to a dictionary I can probably work through instance from sort of training yeah so there's probably way too fine I'm getting this I'm getting this this folio a way to define a dictionary so switch to next window list all windows okay wake up list all windows list all windows scratch that scratch that go to sleep so that didn't seem to work either yeah scratch that scratch that the scratch that song never forget the scratch that's mmm wake up open parentheses 640 comma 480 go to end correct 4480 correct 4480 go to end go to sleep so how do I move the cursor around I mean I can obviously do that with the arrow keys so that's another if anyone's keeping a track of this list how I move the cursor around is something that I need to be able to do wake up semicolon go to end go to sleep so go to end is something that I was using when dictating emails and other things were it would immediately move the cursor to the end but that didn't seem to work okay here wake up function background open paren close paren open curly braket new line correct background draw go to sleep so weirdly I've noticed this is another bug that seems to be in dragon when I tell it to correct something it kind of selects the wrong area it you notice how it's selected it missed the B and it selected the parenthesis so I don't know if that's just because Adam is not technically supported so it wasn't able to select the right thing okay wake up background open paren 51 semicolon newline fill open friend correct fill whoa okay so it lost correct fill choose to open paren 255 semicolon newline ellipse scratch that rect mode all right so a whoa go to sleep so another thing is to again this builtin dictionary if we're camel casing because what if I want to create like write a function or declare a variable that doesn't exist but then also have a builtin list of words those are two of the things I need wake up all caps Center go to sleep that work pretty well I know it's not going to understand this wake up open paren Mouse X correct now Mouse comma Mouse Y comma 16 comma 16 so again I have the same scratch that go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep I know that's the children's song it's I listened to that have with my kids Elizabeth Mitchell sings it go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep my something I can't remember the words close curly bracket wake up close curly bracket go to sleep now there must be a way that I can do command s there go to sleep my there must be a way don't correct the word you said there must be a way for me to say command s right for save now I can actually just type this in and it will auto format I have Adam configure to auto format the code which is nice like all that white space errors I don't really care about but there should be a way for me to say command s then I should be able to say switch what if I go here to commands help help oh I'm in the correction window correction window okay so these are all the well it's like Safari okay so I'm gonna have to look wake up global applications I'm sorry that the font there's no way you guys can read this activate it looks like the word is activate activate Adam or wake up activate Adam activate Chrome activate Adam activate Chrome activate Adam activate Chrome's quick photos thank you scratch that go to sleep I wanted to talk to me why I want to talk to me I'm talking to it I'm being as nice as I can alright that's good now how do I do command s commands a global menu navigation click click file menu but there's got a way to click save choose file close window copy selection go to beginning go to end save would be under s save this document okay wake up new line your line safest document Oh go sleep it did it wake up activate Chrome refresh this page that was a fantasy that that would work go to sleep I have a feeling that it's gonna be happier with me using Safari just based on the fact that I saw so far II show up but I don't know that I could bring myself to do that okay so I can hit refresh hey move mouse I can move the mouse with my one finger Oh dragon quit unexpectedly reopen so that's my quota challenge for today through dictation I was able to use p5.js to create a simple program of moving the mouse around now I wanted to try to simulate my range of motion so I'm seeing um so what time is it 15 I've got to go by 230 because I have some meetings so let's see if I can get a little further and maybe answer some questions I don't know what else I could do no coming back another time okay so let's see here let me think about this so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to draw a line that is you know what I should do when I'm doing my physical therapy is I should monitor my physical therapy with a Kinect and actually measure the angle so that's something I'll do eventually that's a good idea right cuz the Kinect should be able to determine the angle for the range of motion that I'm getting here I have to work on that once I get up and once they get up and running with this whole programming education thing okay so let's see here so let me delete this wake up Oh microphones off stroke open paren 2255 correct 25 to 55 go to end end of line Oh choose 1 go to end so this has to be low go to sleep this has to be lower case wake up new line line open paren 360 comma 240 comma 400 comma 240 new line float a equals correct floats choose three correct equals equals equals symbol scratch that equal sign go to sleep say I've learned that equal sign is what I have to say for equals which I should probably alter the settings so that I just have to say equals that's another thing so altering some of these settings oh I mean I've been job that's correct I forgot oh they care camera still goes off camera on look at that neck dictation suddenly worked with that camera amazing wake up correct floats select floats go to sleep yeah so this is it being off so I've seen this behavior this seems like a bug to me I don't think I'm doing anything wrong notice that it selected the correct number of characters but in the wrong place it should select this float so why is it not working I don't know wake up bar scratch that shoot go to sleep so the other thing is I'm often in that correct mode how do I cancel that correct mode let's try this again wake up var a equal sign map choose to open paren Mouse X comma 0 comma width correct 0 choose to correct width choose 2 comma 15 comma 125 correct now thanks Mouse X so I have to figure out a way scratch that go to sleep so I have to figure out a way to there's probably way I could spell that out if in a custom way but again that's the sort of dictionary thing I mean I I said var hey witch why not keep that but I meant this to be a so what I'm doing here is I'm trying to map the mouse position to a range of angles which is currently yesterday my physical therapy this is the range of motion that was measured so I was able to get to about 15 degrees to about 125 degrees that's I'm not actually it's more like this probably and I you know I want to get to 0 and I want to get to about you know probably 160 okay so now so one thing I want to do now that I'm gonna use rotation I don't want I want to draw this line relative to 00 I think that'll be nicer so I'm gonna say I'm gonna add and wake up translate open paren with / comma height / close paren semicolon go to sleep all right so that's interesting I got with / they probably should have said with / maybe that would have worked wake up correct with / with / correct with choose to correct tightened by my height / go to sleep okay so I'm learning getting closer oops you lazy the dictate so I'm gonna change the line to go from like negative 100 to zero zero zero and then now wake up line open paren zero comma zero 100 comma zero scratch that zero comma zero comma 100 comma zero correct choose it actually gave me the full option of what I wanted scratch that zero comma zero comma 100 comma zero correct that choose to correct why scratch that scratch that put that back go to sleep oh my god this is not working at all I just curious there's got its got to be like less than 200 people watching at this point with you go outside smell the flowers give somebody a hug appreciate things besides me here okay alright alright oh yeah let me let me get back to things all right let me wake up whine openparen zero comma zero 100 comma zero choose two save this document activate Chrome activate Google Chrome localhost go to sleep so I need some way of immediately going to localhost and navigating somehow to the web application that I want to look at again if I was just doing this in processing I'll just need to say run run stop or play stop that kind of thing but since I couldn't get that to work here we are uncaught syntax error sketch das line 12 wake up activate atom I know sleep I need a comma here wake up wake up comma save this document activate Chrome refresh that didn't work so I don't know how to refresh with a command ok there is there is the line ok we're doing well now rotate open paren a closed paren semicolon correct a go to sleep so that needs to be a lowercase a just probably wait for me to say that and this should be the word rotate so obviously I'm still doing way too much with one hand here and I'm kind of running out of time here but let's see how this open let's see how this goes and by the way you might be wondering why am I looking this way whenever I start talking it's because I have a monitor over here that has exactly what you see it's it's so that I can do this and I can say I'm pointing to line I'm pointing to rotate a pointing to VAR a but for some reason I I really what I need is a monitor up there so that I can look more like I'm talking to you but for some reason I have this habit of just looking at the screen over here which is a little bit weird okay let's see and wake up save this document and activate Chrome Oh didn't wake up wake up save this document activate Chrome go to sleep so whatever my refresh command would be mmm so so my angle is wrong right so I actually don't want this is this is not what my harm does I want it to go from so this is the thing I always forget in a computer graphics system pointing down is positive pointing up is negative and rotation right this is rotating 15 degrees so I actually want to be between negative 15 degrees and negative a negative 1/25 wake up activate atom go to sleep so in the interest of time this by the way should say so this should be between negative 125 and negative 15 and guess what also what are these measurements in these measurements are in degrees natively most computer programs graphics programs will think of angles in terms of radians so I actually need to add something else wake up a new line angle mode didn't even wake it up wake up you little sleepyhead wake up new line angle mode open paren caps degrees choose to correct all caps degrees Scrat novice go to sleep go to sleep please please just go to sleep okay I'm gonna manually put it to sleep it's frozen once again dragon has crashed I have successfully crashed dragon press the key f5 to refresh look under commands so f5 is refresh okay unfortunately dragon has died maybe I can force quit it I think I just have to wait for it to die so yeah it's died that's very sad talk amongst yourselves whoops okay let's take a look at this does this seem right now draw that first line which is this part of the arm change the angle mode map the mouse two angles and degrees rotate and then draw another line Wow there's got to be a way to hold on I should be able to probably force quit it with this oh it came back alive wake up scratch that go to sleep so unfortunately I woke it had some sort of glitch there woke up etc etc and and I lost what I did I'm just gonna type it in manually because I'm really I'm gonna have to do a lot more work to practice this and figure this out wake up save this document activate Chrome go to sleep so I'm gonna look for f5 is refresh right so there's got to be under commands there's got to be a command for for f5 what's auto text oh that's probably like an ADD wake up wake up dictation global key commands press the shift are ah so I could do press the key shift are press the key command are press the key f5 would probably work right so that's what I need if I need to add a function key command so obviously I could just hit it with my finger but let's try wake up press the key command R press the key command R there we go so this is my current range of motion I suppose but that's about the only oh well boy this was a reality check for me about how little I can do with just dictation and p5 but this was a good experiment for me to see and learn all of the stuff that's missing so as I have time over the next couple weeks I'm actually one thing I should mention I've been doing a lot of reading and learning so I've got a lot of es6 stuff down that i'm really excited to come back in the fall and teach a bunch of JavaScript concepts that are part of es6 in particular the new syntax and class classes based syntax we're doing objectoriented programming I'm going to add that to my courses here at NYU and make a whole bunch of video tutorials about that use a headset so oh my goodness I didn't go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep okay so that's one thing that's been interesting for me but what I'm going to look into doing is seeing if I can customize more of the features and to be able to programming atom and switch back and forth if anyone wants to help me with this project I'm trying to remember the name of the open source repository that Tavis Rudd mentioned in the video I don't know if anybody knows it's like dragon speaks please just let me do github dragonfly this is it so this is a speech recognition framework allowing powerful pythonbased scripting and extension of Dragon NaturallySpeaking so in theory I haven't looked into this at all but in theory you can create your own grammars and examples and different things anyone is interested on and I know that Tavis Rudd is on Twitter and in that YouTube video has published a lot of code again everything's programmed in Python using vim and Emacs and I probably should go down that road I think you probably very smartly made those decisions to be able to work very effectively but for me you know I'm curious what can i push can I do web development JavaScript or processing through dictation I don't mind customizing and writing code to customize what I'm doing in Python but I would like the examples to be the same sort of stuff that I'm doing so if anybody was interested in helping with this please feel free to get in touch on Twitter at Schiffman or maybe I can create a github repository but uh it's very hard for me to actually do the development work to figure out this stuff out given that I can barely can I can't really type at the moment so um thanks for everyone for tuning in I wonder if I want to take it's 235 I'm a little bit late to an appointment that I have to go to oh I meant to uh I should have a guest video tutorial coming in the next couple weeks I hope so that'll be some content that will appear on the channel and perhaps in August I will be a bit more back into the swing of things and I'm very excited to talk to you about I'm curious to what I'm getting a marker over here I'm curious can i I'm going to talk to you about this with my left hand Const let thank you to ADA who is a supporter and viewer of the coding train who wrote a really nice blog post I will try to include it in the description for this video maybe someone can post it in the chat about the difference between Const let and VAR I think she I think that's where I I also watched a nice video from a fun fun function but ADA is working on a series of blog posts about es6 that have been very helpful to me and i watched a nice video from fun fun function also about const let and VAR so i hope to be covering this I'm just sort of curious how this goes that's actually not so bad we're using my left hand come to think of it and also I want to talk a lot this fall about the class keyword in es6 all right well you guys are all very kind to be tuning in I was going to do this I was thinking ah maybe I'll just do a experiment with this code dictation and old stuff just for the patreon subscribers I'm making a private stream and then I thought well why not I'll turn on the I'm here I might as well turn on the system see how it goes I'm gonna take five minutes to see if there's any questions I can answer if you are a patreon backer you can ask the question in the slack JavaScript voice recognition for JavaScript writes Simon I wonder if that is something that exists so maybe I should google that and take a look into that okay yeah yes 6 equals JavaScript 2015 I'm Way behind you know I'm never not really a cuttingedge kind of person I'm just you know doing my best here keep up with things yeah cuz there's a new there's already gonna be another version of JavaScript I was trying to wait till yeah 6 was born I don't know what I was trying to do but you know I think it's time it's time for me to use some stuff from es6 I don't want to use the you know at some point I would like to cover some of the more esoteric complex syntax but mostly I just want to use the stuff that makes things a little clearer and more elegant I'm that sort of thing the guest is not happy cat although I would love to have happy cat as a guest or do a collaboration with happy cat she has a wonderful YouTube channel that I would suggest you check out well you make a video of both neural networks in genetic evolution in one video yeah so unfortunately that was the path I was on so I got I would say maybe I got a tenth of the way through the neural network stuff I was gonna do a lot more I think I made two or three videos and then once I got through that I also was gonna look at genetic algorithms and involving neural network weights I do have some examples they're actually broken and I think I have a pull request that fit one of the examples I just haven't had a chance to look at it yet it's hard for me to sort of evaluate and run code but that's where I'm altom utley hoping to go so I will get to that it's just going to come later can you make a tutorial video about using HTML CSS and J's to make a website I would take a look at my HTML CSS playlist it's part of the foundations of JavaScript it's not taught in a kind of proper web development way but all the concepts are there for and I cover how to do creative coding with HTML CSS and JavaScript using p5 so that's something you could you could take a look at it that exists already okay could you do some Python I was also planning on doing some Python yes and actually I'm still looking for a really good Python book to read on my Kindle it's hard for me to read books that I have to hold and turn the pages of the Kindle is really easy and I don't like reading on an iPad or the computer so much so I'm any recommendations and maybe I'll come back and do a book review after I get through it I I've been reading about es6 and I'm also thinking of learning react but again I said this last time I think that might be much too useful for me in practical somebody might actually like learn something you get a job from my videos which is you know you shouldn't watch my videos to learn anything practical or useful so but I'm considering learning react especially because there's a new Alpha p5 GS web editor that is coming soon and it is built with react and I would like to be able to contribute to that and help with that open source project so it is something I should learn Cody Tetris Cody challenge I really love to do that now because I really got this dictation thing down I think I could tackle something like that with dictation I had a lot of tutorials already about text processing as a Jason Matthew asks go and check out it used to be called programming from A to Z I can't remember where we are at this point but I think well I'm Jacob use programming from A to Z sounds like it's a beginner course in programming but my video my course and playlist is actually for adventure people with their I do have beginner playlist but that program from A to Z playlist is not at all beginner so I think I'm going to change it to just something like programming with text which with matches suggestion I don't remember if that's been done already but go through look for that playlist it's all about working with text speaking of books any must read book about Java I don't know about must read I honestly I think there's a big classic what's the big classic Java textbook that everybody uses I think I used that probably over ten years ago you know I don't want you know this is the worst thing I could possibly do which is like to plug my own book but it's not to learn Java per se but if you want to learn from the beginning programming and want Java syntax if you look at the learning processing book that's exactly what I do in that book and using the processing development environment and after that you can kind of graduate to using eclipse and other Java syntax as well but just for learning Java itself there's a kind of well big Java is it called something like that I feel like is a textbook that I used a long time ago I don't recommend it but it's pretty comprehensive okay the Douglas Crockford book is a very interesting book and that's for JavaScript it's called the good parts it's not for learning Java a book that I absolutely love for learning JavaScript is eloquent JavaScript whoops eloquent JavaScript let's go to the this is a book that I used to learn Java scripts myself I don't know if it's using es6 syntax one wonderful things about it it's all available for free online which I try to do now with anything that I'm putting online so I appreciate that for sure and of course you can buy a copy to also support the author which I would encourage you to do if you like the book and also the getting started with p5.js is a nice book to learn the basics of JavaScript to the cop in the context of p5 just so much yeah and the slack of the patreon group in the slack channel writes program with text has already been done so if you're looking for all my tutorials about Markov chains and text analysis and word counting you can look for the programming with text it's also at Schiffman neck / e 2zii okay so unity would be great that's another that I should learn so I I'm trying to soak in knowledge and watch videos and read books while I'm not doing as much typing and I'm healing so to speak so unity Mike my major things are es6 react Python and now unity those would be things I would love to sort of pick up some skills with okay so thanks everybody it's 245 p.m. again you're welcome to join my patreon if you like it's going to be paused for the month of July so it won't be it won't be activated again until September 1st the August 1st will be paused if I set up the settings correctly I would encourage you to support in the meantime while I'm kind of on hiatus the processing foundation processing foundation org and of course there's also I'm just like plugging stuff now nature of code comm if you're interested supporting the nature of code book and other stuff that I'm doing you can you can do that as well I didn't see I'm glad in a way that I didn't see any super chat messages but I just want to make sure I didn't miss any so if somebody did do a super chat message please send me a tweet or an email I should hear something I want to mention I noticed something the chat said why don't you reply to your emails I pretty slow about replying to emails I do get a lot of just programming question emails and it's unrealistic I think for me too you know I could spend all day answering them and it's not that much but so typically if you have programming questions ask them at forum processing org but I do read all the emails and I do try to reply to them all eventually and I also try to reply to all the YouTube comments but I haven't been able to do that but know that if you're writing YouTube comments I am reading them all so I am reading all the comments I'm just not replying and you could always also tweet me at Schiffman on twitter okay raspberry pi would also be a great thing to learn okay thanks everybody for tuning in today to this extra live stream I may be back the first week of August if things are going well in terms of healing and dictation I'll try to think of some content I could do but I don't know when I'll be back in the full swing of things it could be a while so I'm sorry for that sort of yeah it's good I'm learning lots of new things about life by having this injury and I'll see you guys another time I don't know if this counts as an official livestream I'm a little worried about I was close to getting to livestream number 100 and I felt that I want to do something special for that I don't know if this counts maybe it does okay I'm going to turn this off the good news for you is this is very hard for me to figure out how to turn this off because I need to click a button over here which we really need to operate this other mouse okay it wasn't so hard I'm already doing it and I just want to also say thank you ever I got lots of really nice messages of support emails and tweets and things in the mail even so I really appreciate it it's really lovely things are fine doing well Healing having physical therapy should be back to things soon enough I will definitely keep everybody posted and I look forward to seeing you in the future on the channel if you have ideas for things that I could do or things that I can be helpful with please feel free to reach out anytime okay and I hope you enjoyed that completely insane totally messed up dictation attempt I really excited the name to get good at it and have a weird is sort of like strange performance art okay we can't run off I really have to turn this off now okay goodbye and see you in the future oh I do see the super chat so that does actually work but I don't see a message do I have to click on it let me try to click on it so I don't see any way if see uh so just wanted to say that you are inspirational keep up the work love to see your vids from Ryan Zhang thank you very much Ryan Jiang thank you very much for that nice message wait ok let's see can I do this no so the way that I look at the chat maybe I can look at it over here the way that I look at the chat is no oh yeah so I think pandemonium didn't actually leave a message yeah yeah okay so I can actually see I can see those chat messages thank you for them okay goodbye everybody very nice to see your messages yes I'm late for my meeting I'm gonna go now but I have to figure out how to turn this off it's gonna take me a minute stop oh I never tweeted that I was doing this sorry everybody okay goodbye well thank you pandemonium I appreciate your super chat message again I I kind of have mixed feelings about using the system for a lot of different reasons but it was interesting to see it work for just this livestream since I fought I figured oh I pausing my patreon maybe I'll just put this up just as sort of like see but anyway okay good bye hi
