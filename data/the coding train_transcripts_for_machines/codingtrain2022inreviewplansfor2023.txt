thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign check one two just testing my microphone how does it work here in 2023 oh I'm so excited to be here live streaming I can I'm just gonna like burst out of my own skin uh let me know in the chat if the sound is coming through okay and then I will be getting started in just a minute with a brand new opening uh animation foreign foreign thank you thank you foreign [Laughter] no here professional operation here everybody happy New Year and welcome to the coding train all that banging around the things was me trying to like make sure I was set up and ready to press the camera button all the while uh this new ready animation uh which has a little robot coming in and then the train arrives to go comes in and then I switched to me and he trained for the first time in probably well it's definitely well over a month I think I did actually did I do a live stream ER no no it was November it was November my last live stream it was November my last video upload proper video upload I've been doing some experiments with shorts as I will talk about in a moment why did this computer go off okay it's back um but I've been gone for a little while this happens to me but uh and usually I'm I'm I'm uh so first of all hi welcome maybe this is the first time you're tuning into the coding train well my name is Dan I am your host uh I do a variety of different things uh tutorial videos coding Challenge videos live streams all about coding and creativity and it's all meant to be friendly and welcoming for the total beginner so if you've never programmed before I welcome you I encourage you to stick around if you've programmed a lot and want to point out all my mistakes actually that's useful too stick around I enjoy that all of the things I enjoy I'm just taking a peek at the chat um just to see all right so I've got chat here Discord here computer here my confidence monitor because I am quite The Confident guy over here so things got really got in the way for me life got in the way families and personal stuff a lot of things going on I just was not able to do much in December um and so I I about usually do like a holiday Telethon and I I've had sort of like a holiday season sort of tradition it just didn't happen this year so let's kick off 2023 um today I uh it's it's ironic because this is the end of my oneyear sabbatical from teaching some of you may know that I happen to have a fulltime day job teaching at NYU uh I broadcast live in my own sort of Home garage Studio here doing all of my coding train work a lot of the stuff that I do I is either um you know if I'm teaching a class then I want to make some videos for the class uh et cetera Etc you know the whole you don't necessarily know the whole deal but I don't want to go through it all right now the point of what I'm saying is I really thought that 2022 was going to be the the year of the coding train because I had a oneyear sabbatical um and I think to some extent I'm probably being much too hard on myself because I really feel like it fizzled and I didn't get what I wanted to get done and I like nobody likes my videos just me really if you're like down the last few weeks this is not a call for sympathy please chat just be yeah just just to settle down I didn't even know what you're saying yet because you're like a minute behind in the past and I'm in the future and I don't know if you're in Australia it was like 20 23 3 days ago but anyway I sort of feel like maybe teaching is one things that keeps me grounded and moving forward with the coding train because I am talking about things in class on a regular schedule I have to I have to be accountable I have to be prepared for it students in those classes have amazing ideas and questions that lead me to topics that I want to do a video to help answer those questions so I think maybe just maybe you heard it here first everybody bring out the Bell 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 not the best year if I'm being perfectly honest 2023 maybe this will be the year of the coding train so um this is my plan for today uh I I wanted to like I trust me I thought of like a million reasons and excuses why I couldn't do this live stream today but by golly I'm here I'm I'm here uh um Kitty tasks is asking can you start I don't know if that means like why are you just talking instead of coding because uh I hate to break it to you I got some news for you a lot of talking in the live stream not so much to the coding um but uh but maybe Kitty is stuck on like the opening animation oh my hair my hair my hair all right uh Bruno says for for me every year is the year of the codec drain that is lovely thank you for that um Bruno um so what I would like to do today this is my plan ah Navid a great question can I ask so today's just going to be a kind of hanging out stream I don't have a plan although not that I ever really had anything that different um does this button work yes it does so I'll come back to that in a second uh Navid asks can I ask what started the coding train interesting question I don't know how to answer this should I talk about how my parents met no that's weird um what started the code again how far back should I go here's what I think started the coding train um my teaching just just to bring it all back together to that I wanted to make videos for my classes and this we're talking about over 10 years ago now so I think probably one of the First videos I recorded for students in a class that I was taking was in 2012. so that's probably what started it uh I could make this a longer story I think I've told versions of this story with more more fewer or more details I think there's a podcast called create canvas from the processing foundation with saubercon you could look that up where I talked about this more but basically at one point I uh in 2015 I started uploading some of these videos I had made to YouTube and the rest if you uh um the old prostate videos that were in Vimeo that is correct denisovich uh and yes how your parents met is a bit too far back okay agreed uh I did have a dream of I didn't ever dream of making my own TV show but can we just talk about wait can we be can I be completely selfindulgent for a second I was always a theater geek um so I was any any kind of geek I was I was like into math I was into computers I was into science I was into like science fiction all that stuff but I really loved the theater specifically musical theater I have very little musical Talent uh I had enough of a goofball that I could go up on stage and kind of like act silly and people would enjoy it but I I also never really like you know sort of um really um meaningfully um thoughtful and well I'm not have a talent for the acting if you will so but I I I think I just always had this like itch to do more performing and to be involved and sort of in entertainment in some way and I think YouTube you know is allowing me to sort of try that in my own bizarre Fashion For Better or Worse and um you know I've kind of been uh in the last month just questioning a lot and I don't know but I think I think I'm I'm ready to like double down on what it is that I feel I do well which is to communicate ideas around programming for people who are new to programming and I would I don't know that I do it well for like a total perfect like sort of global diverse audience because I recognize that I have a certain you know cultural background and identity that sort of uh and references that maybe some people really can identify with it's my goal for the coding train and my work to be as welcoming and inclusive as possible but anyway um but I don't know if I do that but I do think that I have over 20 years of practicing this uh found my way to an ability to kind of like talk through the steps of a programming problem or explain basic programming Concepts to all to a wide beginner audience um Advanced sophisticated deep level software engineering and computer science topics maybe not as much my thing but yeah I think I'm reflecting a lot let me say I know this will shock you many of you this will come as a total shock because of my you know youthful Timothy chalamet good looks but uh and thank you thank you Layla I don't know Bizarro what time of day is it for you that it's time for your whiskey um chat chat GPT people are asking about chat GPT yet so anyway this year this is the year 2023 is the year that I turn 50 I do sort of it's like a weird sort of feeling it's like you know I I I've never felt older until like probably like two or three years ago but I also think like by golly I could be on YouTube I can do the YouTube thing with the youths I'm gonna I'm gonna focus on the Cody train making entertainment stuff making educational stuff and just seeing what I can do in 2023. um so so let's get that started this is my hope this is my plan for today I don't want to be here past like two o'clock because um I want to spend some time with my kids my wife has been out of town mostly for the LA uh dealing with some family stuff for the last two months basically which is um why I haven't been able to do as much work or stream as much but we're kind of hitting the reset button uh she's back and I want to do some nice family stuff nobody has school tomorrow either so but I wanted to get this stream in to feel like I'm starting off 2023 and um more to come but so what I thought I would do is I wanted to I've got my whiteboard oh which I didn't even figure out um I uh Martin says I am 52 and 50 was a nice one thank you I am so pleased yeah cut your beard and you'll be three I do you know yeah we don't need to talk about uh it's okay I guess for me to talk about me because you're watching you could turn it off if you don't want to hear me talk about me this is helpful I mean therapy is uh very useful I encourage everybody if you are able to and uh um to be therapized I think that's the proper technical way of explaining that but also talking about myself here on the live stream to be a somewhat of helpful therapy as well um so uh but thank you Martin your chat scrolled by but I appreciate I I I'm constantly amazed you know who knows how accurate it is but if I look at my YouTube channel my audience is you know my children are approaching the age of my audience let me just put it that way um so uh uh you are a YouTube you need to talk about yourself that's good are you bad at CSS because P5 turns JavaScript to CSS I don't understand that question I am bad at CSS uh uh all right can we expect machine learning tutorials can we talk about Timothy what is your favorite framework processing processing is always will always be my favorite framework just it's it's where I where everything began for me um all right so this is my plan for today it's already 12 20. um I oh the Whiteboard so let's see what happens if I press this button I did not check this I have no idea what camera it's going to turn on when I press this oh well luckily for me that worked let's see if I have a working marker boy this the lighting is weird so I moved a lot of like you know I had completely reconfigured I'm looking at my monitor over there I completely reconfigured this room for um working on my Apple II plus computer and I have now this morning before I started streaming I put everything back and I'm assuming you can still hear and see me okay I see the chat I can actually almost see the chat from here because I can read the latest message is Javascript the future my vision is terrible something that happens to you when you get older also oh no never mind sometimes like random thoughts pop in my head and I'm about to say that I'm like don't talk about that on the live stream all right let me see if I can brighten this view up a little bit I think that might help uh oh it says it's kind of what is going on here something's weird with this camera I probably did some weird settings to this camera um based on um when I had it with the Apple II plus I will worry about that later as long as it is mostly legible for you let's find out so I want to make two columns 20 22 and 20 23. I want to look back time to sweep up I want to look back where am I standing here how does this work move this over maybe okay I want to look back and make a list of the things that I did in 2022 and talk about you know what went well what didn't go well what's unresolved which will probably lead me to a list of things I would like to accomplish in 2023 now I don't I haven't seen Simon yet in the chat it's good I mean maybe it's good the time it's not here because Simon is always the voice in the back of my head is like which is damn whenever you make one of these lists actually get to anything on the list because you get distracted by other things that's true that might be true but can I can let me just start let me try start fresh wipe the Slate clean I hope to like make this list and then feel good about 2022 and then kind of chart out some things that I would like to do in 2023. I actually had on this whiteboard a whole other list that I made like some other time and it was like oh I didn't do most of that stuff but it'll come back up again all right so moving back um yeah so let me know if the Whiteboard view needs any adjustment because and I'm going to come back to here actually so now I'm on the what's over here oh okay um that's gonna drive me crazy the fact that my green screen is key is off there um oh Simon is here uh uh and I don't uh uh uh okay okay so I'm reading the the Discord chat enjoying that um okay let me see let me just turn this slightly okay I'm gonna loosen this you know this is how I do it on the coding train live you know there's just me here did that fix the key that definitely did where's it back it's back and it is gone okay so that should do it Okay so there's a few ways it still looks dark it's the like the question is is this good enough for today I think it is um that's good excuse the laugh is there an update on the poll app all right hold on everybody too many questions I can't follow them all I should do actually what was that thing let's do that thing um just so um if there are some questions people want me to address um I like this online questions thing um that I use that one time uh audience or speaker okay admin well I'm definitely not going to have to do this because I think if oh secret password no no the this is okay so let's do uh three one four one five nine that's gonna be our event and my secret password is going to be rainbow puppy unicorn chocolate lava delightfulness okay and now I'm gonna hit create and never um okay so this is now if I how do I how do I get this I should have done this on my other computer online questions where do I where do I find the page that I send out to people oh yeah ah audience members so you go to onlinequestions.org and you enter 3.14159 and at some point this is going to populate with questions I am going to move those over here I should make that maybe a pinned comment so um how are you is the first question there we go so uh let's let's um just hold on a sec um put in this code 3.14159 and I will pin it oops that's the wrong I've been the wrong message okay come on everybody message on pin yeah yeah go away okay pin message all right so now we see that uh if you want to ask a question of me you can post it here um random guy it's kind of funny you should say that ah happy New Year Christian vikbon all right uh have you tried the new chat AI for coding yes and uh more about that uh later today hopefully because that should definitely go on the 2023 list um all right so I'm gonna move these off okay so now there are a few different ways I can look at what did I do in 2022 so I think probably the is the best place for me to start is the sort of core work of the coding train which is the YouTube channel itself and I think if I go here under videos I can go to recently uploaded and let's just see um I think this was a 2021 video one year ago why does it November 2021 yes so if we're talking about no um this is actually not look at this I made okay so let's talk about this coding challenges so let me add to the Whiteboard I wonder if I should do like a split screen thing but um I'll just press the buttons so um 2022 we did coding challenges uh challenges uh ASCII video I already can't remember uh right slide puzzle ASCII and Prime spiral ASCII slide puzzle Prime spiral so that's three coding challenges that I did then we had the mandelbub mandelbulb and Pie in the Sky mandelbulb Pi Day um I also did what else what else what else what else what else uh Monty Hall wave function collapse wave function collapse see look I did stuff in 2022. it's not so bad wave function collapse uh which uh and then a horizontal Directional Drilling um so those were the coding challenges now let's look up uh tutorials and I forgot to talk about the sponsor of the coding train but that's I'll address that in a minute um uh okay so I did local storage and I did nature of code 2.6 we did a P5 local storage and nature of code 2.6 okay um what else do we got um then I let's let's do ah okay then Apple two so the Apple II series was a totally brand new thing I mean they're kind of under the coding challenge umbrella but I really think of them as separate um I did snake tree and uh what was the last one that I did snake tree oh and 3D render okay so this is and then I'm gonna put here other the anal retentive coder which you know I thought was going to be my big hit in 2022 that's probably the least viewed video on the channel so let's look at this for a second so this is actually like this is making me feel a little better uh in that there were one two three four five six seven eight coding challenges you know by goal would be if I had a goal would be to have 12 coding challenges I mean I think if you count these I could kind of get up to 11. it goes to 11. like the idea that there'd be one coding challenge per month those videos at you know they used to be the kind of thing that would take approximately 24 hours to do because I think of an idea I'd sort of just go and code it while recording and then chop it up the video without really any editing or postproduction and then upload it now the videos have the coding challenges videos have expanded where I do a little bit more research and try to bring in some more examples and references but um I'd be curious to know from the chat uh which one of these were your favorites or which one of these would you like to see a followup on I can say I you know I follow the numbers on the coding train pretty closely the a Visa like not talking about the Apple II for a second this the ASCII video one was Pro I pretty sure it was the most watched um followed somewhat closely by the prime spiral we can kind of fact check this why is it so dark there's something weird about this settings on the camera that's so dark um let's take a look so I'm just coming back over here for a second so wave function collab and you know I'm not in this for the views I'm not in this for the future I mean I I do I do look at the views but um you can see the ASCII text one is it's really um the ASCII text one we're at uh you know it's the oldest one so it had the most time but it's sort of well and far above Prime spiral is also pretty far um and the rest are in the more usual range but I agree wave function collapse in many ways is the most memorable in the sense that I did that over nine hours of live streaming and condensed it all down into a one hour and 18 minute Astro penguin relax coding Cabana I uh the Cabana is not something I have access to anymore but I could I I could sort of recreate that feeling in new and different ways um thank you random guy for saying um 3D renderers the tippy top that's great yeah so um so let's think about for a moment what really requires um and I it's driving me crazy while the why the camera is so dark but I'm just not going to worry about it um what so one thing that really absolutely requires a followup and I've been kind of afraid to tackle it because it's I don't know how to do it but it would be wave function collapse uh overlapping so if we're thinking about what are ideas for challenges wave function collapse overlapping model is absolutely one you know I always like to do something for Pi Day so let's put down Pi Day as something we'll do in 2023 I have no ideas for it so something that we could start thinking of now if anybody has anything clever uh I'd be game for that uh um mandelbobe led me to be interested in um what are they called sine distance functions so that's something I'm absolutely interested in tackling put that on the list here um I don't see any other followups that are obvious to me uh in terms of coding challenges that are directly coming from here I could come up I could go back and look at the GitHub repo that has a bunch of lists of ideas and find some of them um but that's sort of this is sort of where I am so you know could I get what's a goal what's a good goal I mean I just want to like what if we said 10 challenges and I don't not retro Computing so 10 not retro Computing challenges for 2023. let's set that as a goal and some of them could be simple ones just a 10 minute video why not right okay so we got three ideas oh three already here um okay um so let me I want to I want to do uh I'm gonna make some other categories here nebula um there's a category I thought of two things which is why I want to make two other categories and the other one just completely went out of my brain ah yes books writing so we'll call it nebula and we'll call it uh NOC so um this is why so the other thing that I accomplished this year is which led me to doing these videos is the nebula class what is code so I'm going to take a minute nebula is a sponsor of the coding train and in many ways saying it's a sponsor is I mean it's accurate in the sense that I am paid to talk about nebula but nebula is also a project that I am um uh more deeply involved with a sort of cocreator and owner of uh the platform I I don't I I I I hesitate to say that because it sounds like I don't want to take credit for anything because it's like all other people doing amazing work but um I can tell you now that if you go to go Dot uh nebula let's see if I can get this to work dot TV slash what is code so um so this is uh just to be clear even though I'm talking about my work uh for you know whatever FCC and every guidelines this is also I'm talking about a sponsorship a paid this is a paid product endorsement here but you know not just a random thing it's something that I care about and involved with so I worked on this year with a nebula is if you so if you're not familiar with nebula it's a streaming platform for uh educational creators on YouTube and that's not the best way to describe it probably I've probably botched that um there's tons of original content documentaries you know I don't know what you watch on YouTube but I think about channels that I watch like uh you know Wendover Productions uh practical engineering real engineering uh Jordan Herod um Patrick Williams all of these creators uh are on uh nebula and they have original content Patrick Williams has a movie he made I'm obsessed with this thing called jet lag the game um but anyway let's see if I can play this trailer right now one of the things that I did for nebula is create this class about what is programming what is code for uh you know this could be for someone who's never watched the coding train before it never programmed before let's see if the sound goes through here my name is Dan and I have spent almost the last 20 years teaching coding be under the false impression that to code your favorite thing must be computers I'm here to tell you that learning to code is something that may just expand the way you approach the passions in your life if you have never written a line of code in your life you're in the right place okay you know I think it's really important as somebody who makes stuff on the internet to not only do stuff on one platform I don't actually have this problem for the most part but a lot of the if I go to nebula.tv a lot of creators on YouTube let's see if I go to videos um there are a lot of issues with I'm trying to see especially like certain kind of content if I go to history I think is a good example of this a lot of real real life lore and realtime history a lot of these videos have issues on YouTube in terms of some of the the content not able to be uh I'm sorry I'm like like oh what do I want to watch here so uh uh demonetized or age restricted and so this is kind of a nice platform uh where these videos can educational videos with really important topics can be seen um I'm just curious uh uh if you go to classes which is the thing that I'm kind of plugging here I this this I really should watch video editing Basics Adam Neely is awesome so all this stuff is here so um you can go to this link um and uh click sign up and you'll get like a discount for as a fan of the coding train but I have a hack for you which is available um only today and tomorrow which is that if you go to it's this link here uh whoops there we go if you go to curiositystream.com choo choo let's make sure that works you can actually sign up for the Curious curiosity streams bundle so this is signing up for curiosity stream which is a great service where you get like you know thousands of all these documentaries and you get it for just like nebula is five dollars a month I think with my code it's four dollars a month but this is less than one dollar a month for the entire year so you can get curiosity stream and this bundle includes complementary access to nebula um you have to be clever about this because yeah you want to make sure you click on this one because there's lots of other it's confusing like it says that this one includes nebula and then it doesn't say that here but I I have it on good authority that this absolutely includes nebula the only thing is which a little bit unfortunate is if you sign up for nebula through the front door the four dollars a month yeah from my classes page that's great you should do that um you get everything nebula nebula classes this you get nebula it is really really cheap but you don't get nebula classes so you have to add on a one dollar per month extra for nebula classes it's kind of confusing but don't worry all you need to do is just email Daniel thecodingtrain.com if you're confused by this and I will make sure to help you because I want want people to be able to watch the class if they're interested in it so the cheapest way if you're interested in getting the class is to get kind of a hack it's only this this discount is uh I mean it's still going to be heavily discounted after January 2nd but it's like a New Year's promotion so today January 1st tomorrow January 2nd for 97 cents a month you know you get uh all uh curiosity stream and nebula then one dollar per month extra nebula classes I I've gone on for too long about this uh really I just I love the nebula platform I've started watching um you know all the videos there are ad free it's a good I frankly find it like a really good place for Discovery because YouTube algorithm uh search and Discovery works great for me but I find a lot of stuff that I'm really interested in here uh this this is what I'm obsessed with jet lag the game uh if you haven't watched maybe maybe this is not your thing but I love this jet lag the game uh a game show I would love to go on it frankly although I'd probably be terrible okay sorry so that's my plug sponsor stuff I'm gonna put that aside I should put it as like a it's it's all Linked In the video description I didn't make it a pin comment let's check out we're gonna get back to the topic at hand which is reviewing 2022 but that was that was part of my 2020 review because this was a lot of work and a lot of time and effort went into producing this class um and I want to uh I'm hoping I don't know if this is true but if you're somebody out there why is it so dark what's crazy is it's telling me on the back of the you know I'm just gonna I don't care you're lying to me we're gonna brighten you up you're lying to me let's do that there we go um uh if you are somebody out there I don't know if anybody out there this exists who happen to find the what is code class on nebula watched it got interested in code and you're now watching this live stream or later or some other video I mean I don't let me know that would be so thrilling and exciting to me okay so nebula we got through that let's briefly check in on the online questions guest tutorials all right um let's add that so oh yeah did I let's I care I don't think I did any guests in 2022. Maybe so let's put this on the list I don't want to like necessarily make a list of guests here that might be kind of awkward but um but definitely guests for 2022. uh oh but the reason why I was talking about nebula is so what do I want to do in 2023 on the nebula platform so I'll tell you one thing I definitely want to do and if anybody has any thoughts so I want to make a video um one of the things on nebula I should just sign into my account because oh as Originals so nebula has a lot of original content um the things that you can't find on um that aren't on YouTube and one of the things is the series called working titles how do I find that modern conflicts is what I was talking about real life lore yeah those are um this is great too that time when is a really fun series um uh where is a working titles yeah so um oh there's one 19 days ago so working titles is a series about uh title sequences of different um TV shows movies games um whole ghost AI for PacMan oh I like this um so I so if we look at this um oh we can't wait I'm not signed in so I'm just going to put this on my list what I would like to do is make a working titles video about the show severance this is a goal of mine if you're not familiar Severance is an Apple TV Plus show that I became somewhat obsessed with I have a few different project ongoing projects I could put them in here so like um under under other could well they're not videos but like uh so if I put them under here we would put the macro data refinement and you you are bot so these are like some projects that I have kind of worked on just as like sort of goofing around projects and I would like to do a video so Severance is a television Apple TV plus television show I'm not going to spoil it for anyone I highly recommend if you're able to watch it it's really excellent uh you know it's still dark a little disturbing so you know your mileage may vary depending on whether that's your jam but um I um one of the the title sequence is this incredible 3D animated Avatar kind of computer Graphics uh generated sequence that I find beautiful amazing and wonderful and I would love to do a kind of explainer video about that title sequence now this is not something that I've ever done before I don't do explainer videos or video essays I do clear took it Kentucky videos that's how I describe them but that I would like to do I also was thinking about doing a history of computing series that would be more documentary like my idea for it is that I would sort of dress you know maybe I'd start with the 1950s uh and I would uh oh sort of like dress and try to shoot it in the sort of style of the decade so there'd be a 1950s episode it's like one division for computer graph computer Computing documentary so these are two ideas I have for nebula but it um you know obviously these are things that wouldn't be on YouTube they would be sort of more produced I would you know the one thing nice thing about doing something with nebula is it's a collaboration for me they have a whole production team I can you know pitch an idea if I can get it approved it's not necessarily like it's not a a a necessarily like a revenue generating thing for me although the sponsorship stuff all works out terrifically but it's something for me to be able to be more creative and try new things so curious about you know people's thoughts or interest in that but that's kind of where I'm thinking so that's nebula but if people have ideas for ambitious projects I can do um that are uh kind of out there that you wouldn't think would be normally coding train thing but you think I might be good at or might be able to make happen uh nebula is a way for making making those things happen you know for things that I couldn't just make happen on my own on YouTube so I would love your suggestions and thoughts about that all right we've got our 2022 board our 2023 board uh we are we're not even one hour in are we yeah we're not even one hour in so uh yeah that would be cool explain how basic went from Dartmouth to Microsoft exactly exactly and I lost the Discord chat okay exposure come for the one oh opening sequence of severance yeah um all right so let me take a look at the uh questions oh sorry all right let's answer some of these questions and I think if I go to the admin page maybe I should just go to the admin page hold on online questions uh for speaker admin let's see uh open there we go Okay so is chat GPU we'll chat GPT let's answer will chat gbt make our programming experience useless so I think what this is asking if I could rephrase the question a bit is and let me take a sip of my coffee here my throat is um getting a little dry here okay is chat we'll chat so I think the question is asking will chat GPT make programmers obsolete will I know no longer need to learn how to code because I can just write up an idea and chat GPT will translate that into code for me I don't think we're there yet not based on my experience working with chat chat gbt I also think there is a certain Joy to programming to solving the puzzle I think that I think there's a lot of questionable aspects about kind of copyright and ownership and exploitation of Labor that's all wrapped up in the chat GPT I don't feel Adept or knowledgeable enough to really tackle that side of it but if we put that aside which you really can but if I allow myself very briefly to put that aside I think that there is a tremendous amount of potential for systems like chat GPT to be a tool in the programmer's toolbox to give you some starter code you know in the same way that stack Overflow is the coding train is the nature of code book is you know I often will start working on something from an example if maybe I could get to that example more quickly maybe I can ask chatgpt to optimize something that I've written um you know there might be some things in that direction that I think I could even imagine using right now um um so uh you know I think there's a lot more to say on it I do have a brief short that I have already recorded where I try to recreate one of my coding challenges with chat GPT um so that may or may not uh come out sometime soon okay um one of the things I found interesting about chat gbt there was somebody on Twitter who posted I'm already forgetting what the example is oh Pro you know ask chat gbt to make a star field simulation in p5.js and it spit out verbatim the code from one of my coding challenges so I um you know um so all right so let me uh how do I do this now I can say answered I mean you know the the thank you this is not really a question so I'm going to mark it as answered oh this was well addressed well addressed in this video I don't know if this is trolling me or just missed earlier in the video but this is a big year for me I will be turning 50. my brain by the way I don't there's I know there's a couple of you in the audience who are around my age I'm I'm really discovering that I my memory and my ability to recall certain words that I'm thinking of my my sort of quickwittedness that nothing ever had it quick witness or declining so hopefully my streaming and videos will still be of of good quality can we get a C plus plus series probably not open Frameworks tutorials I mean I'd be happy to add that to the list but you know realistically with everything that I want to do that seems like it it's unlikely to happen and but you know I want to encourage people to use the way that I make videos to inspire them to make their own and maybe somebody will make some great um C plus plus videos uh welcome simic we're glad to see you here again um all right hello world is not a question answer this collab so first of all are does our fundraiser still going so let's plug something else here you know usually I'm always fundraising for the processing Foundation so somebody I don't know somebody mentioned school for poetic computation which Thrills me that somebody in the audience of the coding train would be familiar with them uh there's probably some good crossover there is a so sfbc is like to me a dream school you know I work at NYU I teach at NYU I am paid a salary I have health benefits I went to NYU I owe a lot I don't know if I owe a lot to NYU I mean I did pay off my student loans recently so I don't anymore well I never owed it to them anyway the point is I don't wanna I don't want to just I mean certainly don't want to disparage NYU but to me we have a huge problem especially in the U.S I know this isn't as much the case in other countries in higher education in terms of the expense in terms of the stress level for both the workers you know faculty are overworked administrators are overworked I mean some administrators may be overpaid some faculty are probably overpaid anyway I know that I can't get into all the ins and outs of this higher education in the U.S has many many many many many significant problems I would say the largest of which being it's inaccessibility to many people and this sort of like tiered system of elite universities and all that nonsense school for product computation is uh um a well I should uh just I shouldn't try to paraphrase I should read about it but it's independent uh experimental School interdisciplinary study and art code hardware and critical theory challenges the capitalistic heteronormative and patriarchal Canon of Social and Computer Sciences and uh you you I encourage you to read the mission statement the school has been around for quite a while but went through a lot of recent Transformations um so you know it is I I took a class I was able to take a class while in sabbatical from school for I took a class called learning to love mathematics which was absolutely fantastic totally would recommend it to everyone they do a lot of they they provide a lot of scholarship they're you know supported through their own tuition it's you know very Cooperative in its nature um so uh they're doing a fundraiser I'm just curious I think unfortunately the um train whistles that I donated are sold out but I'm just curious they're all these wonderful things in the I bought a lot of them a lot of the things in this um but if if you want to support sfbc you definitely should um let's just see ah here we go sadly the Cody train whistle and sticker pack are out of stock but you know you could get your whistle all in sticker pack by joining the coding train as a member they're really happening okay 2023 goal they're made we're just dealing with one a couple last things before we ship them let's let's go over I know I'm sorry that I'm jumping around all over the place but uh let's add here whistles two members so in 2023 the coding train I don't want to use the word canceled because it's such a loaded work I will cancel you're different if I don't get the whistles to the members who are at the membership level for the whistles in the year 2023 I will cancel the coding train you're already here first so that's an absolute uh must hmm so anyway so back to the questions the reason why this game up is collab with school for oh uh collab with school for a poetic computation I mean I would love that I don't know what form that would be I'd like to support them so I don't know that they need me for anything but I um this is our collaboration I'm going to plug them uh take a look at what classes they're offering consider signing up considering joining them as a member making a donation uh all of that okay I think um I'm gonna answer that um okay so let's refresh oops I can't refresh the page um all right oh open this is Oh I thought I thought maybe it would make it go away if it's answered anyway all right um all right I'm gonna come back to more questions later um where are we where am I all right so uh let's go back over here so I'm going through what did I do in 2022 what are my goals in 2023 so we've got a few ideas for some coding challenges goal of 10 coding challenges let's talk about the Apple II Plus for a second so people really uh enjoyed the Apple 2 plus videos uh they uh it just anecdote you know just sort of anecdotally I got a lot of positive feedback from them I'm looking over at the Apple II plus right here uh I don't know to what extent it makes sense to kind of like do the same thing over and over again but I'm running out of space here but um I'll just do my best let's so let's think of a couple things I might be able to do that would make sense to do as another Apple 2 plus video what I said in the last one that I was in two things on my mind are one is music sound so I think that's kind of interesting how that works and the other is 6502 assembly so those are two things now this is not an apple II video but I happen to have gotten my hands a little holiday present for myself off of eBay and by the way I keep moving to the side because I have this monitor here it's really funny I have this monitor uh which is showing me what the camera is seeing but it doesn't really work and it's like the whole section of the pixels are just blacked out and if I stand right here I don't see my face at all so I keep moving to the side so they can see my face and then like it's making it very awkward anyway I should just look at it's also this camera is in the weirdest place it looks to me like the camera is pointing here anyway um I got myself off of eBay a computer called a commodore 64. so uh we are going to look at at some point in 2023 I'll put a star next to that like I might do that before these how about a video programming on the Commodore 64. does that interest you does that excite you how much of a priority should that be what what kinds of things here do you really want to see um okay so that's sort of retro so so retro computing um all right what are some other things uh what are some other things that I did in 20 um 2022 let's go look at the live tab so let's just count how many live streams I did have a guest I had Dr Green uh I forgot that I guessed on them so this was last year's right I did a New Year's tell so I did a New Year's Telethon extravaganza um yeah I did have this look at that I don't remember this wallpaper okay um so let's look at this so let's just count the live streams one two three four five six oh this doesn't really count I mean it does sure does seven eight nine 10 11 12. so there were 12 oh no there were only 11 live streams now this isn't exactly true because um if I let me I don't know kind of lost track of how I was organizing this list but live there were what did I just say there were 11 YouTube lives and then I also did a lot of experimenting with uh twitch and then also member only so let's see if I can I'm just curious I think that I have done a pretty good job uh sting I see your comment yes how many years have we been talking about this now um I forgot twitch exactly Simon um so if I do coding train twitch archive there is a YouTube channel little known YouTube channel that where I just well oh there's a lot of them whoa two years ago okay one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen so I did 17 twitch streams that's a shocker now most of them are all January which is something I'm going to come to next because uh there is today is January 1st so January must be going on um so somehow not feeling better about this now I did 17 twitch streams that's a big question you know a lot of people did support me on Twitch whether they've signed up as a twitch subscriber I mean I think that's the main thing so uh you know I I in the same way that I'm exploring nebula as an alternative platform you know twitch to me feels like an interesting platform to explore Tick Tock is one your shorts is something I got to talk about at some point in this list but let's just just to do the accounting though I'm going to cure let me see if I can look at the members only um I'm just gonna go here because I gotta um look here under my I think if I go to I think if I go to um the coding train and if I go to playlists uh is there a how do I find the members only playlist I think it's like it's a thing that automatically is oh yeah here it is members only content did I make this or is this happening automatically anyway I don't think I'm going to be able to count these right now I'll just show you what I'm looking at so because there's um basically often for those of you who might be interested in signing up as a YouTube member uh where which supports the coding train you can get access to some channels in Discord I will often stream uh a recording session so if I'm recording something oh somebody just gifted a whole bunch of memberships five who oh Leonardo Joe Joe PS gifted five coding train memberships wow that's very generous of you so all of you are about who just got those gifted are about to have unlocked these old I don't know how interesting these would be to go back and watch but for a lot of the tutorial videos that I release I record them I you know it's a three hour session of maybe why I recorded a 20 minute video but I I live stream those and let people tune in it's helpful to have a little bit of feedback but um I don't they're not public live streams because having it not be a public live stream allows me to sort of not worry about a whole lot of details uh and just kind of focus on what I'm trying to do which is make the content but it's helpful to have a bit of an audience so if that's something that interests you um there's there's a way on YouTube for me to find I think this uh all of the members only videos I'm pretty sure though this playlist is one that I made so it doesn't really count I don't I don't know how to find it but I'm not going to worry about that there's a bunch of them I could try to count them I'll figure it figure them out there were a ton of January streams yeah that's because that was a big thing I was doing last year okay um okay so members only that's a thing we'll just put a big uh uh question mark here so you know I'm tempted to put a poll up in the YouTube chat here to ask people if I should continue streaming on Twitch but I feel like asking that question to a YouTube live stream audience is not it's not the way to do it so uh come back I'll come back to that but that is that is a question let's just put over here a lot let's put this here live twitch member so what do I I know this is completely illegible looks like I'm about to say do like flutter tutorials or something but this is kind of where I am that's a question for for 2022. I mean I always have this question part of me and I don't think I want to do this but part of me always thinks maybe I should just only live stream I just got a notification on Discord so maybe I should only live stream my life would be so much simpler I could just live stream once a week at a certain time pick a topic go over it move on but I really do like having these videos the live streams don't really they don't stand the test of time and I my goal for the coding train is to be a channel you know I know I'm saying Evergreen content is ever going to be accurate but I want people if they're looking for wave function collapse they can just find the video on that if it's buried inside of like a live stream where I'm doing 15 different things so anyway so I'm not there yet but sometimes and also like now I've been now I've got a whole bunch of people working on you know editing and animations and things for the video so I don't want to suddenly you know not give them anything to do so um so uh I I do really like having the videos uh uh I I like doing all the things so I like live streaming I like having the videos edited and produced all that stuff okay uh um let's take a look at January let me come back to January all right let's take a peek at the chat here um okay so we are going over things done in 2022 uh chat suggestion oh Chris Manning for 2020 is there a way for Outsiders to throw their hat in the ring maybe a quick email with qualifications and an idea for a guest video yeah this is a great question um oh and I see it there um yeah I mean I had sort of thought sometimes in a long term kind of way like is there a path could the coding train be a network of people and have multiple you know is it multiple channels uh is it multiple hosts is it different people and I've kind of wanted that and I've done a lot of stuff with guests um mostly my the two sort of paths that I've had for guests are one finding interesting artists and people who aren't on YouTube to come and talk about their work uh I also did a series uh which was curated by PSY X when they were the coding trained Community manager that was featuring black voices in Tech um so you know certainly for me thinking about using the coding train platform to shine a light on creators from diverse communities I think is important and something that I would like to do more of um so I don't know a having guessed is a true is much more work than I think it is so I don't know what to do about guests um but my in my Ideal World I think I would love to be able to have a system to feature the work of others on the coding train and have people happy guests maybe one of the maybe a way to do that is to have more guests for less time so like what would it mean for a guest to appear on the coding train for 10 minutes and be able to be remote um so uh this is something that I think that for me to be able to execute effectively it needs to be something that I hire somebody to produce basically to do the work of wrangling the guests curating the guests scheduling the things all of that stuff um so something I can talk with Katie about who's running the coding train social media to see if if she's interested or maybe this is something that um somebody already is working on something recording train or somebody in the audience right now might be interested in helping so I think if I'm going to do more with guests I need uh I need someone to sort of be have that be their project and kind of keep me in line here I found myself to be more disorganized in 22 than any other year of my life and I don't know I'm a little I always thought I was like a very organized on top of my todo list kind of person and I'm not anymore I have had more emails that I failed to mention people I forgot to call back things that I didn't follow up on in 2022 that any other year and I don't know if that's just how it's going to be for me for the rest of my life or if 2022 was sort of an anomaly well she'll see okay um I'm staring right here at a huge accomplishment in 2022 which is the new coding Train website so I'm going to put that here under oh sorry I didn't press the button I mean that should get its own category for um so I'm kind of at the bottom here uh coding train website so launch but one thing that I didn't do is make a video about it that's been on my list forever so um where to put that I'll put that here other under other coding Train website video like this I imagine being a 10 minute video that just says in 2022 the new coding Train website launched these are the different parts of the website this is how you this is the passenger showcase this is how you contribute to it thank you to all of these people who have done all this work on the website that kind of stuff so this is a big star because this is a must I feel like things that are a must are so far whistles to members I guess I should use like a different color what if I do like red coding Train website video uh whistles to members these are things that are a must I mean is wave function collapse an overlapping model bottle a must I think so but I'm not I hesitate to to use this red star just yet okay so that was a big accomplishment in 2022 looking at the list to think of other types of things uh that I want to do we've got to talk about nature of code I want to talk about these uh which leads me to the Oregon Trail project okay so let's come back let's go to I I can't believe that I'm about to do this but I am going to open up the Twitter application so we are not done with the questions we'll come back to the questions if you need to sign off of this live stream and go away and come back in about 10 minutes I fully understand warning trigger warning content warning I am opening up the healthscape that is twitter.com right now I am going to immediately go to slash schiffman and I also am going to make it oh let's close this okay my direct messages came up briefly that's fine sorry dragon's lore I understand the mess that is that board and how diagonal it is anything I could do to improve your viewing of it I would be glad redoing old videos is definitely on the list there Anusha to come back to talk about Okay so I want to scroll back through my Twitter timeline let's see if we can get to January first 2021 honestly like Twitter is the basically the only social media platform besides YouTube which is also social media platform that I actually use so I think we can discover oh my God I'm only at October we can discover a lot of things that I've done and things that I should follow up on by scrolling through the Twitter timeline if you don't mind just waiting for me to get through all the way to I'm in July halfway there um because I think there are many a thing here that um where are we may that I will discover that I accomplished and or that I want to do more um do more on in 2023. okay a lot of these are retweets of other people's wonderful work so that is less relevant to what I'm talking about today okay keep going all right a lot of severance content here on my Twitter no surprise all right so let's go back year in the life we're in February we're almost there everybody oh 2022. what are you what are we at 120 okay all right because I wanted to do the January challenge today whatever the January topic is before I go so I I this could go on forever I'm gonna try to wrap up in the next 10 to 20 minutes so I can do some coding today okay January 27th I did all these projects with January which was kind of fun and I think my idea was I was going to turn them into coding challenges and I never actually did uh January 11th Twitter is my Twitter was most active last January so if you're not from let's let's look up January let's get to January 1st um yeah Donna this I wanted to make a coding challenge I really wanted to do this as a coding challenge video okay let's see uh January 1st okay right so December 30th I did my Cody train processing Telethon you should donate to the processing there's no official Telethon this year all right and now we're at January 1st 2022. so what is January January is a artificially generated month of time where we at a community of people build code that makes beautiful things um It's Made of hashtags January you can do January 1 you can do January 2023 there are prompts uh we could probably just get chat GPT to do it for today and the first prompt is perfect perfect Loop envelope now I don't know that I'm going to do January this year last year I was like I'm on the start of my sabbatical I'm going to code a creative project every day I could do it it was a different time this year I gotta prepare my syllabi do a lot of other things but I think we can get started um but let's at least last year kind of scroll through last year's January just just pick out some things so this was my first one um a thousand squares I forgot what the prompt was ten thousand squares uh dithering maybe was one oh yes so this what is this called um there's a name for this and and uh I guess this dithering is the name but I Lloyd's algorithm the right was Accords algorithms the court so all right so let's put on the coding challenge list this is a really interesting algorithm and I would like to do it as a video there's a lot of potential to it for Creative twists so I'm just going to write down secord's algorithm and hopefully that will remind me so these are currently our sort of running list of coding challenge ideas for 2023 um right I was streaming on Twitch uh this was my first space nature of code I've got to talk about this was my variation on fidenze um which is a wonderful work by Tyler Hobbs uh retweeting some other cool stuff Square again this actually was really kind of fun I trained degenerative adversarial Network just on images of squares um other people's amazing work that I'm retweeting uh this is my variation on a Casey Reese style work um okay there's more challenge suggestions Tetris yes yes yes Tetris I should definitely do some other stuff that I did saw the wit I'm gonna scroll through this stuff quickly now just seeing uh this I loved I don't remember what kind of weirdness oh yeah I was going to do this as a coding challenge like generative cityscape I forgot that I did all these oh no somebody else did the that I did all these live streaming um no computer I did some kind of weird song thing polar coordinates uh this would be good for a short by the way to do a YouTube short on just uh Universal distribution of random more about prime this sand Falling Sand is a cool idea for a coding challenge I'm I'm writing it over here without switching back to the Whiteboard Falling Sand that's a kind of interesting idea for a coding challenge um more weird things oh yeah aikida map this is like a cool one I mean I was uh needs more cheese Ikea I mean does it make sense it is a coding challenge is does that just become like a YouTube short but these are good I mean these were meant to be last year and I never did them because I mean I did them that never followed through on it but actually having a year off from it probably makes the most sense VHS um uh uh text typography um this was kind of fun uh or just where are we where are we in day 23 most of this stuff is just stuff that I've done before Mandel bulb okay I did that that actually became a video or uh twitch Tuesday remember that everyone that was a funny idea uh oh I loved this this is what led me to like the Apple II stuff in some way like this apple II racer game that was fun to make um okay uh more with some star patterns oh yeah this this this I enjoyed which was like running my slide puzzle thing backwards so that I think when it's done it makes a pattern right yeah just organizes it okay um selfportrait day 28 uh okay organic looking output this is a like flocking simulation this is weird that one was a weird uh okay okay all right so now another new thing is uh welcoming Bernie who has been working on the YouTube shorts and has made some interesting uh trailers and different things for the coding train um there's a lot of Runway retweets I made a Wordle box let's try to play zillions of games of Wordle in different algorithms three blue one Brown beat me to making an amazing video on that way further along than anything I could have done um okay here's something we got to address where's my uh there's a very specific sound effect that I need for this I'd like to put something out into the universe the second edition of the nature of code will be available for free download at the natureofgo.com and for purchase and print by the 10th anniversary of its original publication this did not happen and I also just safely remember saying if I don't get it done by this date forget about it I'm giving up on the project so if you will all have a little Grace with me give me a little bit of um Give Me Your Grace be kind allow me to go back on my word and what I would like to say is while I didn't make this deadline I made progress and I have a lot of momentum and in fact if you go to right now github.com nature of code and go to book website second edition and if I go to insights um commits is what I'm looking for and I guess it's got to Crunch the numbers here hang tight but um 23 I obviously meant 2032 yeah uh I was going to just show there's like been a lot of commits in work and activity but the that's less important than actually showing you um so you can read the documentation about the new system for building the book there are even new illustrations I don't know why I don't have the link to the preview of it there's a whole preview which could go which is on netlify which I guess if I go to now just bear with me for a second let me find this link by logging into netlify ah sorry I have to two Factor fractal Flame hold on hold on everybody do you hear that fly buzzing around all right so netlify has been a big accomplishment for me in 2022 which is now I deploy sites through netlify now the five if you want to sponsor the coding train hit me up um but um so the Oregon Trail project is something I have to talk about Cody train new website but let's go to here oh how do I there we go and go to here and you can actually see this you this does not this does not go anywhere yet you cannot buy the book yet there's no donate button or anything but for example if I go to the vectors chapter you can see there is a rewrite of this chapter there are the actual code examples running on the page and if I click open in the web editor I get to the code example running in the web editor there's a new design there are new illustrations in a new style uh you can see that the book is here it's been updated to p5.js most of these chapters uh some of the late that's a layout mistake um the math formulas work there let me just see even at the end if there's like there's a whole new uh there's a whole new illustration style for this sort of like ecosystem project um you can see this like cool table of contents here on the right that I can get around I can go to the particle systems chapter and I can start reading the particles of the chapter so it's here work has been happening um so uh I'm thrilled to say that there is immense progress and momentum so I don't want to kill the project even though I didn't make my deadline I also I mean I don't think I'm ready to announce this yet but I am um and you can see some of these haven't been updated yet I think I will be working with a publisher to get the print version out um in higher quality uh and distributed through more channels uh it's all the while keeping the book for free online the entirety of the book for free online so there is a lot of to come this goes here top priority I'm going to put it just directly over here NOC book The other reason why I cannot kill this project and it's definitely going to get the red star guess what's going to really help this project I am teaching at New York University again this spring an undergraduate class a graduate class each with some number of students already enrolled in it it runs for 14 weeks it meets every week for hours at a time guess what the topic of both classes is the topic is the nature of code so I will be required to teach the nature of code every week to a classroom full of students not once but twice so what will I be working on every week preparing material for the nature of code which will get me to work on the nature of code book so my new deadline just let me finish it by the end of the semester it's gonna happen folks 2032 I mean it's a joke running joke at this point I don't care 2023 that is a huge goal there was gold star did not meet my deadline but accomplishments were made um again a lot of people offered to help with the book right now there's not much that I can say that is obvious of like how I how you could help but um certainly just cheering me on joining the coding train as a member actually I turned on GitHub sponsor this you really want to like as a like place for supporting the nature of code book I think I put it on those repos so that's one way you could support but just honestly just telling me that the book means something to you and you're excited to the second edition and you know you'll buy it if you can like that'll keep me going so stay in touch about it uh data of code book okay we've covered that um all right so we're back going back to Twitter I I want to get through scrolling through Twitter and then I think I mean this this could go on forever I I want to talk about a couple of things um I'm just looking through Prime spiral oh I was really using the wheel last year the cutting train the history of the cutting train is me starting with a plan and not following up on that plan sorry everybody uh ASCII challenge uh this shouldn't take too long I'm in February already just looking for anything that I want to make sure that I address oh yeah this is pretty funny I love this tweet okay um just to say what this is this is me watching me watching me again and you can just see like and look now like oh now we've got it like here you can all you can all screenshot this now or we can screenshot this and share this all over it look look at the gray I mean look at how much gray there is now people that's why I used to I used to get like you know I was getting older folks but my energy is still here right my smile won't go away um all right that was kind of amazing all right keep going Prime spiral uh um uh um we did uh we feature for Black History Month we featured a lot of uh uh people uh black creators and technologists processing four that was nice that was great um uh let's see what else is going on Pi Day happened Mandel bulbs happened uh um um um what quad tree stuff happened ah yes MDR Lumen so Severance I mean but really I'm running I'm I'm quickly running out of energy here and my brain is uh melting I would like to work on this Severance Pro so let's not not to be specifically about Severance but if I go back to the Whiteboard for a second uh sorry I have to sneeze do I have any tissues in this room I don't think I do that's you I'll have to find the kleenex let's see let's see how far this wireless mic oh here's some oh it's cold in here okay I should probably mute myself everybody I'm going to blow my nose I have not muted my microphone please enjoy amazing wow I feel like a new man okay I like to work on useless weird software projects for entertainment purposes only and one of them is oh and you can't see that probably oh yes if I turn there we go okay this is only going to make things worse but um so I would like to work on MDR uh in conjunction with my working titles video maybe I would make a video on that so that I would like to do more of in 2023 uh if you don't know what I'm talking about that's fine we're getting it's I've been I'm an hour and 40 minutes into this live stream uh you people want to know more about that add it to the online questions thing but the reason why I'm remembering this is I am working on a version of the Oregon Trail this may come as somewhat of something of a shock to you what did I just do to uh but um that's going to get a red star because it's something I've committed to um basically I to make a long story short Oregon Trail is a game from the 80s possibly maybe it was actually made earlier in the 70s there was a version for it for the Apple II I played through it during the live stream I started trying to make a p5.js sort of like authentic uh uh replica Port of it it's not an emulator but just trying to make something that has the same exact look and feel of the game in p5.js uh just because I'm interested in trying to do that but the reason is there's a podcast I listened to called run app raanap you have no idea what I'm talking about that's fine you probably shouldn't where they played through the Oregon Trail as part of the podcast and uh I have committed to making a version of the game that is telling the story of the podcast instead of the Oregon Trail that they'll play through on an episode so I gotta make the I gotta work on that this is very important to me so that's on my list for 2023 and maybe I can make a video about it I mean that's also kind of an ongoing question in my head is to what extent should like for this project would people be interested in a kind of like scripted explainer video I don't I typically haven't done this on YouTube but like a project like this it took a very long time to build it's not really going to fit into like a coding challenge video first of all I'm going to rebuild the whole thing step by step no I already made it but I could make a video that describes what this project is how it works uh you know interesting sort of like coding tidbits about little techniques that are inside there tell the story of it you know something more along the lines of what Sebastian lag does I'm not saying I could do it nearly as well but that's a question so that that is kind of like um if I go back to the Whiteboard like for projects like this you know explainer video is that something that I want to consider doing it could even be like total voiceover not really my style but that is kind of a style of YouTube um thinking about it okay scrolling through we are in March um this was this is what I would I would characterize this to one of my fail failures I really always wanted to do I Love Phil Hartman's anal retentive Chef oldtime Live sketch tried to make my own version of it called the anal retentive coder I think a few people found this really funny and fun but most people just either didn't like it it didn't want didn't definitely did not catch the YouTube algorithm um but um uh there you go uh okay uh maybe I'll maybe I'll think of something for April fools this year maybe not I was on a billboard um a lot of stuff about this project a lot of severance stuff oh the Apple II arrived so that happened in April last year uh this this is pretty funny this was me for the first day I turned it on did you all hear that and there's smoke oh so that led me to oh this is a nice time lapse of me unboxing the Apple II uh um but that led me to working on fixing up the Apple II computer uh uh all right that you know whole new studio uh uur bot was a new bot that I released also related to Severance I would like to do more about with that um wave function collapse uh scrolling through what am I a lot of interesting Runway stuff or wave function collapse um some other things I'm promoting other people's great work all right that's the question I really want to do Twitter bot um oh I got to make a list of tutorials oh dear the Discord bot um I really wanted to do so let's as I come up with things let me go back so I also want to make a list now of tutorials so I think it would make sense to that the things that are on my mind are more NOC that I imagine making more nature of code videos as I am um um as I am teaching the class um processing for intro series Discord bot tutorial and um uh redo p5.js and then there's a question of whether I should you know there's sort of this like ml5 and like um like do like um do I want to do text generative AI with generative AI tutorials these are that's kind of like a list of things I might like to do uh like General like basically generative AI tutorials I imagine being more things like oh how do you take a model that's hosted on something like hugging face and access it in your p5.js sketch that's kind of what I'm thinking of for those um okay uh to Twitter okay so back to here uh we caught weak COC was there for the computer live burning okay so I I was on um uh Raphael's stream I don't think there's a lot of wave function collapse um right we can see here more stuff um maybe a class is launched a local storage video um I'm almost done I think with everything I wanted to go over today there was an ITP show summer happened um if I see is there something important I should under Monty Hall problem I did that video uh uh so I tried to fix the Apple II Plus uh oh I went to Copenhagen yay Copenhagen uh that was awesome where where will I go this year I like to go somewhere and to some processing Community Day Japan any viewers in Japan invite me to Japan that's where I'm going that's a that's on my my next list of a place I really want to go to that maybe I can make happen this year um uh okay uh So speaking which this is me with Cheryl the coconut if anybody knows what Charo the coconut is then to you you probably already subscribed to nebula new website there was a train was like the weekly challenge uh Bernie I met Bernie in person in Copenhagen Copenhagen is tomorrow people they were so great I had such a good time I want to go back to Copenhagen and there's me and Copenhagen and Stig we're wearing flower shirts um then I took a pilgrimage to the super Ellis it's circled stork I went to Sweden that was awesome I got covered that was no fun uh um okay where what else what else is happening here uh uh yes uh did the collaboration with Grady from practical engineering if you don't know practical engineering the channel is awesome I also got to meet Grady in person at educon that was great thank you for indulging me I'm just kind of going through my year we're just getting close to being done um there was Google summer of code uh all these wonderful stickers Christian Dr Christian hubicki we did robot controller so this could be a nice the PID controller could be a really nice um coding Challenge video p i d controller and that would fit really well with nature of code because I'm rewriting the nature of code chapter the physics Library chapter to use matter.js and I used matter.js in this example I could bring those together in a coding challenge video that would be great so let's put that on the list and you can see the result of it here this was like a really fun project to work on where basically the controller balances of balances this uh uh upside down pendulum and I can change the two different parameters here the P gain or the D gain uh to look at how that's done um so I will I would love to revisit that I got obsessed with corgis I mean I'm already obsessed with corgis but generative corgis there was mini dolly for a while uh that was a thing look at all Corgi images uh phase um there's schifferpal which is a color that's just dedicated to me I guess which is pretty cool okay again this just reminding me about how this did not happen but I already covered this um ah by the way so uh foreign is a great Creator um on nebula and this is um uh one of the reasons why you know maybe the anal retentive coder would have done well in nebula um but you know sometimes disgusting race um can videos can be demonetized for different kinds of reasons and um so he he's able to have those videos be placed on nebula I'm not explaining that well but I'm very tired it's been a long live stream I'm scrolling through to see if there's anything else boy look at this this is processing from 12 1002. I was a young I was young then I was I started working with processing like right around I don't know somewhere in here okay more processing fellows my nebula class which I've talked about um came out um Lots about Apple II this this is I think my favorite thing that I made if you haven't seen it let's just watch this I'll be there oh baby we're going together okay okay that was my favorite thing foreign that I did I don't know what that refers to Leonardo oh it's okay um so more oh Sebastian lag that was a thrill seeing Sebastian lag make a snake game based on my video um John Mida tweeted a photo of maybe his Apple too that was really cool um Tetris look at this well other one made a Tetris clone for the Apple too uh okay keep going there's a lot of Apple II content here uh um I was featured in The Creator economy series on YouTube the new website launched um Andreas refgaard always makes really cool stuff uh um Runway did more amazing things we're getting there in September and I sort of stopped using Twitter a lot this fall so this should go pretty fast um ah yes this was also a huge thrill this is like by the way this was recorded I need to follow up I know people would actually want to watch the recording I might have to make this like a members only thing but I was able to participate at an evening of none it's their detail in New York City on Saturday the 8th of October three blue one brown Moira Dylan Jeremy Fielding Beck Hill if you're not a you know if you're not a Beck Hill fan I don't know that anyone could reach the Beck Hill fandom Heights that I have reached you should absolutely I mean you probably the reason why I'm you probably already know if you if you watch the coding drain you might be familiar with Matt Parker three blue one brown Jeremy Fielding bogra Dylan is a professor at NYU but you probably are not familiar with Beck Hill the comedian and television host and author and podcaster all of her stuff is just so so good so good ah I want to be back hill when I grow up um okay that was I I kind of was wondering so let me talk about that for a second so I don't know if any of you was anybody there anybody in the chat happen to be at an evening of unnecessary detail uh let's see if I can find I think there was a picture of it we'll get to it because I think there's a photo of me which will remind me more more Apple II stuff um I uh here we go so here is me thank you Mariko for tweeting this photo of me on stage uh Matt Parker typing into the Apple II so I feel like so I had 10 minutes and I had planned to Live code the bouncing ball in apple basic which I did but I wasted so much time that I only had about two minutes to do that and I think those two minutes were um those two minutes were the best part of my life my life I set so to speak you know we're talking about this as like a kind of comedy show or 10 minute sets and I think I did too much like trying to tell jokes to do explanatory introduction I feel like the first five to six minutes were not good I tried to also be in character like I just time traveled from you know I was like you know like a time capsule and I just exploded out of it onto the stage anyway um there was a recording of it um anyway I didn't feel I really would like to do more live stuff I did it I feel like I would give myself a B minus I uh everybody else I'd give it a plus with a phenomenal like seeing um Matt Parker perform live I mean this is really this is a skill it is a talent but it is also a rehearsed and practiced skill and I was thinking about doing like a live show if and when the nature of code book is done it's sort of like a book party but I don't know if I could pull off a full hour I could have guests I also just don't know like I think I need a like a director or a writer consultant to help me with this anyway that was a really that was a great thing I should put that under my accomplishments that was I don't like the expression like bucket list so much but that was like a bucket list experience for me uh so it it's going on the very bottom a e o u d so nature of code book live book party question mark I mean I could definitely do that venue caveat in New York was great do you want to invite me to like London I'll do one I don't know why I think one did because maybe maybe I could get you know some of the London oh Seb Seb who has uh was my inspiration for doing this because Seb Lee DeLisle if you're not familiar with Seb has done all these wonderful evening of an essay detail spots live coding um in London and Seb gave me some advice which I think I don't know if I took or not but what his advice was good and anything I did well was because of seb's excellent advice anything I did poorly was my own problem but um thinking about that for 2023 that would be fun to do just live coding for an hour or something a live coding train sort of thing uh creative coding comedy yeah I like your I like your ideas um Stig yes so I need to follow up and get the video of this because it was sent to me via a Dropbox link I clicked in the Dropbox link and it didn't work and I took that I was like a sign from God up above said nobody should ever watch this recording delete it from the world it happened it was there it was live I did it uh maths B was there oh and Max B is in the chat oh look hello to you uh that was I was so happy you were there it gave me a sort of a boost of energy uh to know that there was fans of the coding trade in the audience and thank you for saying that was great I really that's that's nice of you um okay moving along oh my God it's it's time it's two this is the end oh I got a dot matrix printer um uh what is this oh there's a new processing Library more Runway um uh Brian McManus also a nebula um et cetera et cetera et cetera blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah uh uh more coding Train website um um some more other stuff some cool stuff uh Apple II uh set that I built erase and replace from Runway gave me that uh um uh Blair is an amazing artist some weird stuff about the Apple II Graphics we're so close we're in October uh this was my favorite Halloween costume that somebody dressed how fast I thought this is totally brilliant uh uh fun little uh trailer whoops this is the whoops for 2022. oops oh it's a little internet stutter there sorry it froze you can watch that on your own uh this was amazing hypercube running on the Arduino uh other people's great work on this I also used runways in painting so this is like just a still for my video that I used oh out painting I'm sorry to uh uh um to oh that's not what it looked I'm looking at it right over here not what the room looks like but Gotta Love what AI generated images can do these days we're almost done uh Mastodon I am on Mastodon I have not been using it um okay we've got my 3D video I'm gonna disappear from the internet soon because we're in November um more about nebula classes um uh uh and just some other stuff I think I've just started retweeting things uh talking about chat gbw this is the chat GPT uh um Starfield that I was referencing and uh the code from my challenge versus chat GPT that is such a cursed image I like these portraits from Runway uh I made a Survivor analogy bot uh uh uh whistle that's a cool project uh ITP show happened you can apply to ITP still and that's it we made it through 2022 we recapped whoops wow that camera went off wait was it not is it not plugged in oh no I moved the camera around and I didn't plug it back in well that's fortuitous here um we will take a picture of this whiteboard this is good I'm done anyway let me let me plug it back in where where did the plug go for that camera oh never ends I never never can get anything right here on the coding train it's so weird that's that one's plugged in it's funny I bought a second back of battery and everything oh here it is oh I forgot to plug it in I'm so silly it's on the floor all right we're we're gonna um this is I'm wrapping up folks but I'm gonna do some coding so don't go anywhere I'm gonna end by doing something for January and I'm gonna I'll come back to show the Whiteboard at the end let's go to the questions that should be charging up now uh um okay uh bias bias is in the chat um let's see uh um Okay so what's left for today buy us in the chat ah shorts why talk about the shorts coding guard and ask about the shorts perfect perfect timing because bias is in the bias is in the chat Bernie is in the chat let me go to let's talk about the shorts so I don't know about this shorts thing but I like to try all the ways of communicating with the audience that the internet has to offer I've been hearing about this social media platform that the youths have been using called tick tock that's right tick tock I have a tick tock so I'm experimenting with a variety of Joyful log sound effects a variety of YouTube has its Tick Tock like clone uh called shorts and thanks to the bias agency Bernie who I met in uh Copenhagen we've been exploring the idea of making coding trained shorts and the nice thing about this is they're actually really easy to make only one minute long if I record for like 15 minutes like you when I record like a coding challenge I I could be recording for eight or nine hours but like I can make a one minute short so we're I'm trying to figure out like what is a useful meaningful way to use this format to expand the audience of people watching the coding train that's not really the goal but what is the goal here why do I want to make shorts one is I'm just curious to try them because I like trying new stuff um I think the other goal would be to sort of build community and inspire people to code and try things out so there are a few different things um so one way of doing that is that we thought of is to answer your questions so so people we we sort of what we did is we went through and looked through YouTube comments and tweets picked out some questions did all this work with Bernie and um so you know I could play one of these I could answer questions so like um promise is a promise no coding train yeah so I uh yeah so this came from a question let's look at the Save gift one question from jewelry I want to include not a single PNG but a gift but I have problems with the correct implementation Julian your question couldn't have come at a better time and the newest release of P5 there is a save gift function arguments you need to add are file name for the gift you want to save and how long you want to record the candidates and then there's an additional trick that I'll show you in a minute whoa no idea what's gonna happen overlay now this is incredible oh look at that it worked it doesn't Loop perfectly that's because I just said do it for five seconds but what if I said do it for a specific number of frames a full loop is from zero to two Pi so the angle changes by two pi divided by the number of frames now I can replace the number five with the number of frames and then an options object to tell it the unit I wanted to consider is not seconds I think that's to perfectly looping GIF in P5 with one line of code question I want to include so I've seen the chat um people are are are rightfully critical of shorts I there's some shorts are click bait uh drown out the good videos uh shorts are a distraction I mean I have a problem like I when I first downloaded tick tock I kind of got like sucked in and I had deleted it off my phone like two days later then like a few weeks ago I downloaded again and now I set the thing where like if I look at Tick Tock for more than 10 minutes it like beeps at me and says like hey you've been looking at this for 10 minutes maybe you want to take a break and I take a break so I do I do the shorts format I you know I enjoy watching them like there's like the talent of people like first of all the Tic Tac algorithm looked into my soul and found out who I am so after like watching i i before it's a little funny story here I I decided as an experiment brand new tick tock account let me just scroll and watch stuff I'm gonna give it one hour and I gave it one hour scroll past stuff watch stuff after an hour all the tick tock started showing me was a musical I was just in musical theater Tick Tock it was showing me behind the scenes music like people explaining uh there's this great I think the Mt was like all of the tictocker explains all sorts of stuff about um music theory about musicals and I was like seeing like you know just like tremendous talent to people like duetting stuff from musical theater like it was amazing so either was kind of like this is a little bit creepy but like you know I'm you'd think like I'd be into like Tech Tick Tock no I was just watching what I enjoyed skipping through things finding things all music computer content which totally said something about me um the audio plays twice when you're playing a video on the screen apologies it's because it's playing out of my speakers and in through my mic so I'm pressing the wrong buttons so anyway so these are the formats we're experimenting with um but let me just check my messages here um I can actually possibly Premiere a new short right here um which is that I think something that I'm excited about is can I also use shorts to give you like a really quick one minute overview of a coding challenge topic and then if you're interested in it you could obviously watch the longer one and so the very first one I'm going to go over here because I uh it's um I'm going to um I probably shouldn't do this because I should have you all make sure to watch this why am I in the processing Foundation YouTube account um I should uh have you all watch it okay this is the one you know what I'm gonna do let me show you I I some of you might have seen it because I briefly released it yesterday and then we found a mistake in it so here's what I'm gonna do uh coding coding guarding we're writing a really interesting comment here which is a new generation people that consume all their media through shorts Tick Tock reels you kind of have to publish there to get in them interested in the long form content yeah and it's not click bait if it introduces new users to other valuable coding trained content um yeah this is kind of like my thinking I mean I'm you know I'm going in with some caution I want to be careful I want to bring positive meaningful communication to the internet not uh which which can just be people doing silly dances like again this is not a good like I enjoy watching people doing silly dances it brings me like lights up certain things in my brain makes me feel a little bit of happiness go on video I do think there is a danger to the sort of addictive quality of the rabbit holes that we can get sucked into but you know so what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you the version that is currently understanding experience stop stop stop pause okay I am going to uh play right Z Dax it makes a good point you can't learn coding by shorts so I wouldn't expect to be making shorts that are really like long form tutorials but they might have a little bit of an idea that gets you thinking to try something or that might get you excited about something to go and learn coding um so um yeah yeah um okay so here is this is so this is what I'm going to ask of you the short that I'm going to play for you I've spent longer explaining this short than sure is one minute long there's a mistake in it in the end so this is the unlisted it won't matter for your experience of it right now at all because the mistake is like you'd have to like pause zoom in to find the mistake but I still wouldn't like it to be there so I would like to play this for you get get your thoughts on it Bernie is in the chat um later today uh I'm going to release the fixed version of it it would be wonderful if you would watch it it only takes one minute I would also love to hear from you if it pops up in your short speed randomly um anyway so this one actually already has like a few hundred views 40 likes on it I don't know I'm a little worried that releasing it and then taking it off and then uploading a new one is going to mess this one up but um um I I want to read maths these are there's a really great discussion going on in the chat right now about the shorts I know I lost the Discord chat because I went to my direct messages so apologies to coding trained members if you're uh okay yeah um okay great so so a math here it's the gift one encapsulates the idea of inspiration really well getting excited to figure out how to create the same thing yeah that's the idea um okay so let's without further Ado uh let's Premiere this short and it's unfortunately going to start in the middle two to one minute I'm gonna take it easy on myself start with the recursive tree which was only about a 15 minute video in the first place I'll play it through twice start with a blank canvas set a line color and a stroke weight translate to the bottom middle of the canvas which is where the tree will grow from then write a function draw a branch which is just a single vertical line with the magic of recursion the branch function can call itself shrinking the length of the next time but this would end up in an infinite Loop so we better have an exit condition to stop drawing when the branch gets too short then we can add an angle translate to the end of the branch to draw the next one then we can rotate off to the right by some angle we can also recursively rotate off to the left throw a little push and pop in there so that each time we draw a branch we're starting from the right position there we go a fractal Tree in p5.js you can watch the full video for a much longer explanation the coded train passenger showcase is full of your beautiful recursive trees you're watching this right now at your own I want to try and experiment can I boil down one of my full coating Challenge videos into one minute I'm gonna take it easy on myself and start with the recursive tree which was only about a 15 minute video in the first place step number one start with a blank canvas set a line color and a stroke weight translate to the bottom middle of the canvas which is where the tree will grow from then write a function draw a branch which is just a single vertical line with the magic of recursion the branch function can call itself shrinking the length of the next time but this would end up in an infinite Loop so we better have an exit condition to stop drawing when the branch gets too short then we can add an angle translate to the end of the branch to draw the next one then we can rotate off to the right by some angle we can also recursively rotate off to the left throw a little push and pop in there so that each time we draw a branch we're starting from the right position there we go a fractal Tree in p5.js you can watch the full video for a much longer explanation the coded train passenger showcase is full of your beautiful recursive trees you're watching this right now at your that all right so uh so so that's the new short I'm pretty excited about this one I also recorded one where I try to make the recursive tree with chat GPT that hasn't been uh finished yet but that will come out at some point too um so um so I'm sorry I'm reading the chat so a if you have any thoughts I mean I don't think realistically we're not going to like redo this whole short right now in the next but because Bernie fixed the error um um but thank you Cody garden and me I am so B for your positive feedback um but I um so this short actually I just got a message from Bernie I see that the new version is uploaded Bernie if you're listening if you're watching you can actually go ahead and uh if you want to like upload this into the channel and duplicate all the metadata um then I could potentially release it at the very end of this live stream but um uh Adam Savage has the slogan about his videos that they are not howto videos as much as they are what happened videos interesting interesting that's interesting to think about it because I really do think about a lot of my videos as howto videos the coding Challenge videos are kind of what happened but they are sort of like watch it while it's happening you know because I don't that's what I'm I'm thinking about if I if I I don't know if the the Whiteboard camera came back on but I'm thinking about doing some like let me go back and write a script to explain the process of building something um that that could that's something that I'm interested in doing anyway ah I am I am um really really tired it's been two hours and 20 minutes I didn't take a break I think I need to wrap things up um I want us to continue this conversation about what's going to happen with the coding train in 2023 I want to see if this camera comes back on uh which it did it is not in Focus anymore so let me focus it so excuse me my whiteboard is back uh and uh all right so let's take a look let's let's take a look at the Whiteboard here this is the map I'm sure I missed things I didn't touch on anything I don't have every new possible idea written here but this is everything that I accomplished for the coding train in 2022 yay me did this get really dark again yeah I think it didn't save whatever camera settings so strange I don't understand this this camera but um I should get maybe I should get new cameras for 2023 cameras are very expensive but I that's something that uh did I say that this uh sponsored by curiosity stream bundle I'll put the link on screen in a second it's in the description um this is uh sorry yay to celebrate 2022. here's a hope for 2023 of many things I would like to work on um I don't know how to prioritize this somebody wants to I I maybe I should like reformat this into some kind of document or GitHub markdown or something um but I'm excited about if if I do if I get a quarter of what's on this list done in 2023 I will be happy uh I think priorities are I've got to get the nature of code book done I've got to send out these whistles to people who have supported the coding train for a long time I really should make a video to announce the coding Train website and I hope to work on this Oregon Trail project uh and I would love to get 10 coding Challenge videos done I kind of want to put a red star there 10 coding challenge videos topics whatever and then I'm not sure about under here like what if I had to pick one tutorial series to absolutely do honestly I think it might be the processing for intro series which is my oldest set of tutorials to redo those and I think that's the thing I could just like sit down for a day and do it'll obviously take more time to edit and put it all together but in terms of recording um that's might be the easiest um okay I also really want to do this Severance working titles thing but I don't know if that gets a red star okay before I go thank you wolf Rose um before I go I'm already 25 minutes over what I want it to be but let's look at January and let's go to um the prompts oh I am tired I need coding Garden you have this I don't know if Cody Gardner is still watching you have this thing that like pops up to remind you to take a break or stretch good thing about me and my situation is I always stream standing whoa sorry the green screen curtain is like a skew and I just slipped on it because I was gonna feel like I'm always moving around but I really should take uh breaks um okay I my nose is running I hope I'm not getting sick I don't think I am um Okay so perfect Loop infinite Loop endless gifts well that's funny that's the prompt for today huh so let's use Save GIF in P5 time out for Mac I should get that uh David Curry hello there I hope I get to see you uh this spring when I'm back lovely to see names that I recognize in the chat and new names I almost meant to oh let's fix it all right so what is your in the chat everybody let me know what is something you did in 2012 all right I'm so tired I was like I like to hear from people in the chat what is something you coded in 2022 that you're proud of put that into the chat all right let's go to look at let's log in here oh I forgot about the online questions I will come back to those um okay open all right so I'm gonna come back this this is still here pinned comment but let's make a perfect looping gif for the new year let's make a happy New Year looping gif Tomer Schwartz says I coded a complete neural network from scratch Martin bellanger a simple inventory system for work in Python Melissa Rodriguez a squiggly line algorithm I feel like I remember seeing you post about this ah your live coding language runs on a Nintendo DS David Curry wow uh Game of Life and flocking simulation senior thesis oh hey Maverick did a PID control system well all this stuff you guys are coding is amazing did anybody learn to code say hi in the chat if you learned to code in 2022 like you had never coded before Kathy says the mandelbulb thank you Kathy uh ASCII art from DJ Mangus all this is great great I love hearing these I love hearing all these from you all okay so what should my can we make a perfect looping firework gif let's try this I don't I don't have a lot of energy right now to code something new so I'm pretty sure I have let's go to codingtrain.com challenges filter by topic let's look up fireworks let's go to 2D fireworks here's the example okay so how could I turn this into a um Joe says I learned P5 just from you in 2022 no exposure before it gets the train whistle all right so here is let me just also make sure my family isn't like texting me like where where where are you uh okay um uh okay uh okay okay okay uh we're gonna release okay see we got we got a bunch of things going here got a like a lot of things okay impossible okay uh hi from Brazil I know there's a lot of folks who watch in Brazil this is another question by the way I'm sorry that I cannot keep a thought going here but I'm reminded by how International the audience is um I have the opportunity to dub a lot of my videos using AI technology and it's quite good I would say it's not the same but I'm hesitant to do that part of me feels like I shouldn't be take I shouldn't okay so I would love to make the videos more accessible and have them be in more languages but I would rather somebody watch a native speaker of their own language teach them the concepts then my voice somehow AI dubbed into that other language I definitely will experiment with it but I'm I'm confused about that and thank you um yes and congratulations to you Brazil on your new president and happy 2023. okay let me move let's we got to make this happen so I'm going to make this first thing I got to do here is first duplicate it then I need to let's make it uh 640 by 360. so how could this be a perfect Loop well I guess it could be a perfect Loop if I let this window clear could it huh I'm trying to think I mean I certainly could use random seed right so that it runs there's no purling noise or anything here um I'm struggling um people are talking about in the chat about the language translation switch between two ran make five or six spawners that only create a new fireworks once each Ken Haley says reseeding so say more Ken Haley this right like it should be able to oh what if I reseed it in the middle right uh I don't know I know why I'm not able to Think Through how I think it's because I've been live streaming for two and a half hours without a break I'm not able to Think Through effectively how to do this as a loop I see what if I okay let me let's think about it this way what if I need a cycle right right every n frames reset the random seed after the first n frames the loop should be perfect right so what if okay so I I get I got the I I understand now I think which is that if but there's a lot of how much Randomness I guess there's not a lot of Randomness once they burst so okay so let me do it this way for a second um like what if I do this okay random seed 99. and then I'm gonna have a counter so every time there's a new firework counter plus plus if counter I need this to happen after everything else actually it shouldn't really matter but yeah and then if counter is greater than or equal to 5. random seed 99. so let's do three this is what I'm trying to do basically I start with a random seed which will push in three zero one two once we get four zero one two three once we get zero goes to one one goes to two two goes through now once we get three one two three random seed should start over oh and the counter has to go back to zero okay one two three one two three uh what did I miss here uh so I got close but the third one doesn't match up third one is always different because the third one do I need okay hold on let me do it with just one yeah okay so this is working why do I suddenly get another one over there like I'm getting the same one over and over again because yeah this is a really tricky coding problem that I have created for myself but I would kind of like to be able to solve it now just curiosity just try yeah what what causes the slightly different one to happen there's a lot of random stuff going on what if what if I didn't use random at all what if I didn't use random at all here just out of curiosity just taking out all the randomness from yeah okay so now this works so I think the issue was I wonder if using P5 Vector random 2D is messing up the random seed because okay okay hold on hold on I got an idea okay okay so now let me get rid of this okay hold on hold on oh let me get rid of the auto refresh for a second um hold on let me do it this way I'm sorry my um so what if I use I'm so tired and I haven't had any lunge this is like the worst time for me to be doing this but I'm determined with stubborn from angle so what I'm doing is my suspicion is that what if uh what did I mess up now okay no okay so no so okay so let's just oh yeah so that yeah so no oh this doesn't matter because that's just the firework the the original particle I see so it's here so what if I have an idea just bear with me for a second here I'm gonna do something weird interesting I I could make an array random 2D uses that's why I thought that's why I thought me I am so me might be the problem oh how if you have more fireworks in the air than the number of calls you're all like telling me really good things in the chat so I think what I need to do I have a very weird idea which is I mean what I need is multiple I need a different idea making a perfectly looping firework system I think maybe I should go for a different a different idea is this is this am I going down a path that I I just want to be done so let's do a different Happy New Year let's use the text 2023 I have an idea I have an idea I have a better idea okay I have a better idea here here I think you need to precompute the exploded particles random data from when the firework is launched that's what I was thinking but I'm gonna I'm pivoting I'm pivoting um okay uh we're gonna do uh steering uh okay we're going to do this okay oops well not new oh my God I I duplicate duplicate okay this is what I'm going to do um so let's first boy this is old code um font text to points why is it not Center that's going to bother me and let's forget about the mouse okay I need to get rid of the mouse whoops okay so I can make this you just run it backwards like every okay okay make every particle a random color I like that so I'm just going to do a very basic version of this High roadock by the way thanks for all your help with the various repos you've been contributing to um so this obviously I could I I could run it backwards but I want uh let's actually code running it backwards I'm sure there's a very creative clever thing that I could do with this but right now I'm going to say this dot home I'm going to give it a new variable called home and then its actual position is this.home dot copy and then um when um so I just out of curiosity let's just say in behaviors let's calculate the distance okay I got to turn off auto refresh um one thing that drives me crazy about the web editor I don't know if this is a known bug that's been uh posted is if you have Auto Refresh on and an error happens it like takes you out of the tab you're typing in which kind of makes sense but I don't know if there's a way around that okay distance is um uh P5 vector distance between this dot position and this dot Target if this if distance is less than one then um this dot Target equals this dot home so let me just try this for a second so this is them all going back I kind of want to add separation in yeah so the problem here also is I need to wait until they're all done add let's do this so this is a little bit silly but um let's assume let's assume that they all are done and if its position is greater than one pixel than all done is not is not true so basically I'm going to look at every single vehicle and compare its position to its Target and if any single one of them is further than one pixel they're not all done then if all done four let V of vehicles V Dot Target equals V Dot home then I'm going to set all of our targets back to the home what what is this extra Square there did I type something in by accident oh whoops that's weird oh this is and this is okay look I gotta put Auto refresh back on what did I miss I feel like uh oh that shouldn't matter right oh oh my goodness so this is not the greatest clever this thing I've ever done but hold on let's I can also I think this must be what's centering it yeah I see so I guess I'm just gonna eyeball centering it I'm so tired I have to finish this live stream okay excellent so I would like to add separation into it although that's not really going to work because they can't be separated as they all right so so this works the question is now how do I Define like if I use Save gif let's go back to P5 the save GIF function what I want to do is call save gif certain number of seconds and we could try just with seconds because it's going to end back where it started let's just try oh you know what we are not using a recent version of P5 I don't know what's going on let me I definitely need to take off auto refresh now because that's going to mess things up okay nothing's in there let's see why does it do it twice when you put it in setup so weird there's some bug I had this issue before so this makes no sense to me but I'm gonna try something so I'm going to take save gif by the way it's also uh I haven't been running the heat for noise in here now it's getting very cold so my fingers can't type uh and I'm going to say I'm going to create a Boolean called Ready Set it to false and then set ready equal to true and then only if ready do all this stuff all right ready let's see how this does so now as soon as I hit the space bar why is it doing it twice do you notice that am I losing my mind here thank you watch this watch this we're gonna hit the space bar it acts like it's doing it and then it like stops and does it again and then it downloads the GIF and it's empty now I had this issue before I don't remember why I'm very sad this is welcome to the 2023 on the coding train where nothing I do works and I don't understand why and I'm very tired and I need to eat lunch what like what am I missing here I mean I think it's just a bug in save gif because it should start doing it at that time I had this issue before when I was recording that short save gift first saves each frame then renders them I don't it says saved then rendered save then renders okay wait wait wait I'm not understanding this saves each frame then renders them what does that mean I'm looking at the chat I don't understand what that means okay oh how much time we should wait before recording it is not recommended to write this function inside setup since it won't work properly okay the first time it says save the second it says rendered okay so I does specifically say don't put it in setup which makes sense let me run this again and see if I can catch what you guys are all saying saved frame rendered frame oh oh that makes sense so it's actually not doing it twice but why is my so now the question becomes why is my GIF empty or is it not empty why is it empty so now something else is going on so okay it is doing it let's just give it 10 seconds right saving all these frames so that makes sense and now it's rent it's just telling me what's going on I got it's not doing it twice it's saving then it's rendering it saving it into memory and then rendering it the question I have is why is it empty I totally understand now um what is the most key pressed save gif 10. what if I were to say let's try this this should be the same thing oh no what if I put in draw and setup no Loop and then say Loop here oh I shouldn't make it that long well this is weird oh red I forgot about the oh it's because of this ah try this oh let's not okay yeah there we go this should work now let's see if this works could it be a quick look thing it could be do you think it's like actually working but I'm just there we go I don't know what I did but now it works this is like the least interesting thing I could have done but let's um I think I only need about three seconds foreign let's see there we go wait I actually what I want is for it to be a hold on the 2023 longer but it's fine you get the idea oh yeah yeah happy 2023 everybody all right let me save this code uh let me put it in the chat is anybody even still watching this stream some people are uh okay there you go you can I'm sure you can improve this in 700 million different ways I'm going to call this a win uh that I have now made a happy New Year looping 2023. happy 2023 everybody yes happy 2023. oh my God it's so loud thank you thank you uh this is my oh that camera went off but I don't care all right let's do something exciting so here are my calls to action one is thank you uh to curiosity stream for offering this highly discounted bundle if you go to curiositystream.com choo choo you can get curiositystream thousands of documentaries and nebula um but really um for free so thank you to curiosity stream for sponsoring um this coding train uh live stream and for sponsoring coding train really for all of 2022 and you know for the foreseeable future so go check out that link um if you're interested in my uh in the nebulous streaming service or in particular um I'm just going to bring up this um you know if you have a friend uh uh who wants to learn to code maybe this uh you know hello there's the Cody drain YouTube channel but I also made this uh class on the nebula streaming service that I hope you would enjoy that you could get uh you could get directly through this link uh right uh go.nebula.tv Slash what is code but the curiosk stream bundle will give it to you for about two dollars per month whereas if you go through this link uh it's about four dollars per month so both support the coding train so you just want to put that out there Link in the description uh uh oh right uh whiteboard is there you can just go back and that's the plan now let's do something exciting here we are going to go and launch a new short on the coding trade so uh I am going to go to the studio YouTube Studio um and I'm going to go look at uh uh coating a fractal Tree in 60 seconds zero views I'm going to change this one to private you know I can I can I can give you a little peek into YouTube Studio here so I'm going to go here and I'm going to change this one to private save and this one I feel like I should check it all right I'm going to check it on this laptop I want to try and experiment can I boil down one of my full coding Challenge videos into one minute take it easy on myself and start with the recursive tree which was only about a 15 minute video in the first place sorry that you're not able to see this is that a line color and a stroke translate to the bottom middle of the canvas which is where the tree will grow from then write a function draw a branch don't worry I'm still here I'm paying attention to you just hold on a second call itself shrinking shrinking the length I think it's only a minute it's only a minute I just double checking it translate to the end of the branch rotate there we go a fractal tree and p5gs you can watch the full video for a month we're starting from the right position there we go a fractal tree and p5gs that looks like the right code line translate Push rotate Branch push rotate area all right I think we're good all right so we're going to do something really exciting here uh this has been a threehour stream how did that happen okay I'm definitely gonna I guess I'm eating dinner at this point by the time the stream's over okay thank you all for being here um what I'm going to do is I am going to set this video to public I'm not going to set it as an instant Premiere because that's silly and then uh I'm gonna say goodbye uh which is this is me saying goodbye I'm gonna set this to public I am asking all uh 200ish of you to go and watch this short and maybe you could like leave a like and a comment you know just if you want just for engagement just to see like I think this is this short it's gonna be it's gonna launch the coding chain into 2023 in a way you could never possibly imagine thank you for being here during this stream um I'm setting it to public there we go publish it uh it's there you could go to the coding train watch it uh thanks coding Garden for answering the question about the arraylist thank you all I I have to say I've been kind of feeling a little bit like I just have like what like it's really struggling with this stuff that I've been doing um and I would like to start 2023 off on a good foot your shoes there's my feet and it's the shortiest of shorts uh Happy New Year to all of you have a wonderful New Year's Day take a break for yourself um if you're you know you've just been on the computer all day um take a break and I will see you in the next live stream in the next video I upload I don't know what it will be do uh you need to stay in touch join the Discord um all that stuff uh thank you um and um yeah um that's all I got to say I'm gonna I'm gonna go I don't have a goodbye I don't have a goodbye animation so I'm going back to this one and I'm putting on the usual music I'm gonna get to hear the this Dot as always I always forget the this style watch the shorts boy I really even lost my voice here I have no no more words oh it's be real never forget foreign never forget the this Dot somebody compose that song for me all right oh that song went off okay uh next one I'm gonna say once again Here We Go sing it with me foreign autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me coordinate song it's the polar to Cartesian coordinates importance my mic is still on let's forget that my mic's on okay one more song Everybody uh uh unicorns and rainbows there we go yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it thank you kittens the kittens again just want to say I just want to say that reading all of your comments on the short I published and they are warming my soul I appreciate it I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound effects what else is there unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes that was invalid syntax I forgot uh there was one other thing here that I think is important that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and dust and died yet
