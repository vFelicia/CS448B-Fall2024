hello and welcome back to another discord bot tutorial now since the last time i recorded those first three videos i have been very busy i have deployed the bot that i made in the previous video uh via glitch so you can see here and you can follow the link in the video's description to the code on glitch and the bot is running if i head on over i should change one thing if i just uh type in chew chew exclamation point choo choo and i will talk about why i'm using exclamation point in the next video when i talk about handling multiple commands but for now let's just make sure it's working there we go i get my response back and if i come back to here let's look at the code something rather significant has changed i know it's a really tiny font so i'm going to zoom on in client.login look the token is no longer there right here's the code that i have in vs code in visual studio code with the token right there that i should not be showing you because that private key that i must keep private returning back again to glitch it's there process.env.token what's going on so environment variables are variables that can be configured on a particular server separate from your code so your code can be released in public for example you can go to the link and see this code but your environment variables are stored securely in a file or it could be other ways around it but a sort of convention is to store them in a file called dot env so if you follow this link you won't see the contents of env you will however see the contents of dot env sample which you can look at to see these are the environment variables that i happen to be storing and the really important one here of course is token the way i'm using server id and channel id just to like limit the bot to a particular server and channel is kind of an optional thing at this point but the token is really really critical and just to show you what it looks like i'll regenerate the token again to switch it out if i go here to env on glitch it's actually giving me an interface to show here's the token here's its value but if i click up here on plain text i can see this is what it actually looks like token equals that very long string so returning back to the code that i have locally in visual studio code and i will cover in a separate video how to deploy to glitch it's i definitely would encourage you there's lots of different uh web servers and hosting platforms that you could use to deploy your bot and i meant you could even run your own raspberry pi or your own computer but that's not the topic of this video i just want to look at getting an environment variable set up so the first thing that i need to do is create a file and make a new file and i'm going to call it dot env and in that file i want to say token equals and maybe i want to be a little bit more specific let's call it bot token and then i want to paste the value of the token there setting that environment variable to that value i can go back to the browser go to my developer page i might as well regenerate well i'll regenerate it later i'm just going to hit copy paste it in here you can see it's that same token it's there and then the idea is that i could say right here instead of this process dot env bot token now this won't actually work let's check and see why so one thing actually i want to do is let me disable the bot on glitch to make sure that it's not the one running so that i can be sure when i'm testing that and the one that's running is the one that's running here locally on my computer it's kind of silly but i'm just going to comment out all the code on glitch i'm sure there's another way to sort of disable the web application through the interface and now let me say nodebot.js to run this okay it's telling me an invalid token was provided if you're just working with a node like i am just well you know on a mac laptop uh with a dot env file this process.enb bot token is not gonna just work magically servers like glitch or heroku or other kind of platforms are set up to use a dot env file but i've got to include a special code to use that dot env file and the code that i want to use is called dot env so i want to require the nodepackage.env and then i can actually just it's just one line of code require the dot env package and call the config function that is the function you call to tell it to load the values from the dot env file but if i run this right now it's going to say cannot find the module.env that's because i have to say npminstall.env so i've got to do that as well we can check package.json to see that now it is a new dependency in addition to discord.js i also have dot env as a dependency and now ah it's running let's see what happens if i go back over to discord and type in exclamation point choo choo i'm getting some why am i always going getting choo choo back there we go i got some emojis great so that's actually all i wanted to show you in this video um i could consid think about are there other things that are sort of like custom settings that i don't want to package as part of my source code and and you know for example it could be that the channel id or the server id are those and so i would say practice try to follow along and get env working with your code and in the next video i want to look at multiple commands but actually right i mean certainly i could just have an if statement that's what i'm going to start with so in the next video i'm just going to show you how i handle two commands if the content of the messages choo choo reply with one of these replies if the content of the messages exclamation point i don't know gif something then i want to reply with a gif so i'm going to show you how to post gifs and that way we have two commands with an if statement and then the followup video to that you know if statement isn't going to be very sustainable if you want to have a bot that can handle you know 10 20 100 commands how do i write uh create a system structure for handling multiple commands and within different javascript files in a way that's sort of scalable and manageable okay so stay tuned in the next video we're gonna make our bot post i don't know kitten gifts or coding train gifts or who knows what
