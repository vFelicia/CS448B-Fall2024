It's a coding train express stop! And i'm going to show you how to do a pull request. This is a repository on GitHub it is at CodingTrain/ExpressStops. If you want to propose a change, make a pull request to the README file, I could click on this README file. (You've got to be logged into GitHub with an account.) Click on this edit button (looks like a pencil) then add your "I am making a short because I am young and hip" And then I'm going to type in the change that i want to be in the world. I'm going to look at this "propose change" button right there. Click "propose change" then that proposal of the change to that file will become a pull request!I can write a little note like "be the change you want to be this is a YouTube short will anyone watch it?" I'm going to now create this pull request by pressing this button and someday my friend dan will eventually merge this and it will be in this repository forever!
