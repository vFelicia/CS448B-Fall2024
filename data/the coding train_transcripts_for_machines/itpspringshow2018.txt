haha hello it is the springtime Oh in the summer is right around the corner and guess what it was just the ITP show here just a few days ago what is ITP you might be asking ITP is a twoyear master's program right here at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University it's where I teach it's where I spend almost all of my time and the show of the student work just happened earlier this week I did a livestream you can watch the full twohour archive of me wandering around with a microphone. Link to that in this video's description. But if you just want to see a shorter highlight reel of some of the projects, all the amazing crazy things the weird stuff that the students are up to here take a look at this video. More information about all the projects in this video's description links and all the people's names and all that sort of stuff so thanks for watching and I'll be back soon with coding tutorial perhaps goodbye my name is Jim Schmitz and this is my Google Streetview style of transfer project the idea is to take pictures from Google Street View and then apply a style transfer algorithm to all the frames to make an animation so it looks like you're flying through a animated painting in this case the highway in Idaho is being transformed a combination of seated nude by Picasso and this other photograph by cat Connor and photographer so my name is Ella Nichols and I created an interactive cubist mirror i'm calling at the painting mirror because if you stand close enough to it you'll see fragmented reflections of yourself and you can move those pieces around and create your own portrait does it like so this is just it's left over in the position from where people were before yes the shapes are but the let's live video moving into the shapes if you find something that you like you can double tap the screen and the preserve it on Instagram and pick it up later so my name is tarek Gutierrez and I just completed my first year at ITP my piece is entitled misunderstood it's an interactive installation where you can place on this hoodie and when you flip up the hood you hear this audio narrative of a young black boys encounter with a police officer so it's a twopart narrative the first part is me telling my actual story so when I was 13 years old I was stopped by a white police officer so I'm recounting that in the first aspect of the narrative the second aspect is more speculative aspect of like what could have happened so I'm tired with the piece misunderstood because I think it's often times at that point of misunderstanding where these incidents of police brutality become deadly I didn't realize there was gonna be like tactile feedback and that really surprised me and I think that's there was very loud gunshots and I would feel vibrating in the in parts of the hoodie which really you know I I do I probably shouldn't be listening to this anymore because I'm doing this like live stream but it was I just didn't want to didn't want to take it off so it's really impact that's great thank you great work Tarek my name is ty my project is poly note which is a sequencer a webbased multiplayer sequencer these are different instruments that you kind of pick and then you can put them on the world the color and the shape is the instrument and the velocity determine the height determines the amplitude and it's completely a multi player so what happens here is going to be here the same pattern and we can play together anything like that yeah hey I'm Anthony I'm Keith Donna I'm Kathy and I'm Asha and this is our project search divides us so search divides us is a project made for playful communications of serious research so what we tried to do was take a serious research topic which was bias and search engine optimization and then communicate that playfully and so for this class we were tasked to collaborate with an NYU professor and dr. Charlton McIlwain and he's concerned with how the way that the Internet's architecture currently works today limit and constrains what we actually see and this can create eventually segregation and problematic ways we've created a kind of a fun game to express that so this is what the search engine thinks you should live based on your profile has found one recommendation for you Ahmadi mosey on oh this is my thesis project Ohio which is a line of neo retro experimental cameras so basically emerges the digital and analog photo experience so you take photos with a digital camera but it immediately applies filters that mimic the quality of a film camera and it mimics the whole experience and there's no screen and all of that and if people want to find out more or you do you have a website about it yet or what can you tell us what the URL is which is oj Oro and where does the name come from it's Spanish a little is Spanish for gold and I translate it to English so it means really that these are essentially tools for you to explore your own artistry or goal tonight hi my name is Xue and my project is called it will be perfect from now on it's a kinetic sculpture and it as a research on being an only child under the onechild policy in China and then it got bigger and I started thinking about how power structures and policy affect individuals and identities and their individuality so I decided to create this kinetic sculpture as a response to that and basically it's an artificial erosion of stones with my name is Roland Arnold and I am interested in true randomness because computational randomness is kind of fake I don't want this so I was interested how can I create true randomness and how can I make to wreden is somehow a spiritual experience to people so I created a stone that when you knock at it and you align with true randomness of the radioactive particles inside that stone when the patterns match it knocks back at you so basically the universe talks back to you because the to randomness is kind of a force in the universe the universe is talking to me so I'm Barack so we're together work on this and we got inspiration from the prisoner system panopticon and try to create this project that express our concern about mass surveillance this is surveillance footage from cameras that we set up all over the floor and it captures faces and when you come in front of the installation it captures your face from the camera on top and indexes you against all of the photos that we found so you only realize you're being surveilled on once you come and face your surveilled image and so this camera at the top that's never showing the image from that camera here I know that one is capturing your face and indexing them and across all of the images from the floor Wow hi my name is ivy and this is actually a group project but my two partners they have their own project over there so this project is based on research paper from neuroscience Department of Hawaii and research is about the imbalance of the human brain and so you know brain there's two neurons which one the one is excitation is intubation so when they're not when they're not balanced they're gonna have seizures or depression or sickness other sickness so people can classic play and standing on those quads to find the balance of the brain so the white color is balanced so you can step on one thank you hi I'm one Jimmy this is my project madam Bhaskar it's a to Kate about using creative technology to do straight performance and also this is a performance at date two weeks ago at Washington Square Park so generally when I'm at is I'm using programming which is like a web technology and the credit like this socket among all the users like always in a park and they can connect it to my backpack which in which I can use my MIDI controller to send away shows and sound to their phone to create is like very large soundscape so it's kind of like everybody in the space x star to jam together and that's why i did in this project hi I'm sandy and I've been growing conductive crystallized textile mana crops who had been growing textiles with embellish crystals she used salt crystals and so I decided to grow them using the electrolysis and copper so how it works is that I have a positive and negative terminal and then I'm submerging it an electrolyte solution when I apply current that moves positive ions over to the negative terminal and then it forms crystals over time so if you look over there you can see the crystals forming and these are some of my swatches close under a microscope they have a very interesting composition and the most exciting thing is their conductive so you can also see over there it's powering a working circuit so it has really interesting applications I think my employee I'm fond of a socket and we made this VR piece called missing 10 hours which is a multiplayer game within one person is in the we are experiencing a girl story who lost all her memories because by a rape drug called GHB and the other person is controlling if the characters the two guys in VR are doing good things or bad things to her it's also a multi ending games so depends depends on the person who's holding the control panel right there you experience different things and have different endings of the stories so we have all like totally sixteen ending into the story I'm not even on this and I'm cher Chaudhary and we're gonna divide this time so this is living canvas and this is like data visualization with living organisms so what we did is like we trace people's paths on the force and we cross that information with some samples that we took from the different parts of the bill for the floor with bacteria because that information to see how it looked like so this is 10 I to be students in just one day and I have your parts drawn as to where you walked and where you moved around and after you've done all of that then we're making the robot print the seats filled also the best part is that the robot moves on an XY also that the you work with the robot and when it's moving on your part you are planting your own seeds I'm Isabella and I'm IO the project was made for a class called nothing creating illusions and it's a three minute video installation that uses projection mapping and basically we don't like to reveal too much of what the narrative sort of treats but it's three minutes and it's the first person narrative alone astronauts and his last thoughts hi i'm i'm mohammed i'm this project is called by the way hi mom and dad in iran when I'm gonna show this to you later but this project is called reactive display which is the idea is like you always look leaning closer to look closer at things so why doesn't that thing help you out so for example when I look at look at this painting from up close then I can see all the better a better example would be like the math charge you know you're in the subway you want to look closer at the map to where you're going you always look close and it's very small but that can't be like okay what's a good Union and I can look at Union or like my stuff there's useful I can look at that my name is Anita Bob Ozzie and my project is about energy was actually for my energy class it's an artistic representation of the different energy sources around the world so from this screen you can see what the different colors represent so the yellow LEDs represent an solar car the blue represent hydro red represents oil and then green is biofuels white is wind energy so it's it's just on an artistic piece and so from here you can see what different countries you is what different form of energy as yes as a source of energy I'm Graham my project is but this applying a yard to cardiac patients this is an uncommon reality a house platform to deliver education and improve medication and hores say I'm a cardiac patient after my surgery I had to take several medicines in one day so I hoping this app can the text on the bottom I want to show this to make it clear it's 3d animated heart is telling me why this blood bit about her could help you to decrease my heart rate and as an decrease in my bladder failure Brett bladder pressure hi I'm cami Sawadee and this is the Handy it's a soft robotic to help people with neuromuscular disorders regain finger strength through rehabilitation exercises like I said this is a glove and so really what happens is that when a person's fingers are so weak it's sort of flops down and once it reaches this stage the muscles don't allow the person to open and close their fingers so this helps with open and close enough fingers and also to teach a person how to do functional things like pick up before or get dressed or something like that so usually like the first stage of this would be in the occupational therapists office when the person gets fitted they now put on the glove and so now the finger is in the glove and this helps them move it so it helps them bend and straighten and then pick objects up my name is Molly and I make this project called crossings which is all idea the 3d scanning of my body then I come a body in three different pieces and reassemble them into the shape of the landscape yeah and I make the animation based on the 3d model that I have and it shows the seven changes my name is quick pop it here I try to have a kind of performance and you can perform as usual you don't think that you are familiar with and you can test the project and yet see what happens I use different Mahler for simulating the movement as I want I use different motor for moving the upon the x and y x and yaxes are also dizzy for the movement of the body hi my name is Metro and I'm here to show you kilograms kilograms is a slick pitch animation technique it is also a photobooth so people have taken pictures over here if you can probably so if you notice actually let me bring this down so this is mother of one of our residents and you can see her not sure how you see that it looks nicer on camera interesting so dance gonna dance gonna take a one picture over four seconds so it basically takes four pictures over four seconds just do one motion slowly I'm going to say go ready and go so this is one that looks like I'm gonna print that out so the photo that you took a while ago this is the same photo that you took a while ago I need to line it properly but you kind of see it red yeah so that's what you get my name is Effie and my project it's called travelling New York men let's call it because I utilized the classic traveling salesman problem and a genetic algorithm to solve this finding the shortest route issue and also this is like a practical adaptation of it because I'm actually using it in a realworld problem which is planning a travel route so these are all the gardens and parks in New York City we can go to Jamaica Bay and then I go to confirm and you can see the computer kind of just do it instantly oh wow that was very fast how many points with that just now a little bit of animation to take you through all around you
