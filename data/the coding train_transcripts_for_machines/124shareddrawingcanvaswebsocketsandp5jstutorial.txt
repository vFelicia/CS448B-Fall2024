here we are the moment of truth part 4 we now have a node server running it's a socket server I have two clients going in two different browser windows both connecting to the server but if I move my mouse around here to draw I don't see the result of that drawing in this one over here so what I need to do now is add the last piece as I move the mouse in a client I need to send a message once I and then in the server I need to receive that message and send it out to everybody else so let's see if we can make that happen so the first step is let's add code in the client to send a message so I'm going to go to sublime here where I have all my different pieces and this is my client code I have a socket variable and I connect to the server so what I want to do is I'm what I'm going to do is in I'm going to write a function called Mouse dragged the mouse drag function you'll see is a function the event function that's triggered whenever I drag the mouse and so if I add that in and put the concepts wrong console put the console in and I hit refresh you can see out when I whenever I drag the mouse and you can see that I'm printing out those mouse coordinates so that's where I want to send I just realized there's sort of a flaw in my program which is that I also want to draw in Mouse dragged as well so now right after I move the mouse nothing happens but if I drag I move the mouse and I see the coordinates spitting out in the console so now what I want to do is I need to create a message that I'm going to send and the way you create a message is two things you need a name for the message which is a string of text and you need the data for that message which is just a JavaScript object so the data for that message is I'm going to say X is Mouse x and y is Mouse y so this is the content of my message I want to send the mouse X announce Y value and then I also need a name so I think I say socket emit Mouse dot data and so I'll change this to saying sending so now in the code you see this is really the sort of crucial part right here which is that I when I want to send a message I create a JavaScript object with the data in it I then say socket dot emit I name the message the name is important because it's a yours making a protocol like what if you have a whole lot of different messages and you do different things based on what the name of the message is that's a way to in this case I don't really have to worry about that but that's kind of important and then I attach the data to it so now I've sent the message now let's first even just run run the sketch to make sure there aren't any weird errors you know sending you can see that it's sending that stuff seems to be working I don't get any errors and the server I don't see anything happening in the server because I haven't written the code to receive the message so now I need to go to the server to write that code server code right here this is the function where that is triggered when there's a new socket connection so what if this particular socket connection sends a message right not just any message I want what if a message comes from this particular client so I should be able to say socket dot on Mouse you know Mouse message I don't know if that's right let me look at my cheat sheet over here yeah look that's right so what I what I'm saying is if this if there's a message called Mouse trigger this function so I'm going to write that function now and I'm just going to say console dot log data so this is now I have a server the server is waiting for connections when there's a new connection I say there's a new connection when there's a message it logs that particular message so let's take a look at this working now so one thing I need to do is I need to restart the server now incidentally there's a way using a tool called node Mon which maybe I should show you at some point to auto restart a server every time you change code but I'm not going to worry about that right now I can hit controlc and start it again so I'm running the server everything is connect reconnected automatically but I'm going to refresh anyway and you can see it's sending sending sending and look at this receiving come on you can do it let me move this over here I'm going to move the mouse around here you can see look I'm sending and I'm receiving for this is getting good I'm sending and I'm receiving I'm sending and I'm receiving but I am not sending again to receive over here right the message went from here and then it went to here now I need it to go here and incidentally if a message from here goes to there I needed to go to there let's see is that happening move this back over here right it's happening here it's happening here you can't see it but it is so the messages are coming into the server but they're not going back out so what do I need to do to have them go back out so I'm going to go to my code and I don't have this memorized so else I'm going to go to my the example I made earlier and I'm going to grab this bit of code whoops sorry everybody I'm in the wrong place a million times over and I'm going to add this back in right I could remembered that so what do I want to do when a message comes in when a mouse message comes in I want to call the broadcast dot emit function to send a message back out what do I want to send back out that exact same message and what do I want to call it Mouse so you can see there's a lot of possibilities here a message that comes in could be parsed altered changed renamed sent back out but I'm not doing that in this sort of simple example I'm just taking the literal message in the name and the data and I'm sending the exact same back out name the data now incidentally we have this question here I'm going to go back to all this let's say the message comes from this client into the server do I want that message then to go back out to blue back back out to both of them or do I want so message comes in goes back out to both of them or do I want message to come in and only go to this one or if there was another one to go to the other two in this case I don't want the message to come back to myself but in other cases you might but I want to show you I'm going to keep this in the code example that I upload that there is this is another way of writing this code I'm going to put it right here if I were to say instead reference the global the more not the specific socket to omit to everyone else but this i/o dot sockets which kind of refers to everything it will also include the client that sent the message so I'm going to leave that in there as a sort of separate side possibility but really we're kind of golden here we've got messages coming in and the message going back out but the message does not get received by the client so I've got to also go back to the client now and I've got to add something that handles the message coming in socket dot on Mouse and I'm going to say new drawing so now if this particular socket receives a message called new drawing what should it do well it should draw and I'm just going to grab exactly this same code it should draw something but at data X data dot Y and let's make it a different color just so we can see it's different so this is now saying in addition this particular sketch should set up an event handler for when a message comes in right it's kind of confusing the same sketch is both has functions for sending out and receiving because it's not like there's two different sketches running there's two different instances of the same sketch so if this one sends this one receives but they both have but if this one sends this one receives they both have the sending and receiving code in them now I might have missed something I'm going to feel ambitious though and just run it because I don't have this stuff memorized so these whoops let's go to the browser here I'm going to refresh and refresh and see oh no I didn't miss anything so you can see it works beautiful oh that's so nice so you know there's so many possibilities here and you know incidentally we are being really there is absolutely no reason why I shouldn't add a third one just to demonstrate what's really going on here so now if I hit refresh here right you can see him let me let me refresh all of these okay here we go I'm going to draw a heart because I love you all for watching this video two hearts for the two people left who are still watching this video and then I'm going to fill in the heart here because that will make it pink on the other two look at this this is way too much fun I'm going to mess around with this later after I turn this video up but you can see the idea here is we have all the pieces we have a node good now remember we have a node server that's hosting a p5 sketch note server is running Express and opening socket connections whatever a client runs it connects via socket to the server if it sends messages to the server the server receives that message and sends it back out to all the other clients not including the original one let me show you again where all the pieces of that to the code are so here this is let me look at the directory of files right this is everything you need the server jeff has the code for running the server and receiving socket messages and send them back out to the clients inside public is my p5.js sketch in sketch Jess I have the client code which sends messages of the server and then also receives messages from the server so if I go to that server we can see all I'm doing is I have new connection I have a function and handles new connections and a function that receives messages and sends them back out immediately and if I go to the client I have I have a variable that connects to the server it handles new messages and also has a function it when the mouse tracked for sending messages so sending receiving sending receiving server client node Express socket p5.js all of those things make this particular example I will have all all of the code on github I hope that you make something with this do something different I'm sure I miss some stuff so leave things in the comments I will add some addendum videos to pick up items I administer maybe how to deploy this somewhere or other kinds of messages that you could send and let me know and have a good day with your sockets and hearts and things like that
