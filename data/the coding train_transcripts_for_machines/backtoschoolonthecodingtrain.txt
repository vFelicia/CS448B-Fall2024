foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign good morning I'm just checking my microphone I believe that you are hearing me right now and if you could confirm that in the chat let me know Felipe that is a great question please ask it at the onlinequestions.org website code 314159 foreign foreign foreign momentous moment it's a bit redundant I suppose where I'm here back live streaming with you I'm looking over at my mother over here to see that I see myself I see the chat going I see people talking about how I am late the train this is not a European train this is definitely a it's an American train I mean we've got some nice trains here in this country I would love to have just a whole long session discussion about trains all over the world and which ones we love and why tell me about your favorite trains in the chat my audio might be on the low side so let's take a look at that um that is quite possible I can Pump Up the Volume uh very easily here let me just do this try that okay how is that I tend so I'm not maybe I won't worry about it too much right now because I'm often when I record I'm noticing that as I start to get excited about something volume tends to peek and get very distorted but um let me know still uh so it's hard for me to know because um you are all a bit uh behind oh let's see looking at these interesting questions how do I delete okay I could delete them answered okay uh you can hear me Well audio is fine audio is good okay I did turn it up a little bit so hopefully it's good now hi everyone I have four train whistles let's try them all train whistle number one first attempt to laser etch coding train logo into a train whistle no good cheap train whistle bought online very inexpensively made drain whistle from uh a actual toy shop uh not coding train branded just says train whistle right here beautiful sound oh that sound I will never I will not get anything as good as that now I also happen to have here a custom laser etched coding train the train right there uh a random walk laser etched on the side this was made the laser etching was done by Jason who does all the coding train illustrations but this was made by Maple Landmark out of Middlebury Vermont a nice wood shop there all right pretty good sound requires quite a bit more force is this what you expected because I'm gonna start looking at train whistles and I get distracted by the fact that it's pouring rain outside or something else not sure how much coding there will be today this is really just a chance to press the reset button for the fall engage and welcome you to the coding train uh YouTube channel uh chat answer questions look at a whole bite of a whole long list of updates the main thing on this agenda today I would say is processing four I'm going to take a long look at processing four and all the new features and wonderful things that are present there um now you may have seen this whistle because this whistle which is in this little box uh and I should have like an overhead camera or a closer camera but I think if I hold it here up to my face you can kind of see it a processing Community Day Copenhagen 2022 I was lucky enough to travel to Copenhagen over the summer where I was presented with an authentic wow can you I'm just gonna be quiet for a second can you hear that rain it is it is a beautiful sound it's just like a constant low hum a strong downpour very little wind just tons of water falling from the sky ah beautiful all right so this is an authentic actually used by Danish train conductors in the 1950s uh let's try um let's try this for a second let's see if it can Auto apologies for the uh loss of focus now there we go I think you're gonna see this right now so there you go look at this beautiful uh authentic Danish train whistle from the 1950s you can see that it's uh got some good use in it I've cleaned it thoroughly I'm the only one who uses it we're all covered safe train whistle protocols here in this household um I would love to read to you a little bit about this train whistle of a whole beautiful uh uh uh um explanation about the history of it um this is by uh pricken from 1957. uh if you like Denmark's Railway traffic is directed by buffaloes Indian buffaloes at that this might sound like an insinuation which of course it is not it is true insofar as the black Railway whistles that unleash the horsepower of steam and diesel oil start their Earthly existence as the main ornaments of buffaloes and a quick calculation tells us that Denmark's Communications have cost oh oh boy oh boy I'm sorry Buffalo so I didn't realize this would get so dark so quick anyway um so let's let's let's take a listen I'm just gonna make quite a loud sound uh everybody um please if you're wearing headphones turn down your volume uh get ready here we go definitely in the red there I hope I did not blow out your ears okay that was amazing I'm gonna wrap this up nicely very carefully put it back in its beautiful box and move on to the next item on my agenda but one more thing about the whistles if you are a coding train member which you can join on YouTube on patreon you can do a GitHub sponsorship there's twitch subscriptions if you are at one of the higher levels um you are owed one of these whistles laser etched and specially made just for you this has been probably one of my biggest failures in terms of the coding train is getting these to people some people have received them some people are next on the list some people I don't even have on my list so if you are one of those people please get in touch um I know that Daniel at the coding train that's where you should there's a bunch of different coding train emails and I forget where each of them go but I know that Daniel at the coding train will go to me so if you happen to be watching this you happen to be a member at a certain level I want to get you this whistle um please okay all members by the way any anyway everybody's welcome the Discord but I have some private channels on the Discord for people who sign up where you can ask questions about getting your stickers and all that kind of stuff so a link also your Discord account with YouTube if you sign up through YouTube or patreon Etc and it will allow you access those channels okay so first things first um on my list um I am trying a new experiment which is I found this a wonderful website called onlinequestions.org where you can add and upload I'm sorry you can add an upvote questions I have an admin Port an admin view of it over here so I can quickly delete something I forgot any uh trolls out there watching the live stream this is live I um so I kind of want to move away from it right now but you can upvote um questions and I will answer them so I'm going to start with uh the very first question uh what is uh the meaning of life I think we all know what the meaning of life is it is a very obvious answer to that question 42. okay uh answered how do I do this click answer all right check are there any good videos for learning how interpolation Works ooh okay this is a great question are there any good videos so um let's think about this so in processing in P5 there is a function called lerp can you hear that rain hold on I've got my wireless mic with me I'm going over to a door I'm going to open this door so you can really hear this rain beautiful this is a little coding train rain ASMR for you today all right sorry to leave you hanging there um lerp uh um so let's see let's try lerp um with P5 I'm back right okay good I'm back hi uh reference okay so first of all um oh fascinating let's it's interesting to see what Google uh tells us about how to learn about lerp so this is I feel like this is oh yeah this is a 2015 video wow this is old I don't look that different I don't think kind of got the same exact haircut wearing a pink shirt I used to do this thing where I would unbutton my shirt and some people made comments about it as if it was some kind of fashion attempt what it was authentically I'm just being completely honest here this is what you tuned in for I swear this is why you're all here the reason why I kept the shirt unbuttoned I wanted to wear a shirt so that I could clip my mic to it but I wanted to show what was on my tshirt and I've given that up because people I get too many comments I was like oh this guy thinks it's so cool this is unbuttoned shirt okay anyway uh we were talking about lerp so um I do have some videos about lip so why what is lerp lerp is short for linear interpolation what does interpolate mean it means to boy I I I I'm gonna have a hard time like articulating this I was I'm just going to do it off the top of my head in the way that I think about it it means to um uh sort of mix find the point in between two things we want to interpolate between this color and this color so if I was interpolating between red and blue and I get like a purplish I don't know if that's exactly accurate but it's but the idea of interpolation doesn't tell us enough because we need to know what kind of math do I want to use to interpolate between two different values and I can interpolate between scalar single numbers vectors arrays colors there's also as long as I've got some kind of numeric quantity I can interpolate between two and lerp is really um the simplest version of this now here's a really interesting question this is a great test of the coding Train website so one of the things about the coding Train website is uh one of the things about the coding Train website is I have a new feature it's still really being worked on and there's some significant bugs about not bugs not bugs in the website I would say bugs in the data entry my on me if I go to videos let's first go to challenges and one thing I can do is I can type in here lerp and nothing came up so this is instantly a mistake in that I know that I have some coding challenges in particular in particular the bezier curve by the way if you all ever looked at a bezie and curve and thought Oh I could never possibly understand the math that makes this beautiful curve well first of all you should watch Freya Homer's video about bezier curves it's so loud the rain I hopefully the the power does go out where I am sometimes with these big storms so for some reason I just disappear instantly that's probably what happened so you should really look at um Freya holmers uh and apologies if I'm getting their name pronounced incorrectly but Freya holmer's uh video the beauty of bezier Curves it is absolutely fantastic and amazing I have my own poor ver like not nearly as beautiful and thoughtful and amazing version of that which if I probably search coding train bezier um which I want to show you here so if I'm on the coding Train website let's try putting in bezier what about curve I really gotta I really got to work on so this is good we got Lisa Duke curve coch curve Hilbert curve so um we're just gonna find it by searching here's the bezier curve so uh note to all of you contributors to the coding Train website let's work on the ah the topics this one just says uh for beginners so I've got to add some topics to this one maybe we could even do this live uh later let's do uh topics I don't want to get too distracted right now by editing the coding drain website but I would like to show that to you um so if we look at let's see let's think about some of these examples bezier curve with formula I believe with I want to show you um not sure which one is going to be the best I know that this one let's try let's try looking at this one I'm going to look at the um let's look at this coding example cubic okay ah so I'm using in this one the reason what I'm looking for is when I remember making this coding challenge and using the lerp function to do it yeah there we go so you can see the actual and this is going to look like a mess to you and I hopefully if you actually go and watch this video I stepped through this in great detail to explain all of the math but you can see that the actual idea of a bezier curve is just a lot of linear interpolations multiple points all being interpolated together to get this curve like if I have these endpoints okay we got a whiteboard over here I'm off track but this is this is what you tuned in for I hope um so oh it's a little bit dark the Whiteboard but that's fine and also it's still got my Apple II stuff on it but right if I have this point here uh call it X1 y1 terrible marker and my audio is still coming through I hope let me just double check yeah I see it and I have this point here X2 Y2 a linear interpolation uh sorry I got to work on the uh I move the lights around it's okay sorry about that for today this will just be as good as it's going to be um this is something I have to talk about in related to the Apple II plus videos I moved everything around multiple times um the idea here is I could be interpolating like 50 of the way of in between these two points would be here and a bezier curve is all about oh take these two points take some control points and do a lot of interpolation with these two points to get this curve that's like a very hand wave high level view of it the video goes over it in much more detail so this would so the bezier curve video might be a place for you to I again I know you asked like what's a good video for interpolation and it's hard for me to off the top of my head know about other videos besides the one that I made I Know freya's video because I it's like the most amazing thing I've ever seen um so um um but uh the other place where we would find and I don't know that we will because I got to work on the metadata oh I'm in the wrong view here we are back again I'm going to go to tracks now I happen to know this again is the new coding Train website these tracks are all of my sequence tutorials that you could find um I happen to know that there is a video on lerp inside this first track but just out of curiosity let's see nope so I don't see it interpolation yeah so that's a useful note I think that would be great metadata for people who are searching for this particular topic on the coding train but I'm going to go to the track uh and I'm going to find the video here which would be unless I imagined it I'm pretty sure map oh you know what I'm getting confused I have a video on the map function uh here as part of this track but the lerp function actually isn't here and Richard is asking what's the best way to contribute to the website so let me talk about that when I get to it uh contribute oh the rain is so loud unbelievable um so uh Stoops New York asked a really interesting question do you sell a boot camp I do not um there's one exception uh with a paid course of mine that you can find on nebula classes which I could Point your way towards if you just go to nebulaclasses.com codingtrain I have kind of a general purpose of what is code a set of videos there but if you want to learn to code through my videos um my suggestion would be and these are all just on YouTube uh find these tracks maybe pick one depending on your level or area of interest um certainly if you're a total beginner this code programming with p5.js is the one that I would suggest um and then if you prefer to learn through more project oriented stuff you could go to the challenges page and the challenges page are more just like a selection of many different videos of different projects that I made over the years um so you know you can see that a lot of work and love went into this website site so much so that the amount of content that I've made just quite a bit less in maybe the last six months or so but hopefully having this organized system for all the content will help people um ultimately okay so um you can't hear the rain that's sorry uh all right video so many wonderful things in the chat so put your questions in onlinequestions.org because I can see them now so uh anyway um so I do have so I have a video on lerp I think I would if you're interested in interpolation go look at bezier curves and then the other thing that you could look at is um uh I I mean this is a little outside the scope of interpolation but um uh let's see Penner easing functions see if we can find a really nice demonstration of this so Robert Penner uh let's see if this uh actually works oh yeah so um you know I think of these as interpolations these easing functions and a linear interpolation would be a straight line right we're moving from one point to another but we could ease in and ease out with a sign with a cubic cubic interpolation exponent elastic they're all these like wild so this actually would be a wonderful you know mental note coding challenge code all uh Penner easing functions um there used to be like a processing Penner Library maybe there's one for p5.js great project for somebody if you want to take this on okay so I answered that question um I'm gonna do one more and then I'm gonna um how do come on answered I'm gonna do one more just in case you see where I am here we are uh I'm gonna answer um whoops ah three one four one five nine I guess I could just open the admin portal here um what's lurk so hopefully uh uh hopefully this is answered oh I can't I can't do it here okay uh what do I do for a living great question so I would say um well let's since you asked it this way the majority of my income how I sustain myself is a fulltime day job at New York University teaching as part of a program called uh ITP and IMA it's an undergraduate and graduate program in interactive media arts at Tisch School of the Arts I'm currently on sabbatical which you would think would allow me to spend a lot more time doing this YouTube thing but in reality it did you know there's a lot of things have been accomplished but um yeah so that um I um I do um also focus on a lot of projects that derive income the coding train being one of them um as well as books so I have a learning processing book which was published through a company called elsevier many many years ago it's a little bit out of date don't necessarily recommend that you buy it but you know you might enjoy having a copy of it or if you can find a used one or a cheap one somewhere go for it there is a second edition of it and then the nature of code book which I selfpublished and that's on my list to talk about today where I am with that project and my goal to have this new second edition done by the end of December this year um okay I just want I want to answer this next one um have you thought of making any assembly videos so yeah so I have on my list here to look at some of the comments and showcase projects for my recent Apple 2 videos let's just mention if you haven't been keeping up with the recent videos on the channel I would love for you to check out I've been really like obsessively playing with the thumbnails and titles of these over and over again but I would love for you to check out these two videos you can go do it now I won't be affected or you can watch them put them on your watch later check them out later but I've been there seems to audience seems to have really appreciated and enjoyed these I've been doing coding on an Apple two plus video I dismantled my entire streaming setup to create this little mini set of me coding on the Apple II Plus I have now put back my streaming setup and I moved the Apple II plus to the other corner of this room so my goal is to be able to go back and forth and I certainly have the technical capability I could even do it today although I no I don't have certain things plugged in um I see Stig in the chat I don't know if Stig was here when I did my entire long elaborate demonstration of the Danish train whistle but you can you can ask all your questions about the history and context of this train whistle to Stig who's in the chat um I see you true bolt Geometry Dash I thought that's coming on the Apple II plus but I do love that idea um so I really would like to be able to do both so the tricky thing is I don't have enough cameras so I have enough physical space now to have both the Apple II plus over there lights are somewhat easy for me to move because I have them on stands and wheels uh cameras I have to like move these cameras aren't sort of fixed tripods they're all plugged in HDMI cables are all set up everything going in this capture PC so it's a bit of a pain to move them so I have to decide do I want to get separate cameras just for the Apple II Plus or do I want to suffer through like uh today I'm gonna do Apple 2 plus let me just break down all the cameras set them back up record a video break it down put it back um so I that's what I'm trying to figure out but please I would love your feedback um if you haven't watched these I think you'll enjoy sort of a little taste of computing history and me reattempting to do some of my older coding challenges like the snake game over here on the right and the fractal tree over here on the left on the Apple II okay thanks for all these questions oh Assembly Language so a lot of people in the comments and I'll get to this when I get to the uh review of these Apple 2 plus videos ask about Assembly Language and I would like to do that and in fact bear with me I'm going to find them up here I have where is it where is it where is it where all my Apple II books um here's a few of them just I'm I'm I'm nearby you don't worry I haven't left uh dos manual ah yes here we go I have so one of the amazing things not just about having the Apple II Plus is that I have in addition and I'm going to move to here and come around and show this to you a little closer in addition to um having the computer itself I have all of the books and manuals and things that I had in the when I was you know 10 years old um uh in the early 80s so this is uh programming the 6502 so I thought I would do some re oh you can't see this at all um I would do some reading of this book uh sorry this is pathetic um uh and uh uh try to learn a bit more about it I know that Ben eater has a lot of videos on YouTube about Assembly Language and um working with building your own 6502 chip baby with modern microcontrollers uh don't quote me on that so this is definitely something that I would like to get into um I also love love love love love love we think of creative coding creative Computing as kind of this new term of today generative art processing P5 look here if you need to know the 6502 you may not be able to find a text easier to understand this one creative Computing I assume that's some magazine book newspaper Journal I don't know a newspaper the creative Computing a newsletter from the 1980s would love to find that out Isn't that cool okay um try turning off the green screen probably would have helped yeah so sorry about that um but I will I do sometimes use an overhead camera okay so let me um uh and but but the thing is like the question says most of the ones I'm able to find online are on a very basic beginner level that's certainly where I would start so I don't know if I'd be getting exactly what you're looking for but okay I'm going to answer that so you can still ask questions um you can still ask your questions at um onlinequestions.org uh you know I've answered these top four upvoted ones I might poke through and see if there's one that I find particularly interesting I will look at these also later I have it's kind of cool to see all these comments coming in um So and I've got it in my my uh peripheral vision over here so if I see a question rising to the top I will gladly answer it and try to do more towards the end of my agenda here okay so um I'm gonna let's come back to the coding Train website I've talked about it on uh quite a few uh streams recently um but I do want you to know that it's there and let's move on to the um main topic of today so I've bear with me for a second um I don't know what music okay so first of all if you like the coding trade like even more I might say the new it's not it's not as new it's not as new and shiny as the coding Train website because it's bit it's been it was launched quite a a fair amount of time ago now but also who created and designed by Design Systems International wonderful design uh then put the music a little less loud okay uh I will I will fix that next time the event number Hassan is um three one four one five nine uh it's in the pinned message in the chat okay so this is processing the new processing website um we are going to live this is processing four but um this is over here this icon over here this is the probably one of the Alphas or betas that I downloaded quite some time ago um I'm gonna go over here there is a new official processing for release uh 4.0.1 uh stable release um I sadly have to download the Intel 64bit but one of the things in my notes Here is that the new if you you know first of all if you're on Windows great if you're on older Mac great but uh if you happen to have one of these newfangled silicon Max M1 M2 M2 Max whatever those things might be um make sure you get the Apple silicon version uh it is a lot of work that Ben Frye did and other contributors I'm sure went into optimizing and getting processing for to work super fast and awesome on um uh silicon chip okay so let's download this we're going to take a look at it and look at some of the new features some of the new uh some new functions you can call in it I've got a whole list of stuff here to look at and uh as I will uh um take your wish so so Alka asks official release yeah yeah I mean I don't know what counts as an official release but this is an official release it's 4.0 out of beta 4.0.1 I really can't believe you can't hear that rain it's so loud all right so let's open this up uh let's just whatever version this was let's dispose of it let's bring this version over here and let's give it a run and one of the things that's really wonderful about it which I hope shows up uh is um yes I want to open it is a new welcome screen yes this is so cool so take a look at this beauty um when you first start processing four you get this wonderful welcome screen which shows you a few examples you could try uh tells you how to find more examples we could go to this is going to be an important link for us uh what has changed let's go ahead and open that up because we're going to come back to this and kind of go through it um and you know you also might be if you want more detail about this I would highly recommend you check out the revisions which is like the many many notes of all of the things I mean I just you know just I'm just going to scroll this for a little bit you may not realize how much work goes into these projects we could do the same thing with P5 pick your poison pick your favorite open source uh project made with love you know tremendous amount of time and energy goes in and one of the things I especially appreciate about this page is the thorough detailed level of documentation this page is not for everyone you might not want to get lost in this certainly if you're a beginner today's like today's the day I'm going to learn to code I'm going to download processing and try it for the first time you don't really need to look at this page you might come back to it later but certainly if you're if you've used processing before and familiar with processing three or two then this page which is a bit shorter more of a summary is absolutely something you're going to want to take a look at okay um so what was I where was I uh changes uh processing four okay so we were looking at this wonderful page uh then okay we've got to look at this awesome thing be sure to visit tools theme selector to choose your own color scheme for the environment uh you could also select an alternate sketch naming method so processing will always autoname your sketches obviously you can name them whatever you want but you can also adjust the auto naming algorithm it seems so let's I'm going to keep this show this message because I like it so much I want to see it next time but you don't have to keep that you could uncheck that um I'm curious what happens if I click on one of these examples yeah it opens it up in processing that's so cool so we could look at this message this is a nice very beginner friendly message if it's your first day coding um there's going to be a lot in this message that you might not understand but you can also this is something that you would be could sort of interesting I think one of the things I don't I don't do this enough but I know I remember a Kyle McDonald once did a workshop like this which was like for total beginners or never coded before it was like here's a code project let's just look at it and try to see what we can understand what we don't understand and without understanding it or knowing it can we change stuff and so that can be kind of fun like if I didn't know how to code maybe I would just like oh what happens if I change that number to 800 and I run it again oh whoa okay the size of the window changed so this is the kind of thing you should uh freely do whether you're a new coder or an experienced coder always fun to just play around and change stuff in a certain level you'll get lost or the things you want to understand you might want to double back and review Concepts in a more methodical stepbystep way but those two ways of working are not mutually exclusive okay so let's also let me close this out um let's look at and I'm going to close the welcome screen let's look at them just look at the time it's 10 45. uh I'm gonna be here my hope would be to be this would be about a 90minute stream with no break but I you know I could might be here until about um noon mblab says can they add auto complete there is autocomplete um I don't there's I think it's a preference and there might be some tricky ways to get it enabled it's not just there automatically I can try to look into that for you um or you come into the coding train Discord but yes there is autocomplete in processing so let's go to oh not the preferences let's go to tools um theme selector there we go so you can read about how to create your own theme and you can save a theme.text txt file for editing themes but I'm just going to go and click through them and I really like the purple one I don't know what looks best it's kind of a dark mode I think maybe one of the lighter ones is maybe better for video it's kind of nice this is how I feel I feel like I've ah feel this one this one has me in my feels uh you know this is this could be a good one for a certain day you know and they're also minerals what Alloys whoa oh these are the gradient themes wild so here there are minerals which are solid colors and Alloys which are gradient themes I hear somebody talking but it must be my wife um okay uh all right let's let's do this one this is very bright and cheery um I like it the line numbers are very hard to see with the themes that is a very good note um certainly I know that for accessibility web content accessibility guidelines uh color contrast is really a key uh thing to always consider for user experience design and accessibility when you're building a website and I think this is a a good note here to maybe uh I don't know where you could file this as an issue or bring it up on the processing Forum I'm trying to take a mental note of it right now that I don't have a good system of tracking everything while I'm streaming um you can tweet at me to remind me but yes I do see that that on some of these themes in particular this one the line numbers are a bit light and hard to see thank you for that comment my shirt is inside out my undershirt is inside out I don't think so you really know how to get me right how to how to push my buttons and make a comment about my appearance live on live streaming and I'm very very okay so let's keep going here um and look at some more things so I mentioned oh so so this is using also uh a lot of work going into updating the version of java and so um from what I understand and I haven't rigorously tested this if you get processing four you're gonna see many many performance boosts um I really want to look at this window ratio method so there's a new window ratio method let's see if I can find it in the reference window ratio so it doesn't appear that it's in the reference yet that's another note uh um to uh I got it if you want me to want me to stop looking at the chat keep making comments about my shirt being inside out um this is another note for the processing Community the processing docs GitHub perhaps maybe we need to have the window ratio function uh documented but let's just give it a try forget how it works let's go look at here window ratio a command that helps automatically resize your sketches whenever the window size changes you can read about it in the release notes for beta 7 ah but a reference page is coming soon so this is known known that the reference page isn't there yet um let's read about it in the notes so let's look for window ratio ah okay so added a new window ratio method function that remaps screen and mouse coordinates to the specified aspect ratio for instance use window ratio whether using full screen or set resizable the sketch will scale its coordinates and the coordinates of your mouse oh this is freaking me out what the oh and then there's like new variables are with r height contain the width and height that we're past a window ratio row it could be used what okay whoa I don't understand okay let's figure this out right well let's just take let's just use this sketch I'm going to do it use a smaller window to start just because I don't have a lot of screen space here let's run the sketch and see what happens so I have a resizable window oh my God this is insane this is insanity that is wild it's like responsive design built into processing it's showing me okay well I'm I'm like confused I'm gonna have to rebuild this a little bit on my own so first of all I guess if I wanted it to start at the size that is the ratio I should still add the size function that makes sense um I'm gonna just take out this I'm going to comment this out here for a second because what I want to understand is is the stroke weight okay hold on so let's just let's try something for a second I'm going to draw a circle at width divided by 2 height divided by two um 100 100. so this oh 100. and I'm going to say fill 0 um okay so this would put a circle in the middle but now if I were to do that oh so something weird happens that's off when I resize the window which makes sense that it would be off because I think the idea here now is if I use r with and R height those values are going to change yeah look at that and the side okay the size is changing relative to the size of the window what if I take this out I'm so confused okay this is just like ah so our width and our height don't don't even work and if I were to do this okay so what I'm expecting to see yeah okay I get it now so this works like width and height always update but the thing that's happening now when I use the window ratio is notice how and I use r with and R height notice how the size of the circle the size of the circle is currently 1 8 of the width and it looks like it is staying that now what if I just adjust the height same thing it's basically figuring out how to adjust the size so the appearance of the sketch doesn't change regardless of the scale of the window um yeah time to change that and add R everywhere in my old processing projects let's take a look at this page again to see can be used in place of width height our Mouse X and R Mouse y contain the mouse positions scaled by the current ratio fat so if your window is taller or wider than the specified ratio your sketch will be moved using translate to fit the space and our Mouse X and our Mouse y might even have negative the exact amount of space that's extra can be found in ratio left and ratio top and the current scale being used compounding ratio scale yeah got it got it got it got it there's a lot more to this and I I almost like I almost can't wrap my brain around it because I'm so used to you thinking about processing and it's sort of fixed window size but I think the real power here for me would be in using full screen because we won't I won't easily be able to demonstrate this but if I'm saying full screen um what this is going to allow me to do is design something did it just letterbox it oh no I think design something to appear full screen but if I'm on a different machine with a different screen resolution ratio it'll still if I'm using all these variables correctly it'll still have the exact same appearance without me having to adjust my code I think that's the idea uh glad to know my shirt is acceptable okay uh great what else do I so I looked at that okay now I want to look at um there's pde X and p d e z files which allowing you to bundle sketches and contributions into double clickable things okay this is gonna have to parse out I should have by the way I had I have this list thank you to Benton Frye who sent me a lot of these things but I honestly like I haven't really taken it done a deep dive in a lot of these so I'm looking at these for the first time so apologies for not fully knowing where I'm going or I'm looking at or how this stuff works so let's take a look at this pdex and pde Z so let's go back to these changes and see so ah let's actually just go through here um not fond of the default sketch blah blah blah blah blah naming system you can also select an alternate naming scheme in the preferences window it's possible to create your own word list so let's look at that oops ah look at this oh ah look so you can create a different naming scheme like culinary arts oh my God this is so cool I'm gonna hit OK and now I'm gonna make a new sketch I get a dissolved croissant or a red hot cider or dried strips of Curry an infusion of fresh Panini amazing now let's try to figure out where is it doing it and how would I oh I've got a project for you I want to make my own work uh naming scheme so how does that work whoops um so where uh make your own word list for generating sketch name I wonder if it uses something like a contextfree grammar um that would be a way to do it hello Argentina in the chat um let's see so where I think that if I go here often if we go to could it be in the Sketchbook folder like I've got a lot of stuff in my Sketchbook so tools modes templates no theme theme there's some theme files there where are here I bet you it's here aha because there's I wonder if adding that's my recent so there's some important files here which are like the actual preferences I wonder where console I wonder where let's look um let's see if there's more um information about it I really want to find this out um sketch naming naming uh oh this is sorry hold on uh detailed information okay uh okay we've replaced underscores new sketch naming schemes can a friendly name of schemes create a file naming.json in your Sketchbook folder that follows the same layout in the processing download provide a name a list of prefixes and a list of suffixes just like that okay so where are those same layout in the processing download so on the Mac it's like the an application it looks like it's one thing I don't know if you know this but it's actually like a bundle of a lot of files so I wonder if I would find one in here somewhere uh Road revisions tools so I might have to like look into this a bit more to find ah there we go look at this I found it so let's open with a visual studio code aha so we can see okay come on come back we can see how this works now that um the friendly name it comes from glitch.com friendly words prefixes I wonder if I skipped over something can I oh my God the rain is so loud can I condense this yeah suffixes yeah and culinary arts is prefixes come on close there we go suffixes yeah Cosmos previous so yeah so now I see um now I see how this is done so we could make our own let's just try it let's do a coding train one so if I do this um let's make a new file I'm going to call it naming.json I'm going to put it in my uh processing sketch folder um well I didn't mean to uh let's call it uh coding train sorry there's got to be a better way for me to do this but I can't think of it right now all right this is fine I'm too stubborn okay so we're gonna get uh an array with name notes and prefixes wow the rain is insane if water starts coming through the ceiling we'll know why um and uh suffixes whoops so prefixes could be chew oh it has to be in Shiny Happy suffixes could be uh chew rainbow unicorn vegan cupcake I don't know what am I doing here what's become of me oh this is from coding train live stream uh coding train all right so I've made this file now this is the most important thing I'm going to do today I'm going to close this out uh I'm assuming that it doesn't Auto populate here so let's let's see if I go out of the preferences doesn't show up let's try quitting processing opening it up again this dot would have been good I don't know why I didn't think of that uh and now I've got a farm fresh bag of almonds and now I see cutting train chew vegan cupcake two unicorn shiny vegan cupcake happy vegan cupcake happy unicorn I want to get choo choo one of these days we're gonna get choo choo okay I know the music's kind of loud it's not loud for me now it is turn it down for you guys all right all right uh what else new processing stuff do we want to look at okay we've gotten through um oh okay so we've gotten through the naming convention naming system oh I haven't been looking at the um uh okay there I see a couple comments in the um in the uh in the coding training Discord okay new movie maker tool that can create animated gifs as well as high resolution lossless MPEG videos all right this we have to try now let's interestingly enough let's go to the coding Train website let's go to challenges I think I had one on like making gift loops okay so you can see I really need to work on the metadata stuff here would love help with this uh so let's go back here um whoops come on also not all the challenges have been ported so that also might be this might be one that hasn't been ported yet let's go to the next page Cube Wave by bees and bombs yeah let's try this so let's look at this uh code oh this is the oops so by the way if you're on the coding Train website and you're looking for the code if you click on this it's typically going to open by default in p5.js to go to the web editor but over here you can see this processing icon this should take me to directly to the processing code and huge shout out to dipom sen who has done a ton of work organizing this code and doing a lot of the content porting um so let me grab this code bring it into the new processing let's close all these windows that I opened unnecessarily why won't they close you know I shouldn't trust my computer my computer is kind of a disaster this 2019 MacBook I really need to upgrade it those new those new M2 matte apples they're not they don't come cheap um okay so crushed sweet potato let's paste this code in let's run it see if it works great so there is oh lovely so I think uh there's a bunch of flaws in my code example versus the original this is a this is one of my coding challenges where I attempted to recreate a very wellknown GIF from the artist bees and bombs who you should follow on Twitter or Tumblr or Instagram or wherever you can find all these amazing gifts mine looks like it's upside down perhaps or doesn't have as much as sort of thoughtful visual design in terms of the quality of the graphics and lighting and all of that but this will do for our purposes tools Movie Maker so how does this work oh I see compression ah I see so the movie maker I remember this now the movie maker doesn't directly render a movie so to speak or um from your sketch but if I were to include save frame and I'm going to do a folder called output and I'll do render Dash pound pound Pound these hash symbols indicate to processing that it should number the files up to four places and I'm gonna say I don't know dot PNG and what I would like to do with this code I haven't been thoughtful about oh we can see the original GIF here let's take a look at it but one thing I would love is for the it might not be possible for the text editor to somehow allow clickable links in it uh to recognize a URL in comments but Cube wave it's waiting to load there it is ah so you can see this is this is a much a nicer version of this but mine will do so my guess is just I I could certainly look at thinking about the variables so such that um how would I match the beginning to the end but let's just try to guess the angle starts at zero there's also m a no and angle minus equal negative one so I'm assuming that if the angle is less than negative 2 pi that would be one full cycle of this wave that's just now I haven't evaluated the math to know that this is really true whoops let's do uh B B's and bombs too um so let's see what this does um I'm going to say otherwise exit so I'm going to as long as the angle is less than negative 2 pi no greater than because the numbers are negative going down so my limit is negative 2 pi so while I'm greater than negative 2 pi keep saving the images and then once I get past uh quit exit so let's see what happens oh look how fast so wow that was remarkably fast so how many images did I get so now we can see we have this output folder with all of these images now the first one does it match the last one that would be the question yeah I don't know if I've gone through a full cycle of the wave but they certainly match so now I should be able to go to tools Movie Maker I want to do same size as Originals because I want to generate my GIF to be the same size as the sketch um then I'm going to just oh I called it the French for output it's fine my typo aside I'm going to drag that into here and then I want to create a animated gif Loop and let's hit create uh and I want to save it let's just save it to the desktop uh bees chew I don't know uh save uh did it do it was it just that fast because usually it shows I've done this before with like thousands and thousands of images and it shows me a progress bar let's see if uh on the desktop we do we have this I think I did it is it a perfect looping GIF I'm not entirely sure because I might have missed one frame on one side or the other I wasn't there's a more thoughtful ways of doing this and I do have a set of videos that I build off of golong leavens examples for this like GIF Loop uh coding train yeah so you'll see that I have some videos about making a gif Loop and making a purling noise Loop a hard curve GIF Lube so there's a bunch of these that you could find if you want to like go do a deeper dive into this but what I don't address in these videos is the fact that you can have processing render the GIF because that's a new feature so yes so what this is using from what I understand so uh Greg in the chat is recommending image magic which is a nice command line tool that you can use to create gifts with a lot of different parameters or render images adjust images I've used it there's also ffmpeg which I use quite a bit and I believe that this movie maker tool is just a user interface in front of f it might be using some other things too I didn't develop this I'd have to look at it uh you know we can look at the processing source code or you could ask a question on the Forum but my understanding is that this is using ffmpeg behind the scenes okay I'm gonna move on oh it's 11 12. I gotta move on from this I'm obviously doing a very long dive into all these new features so we talked about this apple silicon is supported sketch folder restrictions have been relaxed making it easier to use Version Control yeah this has been a big thing so I don't know if you've ever noticed um um that and I I know I spelled bees and bombs wrong but one of the things that has been trickied about working with processing is that you can um you all let me sorry let me go here to ask columns typically with processing sketches the pde file which is your source code file has to have the same exact name as the folder um and then if you have this like stray pde file like if you try to open it it's like oh I've got to make a folder with that name and things can get messy and confusing I want to move on from this so I'm and I don't have the full awareness of all the changes here but I believe and if somebody in the chat knows um um there's somebody in the chat knows please um chime in you can ask um by the way Raphael who does the wonderful creative coding news twitch streams is the new processing Community lead so that's tweet at Raphael if you ask all these questions to Raphael um but um I believe the pdex and pdez are mechanisms for different file extensions for having your processing sketches and not and being able to like move them around in more flexible ways with more flexible file naming and my suspicion is if I go back to here oh yeah uh we could look um yeah um I want to I I'm I'm noticing how long I'm so I'm gonna look into this a little bit more and come back to it um but so um but the but know that that's there for you and it's pretty exciting okay uh many many changes made to Future proof the software Java 17 um hundreds of bug fixes and usability updates um all the Gory details in this revision document let me look at the note uh there's new Raspberry Pi support so um if it's not something I could demonstrate right now not something I spend time with but if you are interested in doing development on the Raspberry Pi take a look at processing again it's been revamped from what I understand being able to rename the main tab so that Version Control doesn't break when you rename a sketch that's one of the ones gradient themes let me look here multiple ways to name sketches okay I'm going to read you um this is direct from Ben Frye there are a few options for these found in the preferences window oh yeah no this is multiple ways personalizing the environment okay I showed this already uh new welcome screen a lot of Plumbing work oh preferences and Export to application dialog boxes have changed quite a bit so let's look at um let me uh I'm gonna just comment this out let's look at the export to application feature so this is great if you're not aware of this this is such a wonderful wonderful thing for those of you who work on um sort of kiosk like installations whether for a museum exhibit an art installation a project that you want running in the lobby of a building the ability to export a standalone application that can boot up with a machine from processing is huge it's much harder to do that kind of thing with like a browserbased environment because like okay we've got to like write this script for the browser to open the browser has to go full screen it could be a bit of a mess so um what's important is this sort of question um is and I guess this is only relevant for uh what I'm using right now Intel 64bit Mac but um if you embed Java processing still runs on Java so the application if it doesn't have Java with it it's going to expect the machine to have Java which in most cases it will but this is a way of including it so it sort of guarantees the experience of running it is identical to your running it there's also this really sort of messy thing on Macs about signed applications so to make sure that they're not that they're that they can be run that they're not coming from an unidentified developer let's see how this goes for me right now sort of dramatic uh you know we can we could do like a um dramatic uh um pause here so I want to do Mac OS Intel 16 for a bit export and I now have this application right here and I believe you can customize the icon there's a way of doing that I mean you obviously could do that on your own so let's see what happens now like I'm just gonna drag this over to the desktop so you see this is totally like a standalone application now I'm gonna it's over here I'm gonna double click it oh let's try this oh I got something I got something for you oh this is so cool okay let's try this now now let's put it all together we're gonna wrap everything up with a beautiful bow okay we're gonna say window ratio 400 400 uh uh full screen yeah full screen p3d I think what this will do well first let's just try running it oh I'm not using r with okay hold on am I using with ah r with R height our height our width now obviously I could do a find and replace but that's not me I'm not a I'm like a tedious meditation coding person let's try this this is very exciting oh whoa okay uh hmm let's try what did I do um I probably missed something okay what did I miss and where do these uh see all right w I have to investigate this later I suppose because I was getting so big oh hold on hold on oh this probably I have a feeling that this is okay maybe this needs to be oh maybe the way that I've sort of figured this out all of these things need to be tied to the width and height as well that's probably what it is so I need to this is my fault for not coding this thoughtfully the ortho uh shouldn't the aspect ratio match with ortho probably right it should yes right okay that makes sense but maybe let's just try this and then uh how do I do window resizable is that the function so let's see what happens when I do this yeah oh I see I don't want to I want actually this is not the behavior I want it's doing it correctly it's trying to adjust it to uh the size but really what I just want I always want to I I mean who knows why I'm doing this so the thing that in my head that I just created in my head was like I want to see it nicely fixed as a square in the center but that's not actually what this ratio stuff is meant to do it's doing exactly what it's meant to do which is making it look kind of weird as I resize it but that's kind of cool like so let's just take this out again and let's go back to I'm just curious let's look at the difference uh I'll do find replace here let's look at what happens without that are with our height stuff yeah look it totally whoa it is kind of cool but some weird stuff is definitely happening and then if I wanted it to not I could have these be right I could fix another way of thinking about this would be to actually have all these fixed at 400 no matter what I do and then this could be r with an R height I think this is kind of I don't know if this is the right way to do this but interesting but I'll have to think oh no because it's still um oh this would be I'm gonna get this I want aspect ratio oh there's an ass yeah there's an aspect ratio anyway you you work this out you can see how I can't figure this out right now because my brain cannot my brain it's like when I was programming when I first used processing we're talking almost 20 years ago now 19 really if I'm being more precise I'm coming up on 20 years though I would say summer of 2003 so when I first used processing no I I this wasn't even called draw when I use processing this is called Loop so how's my brain supposed to understand how to resize a window in your aspect ratio that's for you young coders out there to do okay did you get the idea it's really cool that I can export the application run it full screen that's what I was trying to show you um all right so uh what else what else what else um welcome screen uh multiple platforms I think I've covered just about everything um about processing four so um there we go okay I've got a few other things on my agenda here I'm going to be wrapping up in the next 10 to 30 minutes so if you're um and and one thing that I would really like to do with these live streams especially now that I've covered this stuff and somebody hey I would uh if somebody wants to help me with this fantastic but I want to make sure that after this stream ends that I put time codes in the description so people can find the different parts where I'm looking at these different processing four features um you know one of the things you know that you might notice is that the coding Train website has a tremendous amount of metadata and a full uh hopefully nice way of archiving and organizing all of the sort of Standalone project videos otherwise known as challenges as well as all of the sequence tutorials otherwise known as tracks but there is no uh bar here for live streams now I would very much like to add live stream archive but the reason why I haven't done that is because I don't have the time or capacity and I haven't um and people I I have people who help and work on who are paid to work on coding train there are volunteers who help with coding train um I I that hasn't been something that we've been able to make time and space for but I really would like for the live streams to be archived in a way that they're more searchable time coded because there are uh you know good luck to you if you're trying to find something that happened for like 20 minutes on a given live stream that's like an important nugget of information it's just probably called on YouTube live stream archive and it's three hours long without time codes so if anyone is interested Step One is like let's try doing it for this live stream today but if anyone's interested in helping with that add it to the list of things that I would like to do eventually for the coding trade okay tracks meme tutorials okay Andrew has the great so fall plan is on my list here so uh Raj and Andrew are asking about what challenges are planned um what um how often you're gonna live stream um I'm noticing Simon is not here which is unusual so I'm gonna have to check in and say hi to Simon hope Simon's doing well um uh Sky Grizzly is asking a great question about the Apple 2 plus um so I'm running out of steam a little bit my the engine is getting quite tired but let me fall plan is on my list so let me move through a bit more quickly here so first of all let's check I'm going to check um online questions um there are yeah did I know that this service has no spamming protection I do know that so I'm relying on the kindness of strangers here um where is the name so there are a few questions that have been upvoted um I will come back to those at the end so just so you know um you can go to onlinequestions.org and type in the code uh 314159 uh into the little box there you can upvote questions or ask your own I'll try to do a couple more um at the end um okay Apple II Plus so as I mentioned you can see my recent two videos have been about coding on the Apple II plus I'm planning to do the next one where I'm going to look at building a simple 3D renderer on the Apple II plus so how can the first one I did just text and I made a little snake game with characters moving around the screen then I looked at Graphics drew a fractal tree next I'm going to continue with Graphics but look at 3D rendering that's the plan although I currently don't have a camera set up for it so who knows when I will get to it so I did want to go through and look at some of the interesting stories and comments that people posted here um I think I might not have enough time for that today so what I'm going to do is look at the Showcase so let's go look at the passenger showcase for these but I would certainly encourage you um to take a look at the um the comments there are yeah so like let's just look at this one um 43 year old software engineer here and this is where it all started for me messing around with basic on the Apple 2E in my Elementary School library creating these little games stimulated my imagination as a kid and I can't imagine videos like yours wouldn't do the same for kids today this stuff is timeless thank you for the Nostalgia trip so um thank you for this I see Rusty here in the mid 1970s we got our first computer as my dad was a programmer it was immediately enthralled the game this game was the first program I wrote it was on a Radio Shack TRS 80. so you know I don't know how far down this Rabbit Hole of retro Computing I'll do there are a bunch of YouTube channels um Adrian's basement is one that people pointed me to which maybe is more about restoring the machines than programming on them but um it's been really wonderful uh and thank you practical engineering wonderful YouTube channel to read people's stories about how what kind of uh programming they did on Old Computers in the 70s and 80s I also love hearing from people who are you know born in the century for example and we're like wow I didn't know what programming looked like on these older computers um basic is a bit of um I mean it's certainly something that was widely used but it's a environment that I might say was more for recreational or educational programming but it really fits with what I do I mean I think there is a line that you could draw from basic to processing um whereas you know Punch Cards and Assembly Language and Fortran these are things that I could also get into at some point but that does some people didn't notice that in the comments of people talking about that um okay so I would encourage you if you haven't had a chance to check these out um you can see there's some fun little things in there um uh people uh you know I talk about I was able to screen capture with analog video into HDMI so I'm not going to go through these but what I would like to do is go to the code and Train website and I'm going to go to challenges and you can see here the most two two reasons so first thing I have to chastise you the coding train viewership grab some real talk here people I'm not doing this just to code myself I want to see your successes and failures and where you got stuck and what you tried um so uh so far there are no passenger showcase for no passenger showcases submitted for this particular um video so I want to encourage anybody I don't know what your plans are for today for tomorrow this weekend you know be with friends and family uh make sure you're you're sleeping well you're taking care of your mental and physical health spend some time outside if you can but you know if you're at the computer programming I would love to see some of your work related to this particular video now moving on to the next challenge is there a way for me to go from this page to the next one I think there is and this should really uh um I think oh no we haven't merged that pull request yet so many things I want to talk about um let's go to um back to challenges whoops back to challenges I can do this Apple II and you can see I've got the two so that metadata made it in there I'm gonna click on this one and now we can see I have quite a few wonderful uh passenger showcase projects so I want to take a look at these um coming soon oh look there's a lot of them wow coming soon so I'm going to click through these kind of quickly um because I want to look at all of them coming soon is a way that these will appear in random Order each time um and if by the way if you're wondering how do you submit yours um up here on so first of all there should be a link to it ah submit a contribution it's right here so if you click on this link it'll take you to a new page which has a submission form with information but you can also do it uh through a GitHub pull request so I encourage you to try that the form creates a pull request so regardless you're getting your first pull request made which is going to be really exciting for people that's that's my mission in life is for people to have for me to provide a welcoming positive experience for people to have their first pull request merged to an open source project foreign so I highly encourage you to do this um Raj the thumbnail is something you have to submit so as we've been porting a showcase projects over from the previous website uh Kathy and depam and many other people have been making all these screenshots because we didn't have them originally but now it's up to you to take a screenshot and submit it with your um if you don't submit one it'll it'll just use the thumbnail of the video I think or the screenshot of the the code example associated with the video um so ah so uh I forgot what I was going to say um oh so let's take a look at these so let me actually just go and click on all of them and go through them oh this is gonna cause a problem for me but it's fine Okay so now first is oops looks like it's behind it now this is a little unusual because usually what I would do most passenger showcase projects are to what I usually ask people to submit is well if it's a piece if it's a website it runs online it's the P5 sketch linked to the code editor maybe if you made it in processing maybe you recorded a screen capture it's nice to have like something that I can quickly visually and see but with this it's kind of unrealistic to do that but what I can do very nicely is I can grab the code um and I'm going to go there's a few different emulators I'm gonna actually go to this one and I can just paste the code in here and run it so let's have a look and let's try playing it so one this has obviously been uh switch to Graphics mode mine was just using text and that's really cool to see low resolution Graphics mode and maybe also a nice end screen we can see game over right there so that's wonderful thank you Heinrich and we can see I love that there are nice uh comments and things here uh with with REM being a way to do a comment not the band REM for a remark okay thank you now we've got Julian's um base Apple uh basic okay so let's do this and I think I might have just closed this let's go here let's paste this one in and run it so this also looks this looks like it's doing text but oh it's very fast but just different characters that maybe make more sense game over a game over screen so one of the things by the way um so if I wanted to try these on the Apple II plus I would have to sit and type the whole thing out so copy paste um uh and uh one of the things that you don't realize or that you do if you did this kind of work is and you look at any of these books you would get um magazines in the mail that had cool basic programs that were on pages and pages and pages and you could sit there and just like retype them into your computer and it was a really exciting thing to do to take all that time to retype them and finally run it and realize you missed something I have to look through and find the typo oh those were the days okay thank you for this I'm gonna go backwards now uh ooh so this is a place to hold some code for a snake game in Commodore 64 basic uh here's the basic code the question is I have to run this on a vice emulator you can drag this or attach it let's see convert I'm just curious by the way I'm sure it won't work I'm curious what happens if we try running this code on the Apple emulator yeah so unsupported poke location so if you watch the video you'll know that Peaks and pokes it's an old tiny command to look in the computer's memory or to add something update the computer's memory poke is poking at the memory changing it Peak is peaking it so I used it in the video for peeking at the place in memory that is keeping track of the last key pressed on the keyboard so obviously the Commodore 64 is going to have different memory addresses then so let's just see is there a JavaScript c64 emulator um let's see can I um oh I have to drop some so I don't have unfortunately just because for the interest of time I'm very sorry about this I am not able to I already lost that page um I am not able to figure out the Commodore 64 emulator right now live but I would love to do look at that so thank you for that submission I encourage those of you to investigate that more if you're interested okay so now we're looking at another one snake game gameplay video so that I could watch but where is the code um okay hold on that's the readme file so let's try running this one and let's go back to here this one is from whoops did I just close this one out who is this one from okay this was the uh Commodore 64 one right and this one is from unified data Corp thank you to unified data Corp let's try running this whoa okay this is wild press enter to begin so wait can I just do I get all these oh and it beeps that is so cool oh this is incredible and look at the like text here at the bottom like saying yummy oh I hit the wall oh no press enter to start a new game this is amazing look at all this code look at all this code got some nice comments Go Subs delays welcome screen a poke I wonder what this poke is I actually have the poster over here still four six one eight um here I'll take I'll show you this is um pull it off the wall for a second this is my um so it's gonna get keyed out a little bit but this is the Peaks and post poster it actually has some really fun stuff on the back uh I guess I'd have to turn the green screen on or show it to you on the Whiteboard view but I wonder if we can figure out 49162 49162 four nine two four nine one five two four nine one six eight oh four nine one six eight clears the keyboard so the Poke of 49168 is clearing the keyboard so that way if you're using a key that somebody pressed and you don't want that if statement to execute again you would then poke to clear it okay that's wonderful thank you okay I gotta put this back on my wall this is a very very precious thing of mine I don't want to lose it okay um all right thank you for this this is totally awesome um by the way if anybody is in the chat who made one of these um I would love to please say hi uh now we've got the great the amazing Sebastian lag who uh created their own version of it um and let's take a look at their code um look at this really nice commenting going on here we're gonna ah I'm always closing the window now let's uh run this well look at that startup screen ah whoa this is going very fast oh my God so interestingly enough the speed going horizontally is so much faster than vertically because the size of the pixel is not a uniform Square it's interesting be interesting to try to account for that in the code I'm sorry it's sort of like hard to not stop playing these let's see what happens if I get to the end oh I guess there is no I'm not long enough to hit myself and it's got wrap around so let's see let's see if I can I'm just curious if there's a okay well you get the idea amazing work Sebastian lag I love that you did this I look forward to like long thoughtful video essay about programming on the um Apple II plus okay so that's Sebastian lags we've got uh Michael Kemps uh snake let's take a look at this wait a second seed Peak 78 Peak 79 to create a random seed gotta look at my poster again Peak 78 78 random number field it's right here that's interesting I was not aware of that that's cool to see all right let's try uh running this one see what it looks like whoops oh okay hold on let's refresh this page and let's try running this whoa ah game over oh what are the keys uh arrows so these are using the arrows I'm looking at the chat here this is great let's look at let's see our game over screen game over yes great job thank you for sharing this so fantastic do we have any more did I get them all snake game with Graphics Julian's we did Michael Kemp Sebastian lag Daniel long we saw uh I don't remember seeing this one slightly more complete and faster did I miss this one oh I missed this one it was a paste bin site that's why I closed that let's uh how do I let's look at Raw let's try this one so I missed this one let's take a look so this is the most close to uh the the version that I actually do in the video um and one thing I'm curious about is um I was looking to see if it used a ring buffer so um one of the things that I didn't do is use this idea of thinking of the array so I I'm like in my modern Computing World thinking about an array as having you know five spots in or ten spots in it and if I want to remove something from the array and add something new maybe I shift everything over and add something to the end whereas on the Apple II this glooping through the array to shift all the elements is incredibly slow so it would make much more sense to think of the array as a circle and all I'm doing is changing where the beginning of the array is so rather than Shifting the elements over I shift where I start and that would be this idea of using a ring buffer which honestly is an efficient way of doing things regardless of whether I'm you know on a M2 Max computer or on um you know an old Apple II but I didn't think to do that while I was programming it certainly that would be something to do all right so thank you I want to really encourage all of you um if um to um to submit to the passenger showcase what will happen is um so when you go if you under guides um under the passenger showcase guide if you submit this form um you are not required to include your email but if you include your email and you have a GitHub account with that email then the Commit This will automatically make a commit and a pull request will be tied to your GitHub account otherwise it's just going to be tied to Choo chupot on an account that we have set up just as like a bot account on GitHub so fill out this form submit it you could also do it manually as a pull request and then what will happen is and I'm pretty sure in the footer of the website if we go here to um here and go to the codingtrain.com and I go to pull requests what you would see if I go to look at pull requests with the label showcase and look at closed you can see these are the five most recent so we can see that there are these snake applesauce basic showcase projects that I looked at and then also let's look at this Space Invaders one um so we can see that this is one that's already been merged it's going to show up on the Space Invaders challenge page let's go look at that just curious uh oh that's going to be hold on Space Invaders there we go and uh yeah you can see it right here oh no no right here this is there's a bunch of them it probably is the last one because they're not random right now there's a lot of them let's see sometimes they don't actually show up unless I clear rebuild the site clearing cache regardless um let's take a look at it here we can look at it here so thank you to Steve King uh here is the Space Invaders project tap canvas to start it's still loading so Lucifer says when is this there's no end to these you can submit them whenever um and I don't know if there's an error here if it's loading so I think there unfortunately was an error with this running so sorry for this little moment of fail here but I encourage you please submit your passenger showcase projects I want to see them I look at all of them and I'm trying to get better organized to look at them and the live streams as you can see okay what else is on my list so I talked about the Apple II plus talked about the Showcase talked about the website got a few more questions to answer so two other updates nature of code fall plans these are highly tied together so let me close a bunch of Windows here and I'm going to be out of here in five or ten minutes um all right so as you know you don't know this as you might know there is a book called the nature of code published in 2012. um you can read the entire book for free online right here this has largely been untouched since 2012. this is the original text it is all written uh for uh processing and has a lot of mistakes in it the neural networks chapter was written before anything that's happened in the last six months let alone nine years 10 years so what's happening with this if you go to GitHub nature of code you will see that there is a new repo called book website second edition this is the new repo where all of the and we're actually currently working on more documentation here where all of the uh content diagrams styling for the new second edition of the book is here and in fact it really should have a link right to the netlify preview right here in the readme I don't think that it does so I have to like remember this what is it called can I log into my netlify account hold on let me just uh see if I can log in here GitHub pretty sure if I log in with GitHub it'll work and nature of code um yeah so I'm gonna I'll show this to you no reason why you can't see it so I'm using netlify which thecodingtrain.com also uses to build the site uh from that repo there's a workflow that whenever updates are made the new site is built so I'm happy to share this URL if anyone wants to take a look this is the current version of the second edition you can see it is missing chapter five it is missing chapter 10 and it is missing chapter 11. but most of these chapters with some long a mediumsized list of things they are done and there is a second edition version of the chapter here with a little bit of a new design p5.js code and one of the things you'll see if I go to forces for example which is really exciting let's get to the first example oh okay maybe I need to go to vectors because I haven't done I haven't done this for most of the chapters yet yeah here we go the examples are running embedded here in the browser and then if I click here open in the P5 web editor so this is all in progress because they actually changed everything's changing uh this will actually fix it it would take me to the um the sketch in the P5 web editor so this is a lot of work is going into this um Jason who is a recent Alum the ITP program has been doing a ton of work building out this website this uh I didn't think this by the book goes anywhere because you can't yet so a this is here all I haven't been on YouTube as much because I'm doing a lot of work on this but the really so one check it out um there's not really an easy way for people to contribute or participate in this right now but you're welcome to look at the website look through the GitHub repo I welcome your GitHub issues ETC but the real work needs to happen right now which is that I need to get my act together and write the new physics libraries chapter which will be chapter five I'm going to use matter.js write update the neural network chapter to deal with neural networks in 2022 and write the new chapter chapter 11 which is going to touch on reinforcement learning and neuro evolution so I'm not sure yet but in terms of my fall plan I might have to take October off from YouTube streaming and video making in order to start writing these because I have not I've made space to work on editing to get the site going I mean I'm not doing a lot of this work but I'm kind of managing it and thinking about it and making lots of changes so I think that what I'm going I I have an absolute deadline in my mind of finishing the second edition by the end of December so what happens if I don't do any live streaming or recording videos in October do I get drafts of all three of those chapters done in October and I come back to YouTube in November or do I also need to take November off and then December off so I don't know what the future of this fall holds um but I do have I'm I there's still time in September so it's my intention to do another Apple II plus video I would really like to do the wave function collapse part two and now that there's processing four I want to create a new YouTube course on learning to code with the processing so uh our track so to speak so that's um that's the kind of thing that I can just do in one day like it'll take longer to put it all together with a little light editing and and organizing all the metadata but I'm hoping to take like a Saturday just get in here and like teach all the fundamentals of programming with processing over the course of a day so it'll be very little postproduction um involved with that and it'll just be up on YouTube as like an archived hopefully somewhat Evergreen video that people could use to learn to code I do have that right now for P5 and I do have a really old one for processing but that that one is 10 years old so I'd like to do it with processing four so that's the fall plan um um uh I I I uh yeah there's more to wave function collapse I don't know realistically what I'm gonna get to in the next couple weeks but that's um that's my fall plan I have a uh if you have questions or comments about that um please let me know uh um join the coding train Discord I would love to see you there um you can find it at thecodingtrain.com uh Slash Discord or there's links to the Discord there let's take a look at answering some of these last questions so I'm going to go to whoops I'm going to go to onlinequestions.org type in the event number and uh we see there's a few ques like let's see if I can get so yes I know this has no spam prediction so I'm going to answer that I I uh what I'm my spam production is I'm looking at it to my right I'm not showing it on the screen in case somebody posts something inappropriate but it probably takes something inappropriate a while to get upvoted so that's also a little bit of a protection here will you continue the Apple II tutorials yes the this the roadblock for me and I would love to hear from you about this you know on Twitter at schiffman at the coding train um I need to figure out how to have a nice setup where I can go back and forth between working on the Apple II and this setup that you're seeing right now with this view as well as the uh whiteboard view so um I'll be working on that and um but yes it's my intention to do at least one more Apple II video uh answered and have you seen any of the physical oh where's the name sorry there's two questions where is the name coding train where's the name coding train come from well sit back it's Story Time with Daniel shipping on the coding trade oh only a few minutes left I'll make this a short story um this channel used to be called coding rainbow that was a nice name it was an homage to the wonderful you know you can see that I have a little bit of an obsession with the 80s being the time of my youth um there was a wonderful television program called Reading Rainbow with the amazing incomparable iconic legendary LeVar Burton and I don't know I just I love the vibe of it and I thought what is it that I want to say about coding to the world I want to say it's a rainbow so I called the thing coding rainbow not thinking I was starting a YouTube channel or a brand um but I flew too close to the Sun if you will like Icarus I hit the rainbow dead on hit me in the head and the very kind lovely wonderful nice Folks at Reading Rainbow where we would appreciate if you didn't name your things so close to arthay so I had had to come up with a new name ask for people on social media what do you think and by golly we need like a wick if somebody make a Wikipedia page edit the Daniel shipping Wikipedia page let's find the person who suggested this um because I can never seem to pull it out of my brain but uh a very nice person suggested coding train and I thought that works for me I like trains has a friendly Vibe we can have a rainbow coming out of the train and honestly that's where the train to training to code I didn't really think of that at the time people have mentioned that in fact so that's that's where it came from if you want to learn more about coding rainbow probably shouldn't be showing this coding uh coding rainbow believe you will if you Google it you will find ah yeah this next web article from 2016 has uh this video which is unlisted on YouTube embedded into it which is a little funny uh theme song wow okay okay so you know please enjoy this you can find it uh and if you like coding train I haven't done one of these in a while uh um coding Train theme yeah here we go this one in 2017. is the updated a coding Train theme with all sorts of additional silly graphics and animations so please please enjoy these If you're sort of new and haven't seen these These are from years ago I guess my newest version of that is the coding together uh sitcom intro so that's where the name coding train came from uh that's my little story time to end today uh hopefully there'll be some new videos oh I have this other project I'm working on which is kind of related to the Apple II but I think I want to make a JavaScript web version on it but and then do it over on Twitch and I if I I got to do this soon I'm I'm making a version of the Oregon Trail the Oregon Trail uh my own code example I guess I could do it as a coding challenge I'm not sure but if you're interested in that old game uh you could probably play it on Apple 2 plus load it from a disk that's also a project it relates to this like podcast and I have a lot more to say about that but remind me about that I really got to get that done got to get started on that soon okay so um thank you wave Morpher thank you Alex thank you sarvagya um this is it this is the end of today's live stream um I've got exactly one minute left before I said I had to go uh Alka has all the assets for the old intro that's great uh your lies coding rainbow yeah exactly can you do fractals on the Apple too hello did you not see my latest video um yeah so you can so go watch my latest video on YouTube um um uh Gabriel so yeah uh preferred on YouTube over twitch yeah I I really struggle I I'm trying to like have my I dip my toe in all the different platforms this is probably very loud for you I made a coding train tick tock that has one video on it now you might be able to find it um I um I I I was curious to experiment with YouTube shorts a little bit so we'll see um but yes I hear you I hear I hear from the audience that at least I mean you're I hear from the audience that's watching right now no surprise here you're watching this stream on YouTube that you prefer the YouTube streams I use the twitch stream just to kind of like experiment with weird stuff that I but in the end like why am I doing that my YouTube streams aren't exactly like professional broadcasts they're really just weird experiments but this today like you notice I didn't code any projects I would like to have these live streams be more about interacting with the audience and answering questions and featuring your work is that less interesting to you would you prefer to just watch me code stuff during live streams I don't know but I certainly would um would uh welcome um cervic yeah I'm so glad I pronounced your name correctly one thing I'd love to see just as I leave let me know where you're from where are you watching this from I the international um um the the fact that the coding trade audience viewers are so so all over the world it's something that brings me tremendous happiness I want to visit all of you I want to go everywhere I want to take going to coding train World Tour probably when I retire that's what I'll do I don't want to have to work though I just want to like experience the beauty that is the world presenting giving toxic very stressful just invite me somewhere I will come but I don't have to give it North Carolina Journey Hershey Pennsylvania the Netherlands Germany Bangalore India Korea India Seattle Boston Norway oh I have an invitation in Norway I got a reply to that email from Oslo the Netherlands India coding train Meetup yeah we had one kind of at prostate Community today in Copenhagen oh that's the end of the song Oh I'll be appearing live in New York City on October 8th and we're in a very smart part of a Matt Parker show more on that later goodbye everyone I always forget that this stock this stock this stuff this is stop never forget this stuff I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this dot this Dot Song never forget the this Dot and I'm gonna say once again you're important foreign autotune and the internet will fix that for me bring it with me Cartesian coordinates it look forward to Cartesian coordinate song so this is random this is noise hurling noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with purling noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six well this is like pearly noise performance art nine two seven six one five four eight nine two one three I think nine one two one two three four three four five six five four well this is like thoroughly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five seven five six seven five two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five well this is like pearly noise performance art unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it kittens pictures thank you I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound effect foreign that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens at dust and died yeah
