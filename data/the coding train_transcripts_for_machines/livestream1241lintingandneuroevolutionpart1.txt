oh good morning and welcome aboard to the Kotick train it is Friday March I don't know I think it's March although there was like some kind of like thunder snow this week I keep waiting when will be the time that I can go back to like a nice and spring beautiful flowers will be blooming that's what I but this week in New York City that would still it's still a definitively winter time so I'm keeping mine no√© background so welcome today is another Friday I am going to be livestreaming of various points today it is now this is the morning session I'll be here for about an hour or so then I will be taking a break and I will come back for an afternoon session now what's gonna happen today you might be wondering so first of all something that I care deeply up oh one of these days I'm gonna remember to head install that magic lantern huh my life streaming I don't see anybody give the chat like saying that I am it says streaming let's check my this always happens to me oh yeah okay good okay okay just checking alright never mind I'm very professional this is a professional II rent show operation here all the the producers over there all giving me the thumbs up this is running the director stagehands camera people I don't have any of those people it's just me that's all there is okay so right one of my true to try my fashion is indentation and spacing oh do I love it when the code just lines up all nicely next to each other so I want to spend a little bit of time this morning I've learned recently there's something called linting which I have to do a lot cuz I'm just I got like lint out the wazoo here and I should've brought my lint brush that would have been a good prop for some good shtick to remember that for maybe a part to linting tutorial maybe you don't even know what lint thing is I've known what linting is for a while but I have never I've never been because I like to like manually myself just adjust every little space an indentation myself but apparently there's some automatic style ways of like keeping track of stock adventures and this guy joking around this can actually be a good thing for an opensource project to adopt some conventions and make it easier to contribute and to run some testing to check for style convention so whoa hold on breaking news dentin at breaking new sound that I'm being told by Simon Tiger in the slack channel the patron group I just want to point out that I've realized the trains are in the cat's file and the cats are in the trains filed now this actually completely miscategorized the data from the doodle classifier example I will definitely have to fix that but I'll have to come back to that a pull request I will be accepting Simon if that is in fact the case okay so let's get start so let's let's I might have a few things I want to discuss so terminal let's go oh I term I really got to investigate this i term thing I have a new repository in a web browser here this is a new repository I set up that which is that coding train slash flappy bird clone so one of the topics which I hope to start today I'd love it if I finished it but I would not be surprised if I did not finish this today because this is a bit of a larger project is to use both my neural network examples and my genetic algorithm examples together to create a bot player essentially of a simple game and flappy bird I think good one to start with but I hope that will unlock lots of other interesting ideas and possibilities I would love to mention gibreel YouTube channel I believe it's s e FD Science YouTube gibreel has done a wonderful series a wonderful series about this one this is four out of four my first machine learning game where Jibril's uses neural networks genetic algorithms in unity to train this runner to run around a maze so I want to do something similar to that I've been very inspired by traboules work I highly recommend his a youtube channel actually we're planning a bit of a collaboration which I'm excited about so that's coming soon so but aha so what I did last night is I took the code from coding challenge number 31 which was just to make a simple flappy bird clone I put it into a separate repository I opened up some issues and solicited help with these issues like oh that example didn't use es6 classes so this is a Help Wanted I have a milestone I'm kind of want to do so much more about open source project management so I have this milestone of I need to fix the pipe spacing bug and do the visual and game design so what I want to do is a little bit of time spend a little bit of time this morning is going through some of these pull requests and seeing if I can fix those up merge them and we'll have a baseline game to start with okay so that's number one now since I'm mentioning this now while I'm while I'm talking I'm going to go away from this flappy bird I would love it I don't know if I put some comments here this pull request by Keegan M added oh no wait hold on maybe this isn't the right one how come I'm not seeing the image that was added here I'm sorry I'm looking so so I'm gonna come back to these pull requests sorry and and try to sort that out in a bit so if anyone wants to while you're kind of listening in go to that repository poke around mess around help out please do alright I'm so I'm going to come back to that in a minute now let's go and make let's let's let's create a new project so I'm using this p5 generator node package which allows me to just generate a p5 sketch really quickly I'm gonna call it I wonder if I maybe I just actually want to do no this is good I'm gonna do with the p5 sketch we're gonna call this spacing life's passion life's passion my life's passion my life's passion my life's passion then we're going to go into my life's passion we're gonna open it up in the atom editor I'm going to go here what's down what's going on here some packages could not be loaded because they contain native modules that were compiled for an earlier version of atom let's try to rebuild those packages okay now you've got this dude just add a little bit of code I'm gonna add a draw a background draw a function I'm gonna go into index of HTML and I'm gonna get rid of this style stuff and now go back into here know okay this is good this is a good start oh my goodness all the white space in the indentation it's all messed up Godsey oh that's okay oh this is like you know or something I don't know sound effects sound effects out of it okay now I'm ready to do my first tutorial of the day let me let me also run a server and you know while I'm here do I have this installed yeah why not I'm using node but no no I can't I can't I can't bring myself to do it alright here we go alright ok so so now I'm ready to do the first tutorial of today which the topic is linting and I'm just gonna get started with this I'm just trying to think about if there's anything else I need to pull up and then afterwards I'm going to come back and see so Keegan M if you're watching this I would love for you to resubmit your scrolling image because that was a image background and the the image for the the bird and then da gute who did some excellent there's some like oh yeah excellent changes Goudas here commented four minutes ago so one thing that is really helpful in open source development in certain context and I should have been more clear and I should write a contributing dot MD file is that oh the snake game would be good to do I agree easily distracted by the chats so please so is that if you are making if you are add if you're making a bunch of changes to an open source project so this flappy bird game for example here's some things you might you might clone my repository to like oh I'm gonna fix and add es6 classes I'm gonna fix the bug where the pipe spacing is off I'm gonna add a background image I'm gonna add a score I'm gonna do this other I'm gonna fix the resolute note the aspect ratio of the canvas if you put all of those things in one pull request you know in some context that's wonderful in the context of this there were a whole bunch of pull requests all at once and some people did this feature in this feature it's hard to manage where it's easier for me to manage if there are individual pull requests for each individual bug fix and feature that way I can kind of like try to pick and choose oh I want to merge this but this isn't exactly ready yet that sort of thing so I should say there's no way to do this wrong we're all learning about how to collaborate and participate in open source software development so the act of just doing a pull request is amazing and wonderful and encouraged and I'm trying to figure out what's the best way for me to engage with the community in ways to manage a kind of collaborative project like this okay so I'm gonna leave this aside and I'm gonna return to my life's passion let's put some let's put something in this I'm trying to think of what's a nice maybe I should use the phyllotaxis code let's use that that's always a nice one Philo so let's go to coding train website let's go to coding challenges Philo Texas p5.js sketched yes let me grab this code put it in here yeah I'll leave that there let's just see what's happening here beautiful okay if you haven't watched this coding challenge that's what this coding challenge does alright so now it's oh this is awful oh my goodness oh this is so awful oh this is the worst thing I've ever done hey is linting the kind of thing that will part of the configuration could be hey you should be using let instead of our is that something that'll stop me to use es lid spoiler alert okay okay this is gonna be fun I can't hit save because I have Adam beautify setup all right whoo this is gun oh but I went out and fixed the fact this runs needs to stop at a certain point but I guess I could just do that find you two okay all right so I think we're ready here this is going to be the first no so this is problem so I have this dream which is to have basically a playlist course all about opensource software development and I don't just mean the sort of like nuts and bolts technical stuff but also the sort of project and community management aspect of it so this kind of goes with that so far I've done videos about git and github I definitely need to do some more because I've learned a lot recently I want to thank tiny subversions on Twitter who has been was here at ITP for a couple weeks and did some workshops on getting github and opensource software development I learned a lot from that and so this until our I have the git and github tutorials I have the circle CI and unit testing tutorials so this is going to kind of go with that somewhere let's poke a blob barn lip so Eric will in the chat yes pls someone explain block scope I have a tutorial which i think is called you search on youtube for something like coding train or Schiffman let VAR i have a video that's about let versus VAR I don't know remember what's in its I think I answer your question in that video it's 1045 I've got an hour okay we're doing well oh hello welcome to a video about this video is actually about my life's passion I have a passionate in life everybody should find the thing that makes them happy feel at ease now you shouldn't be like me and you should definitely pick a different life's passion but my life's passion is indentation and spacing so this is my phyllotaxis coding challenge code which I went against every instinct that I have in this life and messed up the sort of spacing and indentation and so what I'm going to emphasize in this video tutorial is something and by the way this is not a video tutorial you're watching from an expert in this topic this is a video tutorial from someone who just learned about this topic really in the last week and I'm going to kind of learn about it while attempting to apply it to this piece of code and that topic is lifting I forgot my I really wish I brought my lint brush so I could have some kind of linting stick but oh well you'll have to live without that now what is linting so one of the things that makes me really happy is when a code editor has something like auto format or beautify and I'm using in here the atom text editor you have lots of people use different text editors and code editors and online editors and consolebased editors and I haven't configured in such a way that if I hit command S which is for save or if I go up here under packages atom beautify beautify I have this atom beautify package which allows which will automatically apply a bunch of styling conventions to the code so this horrible uncomfortable thing like look at this will be fixed and everything will be right with the world if I hit command s okay here we go here we go here we go okay so here's the thing I'm being silly and joking around here there's no reason why I couldn't have a program automatically look through the code and analyze it to determine if there are little things like a missing semicolon or maybe there should be a space here between this now again the cookies are I'm looking for things that don't stop the code from running but that don't adopt a certain style convention for readability of the code and also for maintenance of the code so me I tend to optimized for legibility and maintenance over like could ever making my code like as concise and short and cryptic as possible obstacle I think that's one of my favorite words which I can't really pronounce absolute location okay so and this can make an opensource project more accessible actually to contribute to because you kind of feel more confident as a contributors say like oh I can run this little module that tests the code I want to submit to see if it adopts the style conventions and so this is kind of related to unit testing and continuous integration that I have a whole other it will pop up somewhere video tutorial series about okay so let's get started here we know I have Adam beautify that will but it's not telling me about the semicolon here so I need to figure out how to do linting so the the package that I'm gonna use to lint oh look at this phyllotactic pattern let me just refresh let me actually adjust this to stop after a certain point because this is gonna start running really slow so let's see n plus equals 5 start like what's n at now I thought so let's just say I'm just gonna add something if n is greater than 1000 no loop so that will stop this phyllotaxis pattern will blossom in bloom until a thousand until that variable and reaches a thousand and then it will stop okay like that what the code is doing is less important this video coming back here let's look for something called eslint plugin javascript linter es lint is an opensource project originally created by Nicholas Zakas in June 2013 its goal is to provide a pluggable linting utility for javascript so i encourage you to read through all of the documentation about this there's a developer guide there are there's this whole documentation of rules that's a bunch of default rules so so the rules are the style conventions that you're applying to the code there's a commandline interface all sorts of stuff what I want to look for here I think is the getting started I want to just click on this getting started and uh there's this apparently this YouTube tutorial that you should probably just stop watching this video and go watch this right now cuz I'm sure it's better than whatever I'm gonna do but I'm going to engage with es lint via node so while this project I'm making this phyllotaxis pattern is a clientside JavaScript sketch that doesn't involve a server or anything I can use node the serverside programming JavaScript framework to kind of act as my project manager and I can import certain packages and things that I can run such as unit testing or linting so this is what I want to run the problem is I don't think I want to install es lint this moment right now because I haven't even set this up to be a node project and the reason why I know it's not set up to be a node project is that it would have a package.json file which is like a configuration file for this so that node knows how to kind of manage this project so I'm gonna go here looks so I am now now in terminal so if you're not familiar with the command line I probably have some video tutorial that goes over that I'm gonna just check yes I am in my folder my life's passion I'm gonna say NPM in it this is the command that I can run that will create the package.json file the configuration file for this project I could make it manually or copypaste it from where else but let's run this this utility will walk you through bla bla bla bla bla my package name and let's see what this can be over here my package name is definitely my life's passion it is version 1.0 whatever demonstrating linting for the coding train oh my goodness by the way I seriously need like a linter for my email so I stopped putting two spaces after the period because I just like I have a bad habit of that entry point sure sketch KS test command I'm not gonna run test right now so I'm going to leave that out git repository I'm gonna leave that out right now I can I can add that in later keywords linting tutorial education javascript let's do that author is the coding train and the license will be MIT and I'm gonna say MIT by the way is a software license that's very permissive and I try to adopt it for all of my projects when I can there's sometimes other considerations but it pretty much lets people use it for anything without having to give credit with that we can use it commercially etc okay is this okay yes but for example I use a Creative Commons noncommercial license for like my nature of code open source book because I wouldn't want someone to take the nature of code book and resell it but with something like this phyllotaxis pattern linting tutorial use at will okay is this okay yes yes okay so now I'm gonna I'm just gonna type clear to get back to the top and I'm gonna look we can see now AHA package JSON so I have this package out JSON which is the configuration file for my project and now link to it what does this been like 45 minutes let me just like document anticipating adding the linting all right so you're wonderful to watch this npm install es lint saved it so you might be wondering so first of all npm node package manager i want to install a package to go with this project yes lint is the package now what's this save dev now if you watch some of my other node tutorials you have might have noticed that I say save because often the code for my project itself on a node package this is not the case right now the code for my Philo Texas project does not depend on es lint yes lint is a developer dependency meaning I want to use this package while I am developing the project but when I release the project it doesn't need yes lint to go with it it's just the little animation that's gonna be in the browser so that's this is saying I wanted to pendency for this project but I want it to be a development dependency so I'm gonna do this I'm gonna copy paste this I'm gonna go back to terminal I'm going to paste it in and that was fast okay so now it added everything and I have es lint now I have a feeling we're missing some other packages and we're gonna kind of arrive at all of that as we go but we can now say here we can now we can now we can now see that first of all under this has been added to package that JSON under dev dependencies yes lint version 4.1 8.2 or higher so that's there and in theory now now I should say that some people choose to install yes lint globally on the computer so this now what I've done is I've installed es lint for this particular project only it might make sense for me as a person who might want to use it for everything that I'm always doing on my computer to install it globally but for now let's leave it as a local module so that anybody using this project can can have it there sort of as a standalone thing okay so now what I'm gonna do is I can run yes lint by referencing the es lint execution file in node modules in dot bin and your file I could run es lint on sketch dot yes so let's actually just do that okay so I'm gonna run this but instead of your file Dutch ass I'm gonna write sketch KS oops something went wrong so here's the thing yes lint isn't just magic it's not just like oh let's just gonna let there I know I as the eslint know exactly how you should style your code I there's no matter you have to set up a configuration file so that configuration file is its has a name and it is called it is a file that you create called es lint RC in the directory of the project and so I could create that manually and I could start to add some of the rules like hey I always want to semicolon or I always want to use double quotes me I like single quotes whatever I like to mix them up anyway I don't know what I like so but I could also now run let's try this I can run yes lint in it and I think it will give me it will step me through a series of questions it will ask me all about my preferences my passions my hopes and dreams and fears and it will create a nice configuration file of how I should style the code ever any was ever made on linting it's insane okay oops oh right but I have to instead because it's not a global module I have to say this it a dash dash in it this should work okay I'm so excited to have this conversation how would you like to configure es Lin to use arrow keys use a popular JavaScript style guide that sounds reasonable inspect your JavaScript files mmhmm I'm not sure hmm I don't know actually let's inspect our JavaScript files so one thing you should know is that there are popular JavaScript styles and a lot of them have been created by companies for example there's an air B&B style there's a Google style and these are these you can adopt and maybe I can we'll find out about some of these but let's I don't know I've actually never tried this inspector JavaScript files so let's try that which files should be examined sketch is what format do you want the config file to be in I let's stick with JavaScript am I using EMC ECMAScript 6 features yes am i using es6 modules no but I should be someday I got to do a tutorial about that where will my code run okay this is browser code only it is not node do you use common Dutch common J's no do you use JSX no okay great so it it enabled a whole bunch of rules for me look at this oh let's look now that file is there and we can examine it look at this array bracket new line array bracket spacing oh it's just like it looked at my code and created a configuration style not aloft or how I currently have it now some other things I might do is I might go back and try to adopt one of these common JavaScript styles I might look at a project like p5.js if I go to the if I go to p5.js on github github.com slash processing slash p5.js I'm guessing I'm gonna find look at that this opensource project has an es lint RC file so I could say like you know what I want to adopt the same rules that p5 adopts and so I could look through here now however I should be able to run the lint a now here we go wait so let's run linting now here's the thing I actually this is real so annoying awkward that I have to do this all the time I'm gonna do it right now but I'm gonna show you another way to run the es lint that wow there's been no editing required in this this as long just my shoes untied alright so I'm gonna run the effluent now again whoa okay so this is really interesting I got a lot of errors points is assigned of value but never used setup is defined but never used create canvas is not defined angle mode is not to five degrees is not defined so wait a second this is nuts I mean yes you're right if I look at my code hmm there is a background translate rotate and it's saying those things are not defined but they are they're defined they're part of p5.js so one thing that I probably want to do here is tell es lint that I'm using the library p5.js and if you're if something in my code is not defined but it's defined at p5.js you don't have to give me a warning or error about that so let's look at how we do that in fact one way of doing this is using another node package p5 config config es lint so if I go now to here you'll see that there is this other node package called es lint config p5.js which allows me to put in my yes lint our C file that this that I extend I am I am also should look at all the stuff that's part of p5 Jaz so let's now install this dev dependency to the project computer way too fast again that was installed and then what I want to do is look at my es Lynch RC file is there already and extends in here yes extends yes Lindt recommended so let's see what else I want to extend extends p5 just now ah so if I want to extend a bunch of things looks like I can create an array this doesn't look right right there should be commas here I think this is probably incorrect we should submit a pull request to this project just to fix its documentation cuz I have a feeling what I need to do is turn this into an array and then so I'm going to now add also p5.js and let's just add I'm not using it but let's add p5.js Dom so you can see this should be how I can add other kind of lint configurations that I'm going to es link configurations that I'm going to import into my project so let's see now I should be able to say I'm going to run linting again I'll leave this here ah ok great so now you can see that got rid of all that now here's the thing points is assigned a value but never used line I line 9 let's look at line 9 what is that so I go back to my code line 9 oh look at that that's actually a totally legitimate thing that it found I I'm not using that array anywhere so that's good to know I'm gonna take this out and now I'm gonna run it again and I fixed that now ok great so um here's the thing I probably maybe I'll look into this in a future in a part two or something there's probably a nice way that I can create my own custom rule so that I'm set up and draw are allowed it does think that I'm maybe that should be saying it's actually added to p5 the p5.js configuration but in this case in this case it is it is kind of accurate that I've defined this function set up and it's never called the p5 the library itself is calling it set up it does actually is that in a way I almost want to say it almost forgive me an error like hey where's your set up function let's do some other stuff let's let's put in some weird spacing and see what it gives me let's forget some semicolons knocking oh I I have to do something so one thing that I have is that as soon as I hit command s it's going to reformat the code so I need to turn off my atom beautify package so I'm gonna go to preferences wait hold on pack it I'm gonna go to atom preferences and I'm going to go to packages I'm gonna go to beautify so again this is a really atom the text editor specific which is a little less relevant to this video because you might be using a different text editor but I'm gonna go to settings of atom beautify and I'm gonna go down to JavaScript and there's by the way I can I'm going to uncheck this beautify on save which is what I'm doing right here by the way I can add I can actually link the text editor with es lint so maybe I'll do that in a separate video just look at that but again that's atom atom editor specific so I unchecked that preference so now I should be able to hit whoops I should be able to hit save all right and all of the mistakes or style mistakes are so one thing just to see like I shouldn't I'm not broken the code the code still runs I have not broken the code I've only broken my style conventions and so now I'm gonna run it again and look at this oh look at this let's see if I can it's really bothering me that I'm not that this formatting oh no this is fine now okay I just want to be able to see this a bit better I'm gonna make this a bit bigger so it look a space is required after the comma yes yes it is there should be spaces inside this parentheses multiple spaces found before degrees so so this is wonderful and look at this it's saying potentially fixable with the dashed fix option so in theory I should be l2 now run this again with fix and it will actually fix some of those style errors so look at that it didn't find any errors anymore and if I go back to the code okay I'm upset didn't I got a let's run this again yeah so interestingly enough this is deeply deeply upsetting to me that there aren't two spaces here if I run my package at a beautify I will get those spaces back so that's something that I have to investigate and probably what I need to do is go look at the es lilin documentation whoops in the ESL in documentation go under and go under rules and look for a rule that I can add to make sure that is fixed now here's the thing most likely if I adopt one of these more popular JavaScript style guides it's gonna have more stuff in it that I might want and maybe I'll come back and try some of those in a separate video but I do want to mention one thing here this was kind of no fun what I did in the sense that know nothing about this is fun that I have to do this because I have es lint as a local a local a local module and so one thing I can add to my package JSON file and it's here under scripts so you could see like one of the things you might have if you watch my videos about unit testing I could say things like npm run test and what that will do is will run whatever commands i have that are mapped to test in scripts so i'm going to add one here called lint and i'm going to say whoops i'm going to go and grab this and then I'm also going to say star Jas so this would in theory lint any JavaScript file are in the projects in them in the main directory and there I think it might not hopefully it won't look for the at the library files which is something I definitely want to ignore but if I do this and save this now I can simply say NPM lit run lint and there we go now that didn't work why did that not work lint yes Lyn star Jas mmhmm oh no it worked it just like gave me some like weird error hold on I'm getting a message it's not from the patron group time out for a second let me look at the log anybody know what I'm doing wrong I just why do I have this no run no think so because run is saying run this script so this just needs to be lent you just look at this and p.m. oh I just say NPM lint why do I imagine I need to say run no I have to say run okay look at this again yes I wonder if it didn't like my star Jas drink water it is supposed to be like that es lilin returns arrow so npm errored oh oh thank you kenneth in the chat thank you ah okay so is there it's because the exit code is oh okay okay okay got it so this is actually correct is there something I want like should I be configuring things in a slightly different way or this is actually I want to see this because because if I was doing this with like some kind of like testing true so I actually want to see this if there are errors okay hey by the way this is I've literally never I've used linting in other people's projects I've never used it in my own project okay so 1115 already do Lindt J s hint or true mmm interesting you want to see this es Flint is Xing we wanted it okay okay I'm back thankfully I make these videos with a live chat of people who know more than I do about this and actually I want to see this because what happened is yes lint exited with an error code because there were errors and if I'm gonna run this automatically through some other process like its exit status is one because there was an error in that other process needs to get that report so if I integrate this with some kind of other unit testing system or continuous integration framework I'm a good what are these things you know check your videos are asking the comments this is something that I actually want to see so unfortunately without setting up a rule but I can just see just I can just for a moment just as a kind of like hack for a second is I'm gonna just comment out my setup and draw functions and I am going to run this again and we'll see oh boy comments should oh look at the crazy ah oh look at this and oh it's a terrible idea these variables are assigned but never used and comments should not begin with a lowercase character and you know what yes lit it knows me better than I know myself because I agree I do not want my comments to begin with a lowercase letter although I do want an exception to that if I'm commenting out a bit of code although I guess ultimately in a sort of more formal open source project maybe I don't want to submit a pull request or something with commented out code but again it's kind of okay for me while I'm experimenting of commenting code I'm certainly not going to like do this because that would ruin everything so I have to think about that I might want to disable that rule but you get the idea I'll delete it let's just delete everything hold on I'm gonna do command X and I'm gonna say console dot log I'm so stressed out right now yes perfect that my okay now how do I do that automatic clear again oh no I'll just type clear because that's how I that's how I do it okay nvm run lint here we go oh I expected console statement no I should not have consoles David strings must use double quotes okay I reject yes when I reject your configuration let's go let's go see this video is my way he's like I can't we blur to be like oh what's new from the coding train today Oh a video about linting wait why is it two and a half hours long got like crazy person made it let's look for quotes in here so oh I don't quotes quote quotes quotes alright double wait where there should be somewhere in here oh maybe because it's getting the I gotta end this video and learn about how this stuff works single double so I wonder if it's getting it from es Lynch recommended like I wonder if some of these rules are coming from es lint recommended command K thank you and so let's let's get rid of that just for a second strings let's use double quotes no alright but fine I'll fix it oh it couldn't fix it command K right yeah there we go it couldn't fix it so I will fix it myself this big lint itself by golly let's get rid of the fix let's make it much bigger so you can see by the way this stuff can be problematic and you really have to be thoughtful and careful about what makes sense for your project in your workflow and if you are making a creative art project and you spend all day during your linting file and you don't express yourself through your code maybe that's a problem but as you after a while at certain point after you've worked on a project and have a kind of a first version you might go back edit clean up the code add some style conventions if you're open sourcing it so other people can participate in it timeout for a second so I'm just want to see if I've missed anything anything super you have to put the quotes rule in an array with error and single okay how to configure atom in order for it to live linting yes there's a plugin that you could do that if you tried vs code alright so I think I'm going to end this to wrap this up did I did I have I done anything that once I release this as a standalone tutorial that people will be very unhappy with because I can come back I think I should do a part two I'm gonna I think I'll release this let it linger and I'll do a part two based on what people get tips and things people give me in the comments okay alright so that wraps up this video about linting thank you for watching it's probably the next day now a night time if you started this video in this date time it's been so long I will be doing a part two and I'm sure I've made a lot of mistakes and missed some things and I want to really sort of think about what kind of configuration rules I want to set up for my workflow and maybe experiment with integrating with Adam or trying other text editors so leave your notes and feedback in the comments I'm I'm gonna wait at least a week before I do the part 2 so I can compile a lot of feedback and comments and then come back and do a part two and hopefully integrate this also with unit testing ok thanks for watching all right do you have to I love I love The Cranberries I'm so sad sad for The Cranberries now listen to music of my high school days by the way you can you can figure out how old I am based on that and I can't do it zombie and okay so what is what times it is eleven twenty I think at this point if the junks was got it right at this point I need to move on to the neuro evolution stuff that I want to do and so let's check in and that's mostly gonna have to happen this afternoon so let me just talk about the schedule if you're watching I am here right now for another half an hour or so I'm going to be attending a wonderful presentation by the amazing Kate Compton who is giving a present here in ITP and doing some other stuff and some office hours and helping students and things like that and then I will be back I hope by at 300 p.m. Eastern which is which will be about three hours so will be about a three hour break after I stop and then I will be livestreaming again only for about an hour and a half because I have a very very special guest who is coming this evening a huge inspiration for me someone who is really anyway I'm just really excited about it if you want if you want to know more this is a reason to become a patron of the coding trade because I discuss in our slack community about guest tutorials and even sometimes do closed live streams of the recording sessions with the guests but this won't be live stream but it will be published and released next week so stay tuned about that so so that's coming so I want to work on the neuro evolution stuff I don't think an hour and a half this afternoon is realistic for me to finish it but let's at least check in and let's try to let get the flappy bird game in shape for that tutorial where am I let's go to desktop oh I didn't even clone it okay so let's come back to flappy bird clone I haven't been looking at my email or notifications or anything so I don't know what's going on here there's more pull requests let's quickly clone this so I'm cloning the repo which means I'm grabbing it from github and downloading it to my computer but it is linked because if I say git remote V oops I have to be in the directory and if I say git remote V you're gonna see that the this remote the URL on github is linked to the keyword origin love to come back about all this stuff more let's run a server and take a look at what it looks like right now and try to merge some of these pull requests so this is currently what it looks like you can see so the things that I want to add are this pipe spacing thing is totally broken and I want it to visually look nicer so let's take a look at some of these pull requests and see what's come in since okay so it looks like let's let's just go in reverse order fix pipe digest to use correct height and start coordinates I think this one let's just try resolving this ourselves so this is what you can see here that's happening is what happened is this particular pull request was submitted before another after another pull request that I merged converted this old constructor function syntax to es6 classes so this is what was this is what is in the this the es6 classes branch up here and this is what's in master and i want to pick which one I want and I want this because I want hits bird and but I want the fix which is maybe this boy I can't I'm trying to I'm looking at the code over here on my monitor and which what do I want here what's the mistake what's correct the fix let's hold on a sec I think that I can go here and I what I'm gonna do is look here under file change so ah ah the height minus this dot bottom was incorrect in hits function but in the draw in the draw function it should have height this bottom here and not here okay so let's try that so now that I see that this should help me figure out how to resolve these conflicts so what I want is this here to go here I think and that fixes the hits function and this got fixed anyway didn't have a problem figuring that out and I've lost somehow this so I think that I I think that I fixed the I think that I fixed this merge again we'll see so I'm now going to a mark as resolved commit this and I don't have any unit testing or any linting which I should add and then I'm gonna say I resolved the conflicts I resolve the conflicts manually and I'll just reference the commit and I on github actually even though this is the URL for that commit oh I just deleted part of masters code so I did it wrong I got a notification it was a little bit too late I'll fix it I just wanted the at least the correct I'll have to go back and fix it fix it it's fine let's keep going with what I'm doing here and then I'll go back and fix it so but unfortunately it was correct so one thing I can do now is I can go here and really I think this is right isn't it this is what it looks I'm checking the diff now isn't this what I wanted it to be the lines 15 and 16 aren't correct so let's go oh okay really let's go edit we can add another commit to this branch what's incorrect here is it should this should be height minus this dot bottom this is me like this is like the laziest live streaming everything like I couldn't figure this out or I could just wait for the chat cuz I really trust this dot highlight is no longer set in the constructor ah I deleted that thank you that's what was wrong okay so it should be false thank you for that and then what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna go down and say correct mistake made when resolving conflict and this commit adds back in this dot actually you know what I think you by the way in the commit messages the the markup of doing things like this doesn't apply it doesn't render as far as I know this adds back in this highlight equals false which I deleted deleted by accident apologies to who is this who is this who's the original pole requester here are HBV and oops no no stay stay stay apologies to our HB v k leaf okay so I'm going to commit directly to this branch so that it's included as I merge the pull request and that should be good now the now the diff looks right I just got rid of that space that's still there and now I am going to go back to conversation and I'm gonna say oops I'm gonna say thank you and I'm going to merge the pull request and now we will let's let's grab those changes so those have come in here and let's take a look at it running again so that looks better running so slow it feels like it's running really slow in this computer okay all right so that that pull request is resolved all right so now let's look and see what else we got here great work in progress convert the project to yarn NPM and add linting testing that's wonderful I appreciate that let me just write a little note here thank you for this I'm going to hold off on adding adding this later as it is as it is not presently the focus of the tutorial and then reffering to reference sorry that you guys probably can't see a lot of this stuff I'm typing I'm gonna reference one two three reference referencing number three so I just want to like I want to link this to issue number three oops sorry that camera went off I want to link that to issue number three so that if anybody else comes who wants to submit a pull request for this idea they'll see that so I'm gonna say comment that okay great then I'm gonna go back and I'm gonna check out this train and background oh great alright now let's see what's going on here this this is great I guess there's the background this is the background that I want to include this uses the train image which is great uh one thing that I might suggest here I think I'll fix this myself is we could just use image mode center that would be so what I would normally do if I wasn't pressed for time as I might I might add a review and request I could say to use image mode Center but I think I might just correct some of these fix change that myself so let's this looks great so I've got so one thing that I might want to do is just check is just check that that this that this just check run this pull request now to make sure it like looks okay so what I'm going to do is I to do that oops I'm gonna say get remote and I really should make this into a tutorial you know we're gonna make this a tutorial about git remote alright okay all right here we go we're gonna we're gonna add a little tutorial this will go and get and github playlist yes yes yes images used elsewhere which would need to do the same calculation there okay so I might leave it you also you can just do get pull origin refs pull 15 head oh that is very confusing to me I don't even know so what I'm gonna do do you think it's a bad idea for me to demonstrate how to add a different remote and then like look at that branch I think I would like to do it my like a longer winded way just as for the sort of educational aspect but I'd be willing to told that like maybe I'm sending people in the wrong direction I don't have a lot of time here alright is anybody moderating the chat by the way seems to be some discussions that might need some moderation I can just do this myself I guess I won't I don't want to moderate the chat one that's really all right don't have anything discussing separate remote I don't think that I do Schiffman YouTube remote github branches cloning no I don't think I have a tutorial discussing remotes so let's do that oh whoops whoops okay all right all right I got to stop looking at the chat I'll move this over here hello this is another video which is a tutorial about working with git and github and in this tutorial i'm gonna talk about remotes so i I was I'm in the middle of live streaming and I'm working on this project that has to do with this flappy bird clone and I'm in a train and a bot using a genetic algorithm in a neural network to play flappy bird and I have a wonderful pull request from github user Keegan M who has added this particular image to be the flappy bird and this particular background to be the background of the flappy bird game and I really want to accept this pull request but what I want to do and I can examine it through the github interface I can see uh this was deleted and this was added because now it's gonna have an image and there's there's an icon variable which loads the image those are some things that those are some wonderful things like that that I want to accept but I don't have any unit testing and I um this isn't like hosted anywhere so I want to actually look at it locally on my computer to to run the code and sort of like see before I merge it and so there's a variety of ways that this can be done more efficiently than what I'm going to show you right now but this is a good excuse to talk about remotes so what is a remote so right now the my terminal window which I want to make a little bit bigger is in the directory of this project I'm on the desktop flappy bird clone if I say git remote that remote escape and V V for verbose like I want to know as much as possible output to be very verbose about the remote it's gonna say oh look you have a remote that is named origin that is tied to this URL and that makes sense that's my github URL coding train slash flappy bird clone that's the github repository and this remote was automatically created because at some point in time I said get clone and I put and I put this in so when I did this default remote was created so the remote being another location where this git repository exists now the word origin is kind of a default convention for the original remote but you know the sort of canonical remote being github in this case but it's just a madeup thing like I can say get room and I do this actually with a lot of projects I could say git remote delete I think origin nope get remote remove origin yes and now if I say git remote V there's no more remotes but I could say git remote add and instead of calling it origin why not call it github or unicorn I could call it anything I want let's call it github and then I can paste in flappy bird clone I'm just gonna grab this URL here and I can paste this in here and now I am adding this remote and I could say git remote B again and we can see there it is back but it's now called github so if I were it ever say get put pull origin master to grab some changes master by the way is this name of the like core branch is also just a completely madeup thing I could have source branch or release branch or development branch or experimental branch that's a separate video about branches that you could go and watch but if I say this it'll say ah origin doesn't appear to be positive because it's not there but I can now say git pull github master and there we go now I'm already up to date so I don't have to worry about it now here's the thing I want let's go back to this pull request which is once again from keegan m so where is keegan ends and we can see here ah keegan m graphics so keegan m made these code changes in a branch called graphics in their github repository so one thing i'm gonna do is i'm just gonna copy paste this right here is probably way i could link to it and i'm gonna go up to the URL and i'm gonna change coding trained to keegan m and I'm gonna get rid of the poor I just want to go over there and see that this is the Fork of the repository and so there we can see this is Keegan M's Fork we could see branch master we can see branch graphics I could start looking around now I'm going to do is I'm going to go to clone and I'm gonna grab this so I'm now going to grab Teagan ends a fork of my flappy bird clone I'm gonna grab that and I'm going to say git remote add Keegan I can make up anything here I'm just gonna say Keegan because I think I can remember that and I'm going to then paste in that particular URL for Keegan I'm now one thing you might notice I these URLs they get at github comm you might actually and this is because I have set up this very fancy way for my computer to be auto logged in using an SSH key in a passphrase but if you don't have that set up and I should do a video tutorial that explains how to do that you might want to use HTTPS this is also a way that you can this is just the sort of standard URL without having the sort of secret keys that log you in automatically but that's a little bit of an aside here I'm going to add this remote and now I'm gonna say git remote V and we can see look at this I have github remote which is tied to me coding train I have Keegan's remote which is tied to Keegan M which is kind of that get over puzzle kicking up now I'm gonna say there's a lot of different things that I can do but what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say get branch graphics I'm gonna make a branch locally called graphics and I'm gonna quickly go into that branch again you should probably watch my branches tutorial about how this works and I'm gonna go into that branch by using checkout then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say git pull and usually I've almost reflected Lee just get pull origin/master get Pro argent master git pull origin master git pull origin master git pull origin master but I don't want to pull from origin I want to pull from Keegan and I don't want to pull for a master I want to pull from graphics get pull Keegan graphics ah ooh interesting hmm so something has happened here in that I am now been launched into a text editor known as VI whoa this has been like way off the screen that's what's going on here that's crazy and so there's some sort of merging that needs to happen for Keegan M's branch graphics to come into my branch graphics because I actually have made some other changes it would have been nice if this didn't happen but this is actually quite normal this is a regular thing and I deal with this so what I would I what I want to do is say that I'm gonna say what do i type in VI so I think I'd say insert no I for insert I for insert so again you can link a different text editor to your get work on your computer but this is and so now but I've been launching this text editor in in man and I just want to say like I'm I'm making a tutorial video so I don't have a lot of time but this is here to merge Keegan's graphics with with some recent changes I made and and then I'm gonna say oops oh no I gotta get rid of insert escape maybe escape QW which I think will then quit and write this out I don't really know how to eat vim or whatever I know what to call it q w oh and I'm gonna just do that now not an editor command WQ write and then quit there we go and now it's fine it didn't commit it that's fine so now this is good I just really wanted to look at it all I want to do is look at it I don't need to commit this right now because I'm not really worrying about merging and so now I should if I come over here this is me like looking at my code in the browser before I checked out and pulled from that other remote and there we go look at this and now we have the coding train getting the flappy bird flappy coding train game with our little unicorn train and the scrolling background okay wonderful so this is good so now I feel I'd like oh this looks great I'm done so interestingly enough if I wanted to I could actually merge everything right now from the command line typically what I would do is I'm done I would just go back to here and I would say I go back to pull request whoops and I go back to code and train go back to pull request go back to Train and background version three and I would say all right Matt yeah unfortunately the trolls are out in full form today and we are going to have to we are going to have to edit this video first I am going to report no I don't feel a reason okay so I'm gonna be a little bit friendly today and I'm not going to report this but I will if it happens again I'm just going to delete the comments this one I'm kind of okay with because it's sort of friendly and funny but I think just for the purpose of the video I think I will remove it definitely won't report it because I you know and then I'm also going to I think I might just lock the comments for right now for a second I'm just gonna lock the conversation I'm just gonna say spam for a second I'm gonna lock the conversation this should allow me to still merge it okay so nobody can add any comments right now while I'm here okay so let's go back so normally I would just go to the pull request and I would scroll down here and I would just click on merge because and this would birds that pull grass in fact I've read a comment thank you so much I am going to merge merge this and what's wonderful about using github as a service which is very different than the get software itself the version control software is that it provides a visual interface to a lot of the common things that you might want to do like merging and looking at the differences between two files and that sort of thing but I think while I'm here if you can tolerate continue to watch this video however I am going to demonstrate demonstrate merging from the command line for fun so stay tuned I'm gonna add that comment it's interesting I lock them okay I'm gonna add that comment sorry I'm actually you're going to edit this also it's about to mention like oh it lets me add a comment even though I locked it but I don't need to say that in the edit version of this video okay they're really throwing me off alright so I added that comment and now I'm gonna return to the command line now I should say that I something about the way I really need to make a video about setting up terminal or whatever you use as your terminal application to work with get more effectively because there's no reason why I couldn't see things being syntax highlighted or showing me what branch I'm currently on and there's also like other terminal software like I term that I could use so I've got to come back for that but right now I'm just gonna say I got I got it I don't even remember where I am so I'm gonna say git status and I'm gonna say okay all conflicts fixed but you were still merging so I'm because I didn't actually ultimately commit that merge that I did so I'm gonna say git commit now here's the thing I have learned recently that you know you really that using em is not as thoughtful or so I'm gonna do a video about how do not use em and write more thoughtful longer commit messages but for lack of the time right now I'm just gonna say commit N and I'm going to say merging changes from and I'm gonna want to remember keygen em from keygen em okay I'm gonna do that so now I'm going to say get status again okay on branch graphics so now I'm gonna go to master and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say git merge graphics and what that will do is we'll take the graphics branch and merge it into master it's exactly the same thing that would happen if I press this button here which would merge keegan m graphics into master i'm just gonna do that from the command line git merge graphics okay here we go I'm getting some good feedback in the chat other things to mention yeah okay it's merged and now I can say get status I'm gonna say get status again I type git status all the time I'm on branch master nothing to commit working directory clean let's say git fetch which is just gonna kind of like go to my origin remote and see oh no remote repository specified oh okay let's hold on let's just that doesn't need to be in this tutorial I don't need to talk about get fetch because I messed it up with get origin so let me just make it record scratch back back up alright so now let me put these changes back right there here on master but they are not here if I go here we'll see like what's the latest commit it's still something else that I was working on so I'm gonna now say git push I'm not gonna say origin I'm not gonna say weird you know not to say origin because I renamed it to github master and if I do that now I have sent that up I'm going to hit a refresh here and I'm going to see look all of those changes from keygen em are now here we can see they're here background version 3 this was me merging this would be correcting the mistake this was some other stuff some other stuff we can see all of that is here now the real question is if I going to pull requests look at this where is that polar quad it's not there anymore github was smart enough to realize that I merged this I merge this via the command line so the merge button is gone and it is now enclosed wonderful so hopefully you learn something a little bit about get remotes and about merging in this video tutorial thanks for watching and I will come back and make many more of these working with git and github opensource tutorial thingies thank you a lock and comment still lets collaborators comment which is fine with me you could also do git reset hard keygen / graphics to change to be on their branch without code from your master ok that's a good point all right you know cybernetic and the chat rightz get looks so scary I would be afraid I'd accidentally merge the completely wrong file yeah you know the thing is it is a little scary the one thing that's kind of nice about git is very hard to really delete everything break everything you know rebase is a command that sometimes you can run into you know scary things with but if you're just adding and committing and pushing and pulling you can get yourself into a hairy situation where it's like I need help but I need to go to stack overflow I need to ask a friends I'd like get me out of this but it's very very hard for you to by accident like actually lose something so I would say go for it and don't be afraid to ask for help and don't be afraid to just try and if you're really worried just you know always like copy a folder into another folder on your computer so you have a like a kind of backup of your code but just go for it and don't you know hopefully maintainer some open source projects are going to treat you with kindness and a welcoming attitude which I definitely try to do and I would never you know someone's gonna submit a pull request in a weird way that's kind of like not the right way that I want for the project I would kind of give them friendly feedback and help facilitate them resubmitting the pull request so ok so I let I've got to go but let's see if let's see if there's anything scores and proper spacing so here's the thing I don't know that I need the scores for what I'm gonna do I definitely want the image pipe and I definitely want proper spacing again I think it would be helpful to have each of these things in separate pull requests so but and also now there's I can look at the conflicts here yeah there's not really there's just some conflicts from the background stuff from the other one I probably could figure this out but I don't have time right now so doc gute if you want to resolve those conflicts we can I can take a look at merging this fix typo what's the typo oh the YouTube video is wrong thank you this is one I can this is one I feel like I could merge without kind of worrying about I can see right here like look it's just in a code comment it's just fixing that so I want to fix that then what's this added this dot size to bird digest and improve the code for keeping the bird in the screen so let's take a look at this height minus this dot this is great this makes sense yep this looks good I think I can conjure I mean you know again I should probably do some more testing or have unit tests or like check out the code it one thing you can actually do that's helpful is in the description here you know if you have this forked into your master you can enable github pages and then put a URL to the your version running and I could just click on that and test the code that way that's kind of a nice thing to do I'm gonna just merge this while we're here so I only have really this one outstanding pull request which has some conflicts and let's look at the fight let's look at the changes here just to see what's kind of going on okay this so this shouldn't mark this should this is this is a good change to fix the spacing I don't know about this greater than equals versus greater then I don't want an extra space here oh I love having a pipe image that's great figuring out how to make this better is great it looks like some of the indentation there's a little bit different here I'm not sure it pass is pipe body sprite that's awesome to have thank you for this oh and also changing that so let's um so uh dog food if you want to read submit a fix some of the stuff I'm sorry I'm sorry that this was so convoluted I'm kind of learning how to do this as well and so what I'm going to do is let's just do I have everything that whoops Oh get pull github master I'm kind of rushing now I am going to I want I just want to do some stuff into the code myself actually I kind of have to go so I'll here's some pull requests I would accept I would accept I feel like for one thing is this running slow and or is it just my computer so anything anybody can do to like figure out this should run a little faster ultimately I'm probably not gonna use this image because I'm gonna run like but so the pipes need to be redesigned unicorn horns was a nice idea but also the pipes from Goethe is perfect I think this this I don't know why I guess I made it like this to appear like a sort of like phone but just looking at this on the desktop I think this should have a aspect ratio that's wider than it is tall probably the the the pipes look very skinny I don't know if the collision detection is doesn't seem to really be working so any improvements that people want to make and I don't know how busy I do need scores to tell the neural network how well it's doing that's actually truth so that'll be the fitness function so actually having a score in there is something I do need that's correct so actually I do want that so dude is in the chat I'm fixing those things for the third time during the stream I'm so annoyed so I really have to apologize this is my fault that's on me that that that all this stuff is getting kind of convoluted so I really apologize and I really do appreciate your you or contribution this now actually has no conflicts so I think I will go ahead and merge it and I can always let me just quickly look here everything so there might be some style stuff or some other little things to fix but there are no major conflicts and I do have this nice game over a game over function showing the score so this is great so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna merge this is it broken so I have to go to me I am see I don't know if you in the have a few minutes free bird died but if you could review have a couple minutes to review this the Anthony is a contributor to the website and has done work kind of maintaining and managing some of the code in the past I really appreciate their help so if you have a chance to look at this otherwise what I'm gonna do is while I'm in some of these presentations and and meetings I will take a look at that pull request it's great that it has no conflicts uhhuh and that gue writes I'm a chill so thank you for that but I really do I really do appreciate and I know that it can be frustrating when collaborating on an open source project to have lots of people contributing at the same time and have it not be clear what to do and that sort of thing so so wonderful okay I'm gonna go and hopefully we're gonna have this whipped into shape by I will should be back I'm hoping three hours from now if things go well I'll be back actually earlier than that the absolute earliest I'll be back I think is about 230 Eastern Time which is two and a half hours from now but so just stay tuned I'll at a time to the YouTube live page and I will see you all in a few hours if you choose to come back okay great thank me I am Sami has posted in the in the YouTube chat as well now I'm hoping that this chat is retained that YouTube has a new feature where the live chat now can be played back in the archive and for some reason it didn't work with last Friday's or sent a note to YouTube's support and I have enabled it in my like account but we'll see if it let me know if that's working or not working later today when the live chat the live stream is published okay everybody thanks for watching and I will be back for part two of today's livestream thank you
