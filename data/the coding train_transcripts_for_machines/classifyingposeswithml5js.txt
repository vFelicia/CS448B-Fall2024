hello good morning and welcome to the coding train with me your host Daniel chip I always feel so ridiculous doing this I you you may have noticed that I wasn't around last week live streaming that was because I was sick I had another lovely case of laryngitis but things think to have come back I'm able to speak I'm gonna try to limit myself to just a couple hours today which is really how much I should limit myself to always but sometimes things tend to spiral out of control and I'll suddenly have livestream for four hours wondering why but I will be back tomorrow so today whatever I do today will be in two parts so part one today and part what to tomorrow so first let me thank today's sponsor Lane Lane is a password manager I could not live without password management and it's something that you if you don't use a password manager you might consider checking out Lane and you can go to line.com slash coding train to get a free 30 days of lien premium and also a discount if you choose to purchase it so I'll come back and talk a little bit more about Lane later but I want to thank them right from the outset for helping make it possible what I do here on this YouTube channel I also want to talk about something near and dear and close to my heart so let me whoops that doesn't matter let me open up a web browser by the way this is a new computer and so I have not done anything really to set up this new computer I mean I set up my own personal log into this computer with my dev environment but then I this morning just created a coding train login and I've not set up the dev environment so that's something I will actually do during today's livestream which will either thrill you for it because you'll get to see some of these you know behind the scenes it shouldn't be behind the scenes it should be right out in the front of the scenes but it's a little bit of you know you might be wondering like well what are the visual studio code extensions you have installed and that kind of stuff so I'm going to go through that because I have to can't do anything without having gone through that and then that's one thing oh but where I was I was talking about I want to talk about the processing foundation so few things about the processing foundation so if you're not familiar with the processing foundation processing foundation is a US notforprofit 501c3 taxexempt organization we are a charity based in New York State if you're wondering about all the legal jargon processing is the entity that maintains these software applicants processing p5.js processing dot PI or Python version and processing processing for Android and then there's also it's very confusing processing for pi which is the Raspberry Pi implementation of processing so all of these different tools maybe you use them maybe you teach with them maybe you just been exposed to them because you watch them on the coding train whitebalance looks good on green screen maybe the folk sorry I business it appears that if I cannot I cannot keep my focus which might actually be true but what happens is I'm on a little thought and then I see out of the corner of my eye I had a message it seems important I start to read it and then I lose track of what I'm talking about and here we are let me double check the focus today I will be advertising the mud coffee let's put that here and see if I can focus on this coffee because it seems like I might be out of focus a little bit then I will come back and talk about the processing foundation oh yeah it does seem a little out of focus let's see let's see what that better maybe that is better tell me everyone if the focus seems a little better on me now hopefully it does and he'll have a sip of my bud coffee it is not a password manager but it will keep you awake I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping I think I have to I think I really need a no screens policy after 8 p.m. I've got a little bit of a Pokemon go problem should I not show you admit that or no processing foundation so I have been part of the processing project as a contributor or enthusiastic user of the processing since around 2003 when I learned about the project from some workshops that others had taught at ITP where I am currently and over the years I've been you know with each year that passes I've got a little bit more involved maybe to get less involved I don't know where the what the exact trajectory is but without the processing foundation and all of and countless hours of volunteer work and some paid work that's been generously funded through donors and other types of initiatives none of what I do on this channel would be possible so recently there is a new one of the one of the tools that I use probably the most these days is p5.js library so I'm going to the processing foundation medium page which I probably could have got to from from here there we go I might have gone to the wrong place there oh this is what I wanted to look at but I wanted to look at the East too so first of all if you're wondering what's the latest stuff going on with the processing foundation you should check out the the articles that are on medium and the first one I want to highlight for you is this article written by Lauren McCarthy the creator and leader lead developer of the p5.js project and I won't read the whole article for you but you can kind of get the idea here no no I don't need to sign in you can kind of get the idea here from the title making space for the future of p5.js so after seven years of developing and leading the project lauren is planning to transition out of her role as project lead in January 2020 and we are hoping to have a rotating model of leadership with a new leader every year and this would be a paid position so this is something we are currently act at this is something that we are currently actively fundraising for because this is something that is a question of can this project even continue how do you sustain a open source a healthy inclusive open source project and this is a constant struggle and there are no easy answers and I'm sure lots of projects run up into all the same questions and issues lots of people are working and thinking about this I encourage you to read this entire article written by Lauren McCarthy and if you want to if you have the means and Ken you know so part the reason why it's an open free opensource library is some of you watching this maybe cannot support the project financially and that's totally fine that's great that's what it's here for but if you can or you know somebody who can or there's a way that you can contribute or advocate for it in some capacity I would encourage you to donate and so I want to draw your attention to this other article by Dorothy Santos who is the project manager of the process of sorry program manager of the processing foundation and and we are running a fundraiser like a month I don't all the information is in this article written by Dorothy you will notice something here that might look familiar to you I don't know maybe you've seen more rows and the sort of like a little booklet or zine this looks like something that you might have seen on the coding train it's because as part of the fundraiser there are okay no I don't need to be interrupted there are rewards rewards from this is work by the artist Maya man these are raizo prints that you can get as part of your donation Kate Hollenbach and I'm gonna scroll down and find Saskia uh freckie she's told me how to pronounce her name I've drawn a little bit of a blank right now but I think it's for these I love I love all of you but I I have a affinity to these kinds of geometric patterns that are created with processing and p5.js and other but sigh who is the coding trained community manager who many of you may have come across in your communications with things around this channel of has been working very hard on a coding train zine so as of now this is exclusive to donations to the processing foundation you know I will share all the code and all the images in here are part of things that have been on the channel so but if you are interested this is something that I am working on producing and could be part of a reward with a donation I will also be doing my annual processing fun livestream fundraiser holiday fundraiser closes not tuned what playing a ukulele and making a fool of myself singing holiday songs with coding themed lyrics I will be doing that next week probably a week from today that's the date I'm targeting I haven't in scheduled yet oh but wait next Thursday or Friday or Wednesday so yeah I can't do it after the 20th I'll be away so that's my plan so actually speaking of which I need a maybe I don't know if violet is watching violet has been working on helping to maintain a lot of the community contributions and github repos associated with a coding train they are doing they're being so it's I'm so grateful for their help with this and if I go to github.com slash coding train I'm trying to think like where where where can you submit didn't I do like let's see holiday I feel like there was a repo last year for this having trouble remembering let's look oh wait I can type in here holiday holiday songs okay we could just use this still so I had a book of like holiday ukulele songs which were the songs that I had chords for that I could play I saw a YouTube tutorial about how to play last physical last Christmas I don't know about this Christmas thing I never I was not somebody who celebrated Christmas as a child you can make your inferences as to what sort of winter themed holidays that I my family celebrated Hanukkah I don't know why I'm dancing around the Hanukkah bush but but I love I have a love for holiday music as embarrassing as that might be and so if you have some songs you want to write the lyrics for provide me ukulele chords for or a backing track I will play about b3 backing track even you can submit that to this repo please I encourage you contribute to my time of making a fool of myself next week okay now so I've talked about the processing foundation I have talked I've thanked dashlane ah one other thing I want to mention let's go to their might be other things I want to mention but in my update on what's happening in the world of the coding trade Oh two things I want to mention so i one thing that i did recently hmm am I gonna be able to find this wait no okay I'm looking for here we go so I recently had was lucky enough to have my beginners guide to machine learning playlist converted to a youtube learning playlist this is a new feature I don't know if it's out of beta or still in beta but this is a new feature within the last Kevin Ware's launched but sometime in the last year which is allows for a little bit of extra organization of video content on YouTube in with more like a syllabus style if you will organization so you I just want to like a lot of there's nothing there's not well there there's some pretty new content here because I some of these videos just came out within the last week but what this is whoops is I've basically collected all of the videos where I'm using the ml 5gs library including my sort of introduction to the library the image classification videos the transfer learning videos this is a little bit of an aside but it's useful the canon classification videos the teachable machine videos the train your own neural network videos which is what i'm actually continuing today they'll go in a new section probably called pose poses working with poses i'm going to call it and then i a few different videos which touched on audio so they're here so you know if you are looking to sort of find and go through somewhat sequentially all of the javascript machine learning videos i have they're here now that's to say it's not actually all the JavaScript videos i have because there are a ton of them if you UPS know ah oh go come back pull my log in as i don't even know what's going on sleeping who can you hear that you cannot hold on everybody we're gonna have a little like random number ASMR no no we're not we're not I got to keep moving here welcome back to that later great channel here by the way every day I should check out every day I what am I looking for my home my channel what's going on your channel when my logged in ass no I'm uh oh I'm somebody else with no channel I have too many Google login it's such a problem this is my Daniel at the coding train calm login which you'd think would be the owner of my channel it's not some day I'll figure that out dark theme is on YouTube this is a log and I only use for logging and during my livestream so who knows what I'm subscribed to or what is recommending but how why do I not see the sidebar oh wait I do this there we go Oh Oh No I've saved this I guess oh no this is what I'm looking for oh this is the worst what I was saying is I have a lot of other videos on neural networks and machine learning but thank you David I will mention that there's a lot of other videos on machine learning they're a bit lower level and deal with a little bit in Python but mostly like programming a neural network from scratch and some other background math and that sort of thing so okay by the way this spring I I'm only just take your temperature on this I'm not gonna do a poll not gonna do anything scientific here but I am thinking of redoing this entire series which was recorded let's see let's look at one of these like vector video so first of all look how different I look I mean do you see any gray hair where's those stripes in the beard they're gone so this was recorded quite some time ago it was published on YouTube in 2015 but I think I even recorded these before that so it's 2025 years later I am thinking of redoing all of these videos in JavaScript along with writing updating the nature of code book so if that's the thing that would excite you let me know every day I can't we c'mon that is correct and again if I apologize for this for those of you in the member slack channel if you could remove the previews I can see very little of the history of the conversation I can see none of it as soon as there's like a big unfolding preview of something ok so there were other things mentioned there's the wheel there's the community contributions I think those were other things so let me mention the wheel we're actually before I mentioned the wheel David maybe you could point where I should go where's the best place for the discussion on that and let me go to community contributions so I know Simon always points out the videos that I never showed any of the communities on at this point I'm probably not gonna get to ones that are a big backlog and lists or something that I particularly want to highlight but I will at least show you the community contributions on the most recent coding challenge which was released yesterday or two days ago where I created I implemented the minimax algorithm to have a to play the game tictactoe so let's go to this first of all let's go to the live demo where I will now attempt to beat this player this computer that sick tactile by way you could like do some kind of cool gesture tictactoe game haha see that move watch this now I'm gonna go here haha here cannot get me okay got you oh oh so sad sorry coding train github page it's the most recent repo created so that was the challenge the X's are being played by the minimax algorithm if you're wondering what that is there's a 30minute video for you to watch and then there have already been Wow I have not been I did not look at this this morning there are one two three four five well two of them are from Simon so five unique people contributions already there's tictactoe minimax in Python with alpha beta pruning alpha beta pruning is not something I implemented as part of the challenge I alluded to it you know I I assume that this is not something that I can easily run here but I would encourage you to check out there's a David Snyder's example of this in Python it's nice this is wonderful anytime you're creating something if it's not something that just runs in the browser natively making a little gift including this part of readme is a wonderful thing to do thank you for that I'm going backwards for whatever reason reverse I ooh Oh Oh seriously Wow this is reverse I'm in Emacs with alpha beta beta pruning by copper France all right everybody ready for me to show my reverse eye skills Oh we stretch is it reverse i reverse see live LC new live LT I don't know am I am I going first what are these little dots that I don't I haven't played this game in a very long time oh okay well I guess I'm black is it giving me a clues of where to go or those are the only places I can go oh there's the only place I can go by the way I'm not thinking at all what I'm doing so please okay I don't think I'm gonna win this feel like oh the guy remember I played this in years the goal service to get the corners right reversed see I'm being told oh Kobe says their contribution is still waiting to be approved so Kobe I can maybe pull it up anyway all right all right whose is incredible I'm gonna play this on my own tie fighter thank you copper France for this I'm very curious to take a look at your code do something about my look at this wow wow so this is actually it looks quite similar looks like the whole game has been implemented here amazing okay let's keep going and go okay so Simon I know cuz Simon made his own video about this where he made a chess AI I'm just gonna go so so one of the things about the minimax algorithm is with tictactoe I always looked into the tree of possible outcomes all the way to the end of the game but there are some games I mentioned this in the video that are so complex you couldn't eat computationally visit every single possible move that could come from the from now to the end of the game so with something like chess you have to decide well whatever your heuristic is whatever your estimated way of computing the sort of score of the game at any given time how far down how many moves ahead do you want to look so I this second one from Simon has a customized a little search depth but let's just look at the first one and one thing I'm curious about Simon is did you implement your own version of chess or did you use like an existing chest library uhoh Loui mouth shall I am very sorry this one a my French is terrible and I shouldn't have done that tried to pronounce perversity in French tried not even a French or the origin game okay I'm curious did you implement your own version of chess or did you find an implementation of chess in JavaScript and then just add the minimax algorithm to it so we can see here that I assume if I do something like this and move my pawn and then move my other thingy you could see my chess expertise I'm gonna lose definitely gonna lose this is wild amazing to see Thank You Simon encourage you to play this I'm sure some of you who are sophisticated chess players will easily beat this AI but it is interesting to think about house house how good at playing the game can minimax be with chess let's go to tictactoe with alpha beta pruning so this looks very much like whoops this is very similar to my game and if we look at the code whoops source code what I'm curious to see is it really easy to see where the alpha yeah so you can see here in with the they function has for in addition to the depth has additional arguments alpha and beta which are keeping track of what the score is and allowing the algorithm to skip down certain paths down the tree knowing that there couldn't possibly be a better outcome there so Simon is saying that he used chess j/s for the chess engine and chessboard JS for the visualizer that's great so I wonder if that's something that I could actually tackle it's not realistic I think for me for me to program my own chess engine not without like a very long multipart series but certainly certainly doing something like what Simon did could be possible all right let's see if we can find Kobe's contribution oh it's already added Connect four Wow so Kobe looks like he added in emacs connect 4 and minimax connect 4 with alpha beta pruning once again I'm just gonna go to the regular connect 4 this is something I was actually hoping to do I'm gonna move here whoops whoops back it's a little bit slow there that's not where I meant to go let's go here do not want to give them Oh weird not what I expected ah no no bad I shouldn't go there that's bad move all right all right all right you get the idea everybody you've all had better ideas of what moves you dude this is great Thank You Koby for this this is pretty amazing it even just that basic algorithm I will the normal version is really slow showing the alpha beta pruning zoos so this would be so I guess from I'm gathering from Kobe that that Kinect for is a good example of there are so many more possibilities than tictactoe that having the alpha beta pruning really improves the speed so I that would be something that's worth me doing a follow up perhaps about yeah I can it feels much more responsive and quick now of course I think I just lost so thank you alright and then so thank you for those community contributions please continue to make them if you don't know how to add one there's some instructions and and and information here just file a github issue asking for help I will say that don't be intimidated by this amazingness and sophistication of these I want your community contributions even if all you did just change the colors of what I made to make it your own beautiful like rainbow themed tictactoe like I want to see everything that you do don't worry about getting things wrong or it's not cool enough not it's all wonderful in my eyes that you're watching these videos and making stuff and in particular something that some of you who are maybe I have a affinity for visual design or interface design you know you might I would welcome versions that clean up how the interaction is and change the way the game looks visually and those are exciting and wonderful to see okay so last update before I start actually doing some stuff here always good by the way I uh I think it's so funny that I always just type github flash website I think that's gonna get me somewhere coding train I don't know I don't know where I'm going just typing get up calm slash website coding train if I go to repositories it is the most recent topics wheel so let's see so David Snyder's not a lot here right now but big boots asks sorry to come back to just answer this question big boots asks hi big boots does it have to be p5 to contribute absolutely not I think though the whole reason for having the contributions is for people to bring to it something that they are excited to share and that might be I made a version of this in a different programming language that's wonderful the advantage of p5 is yours can be run easily in the browser but if yours doesn't run in the browser link to a video or a gif or some other kind of documentation if you can so it's easy to take a look darshan is asking me something about the community contribution for the regression challenge but it didn't work for an audio context problem hmm ah oh you mean it didn't work last time but now it does work sure darshan thank you for your contribution I will take a look at that where where do I the regression channel the regression video and regression based on node frequency and color predictor okay I don't know what to do so something to think about is to think about what that may be I'm just gonna figure it out oh this is very similar to my si si si ah this is just like my example so of course I know what to do oh and I get to like just draw stuff around that's so much better let's train it so I know oh I guess the stuff what happened this time I tried do we still have the audio context problem I'm sorry please everybody check this out I'm sure I'm just completely incompetent and not getting difficult to work correctly but when they almost say so one thing that I think is something for all of you to think about when you create interactive work to put on the web is you have to think about what context people are coming to it from now I know what keys to press because this is based on the challenge and in fact that's this is great this is being shared as a variation off of that example and if presumably someone's checking out has watched the video and so but the thing you could think about in terms of always having on the page some instructions or user test it with somebody a friend before you post it not have a thing could always help at least for classes ah okay but try this one more time c d e f i've got for train alright we've got to los people we've got a loss okay all right I think it's trained is what am I supposed to hear something oh it's the color oh that is so cool oh I see it's not sound it's color that is beautiful looking I can paint now I love this so I feel like the letters are kind of getting in the way of my experience with this because I love the fact that it's now this basically gradient over and did you do a regression with three different outputs you must have this is beautiful I think there's so much potential to this I'm sorry that it took me so long to figure it out and so I would think about maybe what you might consider doing is instead of having the user type in these letters which is I res what I did in my example but maybe there's a way there could be a color picker here and I could paint certain colors and then I could train the model and then paint over the space based on those oh there's so many possibilities and image processing and filtering and interact our this is wonderful thank you for sharing this thank you for that I get it right I really enjoyed I really I really think this is wonderful great work if you make if you update it or make any changes to it please let me know thank you darshan Belfer darshan okay and let me know if I mispronounced your name by the way can I just say something if I ever ever ever ever ever get anyone's pronouns wrong please reach out to me and let me know they make an effort to be thoughtful about how I refer to people on the channel but I'm sure I make mistakes and I want you to reach out to me and correct me and help me if at any point I've mispronounced your name get an incorrect pronoun refer to you by the wrong name please reach out to me any way that you know how to reach out to people on the Internet okay are we at 1040 we are so I've got about an hour and 20 minutes left I think what I'm gonna do is work on setting up the dev environment and then take a short break and start talking about and teaching you about Poe's net in the ml5 library and looking out about how to use Poe's net with the neural network classifier so we do the ASMR random number reading now though the one thing I want to do actually cuz it could be necessary later so I'm just gonna go to I should do this oh no no no this is this weird thing with a Mac where you go to like audio MIDI setup and then I create a multi output device because I want to go to the speakers and pro capture Pro capture is what is the capture card that's taking the signal from my laptop so now I think if I were to go to see what sort of meditation YouTube wants to recommend to me today how come you don't hear that no output multioutput device now you hear that okay sixty nine thousand two hundred and fifty one fiftyfour thousand four hundred and sixty 60 1634 31 seventy 1848 seventy two thousand two hundred and eleven fifty three thousand okay perfect that was me testing the computer audio my voice is still a little shot doing the best again I've got to really gotta get a lot of vocal rest if I'm gonna do this holiday song fundraiser next week okay so let's see what I honestly like I don't even know what's going on in this computer let me open up I term so ah okay I term is the terminal application that I like to use one setting that I really really really feel that I need I think it's under it's the one that like when you resize the font it doesn't resize the window does anybody know where that one is I also like to use reuse previous sessions directory I should really make a video about all these settings not that mine are any good parents I mean where is this one advanced no profiles general text where is this one I can never find this one and he's under general zooom but just window and changing font size there it is hate that setting okay because what I like to do is I like to be able to increase the font size well we've got a spam problem here in the chat unfortunately oh thank you thank you to the volunteer moderators or inevitably gonna help out with this sorry everybody why why why people why can't we just enjoy Thursday morning of coding live on the Internet I'm gonna try to do something about this as well I know like what did something I do something to prompt this there's so many people all of a sudden is it like a some kind of emoji army coming to DDoS what is going on why does this happen I guess I could turn me I should turn on slow mode IP ban all right all right everybody you'll get to enjoy the this dot song when I figure this out as always I always forget to dis stop this stop it stop just waiting for your instructions sorry it's gonna take me a minute to login the wrong account I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this star this star never forget to this start somebody composed that song for me getting to the place right thing I can enable slow mode YouTube changed so many things in creator studio I cannot find it where is slow mode oh yeah the worst is over all right well I can't figure out how to find silly slowmode anyway so here could I do it in the chat window itself ah manage monterrey for a toggle timestamps no analytics Viewer activity stream health there's no slow mode anywhere settings allow embedding live chat found it ok should I should I enable it or is it it's over now I guess alright I know where it is now so if it happens again I will enable slow mode slow mode would still be appreciated alright let's add slow mode I'm just gonna should I just do like five seconds between messages let's try that okay okay back to our regularly scheduled programming okay so the first thing that I like to do with my console setup is to install something called oh my zsh so first of all so there are different shell systems that people like to use I've been using zsh recently and then this oh my zsh is is essentially a theme which sets up various defaults and colors for knowing what github branch you're on and things like that in terminal so I'm gonna grab this little command here from the oh my z SH homepage I'm going to run it and now I am back to what I'm used to so this just shows me what it shows me here is a little tilde as the prompt you'll see in a little bit if I get into a github repo that it will show me more information about that and various other things okay now the next thing that I want to do is see if I have notes I have note installed that seems like a recent enough version now I'm pretty sure one of the things I like to do is make sure that node is installing global packages to a directory that's part of my user account rather than like down into the depths of the system files of the machine across all users and there's actually a really nice web page that gives you instructions for that and kind of looking forward I just look search fixed global permissions error NPM and then it's taking me to this NPM j/s documentation page and if you're wondering what's node what are node packages I would refer you to some of the other videos I've done that have gone through that but this what I like to do is put a directory and my my use at my user level which is what this tilde slash means called NPM global so let me do this then I'm going to call NPM config set prefix so it knows about this directory then I need to add it to the path the the path the path is an environment variable of your machine I mean it's different on different operating systems where it will look up where executables are for any commands you type in so I'm gonna add this as part of my path and then this in theory I don't know if this it shouldn't work right because I'm using zsh so I probably need to say source tilde dot zs let's just see what happens like what would this gonna do there right there's no such file so instead I would say source zs h zs hrc so that's the configuration file for my zsh bash so that should add this path export to that permanently that is now done and now if I do something like say npm install g HTTP server which is a node package i use quite a bit to run a web server it should work and i can even just go to hold on here and I don't see that NPM global because the Mac is hiding my hidden files but I think if I do this there we go shift command dot by the Soyuz phone a Mac at least will show all the hidden files and you can see now under NPM global that's where the node modules are that I've installed most notably HTTP server so that's useful to know now the other thing is I need to make sure do I have get yes it knows about get if I do like get config how do I tell it to like tell me what's in get config I know how to like set something show contents of git config git config list oh so all that's there who knows what this is just credential helper oh my goodness I'm gonna have to do so much here so first of all I need to set who I am and so to do that I can say git config global username Schiffman git config global how's it like email what is it get email what is it user dot email pretty sure this is the one that I use and get config task list there we go I'm lost in vim again all I know QQ that's what I use also I could say I could just look at the git config file which is there okay so that's done but what if I want to so one of the things that I want to do right now in order to do this tutorial which I'm barely going to get to today is clone the ml5 library repo and so I like to use an SSH SSH key and so I'm gonna set that up right now so I should like make video tutorials and all these things so I'm just gonna do it kind of quickly so let me see what happens that should give me an error maybe it's just gonna work right permission denied so I could get this to work by changing to HTTP HTTPS oh it uses less that wasn't vim I don't know anything and that was that was less not vim but so what I need to do is you know I might need to like not show you my computer screen for part of this but because I've got I don't want to but this is what I want to do so generate a new SSH key actually kind of check I don't have any existing ones will be impossible so this is what I'm gonna do I'm going to generate a key with this command for my email this is my I'm just gonna I think all the defaults are gonna be fine with me what's your opinion on whether I should use a passphrase I know I should use a passphrase but can I get away with no passphrase livestreaming you think I'm gonna try this no passphrase no passphrase oh no we have I just like allow people to hack things I'm not adding it to github yet all right so I feel like does this random art image can you engineer the key from this image that's showing me we run through these again oh I'm overwriting it I did that again but I'm overwriting it so you can't see that art image I don't know if that's a security issue yeah exposed okay now I need to add the key to my SSH agent and then I need to do this add that your SSH private key to the SSA Jade and store your passphrase in the keychain okay so that's done and now what I need to do is just add the SSH key to my github account so this is where I am going to unfortunately I think log out cuz I'm not log out but just to hide my screen and I'll show you but what I'm gonna do is I'll just show you what I'm gonna go to up here and then I'm gonna go to settings so I'm gonna I'm gonna hide my screen for a second click on settings and then I'm going to go to ssh and GPG keys and i'm going so on this screen I think that it's got my MAC addresses and various things so I'm not going to show it there could be oh it's only the public key that was shown okay there could be so I'm reading the chat I I should figure out a way to make a tutorial with like a dummy github account that would be a good way of doing this but I'm gonna press Inge new SSH key I'm calling this coding train login and then I'm gonna paste my key in by copying it so this by the way is how I can actually just say copy my public key and then I'm gonna go back into the github interface and paste it in and add it and I'm just gonna show you what I snow it's still got a like a MAC address or something there so I'm not gonna show it to you all right so that should be done and I'm closing all this if I did it correctly I should be able to go to documents whoops yes allow I'm going to make a directory called ml 5 and I'm going to say git clone and I'm going to go back to the ml 5 library and I am receiving the ml5 library okay there we go so the reason why I'm doing this is because I want to make an example that uses the ml5 neural network function finishing off this series this has been the stuff that I've been teaching this semester and if I go to the ml5 website go to the reference and go to neural network you'll see this is already a part of ml5 the current release and I have used it in examples but Joey Lee who is one of the contributors and has really been doing a lot of work this year and for the past year to manage lis the development of the library um has been refactoring it the neural network librarian has made some updates and changes nothing really changes in terms of the user facing aspect of the library but the behind the scenes have changed and so to make sure everything I'm doing is working correctly I mean there hasn't been a release yet I want to build my own version of the library that I can use for the purpose of this tutorial so you're gonna get to see a little extra thing about how do you build the ml5 library so first step was clone the repo that's been done now and I also want to find out I also want to look I'm already here I want to look at his recent pull request which is refactor and reimplementation of neural network because I want to know the branch so this is the branch that I care about it's not an image that's so weird just get up make that into an image or Oh like I can copy I can copy it okay that's what I wanted to do because so first of all you can see why I like oh my Z SH it's showing me that I'm in a git repo and that's the branch that I'm on I wanted to get check out this particular branch because I want to build from that brain do I need to is it already I guess it has everything and then now I'm going to go to the library page and follow the instructions for building the library which should be under contributing and it's pretty simple if you have everything installed basically the first thing that I've already done these steps like I have node and get and all those things installed I've cloned the repo I'm using an SSH key and now I'm going to change into ml v library I am there already I'm gonna type NPM install so this should take a little bit this is installing all the packages and dependencies that the library needs to be built so Simon who's commenting on various things that I need as part of my workflow I'm going to do things as I need them so I don't need a list right now is unnecessary because when I need live server I will install it okay so now that I've done this one thing I want to do is let me just open the source code for the library in Visual Studio code which I've already installed I haven't configured there might be some settings and things and one of the things that I really like to be able to do is type code from the command line oh and it worked I guess I already installed that at some point but I want to say code dot because I want to open up the ml 5 library so to do that if if that doesn't work natively on your computer if you're if you're using Visual Studio code come on there we go then what you can do is do shift command P which brings up all of these commands and then if I type in command install code command in path that's what you need to do so I really like having this feature because I can quickly from the command line just open a folder in Visual Studio code which I have now just done and what I reason why I wanted to show you package.json whoo so I'm definitely going to need to do change some settings let's change the font size to maybe better font size to 36 I'm also get packages of JSON again that's better so what I'm looking for is scripts these are all the things I can run NPM run commit NPM run prebuilt NPM run and the ones that I care about actually right now our NPM run start an NPM run build these are just aliases to a longer command web pack dev server web pack so web pack is a bundling thingy framework that does all of the work of bundling all of the source files into one JavaScript library file and I most often use p.m. I'm sorry envy a web PS npm run start because i want to run a web server that's constantly rebuilding the library as I make changes but in this case I just want the current version library so I'm gonna run npm run build maybe I'll make this a little smaller just so it fits in one line alright let me go so then when I need to figure out what Visual Studio code settings I want I go over to the coding garden to CJ who keeps track of all of the extensions he uses so let's see if I can find that coding garden vs code extensions mmm I think we know where this is coding garden just go to coding our website view the gear support could it be gear to stream no this is you this is super useful though ooh I need some of this stuff okay where where where where where where where search filter this by weight coding guard like like streaming goals is coded garden look how nicely organized everything is and there's like a custom search and a link it's just wonderful Koni garden does such a great job but they know where that is maybe it's on the github hooting Garden github let's try this yes code settings there we go looking for it we're at 1 hour Thank You Simon for that reminder I am getting close to my contractually obligated break theme I kind of am a default theme sort of person the thing that I want to know is style formatting beautify okay so let's use let's I the thing that I like the most is style and formatting so let's install this yes lint I want to have this okay then let's install beautify I don't know it's only got a four star rating only one hundred twelve ratings somebody telling me to stop now before I go forward I guess I can always uninstall it I think this is what I was using before as well I know there's something built in then something that I definitely want is save format on save code actions on save format on save so I like to have four it can cause you some problems but I like to have format a file on save let's do that I think the bracket colorizer thing is pretty cool too I'm a little bit afraid to install it because it's very visually noisy but I guess I could always disable it it's install it for right now so this is something that like provides a lot of visual information to see which brackets match up and parentheses match up with other brackets and parentheses it's got a lot of stars okay okay that's good and we can see so good is this still going oh all right so this this works so now we can see that it there should now be of new folder this I I didn't show this wasn't there before this is the version of the library that I just built and what I'm going to do it's because when I start making this coding example our over an hour into this livestream let's see can I get away with 32 here it's gonna be posing that example one I want to just use a locally uploaded version of the library and so I'm going to add the file I'm gonna drag that here so this is how I can now make a coding example with my temporary custom build of the ml 5 library knowing that by the time this video is out that this will be in the release so I won't be mentioning this in the edited version I'm just showing this now this will be closed and I will just be in sketch KS but I should be able to see console dot log ml 5 it's loaded the library I can see it down here okay any questions about what I have done so far yeah Nathan's thing I remember you had prettier instead of beautifier and I think that I did a prettier but I just I always just go with whatever CJ well one thing that I want to check really just as a quick technical thing is I've been recording with a new piece of software called V mix and I want to just see if oh no no no don't stop I'm gonna see sort of like a status report 202 dropped frames in an hour and 10 minutes my question would be is that significant I don't know we will find out I suppose okay well there's a lot of messages here alright so I'm gonna take a short break but before I take my short break I want to take a moment to thank today's sponsors my friends over at dashlane so you might be wondering hey I noticed you're logged in to the peopie web editor you can't even see that as as coding train and i'm gonna log out for a second and I'm going to show you how easy it is for me to log in just using dashlane logs me right in so Lea is a password manager I cannot live without a password manager and you're the

you can take a minute to sign up Oh before I take a break let me try to do something so sign up for now or just hang out listen to some music I have something I was hoping this thing that I have come in before before i livestream so I could use it dirt as an interstitial but it didn't so I'm gonna just give me a minute here cuz I'm gonna I'm gonna put something different on the screen during my break and I'm also I've lost the chat cup and I know there's not a lot of time left today this was a gift this a bit of a housekeeping livestream so let me see if I can how I can get to this it's gonna take me a little bit everybody it's gonna be worth it it's not worth it well what else am I gonna do it [ __ ] amongst yourself sign up for deadly donate to the prostitute foundation any of these things can't see my screen right okay everybody come to things like very important hold on everybody I'm almost there almost there mediasource baby Oh PS not read an MOV file shoot no why no why turn that off hold on everybody everything's gonna be okay so VLC can play mp4 why won't it play alright I failed the LC videos let's do this hold on alright never mind I have a nice little looping animation of this train and I was trying to get OBS to play it so that it would be there when I take a break instead just gonna be this back in just a few minutes I'm gonna get some water okay autotuned and the internet will fix that for me it's coordinates unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I really all right here we are again right there all right I noticed there were maybe some issues because the audio is coming through the mic and also is being sent out through the capture card and maybe there's like a lag between them so sorry if there's some weird music issues I would like to accomplish something today beyond my rambling mess and so let me tell you what I'm hoping to accomplish at this point by the end of tomorrow and we'll jump right into it tomorrow this is it's tricky because it's for me this is the end of the NYU semester so it's kind of like the busiest time I'm kind of exhausted if I'm being honest and but it's like a lot of stuff to like catch up on and finish up for the year and I can I miss streaming last week so I feel like I can undo all this stuff but let me so you might remember that I used I made a previous series and get my water here about this project called teachable machine from Google Creative Lab and when I did this series I didn't touch on this particular pose the pose model that you could train so let me just show you really quickly so for example what I'm gonna do is call this Y right now hold on so I'm going to record for 30 seconds and I'm gonna give myself a fivesecond delay and let me get rid of these and let's cord oh boy I need more room there's my why oh it's still recording this is my why 30 seconds is a long time I did not need to record for 30 seconds so pose net which is the machine learning model that is tracking all these points clearly this is not the optimal alright let's let's do an M and I guess I did 30 seconds before but it's just 2 15 seconds this is no good see this is a C not an M the point is you can train a machine learning model to assign labels to various poses and the data for those poses that I'm collecting are the XY locations of all these key points on a pose net skeleton and then if I were to train this model let's see how that goes well it's taking a long time oh hello everybody I did a pose project with the snake game right but I wasn't using so this is a really good point Abhijit is mentioning in the chat that what I so this is this is great so I actually want to reference that so I did different poses for the snake game but it wasn't actually the data for the the data was not the locations of the various parts of my body but rather the pixels of the image that it was seeing so in that sense as soon as I would turn the camera and have a different background it wouldn't work anymore but if I actually train a model with my pose positions then that would still apply no matter even if I like took took my laptop to a different location with different lighting conditions in a different background so this is one of the advantages of doing it this way okay all right I'm not going to keep going with this what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over to ml5 Jaso what happened to that sketch that I had open pose an example okay reference oops so by the way here's something that somebody could file as an issue for the ml5 website or even actually fix this by just clicking edit this document this should be a link to this should be a link to this actual blog post real time human pose estimation in the browser with tensorflow j/s and in addition to it actually being a link for accessibility this is a we know one of the principles of accessibility in particular for users of the web who who use a screen reader is when things are linked with generic language it's not as helpful as if there is information about the content in the in the text that is linked itself so this should probably say something like the original post set model was ported to tensorflow j/s by dan Ovid you know read more at and then the name of the article real time human posed estimation in the browser with sensor flow Jas or something and actually linked the name of the article so if anybody wants to do that pull request right now you I would do that here live but I've already spent enough time doing random other things you can actually get to it from clicking edit document okay but I'm gonna go to that blog post I'm just gonna look at yeah I'm just gonna remember just looking here always returns an array okay okay okay so I'm looking I wanted to find something I just want to be able to reference the training data kind of assuming that it used cocoa this is more information than we need for this first of this video sorry to say oh right there's a version 2.0 actually belief the training code is closedsource so I don't actually know what it was used what data was used to train I was hoping at least would tell me the data set somewhere here but I'm not seeing it Oliver is pointing it's an hour and a half already we didn't start I know I know this is the this is just what's happening this week for me thank you for your patience I'm just gonna go forward okay okay alright let me add to this example is that how it works create capture video create video capture I can't remember okay it's definitely this and then let's do okay this is gonna be better anyway because the square was a problem okay oh I should get an external webcam I have an idea oh you know what I will get the external webcam for tomorrow when I come back to finish this Wow okay this is what I'm looking for okay all right here we go I'm going to make a video tutorial about pose net and I'll have accomplished something today hello and welcome to another beginner's guide to machine learning with ml 5gs video I in this video I'm going to cover the that was my one start over option hello and welcome to another beginner's guide to machine learning video tutorial in this video I am going to cover the pre trained model pose net and I'm going to look at what pose net is how to use it with the ml 5 chess library with the p5 just library and track your body in the browser in real time that's my statement of what I'm gonna show you thank you for editing you I used to say like that'll be edited out and that would be interest in all my videos and now no really that's better or not I just realized that the whiteboard camera is not on come on whiteboard camera how does this look oh boy this camera is like crooked right by the way one thing I did is I hopefully fixed the white balance of these cameras and they are that's better now the white balance is yeah the white balance is fixed now so it might look off but at least it can be color corrected later and it won't like auto adjust okay model I want to look at is pose net and with what this camera is so much lower than what I wrote that at a very reasonably normal height can't see it at all so weird cameras got lower somehow I'm not sure what oh it's pointing down a little bit that's fine oh you could see my almost see my legs I'll fix that later I know it got the sniffles all of a sudden the model I want to look at is pose net Mathew we'll do our like speeding up as I draw stuff I love that I love that even if it's just like a little bit the model that I want the model that I want to look at is pose net with any machine learning model the first question we should ask is what are the inputs and what are the outputs and in this case let me start the whole thing over I got I got it again I know what I'm doing now everybody model as I mentioned that I'm looking at is called pose net with any machine learning model that you use the first question you probably want to ask is what are the inputs and what are the outputs and in this case the pose net model is expecting an image as input and then as output it is going to give you an array of coordinates in addition to each of these XY coordinates it's going to give you a confident score for each one and what do all these XYZ and what do all these XY coordinates and confidence scores correspond do they correspond of course pot my voice is cracking I'm sniffling it's all going going downhill fast people and what do all these XY coordinates and confidence scores correspond to so I'm like I should use an external webcam you know what I have right here a camera an external camera should just send this in to pose that and then track my but whatever I don't know how to get this into p5 yes all right and what do all these X Y coordinates correspond to they correspond to the key points on a pose net skeleton now the pose net skeleton isn't an anatomically correct skeleton it's an arbitrary skeleton that involves let me actually just do that again now the pose net skeleton isn't an anatomically correct skeleton it's an arbitrary set of seventeen points on the human body that it is looking for and you can see those listed all right here from nose all the way down to right ankle and each one of these gets an X location a Y location and a confidence score to talk about this is the craziest last remember I don't know I have some pretty crazy live streams when you see the full body all I'm gonna just add something here later for this match and I will add something yeah I mean we can add something good I'd be done oh come on energy people energy now the pose net skeleton isn't necessarily an anatomically correct skeleton it's just an arbitrary set of what is 17 points that you can see right over here from the nose all the way down to the right ankle that it is trying to estimate where those positions are on the human body and give you XY coordinates as well as how confident it is that it's correct about those points let me make some footage here so this can potentially be used actually maybe I won't do this right now I'll do this later now the other question you should always ask yourself when you're working with the pretrained model is who trained the model what data that they use to train the model and what are some of the pitfalls that might arise based on how the process of collecting that data exactly I just want to like let me let me let me say this one more time also whenever you use a pre trained model one of the things life I started by emphasizing that when you use a pretrained model you want to make sure you understand what are the inputs that are expected and what are the outputs the other thing that you really want to think about as you go to use the model is how is this model trained what data set was used to train it how is that data collected who collected the data and is there any reason why you might not want to use the model based on that data that was collected maybe the data wasn't oh I forgot that I'm livestreaming to the public sometimes I just do these for I didn't really forget so as you do these recording sessions like this way just go I'm trying saying the same thing over and over again I have to like stop myself from doing this I'm gonna move on all right well I started by emphasizing how when you're using a pre train model you want to look at what the inputs are and their corresponding outputs but another thing you really want to think about and do some research is how is the bottle trained who trained the model what data was used to train the model how is that data collected and what are the kinds of questions that you want to consider around those details that might lead you to I got this sentenced exactly the way that I want it good acting thank you Chris Abhijit has to leave physics exam ghosts go study for your fits exams take that don't don't don't watch this nonsense of me repeating the same sentence this is I'm trying to get this right because Mike this tutorial is really not about the the law that's big the story around data collection for machine learning but I want to emphasize how even if you're just kind of quickly using pose debt for an interactive project it's important to be thoughtful about these questions so this will be the last time I don't think I need to say this thing about how I began another thing you want to consider when using a pre trained model is to be yeah something else you want to consider when using a pretrained model is who trained the model and what I understand how people are writing best teacher ever when all I'm doing like not getting anywhere one other important question you should ask yourself and do some research about whenever you find yourself using a pre trained model out of the box something get somebody else trained just who trained that model why did they train that model what data was used to train that model and how is that data collected suppose that is a bit of a unique animal in the pose that is a bit of an odd case because the model itself the trained model is opensource you can use it you can download it there's examples for it in tensorflow in tensorflow Jas and ml5 jazz but the actual code for training the model from what I understand or what I've been able to find is closed source so there aren't a lot of details koko dataset a data set that is commonly used for training models a data set that's a data set that's used often in training models around images is Coco are common objects in context and it has a lot of labeled images of people striking poses with their key points marked so I don't know for a fact whether Coco was used exclusively for training pose net whether it was used partially or not at all but your best bet for starting point for finding out as much as you can about the pose net model is to go directly to the source the github repository for pose net in fact there's a pose dent 2.0 coming out and there also is a wonderful web there also is an excellent blog post called real time human pose estimation in the browser was tensorflow j/s that was written by Dan Ovid that was written by Dan Ovid yeah I'm just that was written by dano fed with yeah that was written by Dan Ovid with illustration with thank you I read everybody's so nice in the chat today thank you your best bet for doing some read yeah you should also make sure I would also highly suggest you read the blog post realtime human pose estimation in the browser with tensorflow JS by Dan Ovid and editing and illustrations from Irene Alvarado and Alexis gallo so there's a lot of excellent background information about how the model was trained and and about how the model is trained and other relevant details okay now no humans of it yeah although I want to say one other things there we go and if you want to learn more about the koko image data set I highly suggest you check out the humans of AI project by Phillip Schmitt if you want to learn more about the KOCO image data set I also would point you towards the humans of AI project by Phillip Schmitt which is an artwork an online exhibition that takes a critical look at the data in that data set itself okay now most likely if you most likely if you're here the reason why you might be interested in pose that is because wow I can make an interactive project that just knows where my hands are my shoulder is and and anybody can walk up to and interact with it I could do body tracking in real time in the browser with a web camera and yes in fact you can so that's what I'm gonna show you code wise how to do right now and the easiest way to get started with that from my point of view is the p5 web editor with the p5 library I have a basic sketch that's just opening up a connection to the web cam and drawing the video right here and now I'm gonna add the ml 5 library to it so I have the mmm mmm yeah take deep breaths it helps speak without stuttering whoo I got a little dizzy there now for you in many cases if you're interested in Poe's net it's just because wow I have an interactive project I want to make and I can but anyways now for you watching this video my guess is you've arrived here because you want to make something an interactive project with gesture with body tracking and pose that is a really quick and easy way of doing so in the browser okay twelve o'clock okay was a little more time if you found your way to this video most likely you're here because you're making interactive media projects and PostNet is a tool that you could use to do realtime body tracking very quickly and easily it's it's frankly pretty amazing that you can do this with just a webcam image so one way to get started which in my view is one of the easiest way is with the p5 web editor and the p5.js library which very so i have a sketch here which connects to the camera and just draws the image in a canvas you also need to make sure you have the ml5 library imported that would be through you also want to make sure you have the ml 5 J's library imported the most recent vert you also wanna make sure you have the most recent version of the ml 5 GS library imported and that would be through what is it that you a script tag that's what I'm looking for you also want to make sure you have the ml 5 GS library imported and that will be through a script tag in index.html and will will create up create something that'll just go on the screen therefore that once you've got all that setup we're ready to start coding so I'm gonna create a variable called pose net I'm gonna say pose net equals new pose net oh no new no none of that I'm gonna say I'm gonna say pose net equals ml v dot pose net so all the ml 5 functions are initialized the same way by referencing the ml 5 library dot the name of the function in this case pose net now typically there's some arguments that go here and we can look up what those arguments are by going to the documentation page here we can see there's a four rut here we can see there's a variety of different ways to create the post here we can see there's a variety there's here we can see there's a few different ways to it here we can see there's a few different ways to call the post net function I just want to give it a video and the way I want to do it actually isn't even listed here I just want to give it a video and a callback interesting here we can see there's a few different ways we can call the post net function for us I just want to do it the simplest way possible I want to give it the video which tells the ml 5 pose that function that I just just I'm just gonna keep going give me a second I'm gonna stop stop I'm gonna stop stopping every two seconds I'm going to stop stopping stop stopping just gonna move along here here we can see there are a few different ways to call the pose net function I want to do it the simplest way possible I'm just going to give it the video element and a callback for when the model is loaded which I don't even know that I need I'll make sure there's no errors and run this again and we can see pose net is ready so I know I've got my syntax right I've called the post net function I've loaded the model hoes that works a little bit different the way post that works it's actually a bit different than everything else in the ml5 library and it works based on event handlers so I want to set up a pose event by calling this method on on pose I want this function to execute whenever the pose net model detects a pose then call this function and give me the results of that pose whenever I can add that right here and set up pose net on pose and then I'm going to give it a callback called got poses and now presumably every single time it detects suppose it sees me it sees my skeleton it will log that to the console right here so this is working I can see it logging it here so now that it's running I can see the all these objects being logged let's look gets let's take a look now that it's working I can see a bunch of objects being logged let's take a look at what's inside those objects Oh p5 web editor so while the p5 web betters builtin so while the p5 web editors built in console is really useful for basic debugging sometimes what I want to investigate all of the details of a JavaScript object I want to open it so even though the p5 web editors so the p5 web editors console is incredibly useful for basic debugging but sometimes what I want to investigate the depths of everything that within a JavaScript object I find it a little bit easier to look at the native console itself so I'm gonna do that right now and so I have the chrome I have the developer the browser developer console open right here I'm just gonna stop the sketch from running let me stop the scheduler I've stopped the sketch from running and I've zeroed in on one of these objects that's been log to the console and I'm looking at the built in browser console here and we can see that gives me an array so what's in the array every single pose that it detects there could be three or four people here is an element in the array and each element of the array is an object with multiple properties there's a pose property and a skeleton property let's look at the pose property first whoops why is it huh what it's just my browser broken oh is it because I stopped the sketch and it doesn't know what it is anymore yeah there we go do this let me turn to us again all the way once again from the top dan dan dan the p5 web editor console is super useful for basic debugging but but sometimes when I want to look at the depths and investigate everything that there is with a particular JavaScript object that I'm logging it's a bit easier to go to the developer tools of the browser itself in this case I can get to them through a quick key command or just in chrome View developer JavaScript console I don't need to say I'm not gonna include those details sorry once again from the top it's time pose net time on the coding train the console in the p5 web editor is incredibly useful and for basic debugging but certainly in this case I really want to look deep into the internals of the JavaScript object that is the pose and so for that I think the builtin developer console in the browser will be easier I can get to that really easily and I'm just gonna pick any one of these and here I've got I've got one to look at so we can see it right over here it's uh each one of these things as an array with an object in it that up yeah could you start over I just got here last time I swear for months yet poor me toward you watching this I can't believe I'm gonna say this again the p5 the p5 console is very useful for your basic debugging in this case I really want to like dive deep into this object that I'm logging here the poses object so in this case I'm gonna open up the actual developer console of the browser I could see a lot of stuff being logged here very very quickly I'm gonna pick any one of these and unfold it so i can see that i have an array and the first element of the array is a post there could be multiple poses that the model is detecting if there's more than one person in this case there's just one and i can look at this object it's got two properties a pose a pose property and a skeleton property definitely want to come back to the skeleton property but let's start with the pose property it can unfold that and we can see oh my goodness look at all this stuff in here so first of all there's a score so i mentioned how the that with each i mentioned that with each one of these XY positions of every key point there is a confidence score there is also a confidence score for the entire pose itself and because the camera seemed very little of me it's quite low just at 30% then i can actually access any one of those key points by its name knows left eye right eye all these all the way down once again to right and right ankle so let's actually draw something based on any of those key points we'll use my nose so I'm gonna make the assumption that there's always only going to be a single person if I if there were multiple people I'd want to do this differently and I'm going to make if I'm gonna good stop I'm gonna make a variable called pose then I'm gonna say if it's found to pose and I can check that by just checking the length of the array if the length of the array is zero then pose equals poses index zero so I'm gonna take the first pose from the array I'm gonna take the first pose from the array and store it into the global variable but actually if you remember the object in the array has two properties pose and skeleton so it seems there's a lot of redundant lingo here but I must say poses index 0 dot pose actually let me just do this well I did oh I see it was fine yes poses index 0 dot pose I this could be a good place to use the confidence score like only if it's like of a high confidence actually use it but I'm not I'm just gonna take any pose that it gives me then in the draw function I can draw something based on okay then in the draw function I can draw something based on that pose so for example let me give myself a red nose so now if I run the sketch ah so I got an error so pose could be first let me take out the console.log this is a lot of extra stuff for it to do ah so I got an error so why did I get that error the reason why I got that error is it hasn't found to pose yet so there is no nose for it to draw so I should always check to make sure there is a valid pose first if there is a valid pose then draw that circle and there we go I now have a red dot always following my nose right Thank You Nathan yeah people are pointing out Nathan is pointing out that sometimes when I'm going into the JavaScript console I can't find the data anymore it's because when I stop the sketch it does exist in memory anymore it got cleaned up so okay all right so now we have this so as an exercise if you're falling along you know pause the video right now and then add two points for your hands and see if you can have like dip two different circles that are following your hands did you get that working you're all at it for you whoops I forgot what it's called oh there's no hand wrists it's the wrist and your right wrist left wrist okay sorry if you're following along if you're following along pause the video and try to add two more points where your hands are now there isn't actually a hand a key point it's a wrist key point but that'll probably work for our purposes I'll let you try that how did that go okay Ivan added for you now let's see if this works those were bad should probably pick shoulders so one thing you might notice is this is working terribly why is it working terribly because I'm not showing it my full body so most likely this goes back to how the date oh how whoo this is working terribly think I'm almost kind of getting it right and there we go but why is it working so poorly well first of all I'm barely showing him only showing it from my waist up and most likely the model was trained on fullbody images take a minute here now I turned the camera I should probably now I turned the camera to point at me over here and I'm further away and you can see how much more accurate this is because it sees so much more of my body I'm able to control where the risks are and get pretty good accurate tracking as I'm standing further away from the model noting model as I'm standing further away from the camera we can also do so there are also some days tricks we could try for example I can estimate distance from the camera by looking at that there also some other interesting tricks we could try for example I could estimate distance from the camera by looking at how far apart are the eyes so for example here I'm storing the right eye and left eye location in separate variables and then calling the p5 distance function to look at how far apart they are and then I could just take that distance and assign it to the size of the nose so as I get closer the nose gets bigger it you almost can't tell because it's sizing relative to my face but it gives it more of a realistic appearance of an actual clown nose that's attached by changing its size according to the proportions of what it's detecting in the face we just look at the pose again now forking for convenience I was referencing each of those you might be you might be asking yourself well what if I want to draw all the points all the points that it's tracking so for convenience I was referencing each point by name right eye left eye nose right wrist but there's actually a key points array that has all 17 points in it so I can use that to just loop through everything if that's what I want to do so I can loop through all of the key points and get the XY of each one and then I can draw a green circle at each location what did I do wrong shoot oh it's got a part in a position good oops so that code didn't work because I forgot that each element each key point is more than just an XY it's got the confidence score it's got the name of the part and a position so I need the key points index zeroes position X pose key points index I dot position X dot position dot y now I believe this will work and I'm gonna turn this over here I'll stand back over here and we can see now I'm drawing even if I get my leg up into the picture I guess I hurt myself can I get a full body picture people I'm gonna make this happen we're slack here weigh it down a little bit and here we go I only think I'm not seeing are my ankles oh it's not there we go I got kind of accurate there my pose okay so you can see I'm getting all the points of my body right now standing about probably six feet away from the camera okay hold on everybody where's the why is the skeleton blank let me look at the example that drawers a scout oh it's just not this is awkward hold on is it drawing the skeleton oh yeah it is interesting how why does it only sometimes do that that feels like a bug to me like why not just draw all the connected I guess it's based on the confidence but all right so um er I did do this in a previous stream let me I'll explain that in a minute I'm doing this again though because the previous stream I did this is like this one well over an hour it was using a previous iteration of the library so I don't have a nice succinct video tutorial for Poe's net which is why I'm making this okay there's one other aspect to the data and I haven't shown you here it that's fine there's one other aspect of the data that I haven't shown you here and that's drawing the actual skeleton in a lot of the demos that you see there are lines connecting the different points now you could just build your own lookup table of which points are connected to which points but pose that will dynamically sort of like make guesses as to which points should be connected to which points based on like how you're standing I guess so and why why is there a separate skeleton thing why wouldn't that just be like a permanent like these things are always connected like the shoulder is always connected to the elbow that doesn't make any sense to me I guess right like with the Kinect you just know which points it like why is it not just like a permanent lookup table why is the skeleton something dynamic relates to the threshold doesn't have to do with the confidence scores it must be all right I'm just gonna say presume somebody will correct me there's one other aspect of this that I haven't shown you yet so if you've seen demos of pose net and some of the examples the points are connected with lines so on the one hand you could just memorize like always draw a line between the shoulder to the elbow and the elbow to the wrist but pose that what I presume is based on the confident scores will dynamically give you back which parts are connected to which parts and that's in the skeleton property of the and that's in the skeleton property of the poses object that it returns when it gets results and that's in the skeleton property of the poses and that's in the skeleton property of the object found in the array that was returned to us so I could actually add a new global variable called skeleton we've been good for Halloween skeleton equals and let me just stop this for a second poses index 0 dot skeleton hold on it's gonna look up how's this work for every there's a 0 and a 1 part a and Part B okay fine I can loop over the skeleton why do I don't keep closing that I can't memorize it yeah that's what every and skeleton is actually a twodimensional array because in the second dimension it stores the to the and skeleton is actually a twodimensional array because in the second dimension it it holds the the two locations that are connected so I can say a equals skeleton index I index 0 and B is index 1 and then I can just draw a line between the two of them so I look at every skeleton point I get the two parts Part A Part B and just draw a line between the X's and Y's of each of those make it a kind of thicker line and give it a the color white and let's see what this looks like and there we go this I guess about you you can edit back and forth between these two shots since we're recording to both and there we go this is my pose net and we can actually like even like side do them or something and there we go that's the full and there we go that's pretty much and there we go that's pretty much everything you could do with the ml5 pose net function right this is what I'm gonna mention this so for you you might try to do something like make a googly eyes that's something I actually did in a previous video where I looked at an earlier version of pose net and you could also look at some of these other examples that demonstrate other aspects for example you can actually find the pose of a JPEG that you up that you load rather than images from a webcam but what I'm want to get to is what is but what I'm looking to do with this which I'm going to get to in the next video but what I want to do which I'm going to get to in a followup video to this is not take the outputs and draw something but rather take these outputs and feed them as training data into ml5 neural network what if I say hey every time I make this pose label that a Y and every time I make this pose label that an M a C and a you see where I'm going could I create a pose classifier I can use all of the X Y positions label them and train a classifier to make guesses as to my pose this is very similar to what I did with the teachable machine image classifier the difference is with the image classifier as soon as I show it a different background or I've one the difference is with the image classifier soon as I move the camera to a different room with different lighting and a different background with a different person it's not gonna be able to recognize the pose anymore because that was trained on the raw pixels this is actually just trained on the relative positions so in theory somebody around the same size as me swapping out it would recognize their pose and there's actually a way that I could just normalize all the data so that it would work for anybody's pose potentially so you can train your own pose classifier that are worked generically in a lot of different environments so if you make something with ml5 pose net please share it with me and so if you make something with ml5 pose net or with pose that with another environment please share it with me I would love to check it out you can find the code for everything in this video in the link in this video's description I'll see you in the future oh okay all right everyone it's 1240 this this is it I can always come back so tomorrow I'm gonna do the classifier tomorrow I probably will livestream around the same time 10 a.m. so stay tuned for that and there you go I'm so exhausted I'll take a few questions if people want to ask I'm gonna stop all the recording and up start uploading that stuff it's actually you know what for posterity sake I'm not gonna stop it yet I will I will do that when I can all right any any questions any notes anything anybody wants to say speak now or forever hold your peace peace peace I'm holding my Peas hey the last after lunch oh yeah so I did do this previously in this for of code to answer all MERS question in that hour of code livestream but what what what the ml five library didn't have was the ability to access the key points by their name in such an easier way entry point into doing this that totally this tutorial is a little bit better will I ever do slam I mean not anytime soon but it's certainly something that interests me so someday maybe can you start streaming a half an hour earlier please I'm not so sure it's vens on my schedule tomorrow it's the morning for me so I need time to get in and get set up but maybe will you make a deep learning tutorial ask code bulletin so I would say that I I mean far be it for me to know exactly what it is that I'm doing but I would say that I have a lot of videos that touch on deep learning concepts all throughout the channel they're a little tricky to find but see what you can find and feel free to reach out on Twitter or otherwise if you're if you're struggling to find assignments asking about generator functions I have a long list of things to get to and it's I just have to try to prioritize and do what I can the best that I can micki poses as it can you use the camp thing to control a game like the Kinect so yes this pose net is very similar in terms of its tracking abilities to what the Microsoft Kinect product us what's very different is that's a depth sensor that has a lot more information about the scene so it's able to do probably I would guess more accurate tracking and in particular it gives you depth information as well how about making a sign language gesture classifier using a lowres stream opposed net currency that's a terrific job idea and I'll point you to abhishek who created this project making amazon alexa respond to sign language using AI i'm not i actually don't know if he used a post net for this he might have actually just used transfer learning and images but it's a wonderful project i would encourage you to check out related to what you're asking about so why why me and ask what's the purpose of this livestream I've really conflicted about this because why not just make short tutorials so this is what I'm doing my goal if everything goes went well today this post that tutorial oh when Matthew works on it as it will be fifteen minutes or less and I just ideally I would record the edited stuff I don't know but people seem to enjoy seeing the longer versions in the live stream it's not perfect but that's what I'm doing right now is YouTube your main job it is not my main job is working as a teacher at here at ITP I forgot what I thought was the other thing I wanted to mention if you were in New York City the first ever ITP show in Brooklyn is happening this Sunday and Monday Sunday December 15th 2 to 6 p.m. Monday December 16th 4 to 8 p.m. the winter show of all this is where I teach this is my main job and I will be doing a livestream either Sunday or Monday probably Monday but maybe Sunday from the winter show I'm using ml5 feature extractor helper to load and train mobile net model with my own data set how can I save the training data in this case nest Beshear that's a good question I don't think ml5 has any builtin functions to save your training data it definitely has a function to save the model so if you want to save the training data you might have to do something custom for that I have to think about that more but you you can certainly save all the images or you could you could pull out the features and save the features I don't know there'll be a great discussion on the ml 5 nonexistent forum I guess on the github right now all right everyone I appreciate you I will be back tomorrow against my better judgment but I would do want to finish this project hope hopefully tomorrow will just be two hours because I have a lot to do and take care of with the show coming up live stream from show and the processing fundraiser in addition to the holiday songs so I mentioned the holiday song thing but probably more importantly is you know now I'm on a third or fourth year doing this one year I did like snowflakes I don't remember what I did the other one year I did trees like fur you know your standard holiday thing that has a tree involved with it so what could I do this time for us like a winter themed bunch of like coding stuff please suggest it in rainbow topics and then what we can do is create a label like why don't I make a label right now there's the holiday telephone label already I guess we could just use the same one let's just use the same let's use the same label so please suggest them and I will try to like upvote you can also up vote thing up vote them by oh how there's a lot here okay I'll take a look at these ooh Northern Lights using pro noise so I'm going to do some coding topics during the holiday livestream please suggest them here not here okay I did snowflakes both years Nathan yeah if you can make it to New York City Brooklyn you can run audio for the live stream chaos equations I've done those okay uh procedurally generated machine learnings to know people who look style get maybe I could do train a runway model off something wintery themed I'm definitely gonna do that okay goodbye everybody see you next time on the coding train la I'm still here
