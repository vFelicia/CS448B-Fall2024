check 1 2 3 sorry about that I didn't realize I had the volume down very low this is my sound check of my voice how are the levels can you hear me and is the balance between me and the get started in just about 2 or 3 minutes hello happy is a Thursday I am really having trouble keeping track of what day it is welcome to the coding train with me your host Dan I'll just take a deep breath just take a big deep breath together ready I don't know where you're watching from this from where in the world you're watching this I don't know what your circumstances are what you did what time of day it is what you did this morning this afternoon at night how you slept any of those things but all in all I would just like to know how are you doing are you doing okay I am based in New York City specifically in Brooklyn New York it has been quite a week of chaos here if not a month or a year or the last however many years whoever you want to get started do you hear that noise by the way I want to talk about that noise in a second but things are a little quite in flux in the city here specifically where I work where my day job is at New York University do you hear that sound I would like to know maybe you can't hear it hmm I'm gonna wait for that sound to finish but by the way that is literally the sound of somebody washing their hands and I'm not kidding just you know there's a lot of I don't know irony or humor there you gotta have a sense of humor sometimes though it's important to take things seriously and follow science or now Noah dancing around the topic that is on my mind which is what's going on with coronavirus and specifically New York City and New York University so nobody's saying they can hear that sound oh yeah I hear it says DT six let me address that a second so New York University has cancelled all inperson classes and events and meetings there's a lot of other changes going on in the city of New York itself this has caused a lot of us who work at NYU to have to change our daily routines to revamp our curriculum to think about different things I am a person as you might have noticed who happens to do a lot of online education Edel adjacent stuff on the internet so in many ways I am set up well to engage in experiment with remote education but I would say that I think it is something very different to be caring for and teach at caring for a class a cohort of whether it's six students or eight or 12 or 16 or 20 or 50 or a hundred even which is quite different than this sort of livestreaming thing on YouTube there are relationships and the things I do on this channel I hope are resources to people who are teaching courses that they can create their community their local community of their course around but I do think it's it's a I want to be careful about suggesting that oh it's time to do remote education that's a thing that I do already it's not I do a kind of remote education and maybe a lot of it's filled with like way too much nonsense but but yes so I don't want to I don't want to belabor this story there is a huge amount of stuff to say on it I am not qualified to prognosticate and predict the future I'm just kind of working with what I need to do today and I think actually some of the changes that are happening based on looking at reducing the spread of the virus will probably ultimately open up a lot more time for me to livestream or make video tutorials but actually what's happened to me this week is I'm having a lot less time because there's a lot of things that need to be changed I'm spinning up actually a couple new classes for NYU there's just a lot of meetings and not to mention like my son's school closed he's actually having classes with zoom software at home he's in fifth grade and so you know I don't have to be there with him right now because I have that covered but that's it's a the puzzle pieces my daughter school is still open but the puzzle pieces of family and all that kind of stuff are become enormous ly complicated but I wasn't minted managed to stick to having a live stream today I started about a half an hour earlier than I originally intended and I have to leave absolutely 100% at 330 which is now about one hour and 50 minutes if I can still do math on some level loud think I want that noise to happen again so bizarrely I was in here the other day I actually was making a quick video tutorial for how to do video conferencing with zoom which I might try to do some more of that on the channel itself but it was loud noise and I thought you know we did shop there's something sorry I hit the Bell by accident there's a wood shop over there and I thought it's weird that I never hear the wood shop and all of a sudden I'm hearing it today so I'm drilling and I heard it again and hurt again and oh maybe there's a construction going on this building Mabel's construction then uh later I was like I need to you know go to the bathroom do it number one I need to wash my hands I need to wash my head a lot so I went in to wash my hands burn when the water comes out for it so right now during this live stream if we hear the sound bar I mean somebody's washing their hands and we should applaud them applaud them for washing your hands for not touching your face now it could be something we could code today a hand face detector but I don't want to be do I don't want to make light of what is an incredibly complicated and difficult and lifechanging for many people situation right now so that's all I have to say about that I'm going to move on to back to my sort of like usual programming which is a lot of this stuff with today's episode of the coding train you have 1/2 day early pi day thing ok whoa this is getting warm in here oh good touched my face all right uh we should let us let us now also transition to reading the ceremonial book of random numbers things are a little ominous these days so we're gonna have to do it fortynine thousand five hundred fourteen fifty six thousand nine hundred seventy seven sixty one thousand ninety one okay oh boy Friday the 13th is tomorrow okay you know I did I already probably told my Friday the 13th story when I was a little young lad along last lassie laddie whatever whatever is you say that I had a boo boo boo bad boo boo on harder than 30 I don't want diarrhea no live stream from a year or two years ago somebody will find me so um this Saturday is March 14th also known as pi day 4 3 3 1 for being the 3.14 being the first digits of pi i off I have in the past done a live stream on pi day I actually was supposed to travel this weekend I am no longer traveling this weekend that trip was canceled so but I don't know what I'll be doing yet this weekend and I I almost am sure I won't be physically here in this building on Saturday so no Pi Day livestream unless I spend something up from home or something like that but I thought what I would do today is a coding challenge related to PI so it would happen today during this live stream in the next hour and 45 minutes or so and then machiya and I would work in the next 24 hours or so to edit it down to it's sort of like core essential components which would then be released as the pi day coding challenge on Saturday so that is my plan so that's what happened today now either some people been asking the thumbnail it says things like OBS basics another see chapter 3 because I guess turday and I woke up this morning I was like I want to talk about livestreaming and how I could use open broadcast studio record a lecture and I'm a nature of code I'm gonna be in chapter 3 so I could do a little bit on nature of CO chapter 3 the time the time the time the time it got compressed I do want to really think about and maybe come back next week and focus on are there a set of tutorials that I can do to help teachers specifically who might be who who might be doing remote learning might want to record a video lecture are there things that I that that I can make some content about to help people so specifically if you're a teacher and there's like a thing I would love to hear from you or if you have ideas for me let me know and maybe next week you know a lot of a lot of the what people are doing with remote learning is realtime interaction and questions and feedback and smaller groups and that's not something that I really actually have a lot of experience with when I have experience together this much more like oneway broadcast although it there is sometimes like a chat and different things but but I would like to offer some resources one resource I do want to mention let me just try to find it for a second because there have been a lot of people putting together just hold off sometimes I can't talk and search by the way I have a question my kids say search it up like who who won the World Series in 1967 hey Dad just search it up is that a thing do people say search it up or did they invent Sega search it up and now it's a thing that people are gonna say because I'm telling you you could say search it up today Kenny it's sketchy trust me but maybe it's already a thing and I'm an old old Internet man who just says I will search for it but now I'm gonna say search it up I'm searching something up and I can't concentrate well on sir did it up I'm doing I don't have my password looking it up searching it up okay I found what I was looking for I searched it up alright so this is a lot of people been putting together resources and there's a slack channel that I know exactly Berman had put together for people teaching online in the age of Cova 19 but Melanie Hoff who is one of the organizers of code societies at school for Porter competition and alum of the ITP program and if you don't if you don't know her work you should check out her work but she put together this really excellent arena compilation of all sorts of resources for people who are teaching online so I just wanted to highlight that you can find it at arena slash Melanie hoff slash teaching online so I would like to come back and add and and maybe if there's time left over at the end I will answer some questions some nice questions came in on Twitter and maybe next week I can make this the subject of an entire live stream but today I will be doing my PI day challenge Oh Oh silly me silly me the thing that I'm searching up is available playlists no private liked videos I gotta search it up okay the other thing I want to mention is that I am deep into whoops whoops that shouldn't say one it should say why I got to fix this I can fix this I'm working on a entirely new set of nature of code videos in JavaScript with p5 these are renewed urgency Ruiz that I made almost eight years ago at this point or actually eight years ago and so if you're new to the channel expect a lot of new videos to come out related to this you can actually see they're all there already so if the video has a thumbnail that kind of all that means as well a thumbnail was made a description is there I made sure the code is online it's linked but if you want to kind of get ahead you can see all of these videos are there and then the forces of the chapter two has started as well so one thing that I want to say about these videos that some of them are unlisted and some of them are listed especially if a video is unlisted and there's a significant mistake or issue with it please let me know because if it's unlisted it's very easy for me to delete and reupload a fixed version if it already published video it's harder for me to do that but if there's a real significant issue I will do that okay I'm also gonna have to sing oh my ukulele tuners battery is gone we have to do some pi day singing maybe today eating of some pie who knows I'm out of sorts people out of sorts I searched it up but I couldn't find it Chris ray asks are you going to remake genetic algorithm chapter uh not probably no you know no I don't think so so the genetic album chapter is actually something that I revisited more recently so there might be some added videos or I might swap in and out a new version of one of those videos but for the most part that's going to be can stay what I made a couple years ago but I do have some ideas for some additional ones all right so the first thing that I want to do is I want to find myself a text file with 1 million digits of hi let's try this this is good 1 million digits of pi just going to have to trust that this file is correct let's put it on the desktop and I want to find a 1 billion 1 billion digits of pi I don't think I want to try with twenty two point four trillion that would be nice tied at 1.5 billion this looks like it might be good oh here we go PI billion this is gonna be a much larger file right is gonna download it effectively let's do it this way okay this file is almost a gigabyte and I have about two minutes left to download it ok ah recording twodisc time start recording and multi quarter I am NOT going to record to disk the whiteboard view which I think you are now seeing I'm not I don't have my preview up anymore because I keep moving things around and here we are over here okay let's see does the whiteboard actually working it is there it looks pretty crooked to me I'm like skip using the whiteboard today we'll see so this is my plan so fathom information design org maybe no oppai de fathom comm probably no all right fine fathom pie pecan pie dot info fathom dot info / pie this is where we are hi I am dot info and in case I did forget which I did forget lend me also before I get started coding say thank you to glean org the sponsor of today's coding train live stream I will so brilliant is a wonderful website and app and all sorts of where you can learn a lot of stuff and by the way if you need to learn things remotely these days this is a really good tool for you to use but they have some new courses that I'm excited to share with you and I always have a daily challenge I always love to do brilliants daily challenge and that's something that I will be attempting about halfway through this livestream okay now and if it wasn't clear if you want to take a look at brilliant go to brilliant dot org slash coding train and that will let them know that you found this from from here and it will also get you a 20% off even you can sign up for free but if you're interested in the premium subscription you can get 20% off through that URL the first 200 people to do so okay so I want to make my own yeah Thank You Simon so though I know that's one of the reasons why I don't want to use the whiteboard today there's something going on with the lighting in this room what I am interested in attempting to do is make my own version of this wonderful peek inside pi web application that was created by fathom information design and so if you don't know about fathom it's a wonderful design firm cuffs started by Ben Frey who is one of the creators of processing itself and so here what I can do is I can look for any sequence of digits and find where they occur in PI so I'm gonna type 1 4 and we're gonna see if there they are it's the first digit of pi and so if I keep searching there we go but use their 1 4 1 5 9 but instead of 2 1 4 1 5 9 6 and it was found as the 731 thousand of thousands 406 digit of pi so this is good for us to find because I now want to recreate this exact thing I'm going to load in a file with 1 million digits of pi and then I want to create an interface where I type this in I'm gonna have to say all this again but I'm getting myself set up because I'm gonna do that I'm gonna want to create an interface where I type this in and I want to find where if that sequence exists in the number of digits of pi that I have and if so where and while I'm going to this in JavaScript while I could just use the built in index of function I'm going to write my own search in a string algorithm because um once I get to 1 billion digits am I going to run into performance issues and so here it is this was one of the spy day suggestions and in this suggestion there's also another website I think that's actually where I downloaded the digits from it looks like but there's also other algorithms one known as Boyer Moore which I actually have never heard of until I saw it posted which may be which optimizes this kind of bruteforce search so I don't know if I'm gonna have time to actually implement this and yeah hash and yes is asking that's crazy you can't load this PI file into the browser correct so I will be using a node server once I get to the 1 billion digits ok so this is the plan and I'm gonna I would like this to be all one video so all of that explanation unfortunately for you the live viewer I'm going to kind of read start hopefully say it more succinctly and then just get to coding and hopefully I'll be done by an hour and a half from now take a short break about a half an hour 45 minutes from now and then this will get edited and put together into a video to be published on Saturday any questions so many questions ok what start this over got my p5 sketch peak in PI 1 billion digits PI search page I take challenge all right okay um I think I'm ready bill hem is asking why is he not using processing for this good good point good question I could use processing for this I feel like using the browser so I could do this in processing I could do that as a followup video I'll mention it that's it that's actually a great question okay mmm here we go shake it up shake it off shake a wee little we got happy pi day welcome to today is this year's 2020s coding train pi coding challenge and i thank you to fatima Bemis who suggested this idea find a sequence in pi so this is the challenge I'm going to take on for this year's Pi Day I'm saying the same thing many many times I get one chance to start over one time I get to start over now used I I used the ukulele last year this will be more just coding coding coding okay hi day hello welcome to 2020 pi day coding challenge thing that I'm about to do oh I really got to get going because if I keep restarting this we're gonna be a big trouble because I have to no matter what leave at 330 there's no and I mean when I say 330 I mean I mean so I should really be saying three I really gotta leave by 330 okay happy pi day it's 2020 this year's pi day it's today and I would like to do it's not really today cuz I'm recording this couple days early but I would like you to see this on pi day a coding challenge themed around the number pi and thank you to fatin Bibi's who suggested this one pi day find a sequence in pi issue number one for 64 if those numbers are where they are in PI who will find out by the end of this video how to look at how one might search for any given sequence of numbers in PI this can lead to a lot of other things like what if those numbers were encoded as music or what if music was encoded as numbers or if you took a text a message and encoded those numbers could you find secret messages in PI melodic phrases in PI there's so many creative possibilities that you could create from my code I'm gonna do something really really basic now I'm in this suggestion this particular website I'm an geonet slash pi is mentioned it has a bunch of different resources a resource of where you can download all the digits of pi a place to search for pi but i this this whoops and it point edit point this is what's going to be edited out it'll be funny if we actually keep that in c ah meta meta this all reminded me of a wonderful project from fathom information design so if you don't know about fathom their information design firm based in Cambridge Massachusetts founded by Ben Ben Frey who was one of the creators of processing itself can find out more at fathom dot info but they created this project peek inside Pi which you can play with at PI fathom info there's also an app version a lot of the versions I'll link to all those things in the video's description so the idea here is that I can type I could tap can I tap let's see if I can fake it looks no the point is for any given sequence like one four one five nine look I can search for it right here and there it is it's found at the first digit of pi so now let's pick another sequence like what's a wonderful sequence it is today's date is March 14 2020 and that is not in the first 1 million digits of pi ah if we had more digits I must have more digits so this particular web app is searching through the first 1 million digits of pi and that's what I want to create first let's just try this so the number 0 3 oops 0 3 1 4 2 oh 2 is available is found Simon's Simon's Simons interrupting my flow you're interrupting my flow with all the at mentions we all the only really urgent at mentions please but he doesn't Simon does have a great suggestion did it to do good I'm told that I should search for the number nine nine nine nine nine nine which is the 760 second digit of pi so let's remember that and make sure when I write my own version of this that I find the same digit so I'm gonna do this at Fir I'm gonna do this with p5.js JavaScript the browser I'm it's not gonna be as nicely designed with a beautiful interface like this but I'm first going to recreate this exact thing and then and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go from 1 million digits to 1 billion digits and see if I could still search for edge in PI and probably I'm gonna fail because we're gonna need some kind of like optimization it's gonna only run to slow everything's gonna come crashing down but I'm gonna try nonetheless and we'll see where we get to by the end of this video and I should mention just in case I don't end up covering it there are optimal ways to search for a string to search for a string inside of a larger string and one of those algorithms called the boy or more algorithm and so depending on where I get I would get to the end of this video I don't know why I'm talking about this now it's not the end I'll know where I've gotten to depending on where I get to that might be something that you could also do as your own as a contribution when I know that could also be something that you do as your own contribution on the coding train com itself by making a optimized version of this alright okay here we go let me just put this in applications I'm starting with a simple p5 sketch and two text files one with 1 billion digits of pi which is just a megabyte and one with 1 billion digits of pi which is a gigabyte that's a much bigger file so let's start with the one megabyte file I've uploaded it I've uploaded that file to the p5 web editor and I can load all the text from that file right now using preload I'm going to just take away animation here I'm going to get rid of the draw loop and I'm gonna say no canvas and then the file itself has all of the digits of pi in one line buttload strings loads text files into an array with each element of the array being a different line of the text file so what I'm going to do here is create a variable called digits and just say it is the first element in that raw data array let's console.log digits and just see what happens okay so all of the digits of pi are down here in the console now what I want to do is search for a given digit let's make an interface a very very crude simple interface for searching so now I have this tiny tiny search box up here can I make that bigger this is one of the things I hate give me a second here this is one thing I don't love about using the web editor because can i zoom an iframe can I just make that bigger can I do it with the CSS I don't want to go crazy here if I do something like just say what is it like text size or something I don't know CSS somebody tell me how to put some global CSS font size okay no that seem to work but I didn't make the text file do I need to do it for like input hey there we go perfect that's probably bigger than I need there we go that's plenty visible now okay I also just added a like I also just increased the font size for any input element on the page so it's a little easier for you to see but that's you know the interaction that I'm looking for is anytime anyone types anything into that search box I want to look for that string that that those digits in PI itself and p5 GS has a special event function called input which you can call on the search box and pass another function that will be executed anytime a change has been made so let me write that search it up function because that's when I was looking for something I say search it up and then I'm going to be a little silly and make these global variables and I'm going to then then let me get what I'm searching for from the search box and console.log that so now whenever I type anything into that search box I should see what I type here in the console and that's working this is gonna actually be a really easy project to do you know why because I could just use the index of function in JavaScript to tell let me do that real quick just please please guys real quick I'll bet you that real quick digits index of search so this is saying look inside this search string and give me back the index of where oh no no this is saying look inside the long string digits and give me the index of wherever this string search happens to appear if it doesn't appear I'll take a negative one please so I'm gonna say create let's make another element on the page and No how do I make that people I don't know CSS at all help me out here the leaf it's making it red when it's wrong font color no color should be collar right I mean I could make a background color that I know will work no oh this is wrong oh I need another that's a wrong number of digits I'm the worst I'm the worst there we go okay yeah just don't so now when I get that index back I can say index P dot HTML that index which will put the actual index where it's found in the paragraph text there on the webpage so for example if I say one four one five nine hmm why does it think two so really when counting the digits of pi what seems to be the convention is the first digit is the first digit after the period so it's three point the first digit is one so I should really say index minus one and now one four one five nine I got one and then what if I say nein nein nein nein nein nein I got 200 all right so we got it man nine nine ninetynine appears at the 760 second digit in pi I'm also going to write a little if statement here say if index is greater than well I guess if I'm looking for three if that's a bug so if I'm looking for three that's a zero which minus one how do I do I want to handle that bug index of must let me start searching from a certain character right start from index great so if it's a three I don't want it to find that zero digit so I'm gonna start searching from index to and there oops great so I guess I hope that's right but a 3a doesn't appear until the chat is also rightfully pointing out that I could just chop off the first two digits of the string it would be much too easy I'm gonna do it this way so I'm gonna start from looking at digit two and I'm going to say as long as index is greater than zero set that otherwise say I'm going to say otherwise I'll put a message about it not being found okay so let's try one four one five nine nine nine nine nine nine nine not found so I now have essentially without the care and thought into the interaction design the visual design the layout of the page all of those elements recreated my my own version of this peek inside by I got this videos not over them I got two more things I want to do number one is I want to just investigate what does it mean for me to actually perform this search myself to write my own index of function because maybe if I do that might unlock some other creative possibilities and also I might learn something about programming and then once I do that let me increase things up to 1 billion digits and see if this still works which it won't and I'm reading the chat I shouldn't be reading the chat let me increase things to 1 billion it's and see what happens what breaks down once I have a 1 gigabyte file that I'm loading all the digits of pi in as opposed to 8 1 megabyte file right so let's first write our own index of function so I'm just going to change them to comic this out and I'm going to say let index equals index of a search in this string for this search string okay so search in the string digits for the string search and so the function looks like this it's named as an ex uh it needs to receive a block of text and the substring that you're searching for in that text okay I'm thinking about this let's say we do this let's start with what's the first character in the search string then I want to iterate over the entire string of text and say hey does this character in the entire string of text match the first character of the search string if so I need another loop with J starting at I plus one well actually let's do it this way let's bending to loop through all of the characters of that search string I don't have an error here bad assignment Oh they supposed to say four so I don't need to start at zero because I've already checked to make sure that's zero and I want to check is text car at I plus J the same as search car at J again I'm I'm not worrying about running this optimally or elegantly I just want to get the core idea out I'm starting with and I really should use the whiteboard for this do I dare a whiteboard is all like weird and shadowy this light for there's like a nice bright light that's always been in this room that is very dim today is it oh you can't even see that that's of sad 3.14159 let's say I'm looking for the string for one five so in the example and building this is the text let me just start over okay that person is I feel like a water they should be riding the water a little bit longer I would kind of short what comes after the nine people is it I hope it's so let's say this is my text and what I'm looking for is I want to find out where is 4 1 5 in that particular string this is my search sorry my watch is buzzing at me and I am going to turn that off okay okay uh I'm a jolly happy person I'm not actually bothered by anything I just like to play act okay so this is my text and this is my search string what I have going on here is I know the first character of what I'm searching for is four so I the index I is starting here and looking is that for as that four is that four is that four aha this is for now let's let's save our let's save this spot and then based on this length three which let's let's iterate over this length with J zero one two and let's add j2i zero one two and see if all those digits continue to match okay so ultimately really what I'm looking for here is any things any of those digits that aren't the same so I really want to look for first I'm gonna be very strict about this and use the triple equals there's a funny thing in JavaScript if you haven't encountered this before where if I use double equals this will return true but if I use triple equals they won't so it's a little like double equals is a little bit of a fuzzier truth and triple equals like no no no no those things are really really really really equal fuzzy or equals I guess I don't know if that's necessary to explain I can probably edit that out and then I'm going to say not equals so basically I'm I'm going to make a I'm going to make a guess that I found it right as soon as I find that as soon as I find the first character as soon as I find the first character be the same aha I found it and then any time I find any need to be different I can now say found equals false so the question becomes right here if found is true then I can break out of things and once one is not true I don't need to check the rest so I can break out and then if found return what so I'm gonna say let found index equals negative one I'll give a default value of negative one and then actually if I've found it right here found index should equal what I wherever we started with I and then a little bit lost in terms of all the loops going on here and then if I've gone through every possibility and I haven't found it then I'm gonna get to the end and I'm still just going to return negative one but found index will have negative one so if I found it somewhere I'm gonna set it equal to that first index get out of the loop I don't need to check anymore because I just looking for the first instance and then return what I found I must have made a mistake here somewhere right there's no way this could be correct and I'm gonna add a third argument for offset and I can say and just as a really quick hack I'm just gonna start at index equals two to skip the three I mean whatever let this is fine let me just start it ah let's run and see if this works No found is not defined sketch line 22 this if statement has got to be inside here right this is where I'm looking at every single character in the large string I'm searching through as soon as one of those characters is equal to the start check every check all the subsequent characters and then if I found it break out of that larger loop and keep going so that this should be right now I'm sure there's other mistakes but that will be fixed all right one four one five nine at digit number one which is right weirdly enough I didn't subtract out the one anywhere right so the chat is giving me a nice quick optimization that the chat is give me a nice suggestion where I could simplify this code where I don't actually need this found index because I could just return I which will automatically break out of the loop and then if I get to the end I could just return negative one so let's try that again yeah why is that one shouldn't that be zero one shouldn't that be getting to oh I'm already subtracting the one there great great so this works let's try the 999 thing there we go so this is done and this algorithm has no problem with 1 million searching and a string of 1 million characters be interesting to think of what is the try it different number twothirty excellent I'm gonna be taking a break soon I'm trying to think Oh Thank You Simon about the noting the thing about brilliant I will check that big onotation one thing I'd like to think about here is what is the Big O notation for this particular algorithm so when I talk about Big O notation why is it Oh again order that's what I thought okay one of the things that I would love to consider here is what is the Big O notation for this particular algorithm Big O for the order of the algorithm how long how many computational cycles are required to search for a string of n characters in a larger string also of of n characters boy yeah way is there any moderators here it can help me with this report oh and and yeah oh okay I'm trying to moderate this know if anybody wants to help me with that that would be great oh my god so many of them are there no moderators Ally watching it okay Topher jay is here thank you thank you to forge a train whistle for you right so let's think about this I'm gonna start this thought over so before I move on I want to think about the Big O notation what I mean is what is the order what is the computational complexity of this particular search algorithm so I have a string I'm searching through and it has its length is n the characters and then I'm searching for another string whose length is M characters and when work when considering Big O notation the idea is to think about the worst case scenario how long does it take if I'm not going to find it basically or if I find it at the very very end of that string so I know I need n checks 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up to N so it is at least Big O order n but for every one of these I've also got to check I mean if I find one of them I've got to check all of these so really I think it should be how like if this 10 digits here and there's 3 digits here that's 30 checks 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 now of course it's less than that because I only had to check these three when I see the four matches but imagine if this whole string were fours and then this were also before I'd always have to keep checking so it's really just n times n n times M and let's remember that for when we start looking at 1 billion digits Oh so is that like reduced to just saying n yeah you know I know there's some BOTS in the chat I apologize about that I have like really not usually had this problem so I've never had to sort of deal with it but there's some folks on the case here so hopefully we could do know it's crazy as the bots or just like it's confusing because what they're doing is they're taking other chat messages that other people have posted and then re posting them with some extra emojis it's kind of amazing I don't know how to permanently ban an IP so we'll see what we do okay yeah and let me say that and even though ultimately the order is the big onotation is n times m because the idea here n is going to be so much larger than when I'm looking for an M this can be sort of reduced down to a operation of order n which isn't so bad to be perfectly honest so to tie a little bow around this we say that this is Big O notation n for the length of the search string the string that I'm searching in alright so I'm gonna take a short break maybe this will also help us get rid of the bots they're very emotional needs bots and I and I am going to take a minute to tell you about the sponsor of today's a coding a train livestream which is brilliant brilliant is as been a longtime sponsor of the coding training I'm very thankful for having the sponsor it's a website an app and I really enjoy if you're interested in interactive learning as you're trying to do some learning from home these days I this could be a useful website to you they have a lot of online courses and one of the things that I really love is how the courses are interactive so I want to tell you about some some new stuff whoops that is that that to highlight for you that are different than maybe what I've highlighted before and so there's a new calculus in a nutshell course in calculus is a language used by colleges urban planners physicists you need kind of calculus to do stuff on the coding train to describe the world but it's often a lot of formulas and a lot of memorization so brilliant takes a bird'seye view using visual and physical intuition by the way I mix we're going to tell you about the neural network one which is what's playing right now to present major pillars of calculus limits derivatives integrals and infinite sums so in that calculate calculus course there's a lot of sort of background material through interactive lessons I can really support the stuff that I'm doing on my channel I'm really excited about this new neural network course a little behind and talking about in terms of when the videos are autoplaying but what you're seeing here is a couple simple games that you could play interactively in the browser to learn the basics of how neural network functions so wiring up neurons and a process of feedback you can build net where you could get to build your own network that classifies handwritten digits and then there's another game which you just saw called where are my keys so I'm gonna come it doesn't take too long to play something to come back and explain you that one when it comes back on I'll work on my timing next it's really bit of rough week people but this is what I'm talking about in terms of the calculus course being able to play with formulas and visualizations and graphs in an interactive way it's a really fun thing to do and and you know the formulas can be scary but this is really healthy so this is the neural network course so let me tell you about this this key is one which will show up in a minute so the the ideas you'd want to find your keys in a messy room so the tiles the color in as you search and this is still doing the handwritten digits revealing how close or far your last guess was from the keys so it's gonna start so that's what this is so you're looking at ah is that close kind of like hot or cold this game I mean I feel like my kids play this game and basically without any clear indication of how to structure your guess is you can nevertheless get better round after round adjusting your response to feedback eventually finding the keys and this is really analogous to this sort of feedback based process the way that neural networks learn so you can just go right ahead and you can sign up for brilliant for free right now just by going to brilliant org slash coding train if you're in and a lot of the content is there for free so for example something that is for free are these daily challenges I'm gonna try to do one of them right now a Simon was mentioning to me that actually maybe my search string algorithm is part of let me see if I can find his message computer science algorithms archive let's try looking that up brilliant org courses computer science algorithms archive so somewhere in this course maybe maybe there's a section on substring finding when I maybe I need a more a more direct link right or I might have typed in something wrong but I will find it and share it with with the community either here in this live stream or on discord if I don't get to before him but I want to do one of the challenges these are my favorite things to do let's just try the one that's right here what is round and spins with teeth all over so the operation of a system of gears and I've lost my chat here for a second follows only one rule teeth in contact always move in the same direction at the same rate so based on the size you can see us this is run ten revolutions per per minute I guess rpms per second whatever rotations per minute yes ten rotations per minute revolutions one Avenue shoals per minute the larger one rotates at two rpms because the ratio of the size the bronze gear has ten teeth oh it's a number of teeth and the gold gear has fifty teeth okay so oh I think I see what this is gonna be already and the gear system below a set of silver gears injuries having 20 teeth the silver gear on the left turns clockwise at ten rotations what speed and direction will the one on the right half so I'm just gonna be using my intuition here but one thing let's say let's figure out which direction it's going to move so if i zoom in on this for a second this one's moving clockwise so this one will move counterclockwise so this one will move clockwise so this one will move counterclockwise so it's counterclockwise so one of the things that I work on with my kids is like if you're taking a multiplechoice test you can always good to eliminate things so maybe I'm not gonna be able to figure the rest out but I kind of now know it's one of these two now my intuition is it's going to be counterclockwise at ten because ultimately the what is what what is the way to calculate the amount of rotations per minute has to do with the relative ratio of teeth and that one at the right is the same as the ones the left so even if it's like becomes a smaller number which becomes a much bigger number which becomes back to a smaller number it should be ten so I'm guessing it is counterclockwise at ten rpm I hope I'm right about this but like I say it's great to be wrong because when you're wrong that's when you really learn so I should really be happy with being wrong it sometimes can feel a little embarrassing but guess what life is embarrassing all right let's hit submit probably all figure this out much faster than me correct whoo all right and let's see oh look here someone's got a nice explanation and formula which is that okay so I guess you could count the teeth so this is 10 which means this is I should say 40 here but 20 here to think about this there might be an error somewhere here but you can see the idea let's look at some other solutions yeah 20 divided by 10 10 divided by 50 50 by 20 get back to 10 yeah this is a nice extinct way of saying it so anyway if you have some clever ideas Vernal this would be an awesome thing to simulate with p5.js to make this animate that would be really fun to do so if you are interested that would be a great coding challenge to do you could try it and if you have other ideas for great answers to put here you could you could put them here and Florence I'm not going to answer your question about what ide i use you're always just chatting chatting chatting florence okay when is the CNN video coming oh I don't think I artists flowing again I got to take a break let me take a break and see if there's anything I could do if anybody knows Simon is telling me the course is called algorithms during the break I'm going to look for it to see if I can find it if anybody knows any way that I could effectively ban the box more definitively let's see if I can try to do that during the break as well so I'll just say a 5minute break and be back to try to search through a billion digits with no js' in about 40 minutes I don't know if I'll be able to do it but I'm gonna try all right folks I'm starting back up in just a minute or two because my time is super limited so okay I'm back I don't have a lot of time so I'm taking a shortened break a couple of things one is looks like I need to get like something like nightbot or something which is a tool that I can use so maybe manage to chat better the only at present just manually with to like hide users so if the new counts keeping being being made so I'll look for the next time I will look into setting up nightbot for for the next stream somebody please remind me of this in discord if you haven't joined the discord join the discord somebody can hopefully post that that link to the chat right now if you have moderator privileges you can post a link to the discord that's where all of the community activity happens outside of the actual live streams okay this is a very bad idea what I'm going to attempt to do right now because I probably should just call today that was a nice little thing that I made and I could talk wrap it up and talk about other things you could do but I am going to just bear with me I'm going to get myself set up to do a part two of this okay okay all right so what I am so let me let me do something here and we get the browser open oh did I mention by the way so we found it in the algorithms course on brilliant there's a whole course section in the algorithms course under substring searches so oh boy I really wish I had gone through this before where I started today but I will take a look at it and come maybe maybe it'll help come back to it Simon had mentioned DFA and KMP algorithms I don't actually know if it was hard but maybe I can look those up in and offer them as things suggestions okay all right so so you know what I don't know that I'm just in case I can't even come back to just in case this needs to be a twoparter I'm gonna I'm gonna record a little ending as if I'm gonna do the next steps in in a second part so huh I don't like having a time pressure thing definitely do not have enough time we'll see you I might have to come back tomorrow somehow see if I can figure it out okay df8 let me just look at what these are DFA algorithm search string is that anything pattern searching PDF DFA based algorithm and KMP I'll figure that out alright so this really wraps up a small piece of this coding challenge I have made my own version of fathom informations peek inside pi I even wrote my own string search function there's so much more that you could do with this to be creative I mentioned at the top that you could think about what if what you weren't looking for were just numbers but you were looking for some other piece of data that's encoded into numbers so we could you find secret messages in PI or pieces of music and pi are there other kinds of algorithms that you could explore that you could optimize this particular search algorithm with foot with and I'll list some of those in the video's description that's a little challenge out to you to research some of those and tell me about your favorite substring search algorithm in the comments but those are going to be needed for when I take the next step and attempt to get this working with a billion digits of pi and for that I'm also going to need a node server so I'm going to come back and do that in a part two to this video it might be right there for you to watch right now but if you're kind of watching this right when the video came out it's probably not there yet but don't worry I'm definitely getting to this one so stay tuned for a part two where I don't even know I've done it yet so it might not actually work but I'm gonna do my best to get a version of this working where I can search for any sequence of digits within 1 billion digits of pi and from there the sky of pi is the limit let's see you soon all right I don't know let's see where I get to I'm Annie G's read stream I think I can so we'll figure this out later it's good to have a plan okay I just need like a little extra time today I'm so close I'm not leaving you don't have to say goodbye all right I have an idea I have an idea so here I am in the sketch I wrote previously what do I do I'm really I'm obsessing just so you know I'm obsessing in my head about what this is gonna become later but you really should enjoy just let the let the coding flow let it just happen Oh today is one of those days I'm really having a hard time okay yeah this is gonna be it's gonna be two short videos part 1 and part 2 or not I don't know I can't decide so here's what I have so far I made this sketch where if a digit appears in the first so here's what I have so far I made this sketch no go away Apple thingy so here's what I have so far I've made a sketch where if I type in any sequence of digits like eight three six five one eight up it'll give me the index into the first million digits of pi where that sequence can be found or if it's not found it'll tell me it's not found and I'm doing this by just loading a text file with the first million digits of pi and searching in it so at the very least I could be like okay let's run this exact same code but now let's take a text file that has a billion digits of pi so I'm gonna go back to add file here and I'm gonna go back to my file system ignore that part and I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna find my billion billion dollar write my billion digit PI file drag that into the browser here and mmm well I'm surprised and not really getting an error message or anything but the web editor will not let you upload a file that big and even if it could am I really gonna expect my clientside code to load well one a one gigabyte file with a billion characters in it now this plenty weighs probably that file could be compressed encoded a different way I probably get down to like 600 megabytes or something but that's not really my concern my concern is how can I load that file into memory Oh David you're here I'm still here welcome but whether it's 600 megabytes or a gigabyte I've still really got the same problem I have this like huge file so rather than try to work with it clientside in any type of clever way I'm just going to use a node application by the way I could probably do this in processing because a desktop piece of desktop processing is not gonna have any problem loading a really large file but I want to stay into JavaScript I'm going to create a node server that can load all the digits store them into memory and then my clientside JavaScript code could query that node server now if you've never used node before I do have a few basic beginner tutorials about installing node and getting setup with node and I'll refer you to those but I'm gonna start from the point where I have a directory with a blank javascript file a package of JSON files to describe my project that I'm building and both a million digit and billion billion digit file of Pi so I'm gonna start by working in index touch I asked to write some code to load that file so first I need to require the filesystem module and one thing that I could just do is just with the million digits of pi let's just read file sync let's just read the whole file in and see what happens Oh interesting so the file has been read in but look how it's being displayed it's giving me the binary information into the console so I want to tell it that I want to read it as a string and I'll use utf8 so that's a second argument to read file sync and now here we go and there's all those digits of pi all those 1 million digits now let's just change it to why not keep it to a billion what could possibly go wrong Oh interesting did something but it didn't print anything out so I know this is just basically a bad idea I don't know whether something crashed or memory ran out but read file sync for a gigabyte file is not a good idea and I think what I want to investigate here is create stream create read stream so let me just look for that let's just find this page no this is I don't want this page I just want the documentation page here we go so I'm on the node documentation page read stream or create yeah here we go create read stream so create read stream is a function I can call to create eight so create read stream is a function I can call to open up a stream for reading the file so I can read it bit by bit I can kind of track how long it's going to take and get what I want and piece it together just gives me a lot of options so let me do that by saying stream equals FS create read stream and let's go back to the million and then once I have a stream I believe that I can basically handle different events so for example I can say stream on data that's when anything is actually coming in I can then have a callback function and just console.log the data I've got a problem why is there a four space tab what happened what happened to you visual studio code I can't deal with it the number of spaces a tab is equal to 2 based on the file contents when editor detect and indentation is on somebody help me I can't take it CJ are you out there somewhere I'll see Jason the chap help me help me I can't go on I can't go on maybe there's something wrong before space is I just I can't handle it mind if I tag here tab sighs where do I get the board I just hit the JSON file though the interface has changed I'm so confused oh there we go tap size 2 to 4 now save truetrue okay okay bottom right bottom right bottom right bottom right uh here we go thank you how do we change this and don't use a spaces whoo thank you everybody oh no no huh well went back there we go okay we're okay now I don't know how do I permanently change that yeah okay I don't know why I don't know what I don't know what's going on okay we're back so now if I run this hopefully I'm gonna see all those digits streaming out I'm still just gonna use the million the million digits file okay oh I'm getting I'm getting the binary data so probably I can say just data to string rate so that's the million digits of pi you're in I'm sort of curious to do console.log like how big are the chunks that it's reading this in yeah you can see so you can see these are the chunks that it's reading the data and they're pretty large because I put some line breaks in between each each each chunk of the stream in fact I think a lot of examples use the word sort of like a chunk here so now let's try 1 billion digits of pi yeah okay we have 1 billion digits up hi boy this is taking a while oh there we go all 1 billion digits could I possibly just put them all into one string and then uhhuh if I have stream on I believe it's end I think there's an end and a closed and by the way if this arrow syntax isn't familiar to you it's a nice way of writing callback and anonymous functions and there's a lot more to it than that and I have a whole video about arrow functions you could watch let's just do digits dot length and see if we get 1 billion digits digit is not defined data digits and look at that it's 1 billion in two because the three and the one don't actually count okay now let's just search for a digit ah I might be able to finish this fast fast fast huh I gotta start a web server and all that kind of stuff okay okay okay let's grab my index of function that I wrote previously and bring it into the node code and then let's look for I'm just going to hard code this let's search what was I looking for nine nine now let's look for $9.99 and then index of digits search and then console dot log index 763 old minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 ok so that worked now here's the thing that didn't take very long because that is actually found at 760 does anybody know of a sequence of digits that's very very far into the sequence of a billion digits that would be helpful to know while you're thinking about that for those of you who happen to be watching this live not in the recorded video that you right now not you watching this live but you're watching this later or watching let's just quickly add in a web server so I can make a call to ask for the location of a given digit yeah yeah yeah yeah where's my very basic example take a selfie app this works okay so in this video I'm not going to go through all of the pieces of adding a web server and how HTTP requests work and get requests and response and all that stuff but guess what if you're interested in a much lengthier series about all of the details lemon add quickly right now you can find that in the working with data and AP is in JavaScript a learning playlist that I have on this channel but for now I'm gonna go and copy paste but I'm copy pasting from the code that I have for those examples right here I want to create an express app so I'm gonna add an Express app I want I don't need this database stuff so I just need to create an app Express I want to listen that port 3000 and then I need just a get request so I'm gonna grab this I just want to handle one route I'm gonna say get whenever I do I'm gonna just call this route search and then here how do I find the digits wait hold on yeah requests not body oh I just need a simple get request we're how do I do that thing you thinking a Bob where if it's got parameters does that not in this example and in this example yeah this is what I'm looking for sorry I want this one yeah okay actually I'm gonna call this pie and then I'm going to use one of those things called rusty and routes something like that to look for some sequence of digits in let's call it search let's keep it with search some sequence of digits and what's going wrong here oh this needs request params digits right it's not how that works yeah so basically I have a simple get request when if ever I run this server any time somebody navigates to search slash some sequence of digits I'm gonna pull out those digits and just send them back so let's run this server and let's get rid of I'm gonna get rid of just this I'm on end stuff right now I don't need this actually I'm just gonna write console.log billion digits loaded and let me run the server mmm err oh I've got to install Express so Express is a nice framework for making web servers and node then we run it again so I'm listening at port 3000 the bindle billion digits are loaded I'm gonna go to localhost 3000 there's nothing there but now if I go to slash search slash 1 like 4 3 3 to 5 or I see it I got it and I sent it back guess what I can do now this is really exciting so now if I go back to sorry everybody hmm so if I take this code where I was searching before and I bring it up here and I can say search equals request params digits search for it within the digits and then send that response back but ultimately I want to turn make this JSON so I'm gonna say index I'm gonna make this a nice little JSON object and I'll also send back what was the search string as well so let's try this one more time and let's switch to a million digits to make this I know that it runs faster so I'm going to just change this to a million digits go back to the browser hit refresh oh I've got to restart the server go back to the browser and there we go this particular sequence of digits was found at that index let's double check this with fathoms peak in PI the digits were 4 3 3 2 4 it's found at the 35th thousand third at the 35th thousands 570 second digit of pi is that what I got yes that's what I got so my search is working and now let's change it well let's get it working from our interface first then we'll try it with a billion digits so now I don't want to just do this by hard coding this into the browser I want to go back to my p5 code and in my p5 code I'm not going to load the data file there I don't even need to do the search there so index of can go to way go away but whenever I want to search it up instead of actually running the search I'm going to make a get request so I'm gonna say load JSON the the URL is and HTTP well let's just grip Gravatt localhost colon 3000 slash search and then add in the actual search value this is a string literal which is an incredibly convenient way to put a variable into a string I'm gonna I'm gonna call low JSON got results and then when I get the results the result comes back in index and that is where I'm going to put it in the paragraph get rid of these things I don't need so basically this is just the interface and the interface whenever interface goes and asks the server to look in the digits with the server being the one that can handle holding on to those billion digits so but I need to host this webpage and the way that I'm going to do that it's use express the same Express server that is serving up the digits of pi that the index value into the digits of pi to serve up these web pages and that I can do with adding like Express static somethingorother let me go look back to my older tutorials about this it's right here app got use Express static public so I want to host everything that's in a directory called public which happens to be what I just called it back into the server there we go and you can see I have this the p5 sketch that I've been working with is in the directory public we don't need this million digits of pi anymore there it's not part of the clients at all just part of the server let me restart the server let me go to localhost 3000 mmm uncaught error raw is not defined so I've got some errors in my p5 code oh I don't need the digits no longer belongs here there's some weird extra error about style dot CSS I'm not concerned with that let's just get rid of that there we go okay now ooh okay it's searching it's always finding negative 2 because it's searching for this like what what weird that come from where did I put that in by accident oh look at that oh it's just an extra that I had actually in the string that goes away by go away it works it's searching in PI but the searching is happening on the server so now it's time this is the grand finale of today's coding train hide a challenge we are going to search in 1 billion digits of pi to find any given sequence of digits it is time I'm going to do it to go back to my server code close anticlimactic I'm gonna change it to loading the billion digits of pi I'm gonna restart the server I got to wait it loaded the billion digits it's now waiting for me going back to the webpage let me just refresh this webpage and I don't know let's try searching question is has it found it no it didn't find that so Kim somebody's a fact checks this for me is that sequence not in the first billion digits of pi that sequence is not either it was finding it before yep it found that one so this so far is the longest sequence I've been able to find let me just change this to a five and found that it takes a while it's slow it's slow David suggested a string two oh seven seven five five one zero let's see if that works oh seven seven five five one zero there this is at digit number 176 million eight hundred sixtysix thousand three hundred and seventy seven that's pretty good I suppose I could look up in that text file I have well I have an idea let's look at what's in that text file the last few digits digits dot well let's start digits dot length minus ten I could use like substring or something but I'm just like afraid so let me print out the last ten digits in the first billion digits of pi wait what just happened there oh no no digits car car at okay I really have to be like this I'm doing this in the weirdest most nonsensical way so with a little detective work I have determined that these are the last ten digits in the first billion digits of pi so just to see how slow is the searching I'm gonna refresh this page and I'm going to paste those last ten digits in here and we're gonna see how long it takes there we go it found it and that's not so terrible so we can't even with my crude bruteforce algorithm find any sequence of digits in the first 1 billion digits of pi by having both a server and client talk to each other so many possibilities here how could you optimize the search algorithm how could you make the API do all sorts of more fun creative things to give you more information about what's in pi could you put this on to glitch so we could maybe we could make this like the glitch is a hosting website that allows you to deploy different kind of creative web applications so maybe I could make a version of this that runs on glitch that people could remix I will include a link to that if I can get it to work in this video's description and you could just be much more creative about the interface and once again what are you actually really searching for could you search for secret messages in PI by thinking about encoding text into digits music in PI by encoding musical notes and melodies and rhythms into digits colors in the digits what data could you search for in PI and what what wonderful things could you discover that way and maybe you could find a text file with more than a billion digits and make your own version that searches into even larger number of digits of pi I hope you enjoyed this pi day coding challenge I will sing you out with my song about the last ten digits in the first 1 billion digits of pi which has not been rehearsed or planned and as ukulele hasn't even been tuned in like a month so I really hope this doesn't end up in the video and get to edit it out instead what did I do last year no we're not gonna do the song I don't have time I'll come back tomorrow and do the song if I have time thank you for watching this coding train coding challenge pi day thanks to fathom information design for the inspiration with peeking inside Pi and thanks also to Fontan bibi's and all of all of you watching this live on the lan during the livestream with all of the suggestions and help that you offered I'll see you soon next time on the coding train have a great day ride all aboard all that nonsense look that catchphrase it's coming one day oh this is my country it's not a phrase it's a sound train whistle sound that's my country's okay alright everybody I am really under the gun in terms of time because I have to pick up my daughter at school at 420 settle down people that's the actual time I have to go pick her up and it takes me a little while to pack up everything and it takes me a little while I'll take the subway or walk there depending on what's happening with the subway I mean if I don't actually definitely don't have to it's a 45minute walk from here so there's no way I can walk the subway so thank you
