do do all right doing a little sound check here how's my audio uh had some technical difficulties where i popped up on the screen for a moment uh let me know how the sound is going i'll be getting started in just about two minutes people are pointing out that the description has time stamps that's just that's an error that's just because i uh cloned last live stream for today and forgot to remove the time stamp so uh i will try to fix that shortly baby good morning everybody welcome to the coding train which has amazingly pulled into the station quite on time which is a thing that almost i don't know this might be the first time in coding train history although technically my clock here says 1002 so i suppose a couple minutes late usually i start the sort of well usually i start things late but then there's the animation and the music and me trying to like fix some wire that became unplugged and things don't get going till quite late but here we are i don't know this must mean it probably means that this is going to be a total disaster of a live stream which of course if i'm being honest is pretty much every coding train live stream but um i don't know maybe today will be the perfect day i don't have a plan oh it's been a month um how's everybody doing um i do have um some thing and while i don't have a plan i do have some things that i want to look at and talk about oh i do have a plan i forgot about my plan all right hold on a second uh let's let me take a minute to just sort of introduce myself perhaps there are new viewers here who have never tuned into the coding train before is that you if that is you please say hello in the chat uh robert uh perhaps has never tuned in before because robert asks is it 10 am or pm for you and it is most distinctly 10 am can't you tell by the glorious sunlight shining in on my face the sun has risen here in brooklyn new york out of the window of this attic i see steam coming from the rooftops of some other small building and some clouds going by i do have a lot of artificial sunlight here it's not really artificial sunlight i have this new elgato key lights elgato are you listening i really like your products did you notice how i also picked up this microphone oh um so that's why that's why i'm positively aglow well oh i was introducing myself so my name is dan um uh or daniel nobody ever calls me i don't know why when i say daniel i think i just said daniel you could call me daniel uh my name is daniel that was that's the name that i was given at the time of my birth oh many many many many years ago i was noticing by the way that um i have a rather young audience and i think that is positively delightful and wonderful um however if it is the morning for you and it is a beautiful day outside and you are part of the youth hey anybody really make sure you take some time to get some physical activity um um and uh sorry i'm very just i have like four different chats going out of the corner of my eye it's really hard to keep it all together i went off at some tangent about um having about um talking to the youth which really really really was the wrong uh train track let me get the train the switcher and go back down this track hello okay my name is dan uh i am somebody who likes to program the computer uh i am somebody who likes to make uh programming video tutorials and i have a youtube channel that you are currently watching where i release a lot of video tutorials and what you are watching right now is a live stream where i essentially uh waste a lot of time um answer some questions from the chat work on some kind of on work on some ongoing projects and read from a random numbers book so they're probably just to be clear better things you could do with your day but if you choose to be here i am grateful i am thankful um and there we go all right so i'm starting to think so i have this system by the way which is uh i got this like j like ultra wide monitor showing me like with like 15 different panels showing me all sorts of various things uh and like how many people are watching what the chat rate is and there's i have a new feature which um i'm going to pin this message from um kobe so you'll see a message that pops up above me this is my new methodology for featuring uh chat messages from the coding train discord right now this is only available to people who have joined as a youtube member which isn't necessarily my future plan forever but i'm sort of testing the system to figure out ways that i can take suggestions answer questions and show them here so i can pin and unpin messages as they come in let me get rid of kobe's message and um and simon asks what if uh just have the overlay on the scene so i think simon is wondering i'm a little awkward so um i don't want to just have a flood of messages going by i want to be able to curate them i want to be able to moderate them so this is the system that i'm working on this is part of um by the way this is kobe writes if you have no plan today dan you could work on the idea we discussed in dms oh you're so kind to think that my memory is intact and my brain works like a normal functioning human that i could positively pull out of the corners of the recesses of my mind the recollection of what was in our direct message i have no idea i'm gonna need a little bit help but what i wanted to do is thank um kobe and david who have been working on this particular system um it is called this stream chat um and you can um take a look you can you could get this stream chat for your it's like a bot and some software and all sorts of stuff it's really better for people who stream on twitch because it has a whole lot of twitch stuff i don't know david and kobe will post some information about that in the chat but thank you for um working on this um to help with the coding train interaction with the audience stuff so i do have some things that i specifically want to do uh today um let's let me pull up my handy dandy computer system here and so i have two kind of projects that i'm working on one is a live poll overlay which has come quite far along since the last time i live streamed so perhaps i could even use it today to do a quick poll to sort of pick the next thing to do that's something that i am sort of excited to start working with um i have been working also on this um presentation manager so right now i also in addition to doing this nonsense that i do on youtube i teach courses at new york university my copious amounts of spare time and um all the the courses that i'm teaching are currently fully remote um i'm using video conferencing software not a sponsor i'm just like this is just me like like asking for sponsors which is really a little bit weird anyway um so um and i've been struggling really with time management so i built this little tool that i can make a as a virtual camera out of it to pipe into uh let's just say it's zoom i'm using zoom okay not music zoom so i can create a zoom i can log into my class from a separate account that's different than me or i could do it as an overlay but the point of what i'm saying is this appears as a box in zoom and i can control it over web sockets to say who's going to be up next how much time you have left and really helps with um uh really helps with really helps with time management okay i got to pull up some of these messages that i'm enjoying so marcos says uh dan can only remember random numbers well i can't actually remember them the reason i don't need to remember them is because i have an entire book full of them and octopus would really like to see more of the live poll stuff octopus you are in luck so um these are ah the new year's event sketch right so that's i'm gonna save that though kobe that's great i think i'm gonna save that because um it's not yet december today is technically still november 29th it's still november and i am planning to do a lot of fun stuff for the holidays and new year's in december raise money for the processing foundation um do some community engagement stuff with all of you um and so that's coming but i'm gonna wait until december begins okay um is your shirt green by any chance it is not oh there is a cat make it come here there's a cat making some very loud noises over there look i have by the way also have a system by which i can show you the cat oh cat's leaving come on oh my god the cat has something in its mouth it's a toy it's one of my i think it's one of my daughter's toys but it looked like a little like a small rodent that it had captured all right i'm not going to worry about trying to show you the cat right now okay ah this is very hard to make but you know you just add one more piece of software on my console and i'm lost um so okay so these are two things live poll presentation manager let me also pull up something else i am now navigating over to my a twitter account um and looking for a particular uh tweet that i sent that's just a reply and let me see if i can find it aha here we go now i'm going to pull this back up for you to see so this is the other thing that i am very excited to maybe explore today open call for tiny code sketches tweet your creative code in less than 256 characters and we will display it on the media facade at media lab prado on saturday december 12th plus info so we can click over here so first of all um this is something that i have been following on social media for quite some time i uh i think there's a variety of different initiatives different hashtags there's one called twitter or something maybe even where people will post a very small amount of code that fits into a tweet along with a gif animation or recording of it and it's just it blows my mind what people are able to do and so what i want to work on today is not make my own submission to this that is not my role in the world my role in the world is to help other people like who are have creative ideas and uh think in beautiful wonderful ways to be able to share and express themselves and so if i can make a little example and some tips and tricks for how to get your p5 code down to or processing code or whatever your code might be down to a small number of characters um then um then i'm bringing up a question here um and then uh i'm excited about that so those are the three things on my list live poll presentation manager oh i got another thing on my list well i wanted to revisit my fall 2020 list to see how i did which is you know c plus b minus c plus i would give myself as a grade um um but um i also on this list i recall is i need to work i was planning to work on http uh this a new release of this particular processing library so many things to do and yet it's only 10 15. ah the whole day is ahead of me here okay what is on my hat not a very exciting answer uh but um it is a this is a baltimore orioles hat that is a baseball team here in these united states um i grew up in baltimore maryland i went to many a baltimore earl's game at the old memorial stadium i once i said recently i said to somebody oh you mean at the new stadium the news this is not going to be interesting to like 99.7 percent of you but i will just go with that for a second um the the current stadium in baltimore where the orioles play is called camden yards and to me that's the new stadium but somebody could look up on wikipedia it's probably been there for like 25 years at least uh but i think of it as the new stadium ah memorial stadium those were the days all right so um now i should be able to ooh so one thing that's tricky now here's some live feedback i've got it when there's a lot of messages coming in to the chat here i got to scroll back down to find the one to unpin okay um close out a bunch of things one thing i did which is very exciting my upgrade to my studio today is i moved the mouse got a usb extension so i can control it's not my laptop here which is a different computer it's not that interesting is it maybe it's interesting why everybody want a little behind the scenes let's look at a little behind the scenes for a second all right let's see if we can make this happen and then we're gonna then i'm gonna try to get the live poll going uh let's see connecting to your computer ensure that your phone and computer on the same wifi network or connected via the usb cable this should work come on fancy epoc cam thingy um let's see how do i get this to work not coming up so this is my new way of wirelessly connecting my phone camera and it's not working for whatever reason so i guess my little behind the scenes show and tell will have to wait until later okay um i don't even know how to turn this off now there we go all right i'll figure that out later um okay let's read some random numbers this always helps me feel relaxed soothed centered and ready to attack attack in a very friendly way give a nice friendly hug to the day oh wait uh speaking of discord bring this up here um i need to uh figure out so a couple things i want to mention about uh discord is that uh you may have noticed that i recently released a few uh three video tutorials on how to make a discord bot there are three more coming one is how to use env to hide your api keys uh it's about six minutes long i wouldn't be surprised if it's out on monday or tuesday very very short quick tutorial the one after that is how to um post uh gifs to discord um and you can see here that i've added a new command exclamation point gif uh kitten um and um so that there that is the next uh that's the s one of the video tutorials that is coming out how to do this and then the third video tour which will be a little bit later it was recorded separately and i'm just finishing getting it put together is about how to write a command handler hey wait a second k wickman is typing this is supposed to be a channel that only i have access to maybe that's not actually true um i don't know what's going on here so ah but the reason why i came into the discord is this is usually where i keep track of where i was in my quest my quest to read the entire book of random numbers it looks like the last time i did this was uh november 7th 2020 and i finished up oh we should do some community contributions today of course i finished up on row 14 oh boy i'm still on page one everybody page one of my book um i uh need to go to row 14 and column two all right let's see what we can get let's see if we can at least get maybe we can get to row 16 today that'll be really exciting 87 517 64 969 ninety one thousand eight hundred twenty six eight thousand nine hundred and twenty eight ninety three thousand seven hundred and eighty five sixty one thousand three hundred sixty eight twenty three thousand four hundred and seventy eight thirty four thousand one hundred and thirteen sixty five thousand four hundred eighty one seventeen thousand six hundred seventy four seventeen thousand four hundred sixty eight fifty thousand nine hundred and fifty boy this is a little depressing i feel like we need something a little bit more exciting ninety one thousand eight hundred and twenty six eight thousand nine hundred and twenty eight ninety three thousand seven hundred and eighty five sixty one thousand three hundred sixty 23 478 34 113 65 481 17 674 17 468 thousand nine hundred fifty fifty eight thousand forty seven seventy six thousand nine hundred and seventy four seventy three thousand thirty nine fifty seven thousand one eighty six forty thousand two hundred eighteen and sixteen thousand five hundred and forty four all right everybody whoo yeah oh boy what a thrilling and exciting morning this is move the book from in front of the mic i think the sound is being muffled oh you think well you know you win some you lose some um i guess i will have to figure that out also uh i don't know if the mic is actually a little bit quiet here let me turn that up uh okay music is overpowering the voice audio okay so is uh well hold on i gotta mute myself i'm about to sneeze this very exciting moment so do okay boy it's so many things to control right now i'm going a little crazy i can't even turn around the music okay i mean i i wish i could show you my behind the scenes here because i've got like the craziest console of stuff going on right now definitely need to get myself a purdue production team actually the most exciting thing if you will bear with me for a second um i i need somebody i need someone to give me like a really good uh quick um dad joke i know can you still hear me i guess why why why is um what's that number joke where nine is afraid of eight or something but eight is afraid of seven nine is afraid of seven because seven eight nine okay new drum new drum new drum set everybody i don't think that was worth it uh i can't show it to you because i can't seem to get my mobile camera working but um my son who plays the drums he's he got we got uh a friend was uh giving away their drum set so no more electronic drums for him a real life actual drum set let me get him up here to be my band leader um we'll see if we can make that happen for everybody at some point okay oh is that like really loud the um hold on i'm amazed by what's going on here ah too many things okay i need ghost chair yeah okay um all right all right all right settle down everybody let's take a minute to see if we can get the live poll going so um i am going to open up um i term here and uh check in on my live pull a web application grab the latest version of it now i seem to have made some changes here that i have no idea what they are uh let me move this down here and close this okay so many distractions all right so what's going on here i think if i type git diff it's gonna show me what weirdness i've put in here anything that i put into this can't possibly be uh stuff that i want so i'm gonna say git stash which will stash any weird changes that are in there then i can get uh what is actually from the repo let's open up the code and take a look so what is this live poll application so first of all i have a lot of people to thank um so one of the things i certainly realized is my technique of like putting out a web application into the world putting it on github having a bunch of people look at it and submit some issues and pull requests over a week and then me coming back to it live on stream to try to look at those pull requests analyze them understand them merge them resolve conflicts did not make for a good live stream i don't think that was a particularly productive use of anybody's time so i have been taking making some effort to manage this in between live streams so rather than try to merge a bunch of pull requests right now i can actually just go through and show you a bunch of things that have been added so there has been some restructuring and refactoring um one of the things you'll notice here to all of these ads so and so as a contributor ad so and so as a contributor this is something um new that i added if you're not familiar with there is a particular bot that you can um add onto a github repo it's called the all contributors bot and it follows this all contributors spec so this is a specification for recognizing contributors to an open source project in a way that rewards each and every contribution not just code this is something that i care very deeply about uh credit and acknowledging labor and credit and volunteerism and paying people and all of that all of the myriad kind of complicated discussions and topics that come up around open source software development so um there's no easy answers to all the different questions i ask myself all day long about how to work on open source in as inclusive in an equitable way as possible but i think all contributors is a good starting point so just so you know you can see here that anybody who has made a contribution whether it's an idea or a bit of code um can be acknowledged in the readme and it that process is automated so i don't know if um anyway so we'll see if i can demonstrate that actually let me demonstrate that right now um let's see here let's look at the issues um so actually i don't think i acknowledged john telton who and actually i want to look at this because i want to see if i can get this onto glitch um and so what i can do now because i have the all contributors bot added to this project i can say all contributors add john t alton4 and let's just say for ideas maybe there's one for like reference there's a there's a set a prewritten list of categories of kinds of contributions that you can tag people with um the one that always jumps to my mind is ideas so if i add this and i put a comment here um any moment now if i did that correctly we should see i can like play my little drum see i could actually get my son he can do this live but we can see we got this pull request so i can move on over to the pull request and um i'm just going to assume this is adding john talton as a contributor for ideas requested by shiffman in this comment and i can now squash and merge this and then if i go back to the main readme we'll see that john has been added here so this is one thing that's happened i think probably the most significant there's a couple of significant things that have changed um and it's actually interestingly enough now i'm noticing that it does create a lot of noise in the repo i don't know if there's a better way to manage that because now like i don't want to like find a couple of the key pull requests recently and there's like so many all contributors posts pull requests but that aside i still think it's a it's a it's a really great tool um there's a bunch of refactoring a bunch of like fixing just mistakes that happened as i just willynilly was merging people's pull requests without checking them there's no testing um fixing of the rats but i was looking for some of the design stuff um that i wanted to um coats this was super helpful by the way um i don't know too much about this but um this apparently so i'm like obsessed with code formatting and i really advocate that all of you watching do not don't be like me but um my shirt is not key this is a blue shirt oh it's totally what is going on why is it also half it's the same color is it because of this light wait a second this is the weirdest thing ever what is going on oh no that's it's not half it's just like actually keyed out okay i didn't realize that this shirt was gotta work on my key okay um so um so i'm trying to understand how to have good auto formatting of my code that maintains a set of standards and isn't isn't a barrier isn't like causing so much pain and suffering that it's actually making it harder to do a project but just keeping things neat and tidy and i think one of the things that's always been a point of confusion for me is and looking at this pull request it kind of helps me there's prettier there's eslint and there's husky so what are these things prettier from what i understand is a code formatting uh well it's what is it let's let's look at how does it define itself opinionated um code formatter so this actually uh form will format the code right put all the spacing in invitation in add semicolons make everything single quotes or double quotes i believe if i'm correct yes lint is not a code formatter but is a code linting which means we'll check your code to see whether it complies with a set of standards or not and then husky i guess is some kind of like dev tool that will write a bunch of scripts to reformat things with prettier check for mistakes with eslint is this um is this how interesting anyway so a lot of the stuff has been added so i would like to understand this better and one thing that i can see is that like ah so if i want to use single quotes there should be this prettier rc file which i can see here and single quotes i could change to true and then if i go to one of my bits of code somewhere let's find one that has quotes in it ah here if i now hit save i change it to single quotes now why did i get this weird error fail to load module if you have prettier or plugins referenced in package.json ensure that you have run npm install oh so the new aha because i pulled the code from this pull request down i now also need to run npm install to get the new packages like husky lint stage eslint plugin printer and eslint lint stage eslint fix so much stuff so much stuff lint fix oh so these are some new things lint staged post install i don't know do i need to run this post install looks like i might right i assume i have to say like now npm run post i'm post install okay done husky is for universal git hux get hooks i cannot speak today all right so anyway moving along very very slowly here i now have in this project and one of the things i really like about working this way is on with these kind of weekend side projects meandering through figuring this stuff out is you know if i could get my act together eventually if i wanted to i could do some tutorials then that kind of go through some of these bits and pieces more step by step but um what i also wanted to highlight so thank you samuel martino martino for that but i wanted to look for the um some of the design stuff that was added see if i can find i mean let's see rainbow no i could have sworn seven days ago that pretty recently there was some work done to um add a bunch of visual design elements anyway i'm not it's not i'm not not finding it right now and i see that vishal in the chat says use typescript no i will never use typescript and then you could what like two years from now when like entire coding range is all typescript you can you can play that clip back for me um but let's let's see if we can get this running so there's a bit of awkwardness still with this live poll in that um there is no system to there's no uh endpoint or frontend page for creating a new poll it all happens manly right now by uncommenting and commenting back in this create new poll function so let me take a look at that um here so in um i'm looking for index.js or server index.js create new poll so let's see what happens there create new poll how come i can't find this here it is oh wait huh oh right okay so this is this is me so this is hard coding in a new poll which is certainly by the way there's a weird echo going on in here today so what should we do now i'll i'll leave that question or what next let's see so let's try oh this is good well except for bots so um ah so what do i do what what's the thing to say what what did i what was i calling that tiny code so these are three things i mean the live poll to be honest like it's it's a more live poll work look at community contributions or tiny code those will be the three options that i want to explore right now so i believe if i just put comment back in this create new poll function and uh let's follow the readme here um and okay i should could be running npm run dev already so that should have created the new poll then i want to go back and uncomment this so that should have restarted the server let's go to the server now why don't i see anything ah oh no so i need to then look at script.js line 36 so i probably need to then go into the database here and grab this id right this is the poll that i want to look at again all of this should eventually be automated in a very elegant way where i can just launch a poll through an interface but right now it's all very manual i'm going to grab that id and then i'm going to go to the web page that i'm looking at which can actually get uh get the poll id from url parameters but i could also just make it the default one right so if i go and make it the default poll id here paste that in then i should be able to refresh this page aha so here's a bug early bug if there are no votes it should probably have them all be zero percent so if i want to vote to continue working on the live poll i can see that that now is a hundred percent so in theory now and the other thing is this this does not need to have uh does not need to be keyed out so let me also change um the background um to be just transparent so i don't need a background color how do i comment something out in css that's weird how do you comment out css is that not possible oops i also just completely reformatted all of this somebody's got to know q a could be nice as well yeah i've never had a good luck with doing q and a's but um i guess i could just delete this fine delete this and refresh and that's good so now if i wanted to host this um well let's see let's do dude i um i can end rocket let's see so i'm going to use this um ngrok tool is this what i do no oh no ngrok http 3000. that's what i say okay so i should be so now people can actually go and vote right now um at this particular url which i can just put into um discord as well in the live links channel let's see does that actually work so if i vote here yeah so i don't know maybe maybe you're still 30 seconds behind so let's see if the votes can uh start coming in but what i want to do is get it as an overlay in open broadcast studio so oh i have my mouse here where is that um so i need to add a new browser source um and add and grok um and then look at its properties and i need to go to oh i can just copy this from discord uh where is that i'm going to um uh and i want to deploy this to glitch so give me a moment i'm going to do that next but i just want to see if this works i'm looking for where is my links okay copy link paste link okay and there we go it should be uh the live poll should be going now uh visually i've got a bit of an issue here where maybe um i need to think about how to make it appear better because i could go over to here um and well i don't know what is gone happening there let's go to um transform reset there we go so now i guess i guess so now i can cut this off and here we go so uh go ahead and vote as no one pasted the link into the actual chat i will do so this is very exciting there's apparently there's 500 people watching which is kind of nuts um tiny code is growing very dramatic you don't store the so somebody did make a uh pull request there was a pull request that did something to protect against stuffing the ballot oh god no please can i not talk about voting um i've got some breaking news here everybody breaking news 46 of coding trained viewers are so meta they just want to vote for working on the voting system itself yes you can vote multiple times i think but somebody did put something in there was a particular let's see if i can get to it here there was a particular pull request that had some kind of like validation thing involved with it um what is going on where am i oh i mean all contributors i want to go here uh there was a pull request that somebody implemented to do some um validation and and protection simple timebased antispam package and test so this was crunchy pie um who added a package for lightweight antispam guard it's time based so so i think what if i'm looking at this right that maybe this just protects you from voting more than once within a very short period of time so i think you can vote again but you have to wait 30 seconds 60 seconds i'm not entirely sure you can reload the ip um and you could but okay tiny code is now anyway i didn't mean for this to be super scientific um do not use the rainbow it's not colorblind accessible yes so that's also uh thank you for pointing that out prathamesh um one thing that's very important to consider is accessibility in design and which is to sort of uh you know my understanding of sort of what primary thing to look at is contrast color contrast um and so crabby says i use set interval anyway i voted 18 times and octopus is very sad here tiny code overtook the live poll all right well um there we go uh this was interesting to see i used a clicker says antivenom that must be some fancy futuristic technology here all right so i do want to definitely take a look at the tiny code stuff this is so weird this is like this is like oppo this is like bizarro coding train i started on time i was like i must be running out of time now it's only 10 45. i'm like doing this for hours on end um and um but uh bader says they spammed tiny code the antispam isn't connected um so where do i say samuel martino so cross says that they are colorblind um and so uh definitely fi if um you know cross i hopefully um if you have some experience with this whether your own personal experience or as a designer uh color um if uh if you want to file an issue um that um to um i would love to correct the a rainbow design and use a different design so that it is accessible to anyone who has color blindness or any other type of vision impairment okay all right so moving along here let's uh put the so the so what what next let me solicit some help from people so what are some things that need to happen next for the live poll i will make an issue here and i will say help wanted um future improvements now ordinarily i might suggest oh and you're not seeing what i'm doing here ordinarily i might suggest um and uh let's see here nope shoot the wrong one okay ordinarily i might suggest a separate issue for each uh improvement or bug report but because i'm live streaming and i want to move quickly here i just want to create a quick list of things that are um ah and flesh mash mesh mesh in prathamesh is pronounced like it rhymes with flesh let's let me practice this one another thing that's very important to me is pronouncing people's names correctly um i do my best i don't always remember it's something that i really work on with students that i have in my nyu classes it's you know i feel like it's not their job to correct me or to sit quietly while i mispronounce their names it's my job to learn to pronounce names correctly um and so the mesh in profamesh is pronounced like it rhymes with flesh not mash so profamesh hopefully that was an improvement on the pronunciation now so what are some things that need to happen next deploy to glitch which i could work on today myself um oh yeah a different cat has emerged by the way um uh accessibility concerns uh color um rainbow color etc um uh what else um endpoint for new poll and front and for new poll uh antispam protections what else um oh yeah and there was a suggestion it's already in there as an issue to add web sockets so that so that would be a nice improvement um okay so what else am i missing anything important um i'm going to submit this issue these will be things that i will hopefully consider for next week also i have to figure out how to have i guess another question is um i'm gonna make this a new issue uh overlay design how um different views for uh different scenarios in obs for example um maybe a semitransparent background for when the obs video is very noisy and busy i don't that makes sense what i'm saying here transparent all right all right moving along [Laughter] let me move to looking at uh so i i would love for people to continue to work on this submit pull requests file issues i'm trying to keep an eye on it over the course of the week i'm kind of managing this myself doing a pretty poor job of it but i i welcome your contributions um now let's move on to looking at tiny code sketches so i want to understand um um how this works what are what are some of the let me see if i can find very briefly um one of the hashtags that i really like um shoot is kind of awkward that i'm not signed in on twitter but i think it's fine so also i'm looking for something um yeah so ah natto must be watching i'm looking under um because natto just uh screenshot the poll on twitter the reason why i'm looking for an alto i don't know if i'm pronouncing your name correctly um i would love help with that i'm looking for maybe you can help me with this um if you're in the chat i i feel like i went to your twitter instantly to find some of the hashtags i feel like you're always retweeting um tinycode sketches um so ah okay uh here we go let's look at this casey reese tweet which i think has a couple this is this is perfect um so um i am at this tweet now where i believe that these are two hashtags that are used quite commonly for these um tiny code challenges so let's click on both of these and let's take a look oh they couldn't you believe that this game it's like i i just like oh my god i can't believe how wonderful this is like the greatest thing ever and i can't i'm only sad that i didn't make it myself i can't believe this came up so perfect so here's the idea and what i what i wanted to do was start to understand how like what are some of these tricks here that are being used to whittle down a longer piece of code into something shorter so i thought what might make sense is for me to take one of my coding challenges um and right so there is a the concept thank you to uh kobe who's posted the concept is known as code golfing so i i'm quite familiar with it as a regex golf which is this idea of like trying to write the shortest regular expression to match a particular pattern um so um but in a way like i think of i you know i don't love the sort of competitive nature of code golfing um what i think is wonderful about this is it's not really about having the shortest code it's about this sort of creative constraint because there's nothing inherently better but this sketch fits into fewer characters than what it is right now as long as it can fit within this constraint of a single tweet um so let's see let's so first of all let's just let's just prove the point that this works by going to the p5 web editor and let's um what should i call this um so this is i'm just going to put a comment here i'm just going to let's get to this yeah perfect it's going to put a comment in here and now i think i can close this um let's go to here and let's grab this code and let's run it and whoa wow ah interesting so what's missing why is this showing up differently now a couple ah okay i i do oh i know why so a little uh unfortunate thing happened here where um the emojis uh didn't copy paste correctly so let's see if i can replace those with my own let's see so let me get to a tree let's put this here and then let's put the tram tram car train which was what was used here let's just try i don't know if um i don't know if it matters let's just use this one tram car and let's run it there we go and what is there another one that i'm missing here or yeah no that's just ah there's no white uh so i suppose would it if i did this there we go so i've gotten something close now so there's a little bit of extra stuff there and let me just so what is the magic of what's happening here there's a lot of tricks to this first of all no semicolons lots of one character variable names create it's really unfortunate that create canvas is such a long word but let's let's go to uh codingtrain.com let's go to the coding challenges and let's find one um and see if we can fit it into a tweet the raycasting one is kind of interesting i don't know if anybody has a particular oh i'm in in dark mode also right that's that's why in the web editor thank you that's obviously a great point like could i um like well no i can't get the open simplex noise loop to work because it requires um a whole separate library but i could try like a perlin noise loop that's an interesting one to try um let's look at the code for this one yeah so for example could i fit this into a tweet um and right and um this is a great comment also from uh kobe who says code golfing is an art in this case and not a competition which makes it beautiful and i i really do agree with that sentiment um so let's see oh the meta balls one is also a good one i don't know i think i'm going to try this one so let me duplicate it and um so let's try this as purlin noise loop tiny code okay and uh in case anyone wants to follow along i'm really i think i'm having an allergy to my pets today um you know actually i was cleaning up up here in the attic and i think i kicked up a lot of dust i'm constantly feeling like i need to sneeze so i apologize it's coming along um let me post a link to this sketch so if people want to follow along you know as i save you'll be able to refresh this url and you'll get the code so let's see so i'm going to get rid of the slider first of all and just have it be a fixed value so where what this noise max uh what what did we have the slider range it started at uh between 0 and 10 and the default was 3. so let me just get rid of the slider here and change the um this to three now i wish i had a chrome extension or something that could actively count the number of characters i have here i mean i could always just go whoops well i'm not logged i can't uh i guess i need to log into twitter let's let's let's make that happen people um give me a second here um login it's gonna take me an hour to log into my twitter account because i have to look up my password at my password manager and um uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute here people do do okay i i was much too afraid to log into my actual twitter account so i logged into this account for a twitter bot example that i was been working on and just for the sake of argument what i want to do is go over to um the p5 web editor grab this code and paste it in here so we can see here this is how i am oh it's wow look at this because it's in the code comments it actually gave a little preview to the video here so i'm 441 characters over so we got to get get working on this first of all i think we can get rid of all of these um let's do auto refresh i'm not you know um so the uh i was gonna say i i don't need the slider sorry um i can see immediately that i don't need this noise max variable because i can just put three and three here um i um phase can be a one letter variable z offset can be a one letter variable so let's do p p z let's call this x y x so i'm just like lowering variable names right now um and shape close p and z so even just with x has already been declared oh um so this is totally extra stuff that i don't need here let's look at this okay so we can see even with just making some one ver a tiny code is 256 that's correct so the limit this is a um sorry this is a really good um comment from octopus twitter has a limp character of 280 characters i believe the constraint for the tiny code challenge is uh 256. so i should try to make that i can use tau rather than two pi there we go all right so i'm going to definitely be taking your suggestions from the chat uh thank you for that one luke finch um arrow functions and no let const for variables so here's another one let's do this so instead of saying function setup can be this and draw can be this i think is how i have to write it still good and no let and const so i think i could do this right p comma z equals zero no p is not defined is that a thing yeah i didn't know you could do that but let's say that all right so let's see how we're doing character wise right i'm now fitting into a tweet i'm only 178 i just like lost 300 characters amazing so now um all of the white space can go right so um all right so this i mean i still need to be able to follow it somehow i should be able to just say clear that is much better do i need to do translate probably translate so this i could also do as this i mean do i need a stroke weight of two do i need to say no phil now here's the question radians of five uh no the other way around five degrees so point like i do about point zero eight um oh no no there needs to be a space there don't auto format no no no format uh okay so there's also this simon is saying use underscore instead of parentheses friends this is not something i know about i can do this huh i never have seen this what the what is that that i have never seen use minifire so right so who am i suggesting i could use a minifier but i kind of want to do this manually to understand uh draw so that's saving me a character still good still good um i feel like i can get away without using map there's got the math for this is much simpler right like i could just say right six times cosine plus three right that's that's the equivalent of this map function so y equals six times sine plus three is this still working oh i did something weird i thought i would go wasn't i mapping it between it's fine i like this anyway did i am i confused i'm i'm lost here oh no no plus it should be three times plus three there we go right because i'm trying to now um sorry i my system for comments is i'm now like if i so i think what i need by the way here's a little feedback for uh just stream chat if i pin something it needs to stay on the top of needs to stay on the top of the scroll so i can always like go out of order so i can always just unpin it and then i can go back because now i have to like get through a whole lot of comments to find the ones that i pinned also the green is very hard for me to see little comments you guys can't see this but i could uh um all right so now uh r is map noise and right i don't need to have these separate variables this goes here this goes i'm going to get to do so much more i have so many characters left z and i can i don't need the map function right r oh no do i yeah r equals noise of three times cosine plus three three times sine and i'm mapping it goes between 0 and 1 and i want it to be between 100 and height divided by 2. so times 200 plus one let's just do that for right now then vertex set the vertex uh end shape get rid of some spaces and how am i doing people look at that i got 12 more characters left to go oh amazing wow oh i messed something up here but um there we go uh so hold on hold on let me finish this off this is very exciting now i do want to log into my real twitter account so i can tweet it i still have uh line breaks no i messed something up um what did i mess up ah because if i put everything on the same line that needs a semicolon i guess there we go look at me so did i get this into 256 that's the question um do i have enough i have enough space for the hashtag that's for sure uh the question is do i um the other thing about this the whole point of this demonstration is that it's a loop it'll actually like animate a loop but i could rename sine and cosine to s and c that's interesting would that really save me a lot of space it might because am i using them a bunch of times like in other words if i go back to does this still work no oh because it's not in setup so that works and then and then c s c s that's interesting did i save characters there so currently this is with 17 additional characters third no that's that added characters me adding s equals sine c equals cosine that added characters is that really true let's see here yeah i did so how many characters is this is um is this so if i do 263 so to get this in the let in the for loop there's a let in the for loop okay thank you everybody that will get me a bunch where's my let and also can i get away with this yep so i don't need that zero leading zero i don't need this one i don't need this one okay that's good so now wait uh oh i need to i need to shave off two more characters shave off two more characters what can i shave off here there's a semicolon oh there we go there's one one more character um i mean i could does this close actually really necessary or is it enough that it will get there no whoops shoot what did i just do uh oh what error do i have i have lost something ah i don't know what that is oh did i get rid of that no the clue okay so now let me get rid of the clothes well i guess i could have it have one more i i could have it um by the way i really like how this looks i could have it be divisible perfectly by two pie let's put the clothes back so right now i feel like i need the clothes and but do i have i did it okay so now now i need to capture this as a gif that perfectly loops how do i render it with a perfect loop oh my god um well here first let me hit save i should now i should really log into my actual twitter account so i'm gonna do something illadvised first of all i'm gonna paste this into just a text file here then i'm gonna hit auto format just curious okay that's better i prefer to look at it this way anyway so if i wanted to get the idea of this also is that it's a loop so um i believe oh i don't know that it's oh this is just a closed loop here uh it won't be a perfect loop yeah no no i was i forgot this is part of my series about how to make a perfect loop with noise but i'm not loop i'm not making a perfect loop of the animation i would need a fourth dimension there i think or just have the z value um be walking through walking through circular values anyway um so i'll just i'll just capture this this way and we're gonna make our so i know hopefully this helps people sort of see some tips and techniques of things you could do um whoops um let's clear all these i don't know what's in here uh clear captures yes um and let's just grab a small amount of this i think maybe i'm where's 400 400 let's okay let's also what was i trying to do here um oh wait where am i what's going on people um would i let's change the stroke weight to four i think that'll look a little nicer to eight to two here what's p doing well that's the phase uh i can't add can i add an extra character no that's not what i want okay don't stop stop i don't care all right let's let's go back to uh four all right so now i want to record this for a little bit we'll just do like a little 10 second or five second gif um pixel size original is fine save as uh gif desktop noise tiny code could i i give it like a higher frame rate and will it still um tolerate me yeah okay so now what's the only thing i changed was four right all right i think i have to post this from my actual uh thank you to john person um for your very kind uh donation it's much appreciated uh i don't believe that it will become selfaware a random number yes john person will get a random number um but i gotta finish this i gotta finish what i'm doing here so uh i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and log community contributions have moved up into the poll so that's what we'll do next um i am going to move to signing into my actual twitter account um because i believe now this should be posted from my actual twitter account where are we 11 20 okay log out how do i log out oh add existing account uh shiffman this will take a moment here for me to find my twitter account password i suppose i should mute my for all of you people who are picking up my password from my keys okay two factoring myself in and tweet okay so now um here we are i should be able to grab code what was the one thing i changed i just made the stroke weight so that goes there tiny code is that the hashtag i want i also want oops um i like this one p5t um they both fit um coding train can you do a train as a hashtag not really right um okay so i've got seven characters left i don't know what to do uh okay what's happening here um all right so i've got this now what do i want next i want to get that gif and put it here ah oh internet there we go come on there we go there we go um add a description sure um a wiggly like a circular jagged polygon with white outline and no fill jiggles and rotates with purlin noise okay so got that so i think i think i'm good to go i'm ready to tweet this this is very exciting uh arnov is trying the hilbert curve would have been a good one the hilbert curve that's a probably that that's i oh now i want to do it with the hilbert curve let's do the hilbert curve after this why not should i do another live poll since that was so successful all right let's tweet this one out and watch watch the likes and replies come in look at this look at this ah oh give me those fake internet points all i ever wanted was fake internet points the real internet points anybody got it under 200 oh oh so um if anybody has gotten it shorter particularly if you're in the member discord chat and you want to paste it in a discord message i can feature that on screen look at my internet points they're just like flowing overflowing i really i'm not i should not be allowed to do what i'm doing what is going on with this message all right um oh this was fun uh okay okay everyone wants me to give the random number to the john person all right so first of all i just want to say thank you for your super chat i wanted to be clear that i do appreciate the donations they actually make a difference here in terms of uh the sort of mental budget i have for the channel and things that i'm buying for equipment and having time to do it and i appreciate everybody's membership but i do want to be it's really thoughtful about um uh how i ask for that hey i i don't i'm not actually soliciting your donations or your memberships it's great if you can support in that way but if you do have um i'm doing fine and if you are looking to donate i might suggest a local food bank or um any other sort of nonprofit that's helping people who um really really need the help especially in this difficult time and then if after you've donated there you want to donate some to me still that's great also of course the processing foundation i will be doing a fundraiser for them in july but for your donation john person i would like to provide you with your very own random number the setup function does not need the curly braces oh that's a good one thank you mika uh eleven thousand and six hundred it's quite a round number oh niraj stop for the donations people niraj thank you for blinking my lights and connor all these random numbers okay okay okay the eggs i 8781 29643 okay thank you everybody ron and uh not ron connor uh simon posted this trick five times sorry simon i missed it uh all right now um let's see i kind of want to go do the hilbert so where oh i see set up there and so why don't i need the curl i don't need the curly braces because it's one line of code that's cool to see okay um let's do let's do one more because i can't now i'm having fun i can't resist this um let's do one more um let's grab the hilbert curve code and let's do duplicate hilbert curve tiny code um save and then for anybody who is looking for this later i posted the link in the discord okay so let's look here let's make sure this works ooh oh this is my crazy rainbow one too all right can i get this into 256 characters all right um so first we know we can get rid let's let's look at what we're what we're starting with here what are we starting with and i'm just well into my own twitter account now here we're starting with uh oh that's bad oh boy uh how's this gonna go oh no no uh so let's see let's get over here so first thing we can save a lot also i think just okay oops uh hold on i'm going to i'm just so let's let's take off some stuff here that is make i'm trying to just make it run oh look there's some commented stuff that's gonna help um just sort of shortening the code in the first place um oh i wasn't auto refreshing what is wrong with me okay that's what i this is what i wanted let me get it to like all right this is good okay so let's look here what are some things oh i'm using like vectors and stuff so that's oh my god this is going to be an interesting challenge oh my goodness oh what have i done oh i created a hard one let's see what let's see where we are now 975 characters to go okay so order as six i can get rid of this variable uh line 43 yeah okay that's good i just have to remember that um all right so that's good um now uh n don't need this here we're good total can i get rid of this yup path counter being zero okay uh i don't need this background here isn't there some way to like make the counter go up here okay so we're getting somewhere um i mean this is silly for me to start just getting rid of the all right length is width divided by n so if n is going to be two to the sixth power um which is with divided by so like if i said 512 divided by two to the sixth power that's just eight so get rid of this and i think the question is should i try i should probably make this i guess i'm going to leave what it is right now um and we know we can do i don't understand this i don't understand how that works okay what did i do i need this here right i think all the vector stuff i'm gonna have to rethink but where else okay oh this can absolutely be um do i even need these no i guess i do what if i do hsb yeah okay so now i'm now we're cooking here all right um now uh so how am i doing how are we doing character wise oh my god i still have 650 characters to go i'm oops still pretty good pretty pretty pretty good all right um so i know just leave some i need to leave line breaks until the end because i've got to be able to look at this this should work chaining should work right and then i also don't need these ah what did i do line six oh i need another parentheses oh no no there here there we go okay that's good um okay that's this is looking good now the setup um now let's see here clear um okay now this this hilbert function is really where i need to do some other stuff all right so why do i say new p5 vector and not create vector and this will save me some characters okay so this also can i make this function just called h okay am i already using p for path it's okay though um so points i'll call it t now i'm assuming there's a way i'm going to be able to not call oh well what if i did what if i did that and then oh no i have v here um so let's call this oh there's only so many letters in the alphabet a create vector uh uh create let's call it i don't know a a for create create i ate the vector or i could call this i'll call that a let's let's keep that as v and let's just change this to a k equals i ampersand three and then also um wow this is actually quite enjoyable oh am i still going here ah i better i better get this working here oh we're gonna need uh boy this is this is gonna need some serious work there's gotta be some ways uh and this is k k k i believe return a just want to make sure this works v is not defined 17 v equals create vector hmm just just to double check this why is this not save and create vector hmm why am i not save and create vector let's see just put create vector back here for a second just one i don't want to break it so much that i can't get it back index is not a fine line 23 okay okay i'm back so why is vv equal create vector oh because it's aha where do i call the hilbert function make this first line of code okay because hilbert is being called oh hilbert's being the hilbert function is being called right there no wonder okay i have to have that beforehand okay let's let's have a little check in here oh vv pv okay okay still got it let's uh whoa oh we're doing we're doing well just got to get rid of 444 more characters no problem no problem okay uh can i do that okay um a lot of this happening so now length is power 2 to the j there is a way to write the power function right i also have this here this i've got to be able to do or isn't there a bit shifting way to write this um n equals 2 to the sixth power um change um right somebody will tell me that that i can never pull i can't um but certainly here this can be l equals power 2 to the j for right now um and this can be um i don't know if this is is that fewer characters i think it might be did i already use t can i use t oh is the switch statement going to do this for me do i need a switch statement all right so power 2 to the j is the same as 2 exclamation uh two asterisk asterisk j thank you for that um so this i should be able to say two asterisk asterisk six oh is it also isn't that just the number 64. 2 to the ones two four eight sixteen thirtytwo sixtyfour sixtyfour uh length is not defined line 25 okay i'm back um oh i can't stop myself here must succeed at this just want to see like what where am i really with all of this okay this no temp is not fine 31t just i need a reality check here okay please remove the else is oh that's a good point right this isn't great coding but will certainly work line 36 hmm what did i mess up here for ifko no k is 2 k is 1 k is 0 4 oh okay hold on this is opening a for loop if statement if statement ah that should okay what am i working with now wait oh i got only 200 characters more to go ah this is great okay would k equals three work as if k is greater than two that's an interesting um okay right so i don't need these curlies that's i don't need these curlies um this can also be two j right okay now question is i mean one thing i could do is get rid of the rainbow color like i don't need to have color mode and then i could also get rid of the stroke like that's gonna save me a lot of characters um could i would no i guess having i need to write a swap would a swap function really save me that much oops uhoh oh no it's working would a swap function if not k okay that's good so the swap function could i write a function hmm okay k is greater than two i like that okay save myself i need a lot more just get down to fewer characters uh i mean i guess maybe i should get rid of color mode i didn't want to but i think i might have to get rid of the color mode right hmm right because if i get rid of that i can always bring it back right let's get rid of color mode sad oh uh okay we're back to just sort of this plane uh i don't know how to get to david's comment to remove it okay hold on this will give me a second here uh okay where is david's pin comment there it is okay all right so that's working um how we doing people oh this is good now just out of curiosity does it oh i save characters when it's on one line wow so that's going to make a huge difference when i eventually get to that point so i didn't realize that instead of curiosity here how what am i really working with here getting close people you know what i don't oh i just realized something i just realized there's a fundamental thing that i could change i don't need to write a loop i don't need to save the values in an array i can oh boy i did that because i was technically doing it where i wanted to be able to draw the entire thing but i can just bear with me for a second right if i get rid of this i don't need that clear it's drawing over itself but i i don't believe that i need this array i just need the current point and the previous point to draw a line hold on uh all right so let me save this because i'm going to do something radical here duplicate i'm going to do something radical here i don't need this array i don't need this loop i do need a variable i and i don't need c i is c what i'm saying is i is h i b is i already used did i use a here i'm so confused um okay so look look just give me a second here v1 is hi v2 is h i plus one right p is not defined line four um i guess i need to add these in but this is this is that's this is all shortenable then okay oh this is going to make a huge difference so i need a and b well actually i just need b so if the problem is what am i using a for here equals t index k what oh yeah yeah that's fine um so i need two points i need a let's call it a b c d i'm going to use e and f e and f or e f g h i i and j j and k i'm already using those somewhere else m n m n that's perfect m equals this then n equals m so n is not defined yet let me just define it as something very briefly okay all right so that works how do i get it so that it's do i really have to define it as something that's kind of irritating no all right let's see what i'm working with here oh okay i'm i'm doing quite well here i equals n equals zero thank you i hate that i'm getting this like warning thing but i'll live with that okay so now else can i do use draw as your loop exactly okay so now let's see if i put this in here can i just by getting rid of all the line breaks get myself there there's still a lot i don't have 50. can't tell where the line breaks are now but again i still have a lot more to do i'm just trying to think if this can be reduced most like do i maybe i don't need maybe i don't need create vector the dot x though is so much like right a equals t there's got to be a way to do this without create vector um ah okay i like that um this is a good suggestion from mika i can put v equals create vector into draw that way i can get rid of these i guess if i want to keep the line breaks i could lose the semicolons so that helps a little bit there's some kind of object restructuring i could do like no i'm looking for more suggestions because it's a square put 512 in a variable is that really going to save me characters though oh i see that's a way to do it hmm okay line ten and you could swap by saying a b equals b a can i really do that hmm um yeah so i could so one way for me to just know how many characters i actually have is get rid of these semicolons am i still good here yeah um this will just help me sort of see what's going on 50 hey didn't i have it better than 51. combine lines 22 and 24 i see oh that was a really good one uh that was from um that was from andrew garvin interesting how many characters did that save me okay down to 46. oh this is really hard okay i just want to like what am i down to now 37 people oh v a equals v a y dot a x that is super interesting so this is this is a really interesting one that david has just suggested for the swap so here t equals ax a x equals a y yeah a equals v a dot y a dot x yeah wow that was huge that was huge we're down to 28. can i do that with this last one i should be able to a equals this comma this and then i don't need oh boy i messed something up all right how do i do this last one a equals v this is a dot x and this is a dot y just for a second here separate this out okay all right that's good then get rid of these get rid of this oh now we're cooking with gas here okay i think could this possibly have done it oh my god so close to fitting into a tweet now we're way beyond my goal is no longer to get this into 256 i'm just trying to get this into a tweet so that'll might be my goal move line 15 k equals 2 to 20 and rename to else i'm not sure if i'm behind okay all right so let's look at this all right what else could i do um okay so this is save this could save me a character um this anywhere there's a bracket it's no yeah that has to be a new line okay um this looks so short by the way um i've lost david's message to unpin it um all right let's see rename if k is greater than 2 to else ah does that really save me some characters no no no no i can't use else because i can't use because i got rid of all the other i can't do that that was a great idea though uh if k equals one yeah um i do like what i'm getting line four h i plus plus remove line six huh i never understand how that works but i'll take it that's awesome line 15 remove negative one and plus one those aren't oh negative one i replace i equals this so this is one that mika is saying with just shifting it ah yeah okay wow thank you mika that was a good one yeah slightly annoyed you can't pass two vectors to line uh okay how we doing how we doing this those are some good improvements 14 characters just 14 characters more this to me feels like there's got to be something i can do with this i divide equal four is that what the bit shifting is line four scale eight oh interesting would that really help but it's afternoon now okay hold on scale scale i don't think that that's really saving me any characters though with line eight hmm create canvas into draw and delete setup no that's not gonna work because i can't call createcanvas over and over oh you mean the whole thing just scale eight would that actually work so that does work but my line thickness is way out of whack now so i'd have to do like a stroke weight right i'd have to add stroke weight of like point two or something like that works but now i've added a bazillion characters so it's a good idea so youfu unfortunately so some of the the way i'm looking at the chat right now with the this stream chat is i'm like way when you post a link to a discord message previous message i don't know what that is plus plus j plus plus j where would that go with line eight i don't know what any of those suggestions are maybe line eight j plus pl oh like this that didn't work j equals one plus plus j is that that didn't work hold on did i mess something else up no yeah i like this idea but oh i froze froze ah come on come back oh no oh no come back plus j plus at least screenshot this we're gonna get this people uh line 14 i have plus l and negative l l minus one oh yeah look at this those cancel each other out right no l no no no two out can i do two times l that doesn't really save me any characters also what did i just do oh oh line 12 if k equals 1 8 why is it like sometimes it's like freaking out and but that didn't save me any characters uh v i know that's what i was thinking instead of create vector but you're double incrementing no plus plus j at the end no i took that out i saved the sketch by the way line ten l equals two star star admit it in line eight i don't understand that v00 can be replaced with that's a good one oh that's a good one all right thank you uh to i've done that uh marion who said v zero zero j equals zero plus plus j i just don't understand if you remove create canvas q equals 5 12 and then okay oh i mean just use the default cam no i kind of want it to be bigger i mean that's an interesting idea like to just not even use create canvas right if i don't use create canvas right it makes a 100 by 100 canvas so i could scale the thing down very like but that's let's let's hold off on that let's hold off on that people are saying huh that really worked okay where am i now we have nine characters left to go okay replace twelve and thirteen oh i could use it a ternary on 12 and 13 okay let's try this says 60 replace 12 and 13 with k equals 1 then if that's true a dot y plus equal l oh you mean i could just use the only the question mark like this will work well if that's true that's huge i might be able to get my color back in here no hmm oh oh i see i can do this like that oh that's so weird i have no idea what this is like sorcery here no okay i don't understand what i just did if k is 1 do this otherwise if k is 2 do this otherwise just like i put a 0 in there for doing nothing um thank you 60 for that but could i even keep going with this and do this now but this might have gotten me enough characters still need five more okay i still need five more i still need five more ternary operators ternary operators that's so could i do one more ternary by putting this here now and then okay down to 2002 oh my god this is insane line 10 remove j plus plus line 10 add plus plus when i don't need the greater than two now because it's just the only other possibility oh whoops just did something awful no ah okay right so like if this is true do this otherwise if this is true do this otherwise can't i don't need to even check this shouldn't i just be able to say really feel like you should be able to do that no oh because of this all right i need to bet i need to keep going with the ternaries so not k do this otherwise this and then oh my god and then i don't even think i need this last one right no it wants one more or do i can i get rid of that no oh hey i fit it into a tweet oh my god put a as a global variable don't return a oh that's interesting put a as a global variable then i don't even need return a is that oh true of undefined oh no oh but then i would have to say did this actually save me characters it's working does this save me characters yeah i can i can put a hashtag in there now okay amazing but i still feel like i've got extra stuff here that i don't need i'm so lost not k do this or not one do this otherwise to do this otherwise i guess i do need it because i need to oh unless i get rid of this so come on i need more space people need more space think now ah come on give me some space there thank you another curly bracket okay now i've got the turnery thing all set oh my god save save i've got 11 characters left i might be able to get my colors back line 10 is unnecessary k is already set i don't think that's true i don't think that's true yeah no no that's definitely necessary remove yeah okay line seven remove the line break got it there's another one no whoa whoa no i have to have it because it's a function definition i don't know why i can do this that'll work i am going to put semicolons in and remove all the line breaks when i'm done get rid of setup by doing if not i create canvas yeah no unfortunately p5 needs to have the setup function you don't need j plus plus in line 9 if you do plus plus in a line 11. like this wait hold on let me save let me save save plus plus nope there we go yeah that's fascinating that saved me a character right yep so can i get this to 256 that's the question [Laughter] line eight a equals i modulus 3 and remove line 10. a equals t i modulus so unfortunately the youtube chat is too fast for me to follow imodulus3 is that all that that is doing with the bit shifting there the ampersand no i like that okay that's pretty cool looking though nope oh wait oh why do i have this here oh because i do it once that's weird wait wait wait this has got to be why do i can't i just make this zero and then get rid of this no that seems like something i could do right why do i have this extra it's gonna be the same oh i see and then i looped through there was no setup in the train tree example really i can do this without setup line eight uh t equals hold on let me try to hmm there's an implied empty setup if you don't have it oh says chris okay i don't understand oh you mean just do it in draw do it in draw i see oh i get it i didn't understand that that is wild 15 wait what do i need to get to 256 uh 280 minus 256 i need to have 24 characters well now i'm really determined to get to 256. is t only used for a equals t index k it totally is yeah i didn't need that that's a huge extra thing hmm initialize j in the first line no because it's got to be reinitialized every time oh i see what you mean no yeah it's got to be reinitialized every time q512q line two can i do this silly thing again this okay so close i or i or create canvas yeah that's even better there are so many okay i've got it line okay let's let's see kobe says line eight can be h equals i ah yes okay so this is a really good one i understand this now this i can just look at i don't need a separate variable a equals the index into this array that is at i and three did i get that right yeah okay okay that's good oh my god uh um can i go with v i don't think so let's find out yeah it's not that's a syntax error oh what did i do oh what did i do oh it's 11 yeah sorry okay all right um thank you kobe for that one uh let's see did i get it to 256 characters oh now i don't know anymore okay it's not even showing me it's i have so much room left that's not even telling me how many characters i have left one two three four five six twenty oh yeah i think i did it i think this is 256. okay hold on how do i count characters that's 254 characters okay all right let's add i want to i i prefer for it to be on one line so let me hit save the other thing is why not go for a higher n like why not make this a bit more detailed like for example if i've already like lost track of where i started with this by the way in case you're just tuning in right now um and it's still working um i wanna like this was the original code um and i started with an order of six so if i made order eight like i'm just curious if i change the order back to eight where does what is that effect it makes instead of this being 64. i don't even know where those numbers went to like lost my mind here is it really just a matter of how many oh i'm not even doing that anymore because oh it's gonna crash at the end it's gonna crash at the end or will it just go back over itself right because the length is all that matters now right if the length is like if i do this it's gonna go forever right let's let this run for a little bit i mean i could do this just for fun i saved so much space i could make it rainbow color again k equals i eight does that work if i somehow do this no i can write v oh this one nope uh inside the indexing yeah i don't know how to do that do colors hold on the nicos musics this is like crazy to me i don't understand this one if people who are in discord can pull in some of the um interesting suggestions move line 11 into the for loop increment is that the only thing i'm using j for i don't i don't that hurts my brain oh there's this one yeah there we go thank you v1 it'll replace the second argument automatically there we go that's a good one line 12 k equals 1 to k is less than 2. that's another one okay define k equals i mu and use it in line eight no because i still would need to have it here because i is changing but there's probably a way i could say k equals i divide equal four boy this is there's okay here's the suggestion from nico this one i wanted to look at a equals v of i modulus 3 oh my god i don't understand this at all i'm fascinated by this though so let's just think about this here a equals v of could i actually figure out what should go here based off of this by saying well let me just type this out i don't understand it but let me type it out and maybe that'll help me understand it v of i modulus 3 because it's 0 0 1 1. that makes sense zero zero one one bit shift one okay so it's zero zero one zero zero one one will this get me zero zero one one whatever i is and then the next one is 0 1 0 1 1 0 index i modulus three i didn't get that right does this do i mean for this to be this yeah that's not modulus the ampersand oh i really got off the rails here now uhoh why is this so nice happen to me i don't know why that happened sometimes the web editor just freezes up okay i think i have to stop soon this is pretty good oh camera died the camera's not plugged in oh the camera died oh my god bye camera how did that happen this whole time the camera's been going on batteries don't worry everyone i have a solution to this problem it's called a plug uh although this might be a sign that i just have to stop all right nope this is an ethernet cable it's not gonna be any good what i'm looking for is my where did that plug go i didn't notice this was happening i had a cable here oh this is the saddest thing that ever happened i just literally had a usbc cable which is what i'm looking for actually what i need is a um you need that cable if i unplug my microphone like oh there's there's the cable i'm looking for you can't see what i'm doing but i'm plugging in this camera to power usbc goes right here why does this keep getting plug i blame my children you can fit in there usbc cable your usbc port your usbc cable there we go now i just need a other end to plug it into something right i'm going to unplug my laptop for a second and plug it into that hopefully this doesn't fry the camera let's see charge charge charge up my friend camera camera should be back okay should be back all right i think i have to be done make q64 i know but i think i actually want to go back to 512 because technically speaking um it's going to um let's record it it's going to take a very long time but 512 by 5 12. but i think it'll be fun to have oh oh it's not going it's going to take longer this thing only records for 30 seconds all right so i'm going to need to do a quick time screen capture let's quit this um finishing up folks hello i'm gonna be done will you just play like a drum thing for me i don't know give me a beat will you give me a beat well it's about to get very loud in here i'll turn down the gain on the mic okay ready give me a beat oh it's going over it again that was good um all right i have to finish up oh my god it's almost like one o'clock oh my god wait why is it going over it again because of this um line eight oh remove the multiply right if these oh my god i'm losing my mind k equals two to k okay hold on in line five just add two why did this not go on to the next i guess i'm missing something critical here that's fine let's just make it a 256 by 256 thing i have to stop i don't even know where i am when all of my chats replace all ternary operators with immediate array god this is crazy uh turn a equals oh i can't i have to stop i hadn't restarted the sketch oh is that why i don't think so all right my my brain is completely has completely died five i have to stop i'm being i can't believe i went this one this was like so fun but it's kind of like off the rails now okay let's just see what happens camera died again [Laughter] um all right let me let it let me let it charge up a little bit more so i'm i'm gonna be just not on camera for a little bit yeah what did i do wrong for it not to do the full 512 by 512. is it this six here needs to be like for example oh how can i how do i tell to record chord okay um so if i go back to the original code order is eight n is two to the eighth power which is 256. that's how far it's at length is width divided by 256 but that shouldn't matter like if i go back to the original code like i wanted to do this over the whole thing and what did i do differently add colors i think i have to come back i'll have to come back to this another time but i'm trying to i'm trying to understand to the j j is less than order ah there we go i see what i've confused so yeah i just need to increase that that's all i know you can't see me i'm i'm enjoying the fact that you can't see me right now i'm letting the camera charge up a little bit because it clearly can't be charging and so there are probably still ways that i could reduce the number of characters um getting some good suggestions in the chat um and but i just want to see if this moves on to the next section which is very unnecessary but i must know there we go okay yeah okay so i have it calibrated correctly now am i actually recording the screen here hit stop oh i was okay so let me delete this and then i could i'm going to speed this up new screen recording there we go stop record stop and here we go all right i'm gonna let this go uh and then i'm gonna be done uh who who wants to help me uh quickly uh speed up this video so i guess i could i could make it long is it recording my audio am i talking throughout this whole thing oh that's going to irritate me so much now we're trying to get the color back um well let me at least finish recording this i'm sorry that i didn't do any community contributions today i i got obsessed with this i should have just let it do the um i guess i could record this later maybe i'll post this tweet after the stream um so i don't have to sit here and wait for it to do the whole thing it's going to take a very long time use ffmpeg that's a good point um yeah so this is by the way this goes against everything i stand for in terms of programming you know the i this was like a fun challenge to explore but you know my whole ethos is to write the code in as long winded away as possible um so i can't really increase the frame rate in the way that i'm doing it here but i see that i can use people are giving me great suggestions like marcos here's i use ffmpeg a lot i guess i should let this finish now that i have it started um the problem is i'm screen recording so i can't check anything can somebody check how many characters i have currently um and if someone wants to check how many characters i have currently i could consider if i could get just stroke back i would need color mode hsb stroke i should really do this after the stream but i like i'm a completionist you know we've got uh oh i don't have the um hold on i don't have the overlay here just stream shot overlay in the view i'm looking at 248 characters bruno says it's a good example to show why people should not do it this way i agree so i don't think i can get color and stay within 256 characters i could stay within the tweet though so i'll do a second one with color because i agree um that would be nice i still think that um this one this comment from la culotte on youtube so i i realized that some people are saying that people are posting suggestions when other people are copy pasting their suggestions so i'm not sure if this is the correct attribution and there is also getting a suggestion for how to rewrite the for loop to remove the curly brackets and the line breaks which i'm looking at um but i think i'm going to leave it um i think i'm going to leave it as is right now it's so close to finishing all right i think i'm about to reappear there i am all aglow let the lights adjust so close here okay awkwardly go up here and hit stop great so now i'm going to save this um okay save this all right i'm wrapping up people at export to hilbert one desktop hilbert let's call this black and white desktop okay all right so that's good now let's just briefly see if i can get the color back and stay within 280 characters so how did i have color i know i need to add that's probably enough that's i lost my i'm still within a tweet i have 15 characters to add color and then the original way i had color was having q b i map from the entire length which is path.length is the total number of points which is 2 to the 8th squared so let's just try for a second um stroke i divided by um so 300 i divided by two to the eighth is 256. so that's that am i is that that how do i do something squared like this yeah yeah oh no no this is gonna get me color i think right it's the same thing right i can't tell if the color's actually changing i don't think that it is hmm it's so hard to tell because but i'm thinking i think it is oh and it's working it's just really slow it's change the color is changing it's changing color did i map the hue fully i'm not 100 sure and does this fit into a tweet uh i'm over by seven characters i'm over by seven characters do i need these parentheses so i currently can't really i could increase the speed but not with the way that i've written this um spectral piano says they have 273 characters what did i miss that you got spectral piano line five yeah i i think i can get rid of these two parentheses so i guess is there a way i can just for testing purposes increase the speed i should be able to say right am i using n somewhere i'm not using you oh whoops okay that's just temporarily increasing the speed um okay oh boy i've unplugged things everything is dying and also is this that's not right did i get the few full hsb yeah that's right that's whoa yeah i don't know i guess i was off by two i don't know why just make sure yeah okay i mean it's it's interesting to have it repeat but okay so that should be 14 here i'm not i'm i'm not going to question that um then um and also kind of want this oh okay okay let's not so i could let's not get too picky here people um what was i doing uh i wait right right now can i get rid of this that's two characters less okay yes um i'm so close to being done now let me just run this make sure it's still working oh i've messed everything up what have i done oh help me line 14. i need another curly bracket maybe there we go okay uh does this not fit in my tweet five characters i need to remove five characters from this one more for semicolon in line 14. there's i've gotten good suggestions replace 2 to the 14 with 4 to the 7 okay that's good now i am at i need four four more characters people four more characters to remove instead of x to a equals okay i don't understand that one don't line 14 k is less than two don't understand that one a okay line eight says spectral piano okay can someone grab spectral pianos um uh message equals two with less than three i've already done that i've already done that they need spectral pianos comment i i okay can't capture them i can't capture them it's too fast someone's got to capture it for me thank you okay oh all right line eight it's not line eight anymore well let's look at this a equals v i ampersand two times two oh is this gonna get this is just gonna give me ah i see zero four four zero uh right then i don't need the multiplier is that what's going on here i'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the multiplier uh oh my monitor died okay everything's falling apart i can't see anything anymore what happened there i should have known that it was telling me that there we go okay uh right i should this looks right it's just tiny so i should be able to say four times this right no oh no four times this no i'm very stubborn so this i like what you're doing here this makes sense this would be 0 4 4 and then maybe i can just the multiplying can happen here and then i can just do the add here right no how come that doesn't work oh my god people are really i don't think you understand what's happening to me okay hold on all right chris ray has a really interesting suggestion this whole thing can be replaced with i am sand 1 to the i ampersand 2 power i don't believe that fascinating that is not right though i'm getting a very interesting pattern there of not k a a equals not k or v and omit the a equals in between okay a equals not k or v but that doesn't really help me at all well i've got to get back to what i had i don't understand that i'm lost i'm completely lost why don't you need to move line 12 to line seven i don't understand that at all yeah uh i i believe in this solution but i don't understand it um color mode three oh oh that's genius no the hsb constant is something but it's not three i think it stands for a string actually unfortunately can't remove the mult or the ad yeah i agree okay people i think i might have to give up is this my best oh i'll gain the character in between here okay um um so close line six remove the second two from add oh will that work oh that's a good one that's a good one okay i just need two more characters this can be done right two more characters nope really doesn't want to give me any defaults for hsb i and oh this this is a good i yeah i've been trying this i agree that that should work no there should be a way for me to get 0 1 1 0 that sequence but i'm not sure how the suggestions that i've gotten don't seem to work um line 10 remove the last item on the list says marcos i really don't need that zero that's amazing it'll default that's amazing that is totally amazing replace line 10 replace this with times two yeah no that is cool looking though uh what did i do it ah we did it we did it it fits okay hold on okay everybody save duplicate i'm signing off folks what is going on here okay there we go is it gonna let me put an image with this that's the sad thing but it will okay okay well okay i'm i've got to go everybody it's so sad how like i'm so like hours and hours beyond where i meant to be that i have to just like race off this live stream without having a nice wrapup moment um but um i really appreciate everyone's help with this oh i could do ad l that's another one that should work thank you it's another one i didn't see oh no that didn't work it didn't work i don't know why that didn't work but that is not it does that did not allow it did not work okay i'm sorry everybody i really have to go um and i uh i didn't think we need a song to celebrate but i'm just going to play with this dot song so i didn't do communica i got this is what happens in all of my live streams i hope you enjoyed this um i'm going to in a little bit like tweet that i'm going to capture the hilbert curve thing and then i'm going to actually tweet this so i hope you will uh see that and retweet it and enjoy it but i'm just going to play the this dots on as always i always forget that say goodbye and say thank you stay tuned for some afternoon videos coming out next week and some more live streams in december and i'll see you all all right goodbye this dot i'm going to do this this star this dot this dot this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me see you all i'm sorry i'm just shutting this down shut this down the tweet's gonna come out soon though
