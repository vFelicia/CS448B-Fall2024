good morning hello happy coding train Wednesday just me your host and I'm here yet again to talk about this great for so I know I've been you might think that I have a like a unhealthy obsession with this topic about Fourier transforms and how they apply to drawing paths but it's just been something that I have seen and thought about and looked at and wondered about for quite a few years now and never felt that it really understood or shortly knew how to implement and so the recent things that have popped up in my peripheral vision on the internet smartereveryday video the Turkish website article written by Doug ax three blue one Browns video there was actually a wonderful podcast called I have to look this up it's uh let me just look this up because this is a really one I want to get this wrong a wonderful podcast that I listened to called too much not enough and the hosts are Darius and Emma and they they have many wonderful episodes I highly recommend it but season 2 episode 1 is called or if you'd see this Fourier transforms so it's a really wonderful excellent explanation you would think like oh how could I ever possibly listen to a podcast about Fourier transforms it's just listened to people talk and explain and think and consider Fourier transforms and yet I couldn't imagine a better podcast to listen to so this though I think I've kind of got a lot with my life but it's time I need to do one more thing I need to do the part 3 of the Fourier transform coding challenge in which I will let's and in a way I probably should have started doing it this way but to figure it out to get my brain to learn it and understand as much as I can about it and I had to start by separating out the XS and the Y's and if you recall if I come back up here this is the this is the result of the first part of the coding challenge where I apply a Fourier transform to a signal of all the X values of this coding train logo path then I apply a Fourier transform to the signal of all the Y values of this coding train path I turned those into these circular epicycles and use one to grab the Y and one to grab the X and then recreate reconstruct the drawing and you can see the strange artifact here were actually in this one the X never changes even though all these circles are rotating epicycles or or orbits are rotating around each other this x value stays the same and here the Y value stays the same so now it's time to take both of those and put them into one and achieve something perhaps even more magical than what I have achieved already here on the coding tree but this will involve some stuff like complex numbers which had already did but will involve more about complex numbers it will involve revisiting this formula but I'm I'm ready to go I'm gonna make this happen I hope it's gonna work so then topic number two which I don't know that I will get to I mean it would be great if I got to it is and and someone in the chat just asked the dong asks what does K and n stand for and K n n stands for K nearest neighbor so the logical followup question would be what nearest neighbor bead and K stands for K yeah all these are very legitimate good questions if I have time I will get to K n classification and I will be demonstrating an example that was pioneered for the ml 5 library by eaning she who has been a guest on the coding train before and has I'll point to a lot of her materials when if and when I get to this topic but the idea is to create a game controller with basic gestures how could K and n K nearest neighbor possibly do that well stay tuned but if we don't get to that today I will be back on Friday umm what I would love this this week marks the first week of the you semester died class yesterday was okay it did my best so all I could do so it's busy but I also went back a bit more into the routine of things and I'm hoping to try to do more than one live stream per week and have each of them be slightly shorter rather than these sort of like long two three four hour live streams I would much prefer to do twice a week for like an hour and a half each time or an hour and a half to two hours I think once I get I mean really once I get to about 20 minutes of time get it close that's right start I don't know if I ever think clearly but it really starts to go downhill but you know certainly after three hours I feel watching in my live streams for even what you might find it entertaining but it's a little less productive ah so something like starting your day with a nice like math formula just to like sort of settle it in stare at let's just some deep breathing meditation let's read some random numbers to the discrete Fourier transform formula 51 eightyseven thousand one hundred eighty nine fourteen thousand seven thousand I lost my place because I'm looking up at the Fourier transform for me it's actually there okay this is the word expression but really it's just a green wall ninetythree thousand fifty seven nineteen thousand eight hundred and seventy three sixty six thousand two hundred one ninety eight thousand okay I feel like that's what we needed to calm down to ease our minds and to allow ourselves to feel like we can tackle this today uhoh is the mic muted so no it's not muted okay so I'm a little bit concerned one thing I'm gonna need your help with I'm gonna need your help with this because usually I have I have these rechargeable batteries for the microphones that I use usually they've been charging ever since I left the studio the last time I was here did forget to charge them so I charged them up a bit this morning this one is on one bar that one is on two bars I've got some charging here in the charger so if the mic if the mic goes out then oh the music is very loud I can I can make the music a little quieter let me let me just fix that for a second I made a little fire if the mic goes out I don't you're gonna have to do everything within your power to channel your mental energy to me to get me to notice like the check we come up with like a signal although no I don't want to come now worried people are gonna start trolling me but the signal would be like emojis of microphones over and over again so we practice it like a 1 just get it out of your system like everybody all at once everybody all at once just like when I clap flood the chat with microphone emojis and this count to 10 in your head and then stop it got the 5 the 5 your head stop okay ready and we'll still be a practice while I'm waiting for you to catch up to me it was asked what is this book this book is a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal deviants this is not an original print if anybody could find where one could purchase or acquire an original print it would be like my treasure absolute treasure this is a book published by the RAND Corporation in the 50s I believe yes the original publication date is 1955 and it was used as a list of random numbers for different kinds of Monte Carlo simulations and experiments because there was there were no computers but it could quickly well if there were no computers but having a computer at your fingertips that could generate pseudo lists of random numbers to do to very quickly was not possible it also has norm a Gaussian distribution a normal distribution of random where's the back all right great I see all of the microphone emojis that is something I will definitely notice if the mic goes out okay I'm being told by Simon that there is a video I have seen this michael says primes for three hours i I don't know somebody I need to go see if I ever hit 1 million subscribers I would like to read all 1 million random digits now I did the math for that even if I could read like 1 think about if I could read one digit per second it would be I think oh that's 1 million divided by a 60 that's how many I could do in a minute and there's how many you know minutes in an hour divided by 60 again and how many hours in a day divided by 24 it's it's it's a lot it's a lot so I'm trying to come up with a solution I thought well maybe I could read what read from the book for I know I got to come up with something you know something that relates to 1 million but doesn't involve like okay if I could do like 1 million milliseconds but that I think that's not like could I read just that anyway you will think of some idea Ben Morin and the chats as an original $275 I would spend 275 dollars of my hard earned super chat money on million random digits by the way oh and a K week Mon in the chat is saying and Simon by the waist of 277 hours that's a lot I actually think there was issued corrections to it since the numbers weren't random enough what does it even mean usually to be random enough it's really an interesting topic if you think about like well how could it not be random enough if it's not Ray them enough isn't that kind of like randomly not random which is even more random than random so I mean I don't the question is is there a detectable pattern is the actual distribution of numbers over time uniform there are so many things we could get into and talk about but I must talk about discrete Fourier transforms that is what is going to happen me I am sue me seems to think that eleven and a half days of reading the random number book straight is doable okay I'll do that for ten millions if it's ten million subscribers how about that well I actually have ten million subscribers maybe I would sit here for eleven and half days I mean I'd have to sleep it's very unhealthy not to sleep I'm like an old oldish man I can't do the young person stay up marathon for eleven half days anyway okay I take breaks I mean I could do it over time I mean I could do two hundred seventy seven hours over a year maybe I just have like one year to read them all I don't know let let's not come up with this there was a super chat in there so what's giving donations to buy that book I guess mr. Uggla going toward the book so I have a new system I need more in better systems but I have a new system where I can see new memberships and new super chats you know I almost feel awkward about the existence of these sorts of things they do help me fund various things I want to do for the channel make it more possible for me to do this but what I would always feel the most guilty about is if people ask a question with a super chat and I miss it so my new thing that I'm going to try to do is before I believe before I end a session I'll always go back and check if there any questions there I will answer them see how that goes alright alright okay 13 minutes in we've got to get going with I won't do the drum roll whole shenanigans again discrete Fourier transform I'm looking at my email which I don't need to be looking at okay here back into a slack group alright ah and Anurag asks are you going to do fluid dynamics thank you for asking okay I'm gonna go to rainbow topics I'm gonna sort by recently updated and I am going to go here so if you haven't already seen why am I not logged in I won't worry about that right now if you haven't already seen the smartereveryday video about laminar fluids and I don't want to start some kind of like YouTube beef thing or anything you know I'd like small potatoes to the giant that is smarter every day and I'm most likely just gonna get squashed but I like turbulent flow turbulence I mean if you visualize it it's all crazy turbulent it's really cool so I mean lamb trust me laminar flow is cool also turbulent flow just just saying just a little just a little like just putting out there turbulence I mean I don't like it in an airplane a very nervous person I have to like grip off to the sides like this like III fliege of recently was on a trip I think was sitting next to my tenyearold son it was a very turbulent look you're like you're just like looking at his iPad whatever okay that aside turbulent flow I would really like there's this um this is really nice demonstration that I found doing fluid simulation I believe this is using yeah this is using this lattice Boltzmann algorithm I'm gonna hit start and you can see here let's make it all turbulent look at all that turbulence can I add like how do i flow speed if i make the speed much higher let's let's change the viscosity oh we want the visco yeah there we go look at that turbulence look look at that come on turbulent flow what so I would really like to I would like to make this I mean in a way it's like oh look this already exists I mean this is basically exactly the coding challenge that I have imagined that I want to do when people ask about doing like fluid dynamics I have to admit I have no idea how to do this I have at one point have used the navier's stokes particular algorithm it's which is super interesting and I've used several libraries that implemented you know when I'm making a project if I need to make a project that has fluid simulation and I'm just gonna go and use a library probably but when I'm on this channel and I'm trying to do a tutorial I like to kind of figure some stuff out a little bit more our level is a sort of academic exercise or for fun times it's like we're fun times and try to figure out how to code your partial differential equations that you don't understand at all but so I'm hoping that maybe I would do this on Friday but I don't I think this requires some research like I don't think I can come in here cold and just like read the paper I don't need to write code in advance I don't think but I need to read the paper and look at some of these examples and have a better sense I won't wouldn't do anything this sophisticated with like an interface and everything but I just want to get basically something like this working so turbulent flows we are gonna make some turbulence happen with the lattice Boltzmann algorithm if you have some suggestions or ways that I could tackle this here's another paper that you please contribute to this thread oh and this is really cool this is somebody's uh like JavaScript 2d fluid turbulence simulation I mean come on if this war just laminar flow all of the little dots will just be going where laminar flow but if there's turbulence it's like alright enough shenanigans let's get to the discrete Fourier transform that's right Destin I'm coming for you alright alright uh let's see I'm sorry all these interesting things people are saying in the chat all right let's close this out get semi air ideas and help and everything and here we go Oh before I go to start with the by the way clearly the only thing I'm getting to do today before I go and start with the drawing with the Fourier transform let's look at some of the things that people made not only there are only two community contributions by the way I think there might be a website but it's not really a website bug but one of the things were really struggle with the website is when a coding challenge has multiple parts where do people share their parts and then where do people find them and I believe the way the system works is if you share your parts with part one of the challenge then then it ends up being in all the parts but I just noticed here if I go to part two this one that the community contributions aren't there so I think whoops and because I think we probably didn't link them correctly so anyway I'll we'll talk about that in the patron slack group for those of the website contributors that are there but that's a minor thing let me look at this címon rights so I did not know this I did not know this the Navy or Stokes algorithm is is an algorithm that plays out in 2d and there's lots of wonderful examples of it it's because me I am studious things because part one is named wrong okay I can fix that I even know how to fix that thank you in 3d we don't know if navier stakes will Stokes will even work it's a 1 million dollar prize all right coding train enthusiasts let's go solve that prize I don't know that's probably for like some others YouTube's not for me you you might have some way of thinking about it that I my brain does not solve $1,000,000 prizes someday maybe it apparently it might almost some point get 1 million subscribers I don't know if it's my brain that's getting it or my just winning personality I think I got to start coding whoo okay okay yeah good look good all right let's let's stay within my will all right I'm gonna cycle the cameras oh no no I was gonna look at the community contributions apologies all right so this is epicycles redrawing with a user drawn loop by li LM Narayana and so looks like if I draw let me draw something like a figure eight and then i'ma hit start I love that do I have to press the key oh I press a key maybe or maybe it just took a while and got it now we can see nobody this is by the way is exactly what I'm gonna do I'm gonna expand this to work this way so you can see the epicycles are tracing the path but there's one set of epicycles rather than two one for the X is one for the Y's and I like that I can I love that you can do this with the slider whoops all right so there's some interface stuff that one thing I guess if I'm giving feedback here is like it's beautiful it works great I'm not really sure how to operate it it was doing like a really cool thing where it was like computing it and almost like the lines are just kind of wiggling into the spot and that was sort of beautiful but I didn't know to start me and start the epicycles dark my drawing reset oh is that so that might be something to look at there now rainbow units unicorn train driver by Juan Carlos Ponce Campuzano let's look at this one oh this is p5 web editor and there we go oh and I love about this so this is I don't I don't know that I'm going to necessarily actually I might have a way of showing how this works but look this is this we can increase or decrease the number of orbits so for example we just have two orbits this is all we get and the camera went off that's good so this would be a great feature to add to mine once I get it working as well so you can see this is what happens when you only have two orbits twentyeight orbits so gruesel house just making a wonderful gift the all you need is now to put like turbulent flow is the bet better I don't what somebody like me text Turk turbulent flow over laminar flow or something I'm not my see it is it twenty minutes now this is exactly what I stopped being able to speak or make any sense that means it's time to tackle a complex mathematical formula anyway this is great this is basically showing you exactly what I would like to do today in this coding challenge epicycles approximate curve oh look at that oh I love this oh that is wild so you can kind of approximate the curve based on the number of epicycles that is really cool okay alright so guess what I mean if all goes according to plan in about an hour I'm gonna leave I don't know if I'm gonna do that KN Vic today in about an hour I'm gonna have exactly that and all the code for it and I will have explained it and I am also going to start from this so I'm gonna start from this and start from this okay so actually before we get started I would like to write this formula up on the whiteboard so please listen to the vistit song as always I always forget to dis stop it stop it stop this done I need to see the camera this star this star the star this star song never forgets to this start somebody composed that song for me alright almost done here whoops I missed something give me a second I'm just I think I can show you what I'm doing here I'm just writing out the formula so I have it for reference so big X sub and right I'm an automat and here no sub K right big X sub K equals summation from n goes to zero to big n naught n minus 1 of little X sub and multiplied and there's that this is sort of a dot product and I'll get to why that is okay all right house I feel like I want to switch the battery on the mic so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna mute the mic for a second just just so I know that okay I should be bad have two bars so there's less of a chance of it less of a chance of it going blank okay sorry ah I'm all tangled up here okay I'm ready to go the code up here and we go okay all right so by the way if you haven't watched my live streams before I waste a lot of time mostly and then I attempt to do a coding challenge our tutorial and later the different pieces of it get edited into smaller shorter bitesized videos that end up at different playlists so now is the time where I do the weird thing where I pretend I'm just like showed up here and nothing so that happened to the last half an hour happened ok hello it is time for yet another video about the Fourier transform and epicycles now you might be asking yourself what why I mean what's wrong with you what's this weird on Elfie obsession you have with Fourier transform that's a good question I'm not so sure actually but I do know that there is absolutely at least if not more one thing that I feel is very important to demonstrate to you as part of this series this now threepart coding challenge about drawing a path with the epicycle epicycles and the discrete fourier transform algorithm alright so what I want you to look at here from the previous coding challenge is this this is the coding train train logo being drawn by two sets of nested orbits and the frequencies amplitudes and phases of these orbits are all calculated from the discrete Fourier transform algorithm the discrete Fourier transform algorithm takes it over here and this is going to look like what are you crazy I'm not gonna watch the residents video but just stay with me or don't stay with me but stay with me if you if you feel so inclined don't worry if this looks crazy and weird to you I'm gonna help you through it yeah and actually I did this already if you and you might want to stop and go back and watch that first video but what the discrete fourier transform does is it takes any signal and that signal is we're represented here by X sub n signal and you can think of the signal as really just a list of numbers 1 5 10 negative 3 7 9 4 right it's just a list of numbers it's saying that these could be the X values of a path it could be the yvalues of a path they could be the values of a sub Soundwave there's so many types of things that this could be and it takes this signal and breaks it down into a collection of wave patterns each wave pattern has a particular frequency frequency meaning how many cycles does it repeat within one unit of time so how many repeats per second you might think sixty Hertz is 60 cycles per second it also breaks it down into all so there's different frequencies but there's also different amplitudes and different phases so is this wave pattern like election a little bit offset one way or the other is it is it much taller is it much shorter it breaks it down and I can visualize those wave patterns as rotating circles okay so there's a lot that's a lot there I'm sure you have questions maybe hopefully some of this stuff is covered in a bit more depth in my previous two videos or of course in the supplementary material about the Fourier transform that I'm including as links in this video's description I've talked about those way too much but in particular I highlight the three blue one brown video about the Fourier transform that you might want to check out which goes into this in more depth now so here whoops so here I have two sets of signals I have X's oh no this is why it's actually have Y's and over there I have X's I treat them separately I apply the Fourier transform to each and then I render out these rotating circles and get this path what I want to do now is treat the signal the signal is not one a list a vector and array of numbers it is an array of pairs of numbers so we could think of the signal as you know x1 of a path x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 and this is a really useful way of thinking about it because so much in computer graphics is this vector graphics scalable vector SVG's those are really just defined paths collections of points now we can do all sorts of crazy math if these points actually mean like draw a Bezier curve between them but I'm gonna do this in the simplest way and this is just you know if I had this was my path I would have three points x1 y1 x2 y2 x3 y3 and I would want to create three orbiting circles too to be able to render out this path that's what I want to do so how do what happens when the pairs of numbers go into this formula well guess what if you watch my first video I talked a bit how about how this is actually something known as a complex number a complex number is a number that has two components a real component a real number being the numbers we're kind of familiar with more office and then quoteunquote an imaginary number now the fact that it's called imaginary is unfortunate naming it's somewhat misleading but the idea is that it is a real number paired with the number I and the number I is the solution to the problem I squared equals negative 1 so this is often referred to as an imaginary number because it's kind of like what the square root of negative 1 but yet you can there is a solution to this we can that's a topic for a Khan Academy video of math video but if I can treat any one of these points as a complex number X plus so x1 plus y1 I then and that's actually what I was doing before I just was leaving out the imaginary component I just had a whole bunch of X's and a whole bunch of wise always in the real component so if I can actually have this single B and a list of complex numbers I could have this be complex numbers this is already a complex number then I just need to know how do I multiply two complex numbers together you got got that sort of baby let's let's go write some code I'm gonna go write some code because there's more to do over here but I think you they need to take a moment to breathe and absorb that a little bit and write some code hold on pause for a second I don't know I'm just a weak mine oh yes okay so a couple things people in the chat are mentioning I suppose the more traditional way to do this would be you would say x squared plus 1 equals 0 it's the solution to this maybe I'll come back and mention that I that to me is the same as this but maybe this is like an unconventional way to write it in mathematics so maybe I'll mention that then I don't understand K weak moons comment there no phase differences actually or there's no offsets what does that mean did I get something wrong there I thought the fate the phase is like the offset of where you start the angle that gif is really distracting me in the chat if it's like yelling so before I move on let me see if any of those things were like wrong just say I sent the square root of negative one before and somebody complained but that's like not the proper way to explain it it become so I was trying again I'm very very susceptible to user feedback you know not wrong I guess my question for you K week Mon is do I need to go back and clarify something or you just is your comment just like additional information that's interesting to discuss thank you for all the comments about the haircut I appreciate it I got this haircut from a wonderful new barber in Brooklyn I'm gonna go there forever now it's kind of expensive we also shared with me some like a beard oil that I've never used in my entire life I'm trying to be a more wellgroomed person the eye explanation is perfectly fine what about the phase one is the phase one fine I need to say something about the phase no need okay okay okay okay okay okay okay so now we're coming back to the coach whoops what's wrong oh no all right I got to do this okay let me cycle the cameras while I'm here we're gonna check the microphone I still have two bars there and I have two bars here so that should be pretty good I dropped it I was Iggy I am NOT Ziggy asked me to drop the beard oil name but no oh wait till they become a sponsor thank you very much you could tweet at me I'll send it to you but I don't know this is not a buzz marketing YouTube channel unboxing maybe I'll just switch to an unboxing beard oil channel okay here we go all right so if we go back to the code where I left it off from this previous iteration which I have right here I had a particular JavaScript file for ei J s where I had my implementation of the discrete Fourier transform algorithm DFT X X being exactly that X sub n over there the array of the signal the array of numbers and then big X big X whoops where am I going it's freaking me out here and big X being this the array of complex numbers that came out that I get the phases frequencies and amplitudes okay so what I want is to rewrite this so that little X is actually an array of complex numbers and I think one way that I could do this is to actually put here I'm gonna write a complex number class now if you're paying attention or if you used p5 before you might be thinking to yourself oh just use p5 dot vector because actually I'm just gonna swing on it here over to the Wikipedia page about complex numbers look at this this is how you represent a complex number it is a vector in the complex plane where the what we think of as the Y ax is the imaginary access what we think of as the xaxis is the real axis and right here it says a complex number can visually be revision represented as a pair of numbers a B forming a vector on a diagram called the I never knew this Argand diagram ooh look at that we're stuff um so I could just use the fact that p5 has a vector class but I kind of want to pick the time to really think this through and I need to do complex number multiplication which is different than just like a vector dot product perhaps so it's similar but anyway so just let me do it myself so I'm gonna write a constructor I know that I should call these a and B maybe so one way to do is like a comma is a plus bi I think though I might stick with the real and imaginary so let's say real and imaginary but I'll leave these a and B so this is my complex number so this is what I wanted to do first so I just have a complex number and if I go back to the main sketch instead of having two separate x and y variables I'm gonna get rid of this let's get rid of Y everywhere in this code you know weird took away I'm kind of simplifying things let's get rid of Y everywhere well I'm not going to worry about this right now I'll come back to this in a little bit let's comment that out and let's so what I had before I you know again you probably want to watch the previous video is I have this big file that just has a ton of XY points for the path of the drawing and I separated them to separate x and y's and now what I'm actually going to do is say constant C equals a new complex number with the real component as the X and the imaginary component as the Y and then I'm going to push that into X so that array is now an array of complex numbers with the x and y's and in fact then I want to go here and say like you know what I don't want I don't need to treat these as separate real and imaginary components I have this idea I'm going to call it like the sum as a new complex number with 0 0 then the ideas I could say some dot real plus equals some dot imaginary plus equal right I'm going to treat this as a complex number object with two components the problem is this is no longer correct so I need to be everything is right but this no longer flies this asterisk is multiplication cosine of Phi is a floatingpoint number it's like a complex number with no imaginary component X previously X index n was just a single number so I need to rethink how these because this is now a complex number how do I multiply a complex number with another complex number that I have to completely rethink this okay kind of like took a long time to explain that but why not so the next step is for us to work out a complex number multiplication so typically you know if I'm going to if I'm gonna want to implement complex number multiplication in my source code I could actually just look up the formula for it and put it in the code but no electric behind today I started early today let's actually do it here so if I have two complex numbers let's say I have a plus B I and I want to multiply that and often reference this as references the dot product this is exactly what I have here by the way I want to multiply that by let's call that C plus D I then how do I do that well guess what what's this multiplication property called commutative we get the communitive you're gonna have to stop and look that up I'm over here commutative property of multiplication come on just give me like give me like an image to show me I'm thinking about this correctly no no no commutative is this oh yeah come you know associative no identity no commutative is any order no associative no associative distributive thank you thank you yes distributive thank you I knew us all right record scratch sound a commutative is the property of multiplication or addition where I could do these in either order and I would get the same result the distributive property is the one that I'm looking for where I can say a times well this a it's gonna distribute multiply times C plus this so I'm gonna say a times c plus a di right a times c plus a times di plus bi times C which is I could write as B CI plus well if this is crazy this is the fun part plus B I times di which is B D I squared hey guess what remember how I wrote up on the board over here I squared equals negative 1 by the way somebody pointed out that the traditional way you might see this written is like I is the solution 2x squared plus 1 equals 0 you see that's the same thing x squared equals negative 1 we could also think of it as the square root of negative 1 although somebody a youtube comment I had earlier said that's not a good good way to describe it but whatever this is negative 1 so guess what this becomes negative 1 which means this is just a minus and now a complex number is real and imaginary components what's the real the real component is a C minus BD and the imaginary component also I could pop out that distributive property again is a whoops ah a dplus sorry plus B C I so this is the real component and this is the imaginary component we have just done what is why you can't believe this is the coding train first complex number of mathematics now that the truth of the matter is I could probably spend a whole video many videos building out an entire complex number class but I'm just gonna stick to what we need which basically is just the multiplication foil oh yeah I've heard this is called foil first outer inner last yeah I've heard that foil foil oh yeah first of all did I get that right let's just check it complex number multiplication no one does no one's saying I did it wrong a co Jai use the same naming a a plus bi c plus di a AC minus BD plus ad plus BC yes okay great first all right just in case just to be sure I quickly googled how do you multiply complex numbers and the same notation is here and the same answer dare I say is there and then I was also reminded also by the chat that there is an acronym foil for a way of remembering this first outer inner last first outer inner light I don't understand what that means who's the first outer inner last refer to oil man first oh oh I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it I get it look how I figured it out first is you first multiply a and C together then you multiply the outer which is a and D right okay hold on first first outer inner last first outer inner last we've got a new coding train song called foil foil foil which also could stand for F oil which would be a useful acronym as well in our day and age okay now all right let's move this along here we're gonna have to edit that last little bit out don't get flame to the comments all right okay all right everyone okay we're getting close so now I need to just replace these two lines right I need to replace oh actually let's do this in a different way okay sorry all right so now okay we are ready now we can add a function here called multiply C so C being another complex number and I want to create another and the answer is a new complex number and the answers real component is first multiply the first of each which is this top and this is A's and the and the complex numbers a plus the out oh whoa first outer inner oh my god wait hold on let me let me sorry I let myself get way too distracted we come back to this so I'm gonna implement I was I was just gonna write the answer here but I have this complex number class so let me do a multiplication function okay Matt you re not a yes exactly exactly ah okay so confusing okay all right it's time now what we can do is take this result that we've got here and add it to the complex number class as a multiplication function so let's imagine I am saying I have a complex number dot multiply another complex number which I'll call C and so one the one complex number is this and the other complicacy so I need to make the the real component is this real component times I'm looking over there the whiteboard at this formula times C is the others real component minus this real component no yes no no this imaginary component because written this be over there times the others D is its imaginary component okay and then the imaginary component is this real component times the others imaginary component plus this imaginary component times the others let's see see see see is the others real component let's take a moment to meditate on that and wait for the chat tell me I get it wrong and then I'm going to say return a new complex number with this real component and this imagine okay so now I should be able to say some dot add X index n oh I need a new complex number okay so I also need now I need to make a complex number I'll call it C for what where's my marker I need to make a complex number that is cosine of this and negative sine of this okay so this is the this is I did this before but I just never bothered to separate it out so my my complex number is a new complex number with cosine of Phi and negative sine of Phi that's the complex number and then the if I take a sorry X some dot add X sub n dot multiply C so I want to add up this complex number multiplied with C added up to the sum what does that mean I need an add function and so if I go back to the 48 of the Fourier class up here I can write an add function which also takes a complex number and I just add the real components together and the imaginary components together like this now I've done something sort of terrible here where the add function adds to this particular complex number rather than returning a new one and the multiply function returns a new one and that's that's definitely an opportunity for refactoring this later but I'm gonna just leave that for now this is not good objectoriented programming design me about wanting to be static but I'm gonna leave that as is oh okay then I can say some and I'm just gonna do this let's just let's just leave this I could write a divided function but I'm just gonna leave this as this and I think dare I say this is now done this is now the version and some of the chat is telling me I've made a mistake so hold that thought this this is that this is the version of this algorithm where this array is no longer just an array of floating point numbers but is an array of complex numbers all right what did I get wrong see not other where did I write that where did I write mother ah yes this is see I was saying other in my head whoops but it is see thank you so let's just see uh dare I say let's just console.log Fourier X and see what I gets re is not defined for a line 33 I'm sure I forgot oh boy oh boy I forgot that now all of this is in an object again I could I could put in I should put in the complex number class a magnitude function and an angle function but I'll just do it this way and then I have to say this I'm just gonna this really should be refactored but I will leave it like this just to see if it works great so here we go and we can see what does it look like I have a real component I have a frequency I have a phase I have a real where's the imaginary component huh okay let's go back ah the imaginary component let's try that again I have in each one of these a real component and imaginary can't see this a real component and imaginary component of frequency of phase and amplitude those are all the things I need now we're not going to know if this worked till I try to draw it all these numbers they're there there's no not a number but I'm just going to hope there's a lot more code for me to write before I could actually run it so that this Tiffany sound is a premature all right so a couple things one is it's complaining to me that there's some left over for EI Y and sketch 958 oh okay well that's just the length I only have 48 X now whoops no errors this is a long timpani sound so I just need to do the epicycles this is stuff I wrote in the previous coding challenge it's calculating all the upper cycles based on a particular Fourier series that was calculate from the Fourier transform I don't need via separate VX and V Y so and I can just basically this is actually simpler now I don't need these lines and what I should be able to do is then it should actually just be this ironically it's a lot simpler right because all I need to do is get all the epicycles the epicycles return this function epicycles which I never liked that I capitalized the C so let's fix that this epicycles function basically goes through and calculates all the XY positions of the circles and angles it was done before but the same function should stand and now oh there's still an error in the hold on hold on hold on I'm being told that there is still an error in the multiply function this times are e this real real like this this CC this this CC real imaginary real real real real imaginary imaginary real imaginary imaginary real I think it's right it looks right it looks right error line 14 I think people are I think the problem is some people watching in the chat or like from 10 minutes ago and so they're seeing the error I'm pretty sure I fixed it the error that they're referring to okay so matsya we can in post I don't think we need this extra check that I just did cuz I think it actually was fine thank you thank you thank you Challenge is now done look at that whoo all right so that is the Fourier transform now okay quickly quickly quickly let's not go just yet I really vastly prefer the version where the user has to draw their own thing so oh there's also many things we could do you know what's interesting about this I'm this video needs to end but here's something you could try like for example where where am i doing the epicycles so in this episode close function I am doing all of them but look what happens if I just change this to one right that's just doing just the first episode if I change this to two these are just two epicycles and I could speed it up potentially if it's a lower number this is five so you can see this is the coding train logo kind of with smooth out and sort of much more primitive with only five epicycles you can kind of see how the contour of the cloud that looks sort of like cloud rainbowy thing is there but certainly you know I'd have to get up to like 50 and we can see with 50 we can start to see oh this looks much more like it but it's a much curvier so there's a lot of ways and also I kind of like one thing I like so that's one thing you can try another thing you can try is I think it looks just really interesting without drawing the path so like what happens if I don't draw the path and also what happens if I don't draw the circles I really like just looking at this crazy thing because if you look at this could you possibly imagine what it's doing but I could then so I could create an interface where I change the way I'm visualizing it use different colors speed up slow down vary the number of epicycles that's a lot of things you could do to sort of play around with this idea I think what I would like to do right now very quickly however is go to this one user drawing so this is this is another version of the coding challenge that I made where the user draws something and very quickly let me bring in my new discrete Fourier transform algorithm to this one just so we can see this at play so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go over here to Fourier yes I'm going to paste it into here and so I now have the new algorithm there then we go into sketch KS and the drawing is so again I don't have X's and Y's just just the X's and the X is a new complex number with drunk with the x and y of the drawing as a component just want to see how quickly I can get this to work then I'm sorting it and then all of this is the same and then here this is just creating the drawing offset by the middle of the screen and then put that offset in here same sort of thing I can just change this I don't like that that function had the capital C in it so I must fix that as well little refactoring now instead of later I can get rid of these lines and here we go and now 26 I'm missing a parenthesis ah you know the parenthesis here and now all right let's see I'm gonna draw a little cat this is gonna be really sad what this doesn't work it has to be a continuous path be interesting to try to do this without like a continuous path you can see it did it calculated it but I need a better sound than that trombone thing it's a little cheesy I mean all this is cheesy for me what is not defined I better not do an elaborate drawing next time huh before I so let's just real Julien really quick okay now it works okay would you mind so now this really is the end of the coding challenge there it is Fourier transform of a complex number series into orbiting epicycles drawing this beautiful cat sound it's cat thank you very much for watching if you make something from this please share with me one thing you might try is go look at that quick draw data set from one some of my previous coding challenges or maybe these sketch are an N machine learning model you that those are the interesting things to combine with this right I think there's some interesting possibilities there okay what what what see you soon ohhkay week mon is saying okay week mine is saying try and approximate version so I can't do that because I didn't store at the point I mean I could do it again I could add that to the drawing what time is it 1130 huh well this video is gonna be a half an hour okay less than that this won't be a really long coding challenge am I crazy because I start at 1030 I wasted a half an hour now do it in 3d you go it in 3d what I think is also fun to do with this I'm gonna lose that cat now is I could draw a heart no no that's not what else that's a nice one actually simpler simpler drawings almost have more interesting but what I what I meant to do not that is I meant to just actually see how close to a circle I could draw that's terrible and you could see like that's pretty interesting to see like how close now I could try to trace this circle like how perfectly of a circle can I draw yeah that's pretty cool look at that that is wild I love that like to see there basically that's the air it's the error of the circle so what would it look like with just you know you should definitely read it in SVG files and do it yeah that would be a great thing to do so all these things are things hopefully you all as the viewers will watch and be creative is there a way to get the circles to sit outside each other is there a way to get the circles to do the camera just go off yet I don't understand what that means Oh to like well I mean I could certainly be more thoughtful about how I'm rendering them I don't know exactly what you mean about to sit outside of each other but yeah how to extract points from an image yeah that's a good question I don't know how to do that I think there's a variety of different ways you could do that certainly an SVG in theory is exactly that but an SPG is gonna have all this information in it about the different kinds of curves and vertices and how the shape is actually constructed that would be a good topic for another time enough anybody has any really good suggestions try to draw a square oh yeah that's a cool let's do that thank you for like distracting me from that question yeah I don't I don't there's I think a variety of techniques for doing that different code libraries actually will do this for you like for example there's processing just have this library called geometry I think it still exists which will extract the path from like a font I don't know if it does generic SVG's processing as an SVG loader I mean to something called a piece shape and it may have some algorithms in there that then allow you to extract the arbitrary vertices but yeah me I'm sorry says I also do the circle on an even rate although I could do also this thing called RDP RDP algorithm is rammer Douglas puker is not the right name for it is decimates a curve decimates a curve composed of line segments to a similar curve with fewer points so this would be also I should do this as a coding challenge I need to do this we need to add this feature to ml 5 in the sketch RNN class anyway let's try the square that's pretty interesting to see but once again I could feed in welcome new member David Schneider hello thank you the lights are flashing in my house by the way joined in the middle of the mountain lights started flashing last night we up I think I'm gonna have to turn that off for a while I'm sleeping but thank you whoever choice in the night last night right it'll be interesting I mean one thing I'll be interesting to actually just to do Fourier transform to like the path of a like a flocking agent and think there's so many possibilities here let me check the super chat membership log okay that's the regular chat ah okay so thank you new members Benjamin grosser ty Smith mister Uggla thank you for your sponsorship of me getting the original book of random numbers and thank you David Schneider and remember what about a star alright okay okay this is this is the point I make this and then you can go have fun with it I don't know if I have the energy for the kan thing right now this is kind of cool there you go there is the star or what could I do today so I guess I could I have to go at 1230 so there is 45 minutes I mean part of me wants to just do one multiple to stay true to my like multiple livestreams one thing one thing per live stream like a I feel like that took a lot of mental energy towards got out and I'm a little bit drained I think starting the canine stuff that's too big of a project to try to tackle in the next 45 minutes that needs a whole session so I could dare I say I could dare I say just do like one more of these and load the quickdraw dataset people are saying KNN please oh that makes me sad please do kN all right all right all right all right let's erase this I'll do a little of the KNN the KNN stuff by the way is covered in the live stream I did it grow Paris I could also just sit here and do a dramatic reading of that paper on lattice boltzmann flow I would make sure all this is saved I'm gonna be uploading this not to worry it's gonna take a minute for me to set up here sign in here alright let's try to do the KN thing today I did I did sort of promise it and so I need to do the twofactor thing there's like a security thing mean these authentication codes come and go I don't can't imagine there's a reason for me to worry about typing it in here pretty sure we haven't updated the reference yet let me check yeah can and it's not on here where's the ml5 stuff I'm looking for I'm looking for where I last left off and this is gonna go on the beginner's guide to machine learning I don't think this will be a coding challenge and I'm just looking for where that's duh I know I mean I don't really it's fine I don't need I don't need it I just was curious um so let's make directory a cannon and let me just grab this is good to grab I think his current version I'm just getting myself ready it's some starting code I'm I am just getting so I want to start with base code that already has the video in it why is this not formatting that's weird why is my code formatting not working unsaved we've got going here this thing initialize our sketch line one okay um hold on why first of all there's a 7.3 FP v now oh I can't do it that way if it's gonna be global variable okay okay so that's working sorry hold on I just want to start I'm this is gonna go in just so you know where this is going this is going in so not even here I don't have that as a shelf anywhere on my homepage okay this is going in here so basically what I'm about to do will be in this playlist probably around eight prettier extension at the bottom is showing an X which means you have a syntax error that's why it's not formatting okay thank you so this is going to go I think in this playlist that's why I'm gonna start with this base code let's see does this run already so that just seeing if this is only if this is going to work okay yep does this matter I'm ready yeah okay great all right so so I'm almost ready to start it still skates 1150 and then was I going to say what else do I need oh yeah why is my prettier not working oh now it is working oh there was just some air ah but I want single quotes I don't really care I'm not gonna I'm not gonna worry about this okay I'm gonna oh it's double quoting it automatically that's fine I don't care I don't care all right okay okay please hold test one two cause my microphone doing two bars two bars all right all right question how do you say this word how do you pronounce logits logits how do you say it what is it short for something define logits the logic function ok hohoho loge it legit it's a little bit of a cold can I hear it no loge it would seem the log odds the logarithm of the odds interesting logits like logics here's this low look that that specifically says low jet half an hour later logits logits lodges it can't possibly be wrong because it's on YouTube put it on Google Translate that's an interesting idea lock it log it I don't think that's right Loggins Loggins what if I what if I want it to be in French yeah I like that better I don't know lo JIT nobody knows nobody knows nobody knows nobody knows how to pronounce his word machine learning pronounce logits pronunciation whoa that's low this would be lo lo right lo JIT lo jet I'm sorry but I cannot possibly teach k9 cuz no idea put down flow jet logic low jet alright I'm gonna just go with low jet because that's what it says let's just try one more economic job rumors well no I don't want well I don't want like all these stuff well they tricked me look they got me with the start now button logic regression hmm not you to aggression larger progression I guess it's logit seems to be logic logic regression a larger progression logit regression logic regression not you to regression a lot of logits all right I'm putting that aside now I've got like a logit all right I mean good point Bruno says wrong pronunciation he goes more comments correcting you more video relevance for the YouTube algorithm okay so I'm gonna basically okay oh this is this is not using K&N classification oh hello annoying that's fine that's funny this is using the other way of transfer learning that's fine so we will keep the teacher one machine up this is an experiment that lets okay No do you hear that weird sound there's like a weird highpitched sound Luigi okay great I am ready we're gonna begin this video logit logit logit logit I'm gonna say logit all right I'm not really super prepared but let's do this anyway oops this camera is off apparently no oh whiteboard camera went out that's not a good sign oh dear oh there we go okay okay hello I am back in the beginners guide to machine learning with ml 5 and today I am continuing this series and I'm going to do a few videos about something called kN and classification and the thing that I'm going to use it and apply it to is building your own teachable machine now this is the teachable machine project from Google Google Creative Lab demonstrating this idea of transfer learning taking a pre trained model and using it as a foundation to train a new model on top of didn't you already make these videos there was that whole thing with the feature extractor and classification regression and saving the model yes you are right I did already make those videos however I'm going to basically do the exact same thing again but with a slightly different technique and that technique is called cannon classification which has some advantages there are pros and cons to both these techniques and at the end maybe I can sort wrap up and look at why you might pick one over the other but the main advantage one of the main advantages of KNN classification is it's sort of training the training the model is happening as you're adding new images as opposed to a separate step and I'll get into why that is in a bit so this is the teacher machine project you can go to teachable machine with Google comm and what I'm gonna do is I've already trained this and so if I'm just standing here in the middle it's thinks it's I've trained it doesn't know I'm just me standing here with kind of like a angry look on my face that's orange my hand to the left as green my hand to the right as purple so what I want to do is emphasize that what you can actually do is build a gesture based controller for some type of game using this technique you could do this with the other way as well but it's not something I really looked at it as just a new way to like classified new images but here let's think about if I'm trading a model in real time to understand that I hand is holding up on my left and my hand is holding up on my right or I'm I know hands up at all you could imagine I could control a character a pong paddle to move left or right and maybe up or down so that's what I'm gonna do it's going to take a few videos as a bunch of things to get for but that's the idea all right so you can play around with this website to get a sense of this is a really nice interface there's an ml 5 version of this this is built with tensorflow J s ml 5 which is a library built on top of tension large s we have a similar version all of this work was done by sorry I'm in the wrong place all this work was done by yuning she 4 ml 5 and yuning she has been teaching a class called machine learning for the web at i TP and why you thank you so much for you tuning for allowing me to be inspired by and use your materials in these tutorials hopefully yunying will come and be a guest again on the coding train and to show some additional examples of things you can do with kN classification and you can highly recommend you look through this syllabus and examples and there's also a whole presentation about Kanan classification that's eating slides that you could look at but what I'm gonna actually follow is this article written by Nikhil flora who is one of the creators of tensorflow das one of the members of the research team at Google Google brain developing tensorflow yes you can see here and this is a notebook about how all of this stuff works and I'm going to basically go through this but not use the code here the code that's provided here if there is any code wait hold on yes sorry Matt you can do a nice slide it there I'm not going to use this code which is kind of the raw tensorflow j/s code I encourage you to look at it and think about how it works and and you might this might be a place where you actually want to get more lower level into it but I'm going to use the new ml 5 k9 classifier feature that is in the ml 5 library now this feature is only in the light you're gonna want to make sure you're using at least version zero point 2 point 1 of ml 5 so as of version zero point two point one the canand classifier is part of ml five but I will mention at the time of this recording that documentation is not yet up on the website but hopefully by the time this video is released as part of that playlist you will find the documentation on the website ml 5 j s org alright so now let's do this okay slide URL okay all right all right so let's start going through this article and let's start right here at this moment of background mobile net now this is mobile net the mobile net model is something that I've used in just about almost every video up until this point so if you've been watching the playlist you're somewhat familiar to it mobile net this is our first step load mobile net and mobile net is a machine learning image classification model that's been trained to recognize 1,000 classes of images and it was trained based on a huge database of images known as image net this is typically I've said this before but this is a database that exists for researchers to use and try to develop machine learning algorithms with but it's not necessarily a model that just works particularly well in kind of like generic applications of image classification out in the world because it knows a lot about birds and dogs but not anything not about a lot of other stuff that appears in the world however it is a good basis to load to the first step one is to load this model it's a good basis from which to extrude this feature extraction process this transfer learning process which we did before and we're gonna do now in a different way so the next step is to then create create what's called a feature extractor so this I'm gonna I'm going to show you in the code this is actually basically what I've done before so this is what mobile net does here you can see it like can look at an image it could tell you what the probability of a particular class like Egyptian cat tabby cat tiger cat remote control apparently there is a like almost two percent chance it's a remote control okay cat you are not a remote control to me all right so now what I have already which is basically from my previous examples is a and let me just fill that out what I have already which is basically from my previous examples is a sketch that loads the image from the webcam and display displays it in the window and I also like I said have a reference to the ml5 library and I also have this feature extractor loaded so I'm using p5 I'm connecting to the webcam using a p5 library to connect to the webcam and draw the webcams image and then I'm using ml 5 to create a feature extractor with the mobile net model so now we can go back to Nikhil's article and scroll down but like ok so this is actually this is the end result that Kat softmax so what does this mean so the mobile net model is a neural network that expects an input of an image that image comes in and it's processed over a variety of different layers so the image is like transformed and processed and twisted and turned and all of that is the neural network process which you know you'd have to refer to some of my other videos and other reference materials to understand about how more how this works underneath the hood but by the end what it gets is a big vector a big list of numbers that are all probabilities they all add up to 100% and if you look at that here that's what we're seeing here and we're seeing all the way over here like these classes have a very high probability so somewhere in here we're getting this like number like 0.9 you were getting 0.7 maybe we're getting point zero five and all of all sorts of other numbers they add up to one hundred and point nine is probably this particular number is the number that corresponds to the probability of it being an Egyptian cat so this is what mobile net would do on its own but both this stage is called the softmax stage softmax is a fancy term for normalizing the output of all of this process to a set of probable the values that all add up to a hundred percent but there is there are stages before one stage before the state before is called the logits and I really I felt like by the way before I record this video I smell like a half an hour trying to figure out I pronounce it whether its logits or logits and a lot of places said low jets and some other places said logits I'm gonna go with logic like logic or logical but you can see this is actually what the logics look like it is the unnormalized the nonnormalized output of the neural network it is a layer I shouldn't be using my hand I have an eraser it is the layer right before this is called the logits and it's just like a lot of numbers who knows you know it's probably normalized within some type of range actually but it's a whole lot of numbers and softmax is applied to get this last output which is good for classification but this layer all of these numbers this is referred to as the features I know I explained this in a previous video but in case this this is useful to sort of give this another try and it's kind of again we haven't really gotten to the next step is where something pretty different is gonna happen this is still the same as before and so we can look at it this is this is what those cat logits look like and you can notice there's Peaks still around here but there's lots of other stuff going on and you can see the Keele rights this is a semantic semantic fingerprint of the image right it is this is basically the essence of the image the boiled down acid miracle essence of the image as perceived by the bubble net model so because an image itself right let's say this image I forget what the dimensions mobile net requires is is like maybe 224 by 224 pixels this is like a lot of numbers so you could say this is the literal numeric representation of the image is all of the RGB values of every single pixel but that's too many numbers work with and compare and try to make sense of the image so this pretrained model has already learned how to boil it down to just one thousand numbers and if we have one thousand numbers we can start to compare this image to let's say another image so this is the feature extracting extraction getting these features that essence the semantic what was what it wanted to kill right semantic fingerprint of the image if I have two semantic fingerprints of two images that are arrays of numbers there's lots of math that I could start to apply to them I could say well how similar are they well how similar are they compared to these other images or what if I were to sort of like move interpolate between one image to another and you've seen some of these maybe like our artistic visualizations of the output of neural networks as like moving through you might hear like walking through the late into space so this idea of like interpolating between the features of images to generate something all this is interrelated but here this now finally is the moment where I can say this is how it relates to K N and classification because K and M stands for K nearest neighbors so if we get the logits for an image I could say well what other images have I seen previously that this semantic fingerprint is very similar to then this image is within that category of those images that's K nearest neighbor so I'm gonna wrap this up and we're going to start implementing the code in the next video but let's take one more step let's actually look and see with ml5 how easy it is to get those logics so I'm gonna come back over here and I am going to industry this is my code right so in my code I have the video and I have a feature extractor the feature extractor I'm just calling it features is preloaded with the mobile net model so now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say I'm just gonna have house pressed which is not what I'm gonna want to do ultimately and I'm going to say features dot infer video so the infer function is the naming I'm a little unsure about this naming but it's what the maybe it'll change at the API at some point but this is the idea of inferring the logits from this particular image so this could be a static image but since I have the video to whatever the snapshot of the video is right now and this could go into the logits this is basically giving me that particularly object and I'm gonna do something that it's gonna look weird I'm gonna say console.log logits like shouldn't that show me just an array of numbers not not exactly but I'm gonna show it to you let's see what happens so let me refresh this okay the model is loaded now I'm gonna click and you see what Oh what well this looks kind of dtype float32 okay floatingpoint numbers there's a thousand of them what's all this nonsense look at all this this looks crazy well guess what we just waited by accident are kind of on purpose there's a different purpose into TF Jas territory now we we to continue writing this code we don't ever have to look at the tension flow digest documentation but this isn't moment to realize like ml five isn't some magical thing that exists on its own it is operating on on top of tension flowed at us meaning it's managing something called it the tensors for you what's a tensor a tensor is basically a fancy word for an array of numbers or a matrix of numbers and so the logics are a tensor it's a onedimensional array of all those numbers so there are actually a tensor I can actually look at those values in the console by saying logits I can actually logic print so let me do that now and if I click here now you're gonna see there it is now it's not printing it all out but you can see like oh that looks like an array of numbers and another way I could do it is I could say console dot log logits data sync so data sync is a function these are functions that are part of tensor flow GIS and you can go back and look at my tensor flow tasvideos as back where I goes to them this more specifically this is a function that gives me dot data as a regular array so last step here would be to do this click and there you go this is the this these are the logics this is the digital fingerprint of that image so we are now ready we now hopefully from watching this video you understand me a little bit about what can and classification might be but that's what I'm gonna get into that you're loading mobile net the pretrained model you're creating a feature extractor which knows how to pull out the logits of the of the mobile net model with a given input image and then we're passing in an image from a video and instead of getting the classification getting just that digital fingerprint and that semantic digital fingerprint this is exactly what we're going to do in the next video to train a model a cam and classification model alright so if you want to keep watching then keep going in this playlist if the video doesn't exist yet it's because I'm still working on it but it'll be there soon bye okay wait a second so how many so how many horrible mistakes did I make I guess I've been looks like from gofaster Dan all right I like to explain things we can edit it down it is 1220 I'll see if I can finish this today so I think I was kind of conflating I think I was being looseygoosey I guess maybe I'll mention us the beginning with my kind of oh it's an array it's a vector it's a tensor technically speaking and maybe I'll mention this when I start than a tensor is an ndimensional I don't know array is the right way but like an ndimensional set of numbers but it's Simon right and dimensional thing right not really in writes and dimensional collection of numbers whereas an array is an array a list of things in code so it's that these are similar concepts but there are some there's some nuance there tensor is a much more sort of like generic term for this idea okay they are tuples not vectors okay let me just look at the definition of a tensor no not tensor flow what can I say besides the thing yeah could we possibly write this in a more confusing way tensors of geometric rot but I mean it is accurate that's what a nice yeah I think I think I don't need to get into the detail of this so but I will I will mention something I will I will mention that okay all right we are ready to do the canine classification right matrix okay thank you that is actually a very good point scalar is yeah M dimensions thank you these assignments writing some very helpful things here into chat okay construct all right thank you to new member sarah bloom our what am i doing I am looking for I'm looking for France I just want to since I don't have the ml five reference to look up I have my code from the workshop in France that I'm just pulling up over here in case I need to look up the names of any functions where was that I don't remember where I put that was it is it in Schiffman github Schiffman I'm sorry I'm looking on the invisible computer repositories the tank workshop yep so I'm looking at shift github.com / shift mint / the tank workshop because the code is let me look at the yet let me look at the final sketch example I just I don't remember all the functions are name classify load classify features can and classifier okay clean an ad example okay great okay okay alright whoops Oh as I did it before the models ready okay okay all right we are ready to continue our ml5 K&N classification but I'm calling game controller I want to be able to create an interface by which I can train a little a little controller for a game to move something left and right maybe up and down that's what I'm doing it's the last video I left off with at this step where I love the mobile net model I create a feature extractor I passed in an image from the webcam and I get the logits out so one thing I do want to mention on people in the chat were helpful I was being a little bit loosey goosey with the terminology of like scalar vector matrix and tensor and so I should mention that a scalar right being like a single number is really is really zero dimensions a vector is typically like a list of numbers which is really onedimensional a matrix is thought of as a grid of numbers this is 2d and a tensor is a term to describe the sort of ndimensional possibilities of any collection of numbers so a tensor can be can be zero dimensions one dimensions two dimensions three etc so that's what those terms mean and in this case the logits come out as a onedimensional tensor and the shape of it the dimensions might actually be something different underneath the hood below yes but that's one way of thinking about so hopefully that helps clarify a little bit but let's now move on and I'm going to the next thing that we're gonna do is we're just only going to work from assuming that we have the logits and the algorithm we don't have to write ourselves I think I have a video where I do some kind of KN writing the algorithm out we will so we're like movie recommendations or something I'll try to reference that in the video's description but the next thing we need to do and I don't know what step I was on it's like four is create an ml five K&N model it's gonna be empty it's gonna be create an empty one so I'll explain what that means in a second but this is an empty one so the way that I do that let me go back to the code is I'm going to say I'm gonna make another variable I'm gonna call it k n N and then in setup I'm also gonna say k NN equals ml 5 k NN classifier I think that's how I write it let's see if that works and then if I look at it here this looks good looks like I've got one I've got some functions Oh hold on timeout wait this isn't right time out for a second here this is not with the new names this is weird there's no ml5 right okay oh hold on a sec apologies I'm not seeing the right names for the functions I don't think so on what I'm looking for is in the source scan and classifier index add example classify classify clear label clear all labels and yet when I see here is clear all classes key clear class we'd have to get my prebuilt version of the library wait I tested this the other day all right let me explain what's going on here we recently did a release of ml5 library and I thought it had the these new names for the functions in it but pmj s ml 5 I'm not seeing the new names that's the latest I could just build the library myself but I did reference saying you had to have zero point two point one I'm waiting for somebody to it's 1230 I know I know I have a little more time I'm waiting for someone to figure this out for me but like nobody is so I have to figure this out myself so when I did this was weird when I did the workshop in France I had let me download this sorry when I did the workshop in France where's the tank what I'm going to do is go to Caden image example let me just do that the sketch we created in the live stream which has all the stuff that I want to do okay so I'm going to do download okay and then I am going to weird I already downloaded this one a different one I'm going to extract it I'm gonna put it on the desktop and I'm going to what is going on with my let's see if this works whoa something's going wrong here I think I know what that problem is sorry everybody had a little we've had a little bit of an issue here there's actually a mistake in this code which I can fix I just realized which is this should not this I should not be doing until the model is ready okay so this is where I can't remember what the classes were but this is in that example this is working and now if I go to here let me just get these things so instead of using let's use this local ml 5 so still work that still works now let me use ml 5 2.10 it works what hold on worse it still has the wrong function names here looking in the wrong place I'm like losing my mind here this is so weird wait this is working yeah it's getting clearer labels that's fine it should have an error now that worked out huh but clear all classes is not a function but if oh oh I'm losing oh I'm so silly oh I was wasted so much time I get it I get it I get it I'm so silly everything was fine all along I overthought it let me now explain to you what my problem was so this is the KN object that we're working with here are all of the functions I was looking for get count get classifier data set clear lives save load these are the functions I'm looking for I went weirdly I went to here and started looking at these functions guess what these are all the tensorflow j/s native functions I have like some slightly different naming and some more stuff clear train data set matrix I was just completely looking in the wrong place everything is fine sorry for wasting your time there I have no idea where I was but I will figure that out we'll close this I will I don't need this little tank workshop won't open anymore which one I don't need this one open anymore I was in the code here and I was here ah let's see mine get a little further try at least finish this does anybody remember what I was doing they might remember what I was doing before I got lost in that I think I had I was over here and I said create an empty ml 5kn model so I walked over here and this was me creating the empty one okay well let me just do that again because I don't know I went off I went off the rails there so let me minimize this do this okay sorry everybody and I can close this out close this out okay okay all right so something something created empty ml 5kn model okay something something created empty ml v model okay now where do I want to do that so I have I have my video I have my feature extractor and now sorry I also have to go soon something something created by model so I'm going to add a new variable kN and then in setup also and I may have to move this somewhere else eventually but for right now I'm going to say KN is a new ml 5kn classifier simple as that so I have the feature extractor and the classifier I think it's time to talk about what is K&N classification luckily for us we can refer back to the Kiehl's article thank you again to Nikhil for publishing this and I'm going to skip through some of this more examples of different logits and I'm going to look down here and and look at this so this is a nice example demonstrating the idea of K nearest neighbors so let's sort of recreate that visualization over here on the board so I can talk through it a little bit let's say this is a two dimensional space it is and I'm going to put in this two dimensional space a bunch of A's and a bunch of bees now I've written them in a kind of certain way to make it very obvious in fact if I wanted to I could draw just visually I could sort of understand what's where's the critical decision boundary between these two different categories and I could kind of draw like this that's just me eyeball again I'm not sure if that's exactly those are the exact mathematical the decision boundary but and then I could say like oh if I threw a dart at the wall the darts either going to be like over here or it's going to be over here it's going to be either of Class A or of Class B it's going to be either I want to classify it now the way that K nearest neighbor works the N stands are nearest the N stands for neighbor the K stands for how many nearest neighbors are am I looking for so the way that it actually works the way that the decision boundary is computed let's take it out for a second is that if I were to look at any given point like this one let's say I have a K of three and typical you would want a K that's an odd number because what you want to do is it's basically like a voting system I want to look for the three nearest neighbors and in this thing I mean literally nearest the Euclidean distance by Euclidean distance by proximity in twodimensional space which are the nearest well I can eyeball it I could say this is the nearest this is the nearest and this is the nearest so these are my three nearest neighbors they're they all vote and three to zero this spot gets categorized as an a we could get a little more complex like what if I went over here like I said what are the three nearest neighbors well this is the nearest this is the nearest and this is the nearest ah by a vote of two to one actually this K being odd is actually irrelevant because you can have more than two classes so I'm breaking the tie as a thing but but here I could say by a vote of two to one this point is classified as a B and this is exactly what Nikhil's visualization is doing and in fact this would be nice too to actually do make do a coding challenge of just like doing exactly this like remaking this visual explanation but what I can do here is I can vary this like I can say let's look at a three class example let's make a much larger like eight and we can see here this is showing which what category it is hold on close this make this little small ah so I could see it and I can also show that decision boundary and you can see here this is the decision boundary so this is the idea of K nearest neighbor wait so that might make sense to you it you might be thinking yourself what wait something's got this like twodimensional graph at a bunch of points which ones and your each other what does that have to do with images of cats and logics of a thousand well it doesn't as something very specific to do with it in fact the reason why Nikhil picked that example in his writeup and the reason why I'm drawing it this way to explain it to you is because our brains are very wellsuited to think in small amounts of dimensions two dimensions three dimensions so you could think of each one of these points in twodimensional space as the logits that just has two values its x and ycoordinate but what the feature extractor does so I'm gonna say I'm gonna say like infer from an image right remember this step from the previous video this gives us a thousand logits a list of a thousand of the thousand numbers and I said like what if we got two of them two lists of a thousand numbers how could we compute which the it's the distance between these two things like it's weird to think about how do I think about the distance between two things in a thousand dimensional space well actually the formula that you would use for Euclidean distance in twodimensional space is the same exact formula that you would use in a thousand dimensional space beyond the scope of this video I could make another video maybe it's you know basically it looks like the square root of the difference between all the values squared added together it's like the Pythagorean theorem but actually this Euclidean distance formula is not such a good one for higher dimensional spaces it kind of breaks down because you could have a lot of the numbers similar but just one number really far away from another one so there is actually other ways of calculating distances one of which is called cosine similarity or cosine distance and actually have referee that in my word to vectorial zazz well this comes up exactly in that word to vex stuff and this is a way of looking at you could think almost as if I wanted to compare a and B I might look at the angle between them right if if this is the origin right and I'm looking at these two points in 2d space are they is there a small angle between them that's kind of like what cosine similarity is doing but what's that sort of like angle between in a thousand dimensional space but the point is if I can infer the logits from an image I can build up a database a database of let's say cat I can then use the what I'm going to do is use the ad example function so ml five has an ad example function that I give the logits and the label so I can basically build up a database of a lot of logits labeled with cat and store them so that later when I get a new one I could see where is this new one in one dimensional in one thousand dimensional space near all those cat ones this is exactly we're gonna do so in other words let's come back here and I'm going to say under mouse press now instead of console logging it out I'm gonna say KNN add example cat and actually what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna add left and right I'm gonna try to do left and right because the idea is I want to control something so I meant of example these logits are categorized as left and I'm gonna change this to keep rest this is sort of silly what I'm doing but I'm going to say if key equals forget how I do the error if key equals L again I should be building a nice interface for this but this is going to just do the trick right so what I'm doing now is I can now build up that database this is the model the kN model is actually just the big database of all of the logits that are labeled alright so the idea here is that I extract the features from the video when I press L on saying like this is one to the left and when I press R this is one to the right let's take a look at that go back here click in here to give it focus so I want this is confusing cuz it's not mirrored this is my left you see it as my right this is my left hand so I'm gonna use my action left and I'm gonna press L so I'm training it and then I'm gonna do this and press R a bunch of times now of course I should be consul long to see what's happening but I at least can look now at that KN object and I can look in it and see what are some functions I can call I can do get number of labels to write left and right I could also probably like how many how many examples are there but this is me training it sorry ah I didn't mean for that to come up then if that part out okay thinking thinking we're actually not too far we're not too far from being done oh two labels oh and look left and right it even notice that map string to index that's there okay so now there's a let's think so now what what about what I do let's use mouse breasts let's go back and use mouse breasts what if I get something new and I want to classify it aha so let's say this is me training it like here's a bunch of less here's a bunch of rights and when I click the mouse I want to see what it is currently so what I'm going to do now is i'm also going to infer the logits from the video then I'm gonna say KNN classify those logits uh here's the thing this is where I now need a callback so everything so far I've been able to do criticize it but this is where this is now the the computer the ml5 library and tensorflow j/s but nice needs to like do something for a little bit let me know when it's done so I am going to stay at a function called got result and I'll just write a separate function again I'm doing this in a very sort of like es5 callback kind of way you can use promises and all of that as well if you if you prefer that but I'm gonna say got result result and I'm just gonna say console.log result just see what that looks like so now I press keys to train it and you know it would be nice for me to console.log something so console.log left just so I see that it's working console.log right so I just console.log something there again if you are you doing this you probably wanna build a whole interface for this I'm doing everything with just key presses and console logs which is super awkward in terms of like user interaction but allows me to test and iterate and explain this idea more quickly alright so now refresh so what I want to do is by the way I'm gonna get an error so from Canon classify is not a function well oh I spelled it wrong classify so here's the thing I want to say like if okay I only want to do this if it's ready to classify I want to say if KN what was it what did I say can an get count or get number of labels or something I'm gonna say if can an get number of labels is greater than zero then actually do the classification pause for a second just turn off the sound there okay okay here we go I said now let me refresh and I'm going to click over here and train it left here's like 20 images train it right here's 20 images 2017 is 21 now I'm gonna click the mouse do this wrong and now five uses error first callbacks p5 doesn't and so I'm so used to just the result being the first thing but the error and any error always comes in it's the first the first argument to the callback so I'd want to say if error console I probably want a hint like you know there's many ways I could actually handle the error otherwise console.log result and got to do this again it's fine here we go okay so I'm gonna train it wait no what's to the 21 I'm gonna try to do about the same amount 22 now please say left left please say right oh no looks clicked in the wrong place no right it's that right anyway right left it's working well that's exciting so we've done it now we this is basically it right and I could just so you know by the way I could say let's add one more let's call it up one of the advantages of doing K&N like I was saying this Canon classification unlike the other feature extractor with transfer learning example that I went through previously this requires no separate training step the model is just the database of training images and it's able to do that distance calculation in real time so also I can add labels later I can add new images later so you can kind of like train and classify all at the same time in a very flexible way that's one of the advantages of doing this can and classification way all right let's let's do one more thing which is let's actually just have it constantly try to guess so I'm gonna make a label paragraph I'm gonna say label paragraph equals create P need training data then what I'm going to do is let's just make sure that's working so it says need training data there then what I want to do is this Astraeus is I'm going to have a boolean variable called ready have it be false and then in in draw write whoops what I do uh sorry everybody I want this basically since draws looping anyway there's a more elegant way I could do this as long as it's not ready and if it's not ready and there's at least one label I could start so I can start this classification and I can now say ready is true and then in the classification I can when I get the result what are the results look like they have a class index confidence confidences by label so and the actual label so I can get the label I can say label p8 HTML result label and then guess what I can do right then I can classify again I probably want to break this out into a function but I'm just gonna copy paste the code right here whoops ah this video was going very well a moment ago well as well as could be expected okay and I don't need ah no that's not right I want to do these two lines of code what do I want to do let's put this into another function go classify I mean I could think of a better name for this and actually let's take this I'm gonna do this I'm gonna make this a little nicer I'm gonna do go classify there so if this is true then go classify will refactor it because why not this callback is a little silly to have it as a separate function let's just make this an anonymous function and put it in right here so this is maybe a little show so this is what I'm doing I'm basically saying classify what is classified do it gets the logits it calls classify with the logits then it has a callback at either gives an error it labels it and then guess what it does go classify again so this is kind of this recursive just like classify it when you're done classify again when you're done classify again okay let's see here needs training data needs training data so let me do this I'm gonna give it some left whoops kind of click over here so it's only going to ever be able to classify anything as left right now and at some point it knows that it's right left right left okay let's let's train it better first of all one thing that's bothering me is it's very hard to see that so style font size this is how this is how CSS works it with p5 do too big okay let's try this one more time here we go everybody that's so loud give it lots and lots of examples of me with my hand to my left about 50 of them now let's give it lots and lots of examples of me with my hand to the right you know maybe ok now left right left right left right left left right oh yes up ok so this is good so guess what we're kind of there I mean there's so much there's a lot of stuff what's what's missing here now first of all I want this to actually be able to control something like moving a paddle left and right and then also I might not want to have to Train it every time now I think there's interesting probably a lot of really unique applications for you to make something that the user is actually expected to train their own controller there's a tensorflow Jess what examples on has an example of training your own controller control pacman I'll link to that in this video's description but in this case what I might like to show you is that I could sit here and train it for a while save that and load that model into like a different sketch which is just doing the classification to move something so um that's what I'll do in the very last video and I'll add up as well so the last next step that I'm gonna do is add saving and loading as well as a simple game mechanic to control as well and you probably you you save and load function or just call that save and load and so you might even try this yourself before you watch the next video where I'm gonna do it ok goodbye I'll see you soon okay is it 1 o'clock yeah so I definitely need to go I don't let me check my calendar sometimes I have more time than I think cuz I would be nice to just kind of finish this because there's not there's like very little left to do here okay hold on now now I'm like crazy looking at my email which I don't want to do calendar okay I have a little bit of flexibility here so much for my short life live streams alright I want to finish this I want to finish this because there's really very little left to do Wow look at that let's see if I can do down and up let me try let's just give myself a little bit of time to train it some more I'm curious how like how well it's able to just so this would be to the right actually look at my heads on the right of the screen no but if I want to move it's not I really should this is really awful like yeah I'm gonna make this to the right because I want to move it I move this way I wanted to go to this way yeah okay no this will be left I'm gonna use my vote yeah Ola let me just see do I have a okay let's see just want to see if it'll actually train according to the just the position of my head left right it works pretty well I mean the thing is I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about this all right all right we're gonna finish this off okay welcome back I'm gonna finish this ml 5kn classification example for like a gesture based controller so I just in between the last video and this one I just sort of trained a quick KN model where if my head is up here it registers as up my head is down here it registers is down over here would be to the left and over here would be to the right now you know interestingly enough you because I have a green screen here and I'm a sort of like quite a different color than the green screen I could probably just do this with some image processing and like pixel manipulation to sort of like check where my head is so with a lot of if statements that's a sort of interesting thing about like you can almost think of you doing machine learning it's looks like automatic if statement I think is one way of thinking about it but I also should note that I'm actually almost somewhat surprised that this is working because you have to remember the image classification model mobile net that this is built on is trained off of like a lot of things like dogs and cats and objects it really has never seen people there's no images in the database with like a green screen so I would have actually expected to actually think all of these images wherever I am are kind of similar according to the way it thinks about the world whereas if I were to like do this like that's going to be like remarkably different so there might be some ways that you could use the sort of the the the way the your understanding of how mobile net was trained and what kind of images were in there to have other images that are the most distinguishable for it to like learn about but this is something you probably have to do you could do through research and you could do through trial and error interestingly enough even if I move the computer rounds it's still going to work updown leftright so I'm really at a huge advantage here having the green screen but if you're using this to build some kind of kiosk installation and you have it doesn't have to be green but like a fixed background that's gonna allow users to come play with and have it work pretty well alright but the next thing that I need to do right so what I want to do is two things in this video number one I want to be able to save it so I should actually this time training it as soon as i refresh the page I'm just gonna do it it's gone all of that training data is gone so I want to be able to add savings so let's add that first and I'm just gonna do that I'm also just I'm gonna keep doing everything in key pressed if key equals S I'm going to say cannon dot save model JSON so I think this is what it is but basically all everything that it's learned all of those logits and labels are all sitting in memory and I could spit them all out into a JSON file so let's just do that really quickly without a lot of training so I'm just gonna like arbitrarily train a bunch of things up and down and then let me hit s and we can see I got this model JSON file there it is I want to put it in pause for a second here I want to drag it over into my code folder so I could actually the other thing they'll be interesting to do is let's actually take a look at it and look at this look at this what's in this craziness this is it it's just like lists of numbers tons and tons of listed numbers with with the labels and you might think uh this is so much data is it gonna run so slow how is it going to do it but actually if you look at it if you look at it reveal in finder you know I didn't have that many examples but this is just a you know 600 byte file so kind of kilobyte file about 559 bytes fired fiftynine thousand bytes but oh I can't speak anymore hold on what what's uh matchy let's do a little like editing magic here let me do that again because let's get rid of all this stuff let's have this year just to make this like a little more elegant in the final video all right let me save whoops what just happened oh it was already there all right let me save oh all right let me save all right let me grab this model JSON file I'm gonna just drag it over into my code directory so now we can see that oh shoot it's one more time like sequencing is hard all right I'm gonna press s to save then I'm gonna go to the download directory I'm gonna grab this model dot JSON file just drag it into my code folder I already have one in there because I did this a few times how was it in there okay oh my god that's weird time this is really silly I should just like forget all this editing nonsense I'm spoiled by the possibility of editing now this used to just be how it was right deep breath there's nothing there all right I'm going to click Save then I'm gonna go to the Downloads directory you can see I now have a model JSON file I'm gonna drag it into my code folder and then I'm gonna go over to Visual Studio code and take a look at it there it is look this is actually the saved K&N model all this stuff you can see there's lots of configuration information up here this is kind of the domain of tensorflow jas this is all the stuff that tensorflow toucheth needs we could kind of ignore but interestingly enough you can see like look at this it's a whole lot of arrays of how many numbers I think we're gonna get down to wait what I don't know how it stores it why is it how does it store it forget I just shouldn't have said anything yeah it stores it in some way I just assumed there'd be what are these oh these are all the examples I'm so confused I don't know how it's Orson I'm not gonna bother trying to explain these are the tensors zero one Oh cuz it's all okay I'm gonna ignore nevermind ah all right this is all the domain of tensorflow Jas and figuration stuff that's super interesting you could go we could do a deeper dive into that but we don't have to worry about that we could see that all the numbers of all the logits are all in here it's just a big file with all this stuff all the logics and all the labels and the configuration information that tensorflow jazz and ml5 needs now I should use might be thinking wow it's like a lot of stuff in there you know well how big of a file is that and actually it's just text and it's just 561 kilobytes so even if I had like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds or thousands of training images it's going to be fine you have to remember it's taken an image file which we work with all the time and boiling it down to just 1000 numbers so even though it is stored ultimately as text it's much less data and there are ways of optimizing the storage and all sorts of something that but ultimately this is a perfectly reasonable thing to do so now let's actually do a better job at training it let's actually get a better model to Train so I'm gonna hit refresh and oops oh I lost in next I HTML somehow pops timeout I deleted text so wonder somebody probably knows I don't have the chat up anymore I lost my index course Simon Says I lost my index file well I'm sorry to make this an editing nightmare Matz yeah where's the trash get that back trash where's index.html here it is this must be it interestingly yeah oh because if I click Save or s or something whatever all right let's alright we refresh and now let's try to train a new model so I'm gonna do a please bear with me about this could be we could speed this up so let's train 50 up I'm just picking 50 arbitrarily 58 it down this is left and then this is right all right I've trained it let's see if it's working pretty well right left down up that left wasn't super great let's see but I just not give it enough time let's give it some more training move around here some more see we can make that more accurate left right down up so I'm sure we could do things to improve the accuracy that's good enough I'm going to click s for save Oh what s what Network error oh that's sad okay why is this not working what is going on what no why am I getting a network error now the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different results I don't have to refresh have to now it works thank you very much let's go through this again now we can train our model and we'll speed this up for you so you have to watch the whole thing oh that's to the right all right we'll train our model and speed this up for you so you don't have to watch the whole thing this way is to the left we move around a lot over here left left left left left left left left left move over here all right we've trained it let's see how it's performing left whoo it's a little not super accurate over here I left if I go off interesting but if I'm stay here left right down let's keep it some more training over to the left where I'm like off a little bit so that'll help clean that up it's a little more accurate now down up to the right okay now let's save it all that time training it please work what am I doing wrong is it like too big is it like too much data like it's just like it must just be like too much this is a bug but where do where can I find them like the bug like there's warnings well it would be in like the network just so weird alright I'm just gonna try doing it with less date huh is it cuz there's four it should be that there's four blah works like is it just that it's too much stuff save it from the console that's a good point so I was getting about 200 examples by doing about 50 of each I think we found a bug in ml 5 yeah so I think there's a limit what is that limit this is definitely a bug always good to find the bugs I mean yeah 60 it failed at 60 that works 2530 is fine 40 is fine 50 is fine 60 fails is it a specific number there shouldn't be a limit so why I wish I could debug this and get like an actual error in ml 5 so and and I assume if I do this same thing so weird I don't think anyone's following along is this something that's weird on my browser or computer well I may not be able to finish this today I can't figure this out I guess like does it really work with like 59 so why would that be the limit 51 whoops 51 works it works oh wait I don't know how many it is yeah as soon as I got to 57 or something it failed so so people in the chat it takes a finite time to save you may be trying to save while another file operation is going so this has got to be a bug in ml5 library what is what is it actually triggering is there is there a save like in tfj s or we're doing it ourselves what school look at the ml 5 library shoot source k9 classifier let's look at save you know what could possibly get classified data set it snapping it to with the labels you think and I Oh save file oh I always like a ml5 utility so the bug could be in there it's pretty weird for sure I don't understand this is a weird way to save a file but I guess that's how you do it alright maybe what I'm going to try to do let's bring this code into my thing see if I can discover what it is I really have to go soon I really want to finish this though I'm gonna hide this stuff down here just gonna okay so now I have my own save function let's see if this works where's s can you try to print the model to the console I could how could it be the memory just like the memory of the browser is full like it's just like my session has like gone crazy alright so now I doubt that but let's try it let me just completely restart the browser if that's really the case I'm gonna laughs let me go up to 60 no it failed still so I don't think it's a whoops I was weird okay let me try my own save function okay that works does this look like it's the same as it look correct Oh interesting I did something wrong in my save function oh I'm not gonna be able to solve this am i I mean I am gonna be I can't solve this but like doing it right now is a little bit crazy I miss something here they're still at this in here I was weird that's weird oh it's not actually using it what's going on this is not happening now I'm really losing my mind maybe open the memory tab see if it's a memory issue look at chat please wait hold on I appreciate your suggestions and I'm happy to look at the memory tab but I'm just confused as to right now why my actual code isn't even seeming to run that's running save km why is this not happening so confused alright memory where's the I could also just do this with a little bit of training where's the memory here this what's going on here let's look at the network activity oops I might just come back later today to finish this 130 network now you choose to work now you choose to work and which code are you running now there's an arrogant what Oh weird now my function seems to be working why do I not get the console.log hello that I'll never understand oh but I think my model file is no good right the one that it just did it doesn't actually have the stuff in it which is why it's definitely a memory thing it can't so we of the okay so this is a bug a the bug is definitely an issue with the way that file saving is written in ml 5 it can't do above a certain size and it's only working when I switch to my file saving function because my favorite function is not actually saving the data okay so yeah so that's it so that's definitely the issue and I'm gonna have to like debug this later what I think I could possibly do right now oh just to see if I could finish this is I could limit myself to training just a smaller data set so let me just try that so all right Oh delete it index.html again how do I keep doing that I know the cameras off I'm frustrated this today was going so well until I had to go and ruin it I keep deleting the wrong file delete this file so let's see I'm just curious if I little myself to like ten examples well that was too many down left right that's good enough Hey all right so maybe I could just quickly finish this off with a smaller number of examples and then we'll fix that bug in ml5 so please bear with me just save this like somewhere just in case I need it all right all right everybody okay I'm going to try training this now and saving it here we go so I'll speed this up for you this is the right oh that's too many myself to ten all right it's time I am going to try training this and then I'm gonna save it and let's see how that goes and I'll speed this part up man let's do left let's do up down all right I've trained the model just with ten examples in each that's very small let's let's let's see how well it's working so right left down perfect so I'm sure I could do more to make it more accurate to be honest with you I just have to let you know the reason why I only did ten is there's a bug right now where it was not working once I had too many examples but hopefully by the time you watch this it'll be fixed and then you'll have to use ml five version on the screen here which is the correct one to use so that you don't aren't limited okay so let me let me save let me save yes okay I saved my model and then I can go over and I can drag it into where where are we're here and now all I need to do is add some code to load it when the program starts so what I'm gonna do now is as soon as when the program starts when the feature extractor is created I'm gonna wait to create the K&N classifier until that feature extractor mobile net is loaded and then I'm going to say KNN load model JSON and then I am going to what am i doing now that's me loading the model and then that probably has a callback to which I could say function error result you know what I don't need to worry about the arguments here I'm just gonna say console dot log K and n loaded so this is the process I have to load mobile net then I have to load my KN model and then it can just start and then I can also actually say ready equals true and I can say go classify because I could start classifying without having to train it first all right here we go I think we're almost there let's refresh I have a syntax error line 57 function oh this needs a parenthesis semicolon to use the anonymous call back there get number of labels undefined system so it's working but I got some weird error here line 63 let's see what's just happened there line 63 if not ready and KN number of labels oh so you know what in fact let's let's actually just comment this out there's no reason to wait for the training since I'm loading there we go left right down up oh that's wait this is left let's train it some more there we go I fixed it left down right up all right so it's working pretty well now let's get it finally last step let's get it to control something so I am I'm gonna say background zero I'm gonna create a position I'm going to say position I mean let me just make a separate X&Y x and Y and I'm going to say X equals with divided by 2 y equals height divided by 2 and now I am going to say I'm going to say the label is nothing and when I get a result when I get a result help me scrolling out where do I get the results yeah when I get a result I'm gonna say label equals result label and then in draw I'm going to do something very silly I'm gonna take out the image I'm going to say ellipse X Y 24 fill 255 and I'm going to say if label equals left then X minus minus otherwise if label label equals maybe I'll speed this part up to write X plus plus else if label equals up why else if label equals down y plus + and yes my allergic reaction to the switch statement is still in effect apparently all right let's go here we go move to the left move to the rock hit see myself would really help for me to see myself hold on let's not hide the video so I can see myself and here we go move to the to the left which is that way move to the left wait I really need a better training this is terrible I'm setting it to my all okay guess what I'm coming back later to fix this this is it I I need to fix that bug because without it being trained well it's not gonna work well this is all just a mess I'm gonna come back well let me just and also my left and rights are all mixed up my brain is dead the I'm gonna finish this another time this is silly I don't know why Mike so stubborn but there was one thing that I wanted to do oh yeah I wanted to at least add a constraint I'm not going to add it okay everybody thank you did you see my sending this to yourself of the future message Simon no I did not see that I will check that later okay let me I've gotta end this I must end this now and hopefully somebody can help me solve this ml5 bug and I'm just going to I am just going to chuck and say ah thank you two new members Benjamin Tai David and sera and thank you to mr. Uggla for the super chat I have to go it's going to be somewhat abrupt and also I got myself completely confused with the left and the right because my left is yep so I'm gonna if anyone can help figure out what that bug is it doesn't necessarily have to be fixed and published to ml5 because I could just like rewrite little secret code to like actually save the model without that bug and then I will come back ideally later today but my next plan for a live stream was this Friday to try to do the fluid simulation thing so if I don't come back later today to just finish this off I'll come back on Friday do the fluid simulation alright okay what do my what do I need to notice when are you uploading the code for the Fourier I will do that soon I don't know what Joel's referring to that I need to notice but who knows oh how big is that model JSON the one that worked alka is o is one megabyte so this one that I got to work is one megabyte and I don't know if I try to save it now I added a few oh yeah but I gotta go okay thank you Alka for volunteering to maybe look at that Suresh is saying I can fix it it's fixed now run I don't know what's going on okay I'll see you everybody everybody fit you cannot speak goodbye let me hit this stop recording let me now hit oh I'm still live streaming our night I get hit stop streaming here now that now this is really gonna end goodbye everybody
