good morning happy coding train day it is me Dan I was like taken aback by the fact that I had to start I thought I had another 30 seconds there there's a lot to say probably as there often is and I'm you know while you are watching the coding train perhaps at this point it should just be called the nature of coding because I am just still slogging through making the examples in the nature of code book and that's what I'll be continuing today do have some ideas for things in the next few weeks month or two where I will hopefully take a break from nature of code but I would like to by June and kind of get through the entire book we'll see if that happens but before I do any of that at all I have to test something yeah you might I don't know if you noticed something slightly different about me and no no not the haircut there can I had last week same haircut nope not this sweater that I don't think I've ever worn before although I have worn this shirt it's something else I will I will wait for a few minutes to see if anybody can notice something else that's maybe a little different and while I'm waiting I will take a brief moment to thank the sponsor of today's coding train Lang comm late is a password manager if you don't have a password manager you should have a password manager and I would Lane is one that you could try and if you go to Lang comm slash coding train you can get a 30day free trial of their premium service and then also if you choose to purchase the p m service a 10% discount everybody's got it the jet already everything yes yes new glasses but not just new frames which hopefully you ohhblue reflect okay so that's interesting let me address that so the lenses are really what I'm here to discuss because something quite big has changed I which is these are progressives I've been having a lot of trouble reading really for the last year or two and I would have to take my glasses off to read and so the options as I understand them well besides all sorts of like laser eyes options were to just get a second pair of glasses so I would switch if I'm gonna read but that's sort of silly because I could just take them off to read which I was fine doing I was that well the other option was just do nothing but the third option was get progressives which I now have and I have to say yeah I mean I've only had them for I think I got them on Tuesday so I mean like for about 48 hours in and I'm having quite a difficult time with them if I'm being perfectly honest although I'm much more used to them today than I was yesterday or the day before but I don't know if anybody watching we're all so young and youthful with your excellent eyesight oh just wait just wait until you get to be me and you need these but I didn't really rise is your but because of the way the lenses progress for distance and reading there's some distortion on the sides and we're going to create that progression and so it's my peripheral vision is less it's has a smaller cone a focal poke what's the thing Fache frustum my frustum vision is smaller but the good news is I mean all for you the viewing audience because I know your favorite part is me reading random numbers I'm looking at the chat here and this I could just do so easily now the reading is quite phenomenal and I I wasn't really able to before so we're gonna do a reading of the ceremonial reading of the random numbers with my new progressive lenses and people had mentioned there's a blue and so I did get I did I don't know maybe this is silly but I did get the blue light filter in them which hopefully is not going to be too distracting or cause like weird reflection in me making these videos but we'll find out field of view thank you I have a problem I can't remember words anymore I think it's related to the fact that I need lenses it's good stuffs all going downhill they go watch my I always say like all those videos are so old or outofdate I think I had was like I was what were with it then so let me go back and watch the old nature of code videos 931 fifty two thousand one hundred and seven ninety two thousand eight hundred and twenty three thirty nine thousand nine hundred and ninety four seventy four thousand six hundred seventy seven ninety nine thousand four hundred and seventy one fifty four thousand and sixty five fifty four thousand nine ninety six thousand two hundred and fifty six 80 thousand eight hundred twenty three twenty five thousand four hundred and seventy nine seventy thousand eight hundred and twenty three thirty nine thousand six seventy nine thousand two hundred and ninety four ninety three thousand one hundred and seventy thirty four thousand four hundred and sixty nine the music is a bit loud okay thank you that's useful to know that's a oh my goodness it certainly is sorry about that no wonder everything seemed off sorry about that I'm fixing why is blue filter useless no I I think it is useful I'm just sometimes I wonder like what's this what's the real science behind blue light filtering and what studies have been done and how effective is it how bad is blue light how effective it's the filtering but you know and you know one thing that I try to do is you know I really give myself like I should give myself like at 800 p.m. limit but 900 p.m. I try after 900 p.m. I try to look at no phone no screens nothing I'm watching a movie or whatever but and I don't want the fact that I have a blue light filter to give me an excuse if you like oh now at night I can play pokemons go on my phone not that that's what I play I don't play that no that's like that's like so two years ago and you know people in their 40s don't play that anyway so why why would I be playing that no definitely not I do not like trying to get to level 40 or anything and I don't have like extra yeah no no no no no that's somebody else it's 8 p.m. a year coincidently yes Sri young turn this off you've got to get to sleep soon too blue light for emanating it's not worth it the coding train is not worth it'll be here tomorrow morning when you wake up and our fresh I do use nightshift yes I do I do use night shift Luke is asking to use the night shift I also use that which I quite enjoy all right I would like to get into it pretty quickly I'm there's a little less of the high jinks these days on the coding train because I'm trying to I'm trying to be a serious teacher of content I'll be here till around noon and that's that let's see what other kind of OC like my screen is like distorted especially I'll look from left to right it's like a waving bubbly thing whoo okay but I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna be fine all right let's open up the Chrome browser and let me just mention one thing and I'm really not mentioning this to ask anyone to buy anything or spend any money I just want to let you know what's going on because some people have asked the coding train hoodies have hit the minimum number of orders to get made so they will be on the way nobody needs to buy anymore but I just wanted to mention that if you were interested I think maybe tomorrow I'm gonna say hey go ahead that's enough orders send them to the hoodie maker and so I don't know that you'll be able to order them anymore after tomorrow so if you were interested in getting a hooked coding trade hoodie I know I mean hopefully we can put them up for sale again or make them or make tshirts something new next time but I'm they do these are being done in limited runs in in terms of how they're being made and the quality so if you were interested in one of those now's your lucky your last chance okay I also by the way I put one of these mugs in the dishwasher here at work and it got a little faded so if you have one of the mugs you can wash it and wash it does anybody have one of these I don't have one of these if you have one of these could you send me a like picture of it or something sends me on Twitter social media whatever disk or join the discord that's the other thing that I was like to mention the discord has been as far as I'm concerned a big success I don't success is the right word but has been really productive in that it's III don't know where to tell people to go to get help specifically related to the content of my videos there's lots of places on the Internet to get code help some are you know they all have their pros and cons and they're sort of vibes and different strokes for different folks the processing forum discourse discourse it's confusing is not discord but discourse dot processing dot org is a really excellent place to ask questions about processing and p5.js specifically and I would say there's a lot of crossover between the coding train community and the processing discourse but if you want to engage with getting help from the you know laser focused coding train passengers then the discord is the place for you to do that and if somebody I know that I saw Kobe's name pop up in the chat is can post a link to joining the discourse the discord in in the YouTube chat that would be helpful now I also wanted to mention a couple other things Google Summer of Code I think this will get me to the site I can't remember if I mentioned this or not but the organization's have been announced yeah because this was announced before I probably mentioned this last week but google Summer of Code is a program that I participate in as part of the processing foundation but there are over 200 I think whoa oh no 686 over how ever many years but there are a large number of other opensource organizations that participate as mentoring organizations for google Summer of Code and you if you are a student I mean do have to be a student unfortunately or fortunately you can apply to work with collaborate with make an opensource contribution to one of those projects over the summer and get paid a stipend so again I'm not an official representative of Google or Google Summer of Code all of the administration and application process and eligibility is handled through them I'm just here because it's a program that I participate in as a mentor and would love to encourage you to apply if it's something that interests you and to the extent that I can help with that or we can maybe we can open a discord channel for people who are questions about that that's something that I would be open to Thank You Koby for posting the discord invite I should probably just get a button like I have one button on my stream deck when I press it it both choochoo into the chat you know I should maybe make one I need to get the dist that stream deck with the with more buttons I need more buttons oh my god I just want I just like a giant panel of buttons that's my dream all right so that's the nature of code is what I'm gonna be doing what other things I shouldn't make a list of it'll be so helpful if I've just made a list of things that I wanted to mention as opposed to just try to remember them while I'm livestreaming just think about this for a moment I thought of it alright so there's two things up and coming on this channel that are unrelated to the nature of code Oh everything's kind of related nature of code one is March 14th is Pi Day and traditionally I've tried to do something special to mark the occasion I will be not available to livestream on pi day so I'm probably going to prepare something in advance to really be released on pi day but I don't have any idea what to do so if if you know certainly I'll take suggestions in the discord but right now for better or worse the system is a github repo where you can if you have a suggestion for a topic oh whoa whoa hold the presses do welcome for your membership to the coding train you have one random number and that number is 90 4544 you are the sole owner I mean I don't think we're ever gonna get to a million members that would be kind of nuts I will just ride off into the sunset if that happens and thank you by the way if you don't know there let me see if I can find how am I gonna do this I'm looking for there we go perfect this is what I'm looking for if you are not aware and I'm sorry if you don't want me to be plugging this it's too late for you you put this on the internet I get to plug it without your permission Jose teaches a course called introduction to computational design and it seems like it's at Harvard and all of the lectures are all online in this playlist is this a learning playlist or is it just a regular playlist you should get access to the learning playlist if it's not it looks like a learning playlist so check check this out welcome well thank you I uh I was talking about something high day so back to this so if I go to label you won't be able to add your own label but I encourage you to file your issue with your suggestion and then I will or somebody else will add it but I'm just gonna see what's there right now so Pi Day 2020 let's see there's every year so you look at this every year damn does a couple cool yes thank you I am as my kids tell me very cool I'm the cool dad definitely every year dance has a couple cool coding challenges related to calculating visualizing or using pi this year would be a good time to start a pythons no no no you make last year's pi day challenges in Python and also explain Python today it is a really nice idea ddddd ttttt but i'm not sure that that's gonna fit with my schedule and something there you know actually at my son's school not to keep talking about my kids today but they're always on my mind they have a PI digit memorization contest so I one thing I was thinking is there a tool I could build it helps people memorize the digits of pi if you have any ideas about that but it really anything that is eh especially if it's like a beautiful geometric pattern algorithmic pattern that's what I really like to do for these kind of challenges that relates to PI and the mathematics associated with PI then please suggest that here as a github issue or talk about it in in the discord otherwise I will be just baking a pie oh that's what I should do clearly I mean because have you all seen the bone Appetit YouTube channel I know I'm like really late on this but it is just Oh chefs kiss I just wish that I could be like one of their cooking people which I definitely cannot be there's no way but I aspire I can a spike in dream D t6o which i assume is the same ddddd tttt tttt has memorized 80 digits of pi i was like how did you do that maybe I should just try to memorize them but I think is I don't think I can do a live stream so I don't think I'll be like a live PI day live stream this year but I do want to do just like a video maybe I'll do it as a Cabana one or something like that will I be here on towel day yeah maybe I'll just wait till tala day so that's number one number two is insanely and I really don't understand how this is possible but it seems as if this channel will soon have 1 million subscribers I'm assuming that then the next day they'll just like everybody will unsubscribe but you know probably at least for a day and me I kind of want to do nothing like just like keep going is I'm usually doing but people are asking and maybe it is a nice thing to think of doing something special to celebrate that so I could use ideas I really want to do something with the original unoriginal I I know I got I'm gonna keep mentioning this till somebody if you live near a like a rare bookstore or have some way of finding a copy of an original print I will pay I will pay for shipping I will purchase all these things I would very much like to purchase a original print of this million random number book I have found some listed online but there's no way for me to authenticate them and I've emailed and asked and I mostly I'm seeing them three amazon listings and no one will give me any real information and I don't feel like it's a good idea to spend a large amount of money to purchase something that I have no idea what it really is okay oh Lord the cutting tree hit with your membership of the coding train you have won stickers in the name eventually eleven thousand eight hundred and twenty seven new member that I already now can't see in the chat anymore I think was Adrienne that is your random number you're the sole owner of the random number eleven thousand or twenty seven please write that down because I won't remember I suppose a lot of the numbers appear more than once in this book though so you might have an issue there this this is the million random digits doesn't mean B million unique random digits okay now so that was that ideas for any kind of special video for million subscribers I would the other thing that's on my mind related to that was it oh yes I'll bring this up in the discord and maybe um I am working on training a machine learning model to generate text based on all of the captions of all of my videos ever and I could use some help with that so but that all that I'll bring up in the discord row that's a separate thing alright numberphile showed that 39 digits of pi would calculate the circumference of the known universe to the width of a hydrogen atom whoa whoa okay that's intense oh my goodness Simon Says Simon Says that is calculating the rate that I'm getting subscribers and estimating that this might actually happen on pi day ah well can you slow down please I'm not ready April first I think is a much more appropriate day for me than pi day said that last week okay so I think I better get started it's 10 o'clock half an hour should really be my limit of shenanigans let me go to the web editor of p5 oh wait hey where's my what's going on here here we go look at this huh isn't Ashley wonderful it got me logged into the coding drain editor and I have no idea what my password is it doesn't matter cuz I'm using okay hmm 36 I think is the number I tend to use let me go to where I left off last mmm whoa what is going on here oh by the way this is a little this is kind of an aside and maybe I shouldn't be showing this but let's see if this works I was helping a colleague who's teaching a class about animation and this is like an animation I think made does it made an illustrator knowing After Effects but using a library called using a library called la tjs and these are some like Lodi and p5 examples actually don't know what I'm talking about but I helped de minimus but it's cool because like the whole animation is all just in this big like JSON file and then I have p5 like playing it back which is kind of cool alright but that's I someday I would like to make some videos about this with alone who I worked on this example with ok coming back to opening my sketches the one that I want to get is this here we go so this is where I left off this is the last we last left off all our rights we miss Adam or vias code we don't like the browserbased editor too bad no no I get it I get it thank you for your feedback in your comment it's important for me to use this editor because it is a tool that I'm feel very invested in in helping it grow and for it being something that is a really friendly easy place for people to start to learn coding so when I do certain projects that really don't fit well with the web editor I certainly will do things outside of it but I do feel like it is a useful tool for me to demonstrate the basic nature of code examples okay hello Argentina people of Argentina okay all right I think I'm trying I just trying to figure out where I want to kind of begin with this all right I am going to actually go for it whoops no I don't want to download this I'm gonna go further back friction forces 1 I think this is yeah yeah this is where I'm gonna this is the example I'm gonna build on it okay I really am having trouble because I don't have peripheral vision so to see the screen over here to turn all the way to the side okay I'm gonna need to start all my recording things so let me do that actually now start recording let me go here and set the multi quarter to go um one thing I also want to mention is I've had a little bit of audio interference I'm noticed it must not be significant because nobody is ever says anything to bring the live stream or at least I don't catch it if you are if you're noticing like a little almost like and you know the the sits just like a sort of like a highpitched hum that sort of like slowly fades in and fades out if you're hearing that could you let me know at any point and I'm just trying to get the various chat things back up here is there we go the YouTube chat back up you can see that Oh Simon is giving me some excellent suggestions about additional things I could do you know I've got to move on to chapter 3 but I I hear you read the entire book online for free how nice okay and then I want to go to where am I forces holding chapter 2 boy this is going very slowly and here we go okay so this is what I'm going to be doing today I am going to go through this particular scenario and example I need a minute to pull myself together here and by the way oh I don't want to show this diagram because this diagram is absolutely incorrect there's a major flaw in this diagram I think I can't remember if I fixed it or not and just not on the website but this are needs to be the distance between the Centers of the bodies not the edges of the bodies so I hate to show this I mean one option is could replace it later so maybe much yeah what we're gonna do today is I'm gonna leave this flawed diagram up and then I will I fix it in Illustrator and we'll just like replace that in post even if the recording system isn't working we don't have the separate green stuff we can I'm pretty sure like overlaying a diagram should be possible although I'm gonna like point to it and stuff like that so that's gonna really mess us up but whatever we're gonna try our best we're gonna hope for the best everybody that is an absolute mistake alright so if I'm making a brief list I'm gonna does this overhead thing working know what happened my overhead camera so sad that's weird oh well I am going to let me make a list so the first thing I'm gonna do is just do attraction and then I'm gonna I think in the same video I can make an array making notes to myself here you know what usually I type these out let me do that so you can see it right because actually I have it here right uh okay here we go oh right so I've done all these I already have these nodes all right so this is done so gravitational attraction plus array I think I could do that in one will file might change that I think that can be in one then I'm going to do repulsion plus like a kind of group behavior so instead of there being separate attractors a separate attractor and movers or bodies whatever I want to call them particles I'm gonna have them interact with each other and then I'll add and I think this could I think this could all be in one so I think hopefully this will be two videos right do the implement the basic gravitational attraction then I just switch it to repulsion and show I could make it a group behavior and a wall force and then I also have I should look like some of this is a little bit redundant content because last year I did a traction coding challenge couldn't challenge fiftysix I guess that's more than though that's what we go oh are you insane have I really been doing this for this long that it felt like oh that was just last year that was three years ago that I did the attraction and repulsion coding challenge just look at the code did I I'm hoping that I was using es6 classes at the time I was or I changed it whoa all right okay so then there's also this so I'm gonna refer to this coding challenge and also include it in the playlist and are noting the chat is and my minds are exactly aligned here Arn don't forget to mention your coding challenge on attraction repulsion okay so yeah so you know a few years ago I didn't feel like I had time to redo the full nature of code tutorial series and so I picked and choose little things and did them as coding challenges gym anyway makes more sense because I kind of make one video that has a whole lot of concepts all in it but this year I'm doing it differently and as soon as I do this I can no longer see because this is the reading part distance reading distance whoa I'm dizzy dizzy okay so that's there this is Jose's playlist and I'd mentioned pi day anybody anybody file any issues money to pi day ideas okay and then Here I am and then Here I am alright okay let me just actually you know what I'm gonna do this get rid of this interest thing oh boy boy duplicate duplicate duplicate oh did I mess it up hold on everybody let me just I might have messed up that other example and if I did I just want to check real quick I think I did oh no I left I might have like changed something but oh yeah okay so this doesn't need to be in there and mover is fine okay great that's fine I'm here get rid of the edges function and oh I'd if I also want mass hold on I don't need edges I don't need this you'll see but I also want to get the idea of mass back in here which I implemented in the previous one this stuff would be nice if I did this in advance so apologies a drag so what I did in the previous one is added mass hold on and then I calculated the radius based on the mass so that's gonna go in here and it's gonna take a third argument and also / mass and then add that and then what else what else what else I think and then I just need to give it a mass here like five okay great all right I love the Wesley Crusher reference in the chat right now by the way all right Adrian thank you for your new membership I winced identity I happened to see your message to the YouTube chat but pi day suggestions if you want me to see them the discord or the github repo is the best place all right but please talk amongst yourself about all sorts of pi day ideas in the chat I don't need this anymore all right here we go is there are you serious oh this is the worst okay the worst this is the terrible thing that I have discovered on the internet today that when I mean it's mic no I'm not signed in hmm when you search gravitational attraction this image comes up just from my book would you read it would be great bonanza mistake in it oh look at this what a coincidence so by the way my the book is Creative Commons noncommercial and Khan Academy hugely correct diagram also has a basically AB duplicated version with a bunch of changes of the nature of code book hopefully that I'm credited on here but I think that I am Shh but I'm looking for yeah this is what I want to look for yeah here we go all right I have such trouble getting started but it is time for me to get started got to get some stuff done today not looking at my email if I wanted to I could just pull pick up my phone I have progressive lenses so I can see it really well and I could see if I have any important messages but what could be more important than what happens we know nothing but the phone is going further away I see it out of the corner of my eye it's going over here I'm taking this coding training notebook I'm taking the phone putting the notebook on top of the phone and it's going over there all right and we're gonna start having trouble where does some encouragement please little by the time started by the time you hear me say that's never mind stretch everybody stretch if you're watching and you can whatever works best for you to like move any parts of your body that you can move stretch oh so Raul says just heard the noise hearing the chirp what can I do about that all right let me I have a suspicion that maybe where this receiver is placed so I have an idea so thank you for telling me that you heard the chirp and now I'm hoping I moved some wires around hold on there's one other wire that I should maybe move that could be having like some interference okay so hopefully that's going to do the trick I think you you need the CJ timer I definitely do happens when I do certain poses Oh could it be I don't have any like I don't have any other electronic devices in my pocket and could it be the zipper or something this is the mic well alright alright everybody listen listen standing still talking talking talking talking does it happen I'll do anything to not have to do like coding tutorial can you tell okay oh it's ten third all right this is this is bad start all right hello and welcome to another I mean now what he wants to look if they're watching the secrets and I just keep thinking welcome to but I don't know what else to say all right no I don't like starting with that way either it is time for Newton's law of universal gravitation so this is the final example that I will be demonstrating as part of chapter two although the concept of forces and how they are applied permeate throughout the rest of the video that I intend to make but I'm gonna wrap up this chapter by looking at the equation for universal gravitation that looks exactly like this and trying to see can I take this equation and implement it in a p5.js sketch okay so that's good that's the only one I wanted to say at the beginning so much but I'm we're gonna sort of like hope we can fix this we'll see well I can always come back and rerecord or something okay let me just see here here's the same formula with a diagram in the nature of codebook itself so the idea of this law is that every body every particle every thing in the universe attracts every other thing with the force that's proportional to the masses of those bodies and inversely proportional to how far apart they are so the farther apart they are the weaker the force the closer they are the stronger the force I did something very much like this in the first example as part of this series where I had done actually look let me actually put this here all right oh it's my watch is my watch doing it okay that's easy I don't need to wear this silly overpriced Pisa unka exercise tracking surveillance couch or okay look I do some free iPhone and watch your God all right so I know I don't think it's worth me was it really bad and is it really bad that I need to go back and redo the intro or was it fine like the glitchyness audio it's going to end up in the edited version of this but if it's just like a little minor hum big deal did it happen again all right I'm gonna just keep going turn it again oh well what could it be I wonder I guess I could change the it is it just the Bell fine good all right all right I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna keep going in the first in the first example in this chapter I did something very similar to this idea of the law of attraction I created a vector that points from the mover object to the mouse and then made that vector the acceleration of the mover object itself and it appears if if this body like orbiting the mouse itself I got it so there is sort of a problem with me keeping my eye on the chat is it's very distracting and I lose my momentum so I'm gonna just take a break from looking at the chat and I'm gonna I'm gonna move I'm gonna plow forward this cuz I shouldn't keep stopping and starting hey what's going on here I did something in the first example on this in the series very similar where I took a mover object and created a vector that pointed from that mover object to the mouse itself and set that vector as the acceleration of the object so this was like attraction but I wasn't thinking about mass and I wasn't thinking about distance let me try to diagram what it is that I want to do I want to have a new object that's called an attractor so I'm not actually going to at this moment in I just I realized something let me diagram what I want to do in this video so I'm gonna simplify things and have this concept of an attractor object so the attractor object isn't a real body in the universe it's a fixed entity that does it that that attracts things to it but it cannot move and it cannot experience forces itself then I'm going to have the mover object with some given velocity and the mover object the attractor is basically the mouse from the previously but the mover object is going to experience a force a gravitational force that pulls it to the attractor and that force which is a vector is going to be equal to the mass of one object times the mass of the other object divided by the distance squared and I put this in the wrong order but also times G which is the universal gravitational constant now there's a very real number that is this value in the universe as we know it but for us in our fake p5 or I don't want to say fake I'm say pretend but for us in our in our pretend p5 canvas over this word ok I understand what I'm doing now but for us in our pretend p5 canvas if I draw like a box around this G is just a way for us to kind of like tune the the world to have stronger gravitational attraction or weaker attraction forces and in a way I could think of this G as a property of the attractor itself may be different attractors have different constants although to some extent that is taken care of by the mass but I have everything that I want I can make up so I need everything that's in this formula I need to figure out where is it here so the mass of one object well would be the mass of this mover object the mass of the other object would be the mass of the attractor so to some extent the mass and gee I could conflate these into one constant but I'll keep an exception for now distance is the distance between the Centers of both objects so remember when I'm calculating a force I need two things I need direction and I need magnitude so this is really all of these numbers are talking about the magnitude how strong is that force how long is this arrow that I'm drawing here the direction is just a vector that points from the object being attracted to the attractor and so that I can get there's a bunch of times now with subtraction so the sum function for subtraction I can take the position of the attractor minus the position of the mover and that gives me a vector that points this way set its magnitude to the result of this formula and voila I have gravitational attraction okay so coming back to this example I am going to now get rid of this acceleration calculation and when I run the sketch I should just see this mover not moving at all and in the main tap sorry and in the main JavaScript file where I have set up a draw I want to add an attractor so I'll create an attractor that also gets in X Y position and a mass I'll say a tractor attracts mover and a tractor dot show now I might have just confused to you for a second there because you might be thinking wait did I miss something did you write in a tractor class and is this just gonna work right now definitely not like when I run this is gonna be like I have no idea what that is so this is the way that I work sometimes it's a little bit of flawed me making this tutorial video because this is probably an example that I've written many many times so I had it just sort of right in my mind at the ready but sometimes it can be helpful to sort of sketch out what did how it is you imagine writing the code to operate an object before writing the class because now I have the instructions for what it is I need to write I need to make a class called attractor the constructor takes three arguments it needs to have a show function and it also needs to have an attraction that receives a mover object so all of these things are now at things that I can write into the attractor class I've already created another JavaScript file attractor j/s which is empty so I'll put class attractor in there then write the constructor which if you remember required three arguments an X Y and amass the X while used for position the ammo use for math let me write a show function just to draw it as a circle I'm now realizing I should calculate a radius based on mass the same way that I did in the previous examples with the mover so I'm just gonna grab this code which takes the mass takes the square root multiplies by 10 I'll use the same convention and then so let's leave out the attract function for a moment comment that out move the mover to like a little higher up in the canvas run it and what do I have now tractors not fine oh I can never seem to remember to add the script tag when I have a new javascript file and here we go alright now I see the attractor and the mover so the net would have been chat now I see the attractor guess I'm looking at the chest now I'm seeing both the mover object and the attractor object the next step is just to actually write a function in the attractor object that we're that loud noise you have a vector on the left side the feedback was bad when you were at the white hold on time after second the feedback was bad when you're at the white board might be from the mic cable moving so what might Cable moving do you mean just like this and then you have a vector on the left side and a scaler on the right side oh yes yes okay people are telling me that the noise is annoying I really I don't think it's an OBS problem because I think it's also in the audio track of the I have another system that records a backup of everything zipper gets close to the mic I mean that doesn't really make sense right I mean that's gonna make have noise but I mean I've done streams without zippers before oh you don't see me right now bumbumbumbumbum what do I do about this I don't think it's a it's mostly when my hand is near the mic my ring is hand so I'm just I'm taking a pause for a second to figure out if I can sort this out at all I'm trying to think charger what charger though it's interference it's a mugging well yeah it's fine you know I guess just let me know if it was particularly bad the game being too high yeah I have that down I don't think it's feedback though but one thing I can do is just turn off I do let me just let me just check one thing for a second okay it was really bad just now huh people are telling my phone but it's my phone so far away I'm just wondering if I turn the audio monitoring off what's weird I it's interesting because I'm not hearing it the way I think I just heard it yeah I hear it oh yeah I hear it okay playing with the receiver oh yeah okay that is really weird I was able to get it to move such as the coincidence yes you were watching a person and move around trying to figure out if it was a way to trigger the audio interference all right I have an idea I have a I have another laughs Mike let me just try the other laugh Mike which I should done a million years ago so I'm muting myself for a minute they test one two three all right I think this mic is working and it doesn't look like it's crazy left so the question is is there interference this is better or worse the same test one two huh I don't hear it too loud okay well that's easy to fix okay that should have turned it down a tiny bit and hopefully the interference will be gone we'll find out okay so if if you hear any audio issues let me know but I'm gonna assume that hopefully fixed it Wow it's 1040 already I'm gonna be taking a break shortly great I I actually have a third idea of something I could do if it's really bad because I have new wireless headphones and I could wear them and the mic wall it's actually pretty good so but anyway well everybody saying the mic is better I there's exactly the same mics it's just two of them all right okay that was a burp did you pick that up clearly easy to forget you're live streaming and the body just does what the body wants to do alright I'm gonna move on okay so okay all right all right all right now you're catching up to me in real time I'm gonna move on you know while I took this break just give me a second to check I'm just curious now to see how that recording is going okay now if I could only remember where I left off but here we go now I can see both the mover which isn't moving at all which is what it should be doing and the attractor just as a circle there's a better pic suggestion in the share channel could you repost it here because I not easy for me to check other channels cuz I'm gonna repost it in the live chat supporter group I the problem is you're gonna it's gonna be a while so you hear me say that okay get a move on how's everybody doing today okay we're really feeling okay as things in the world are spiraling everybody take a deep breath relax hug your neighbor a friend all right I'm gonna move on I'm waiting for it to appear but I don't think it's going to oh there it is oh thank you perfect yes that's exactly what I intend to do yes that's a great diagram whoever made that thank you how do I pull that up here hold on a sec hey can someone make money all right I'm moving on thank you for that diagram but I it's I need a better system for all sorts of things move on okay the account that I hopes there's an account that I log into discord on this laptop that's not in the supporter Channel I could have checked share Dirk Harrell six eight seven okay all right everybody I'm moving on okay now I have the mover not yet moving because no force has been activated and the attractor just in the canvas so the next step is for me to write this attract function and implement the formula but before I do so let me address something why did I choose to say a tractor dot attract mover I could have said a number of other things I could have said I could have choked I could have caught up I can't get the momentum back I could have called a function it's gotta be okay everybody here we go I could have called a function on mover instead of a tractor or I could have written a new function that takes the two arguments the mover and a tractor or I could just work out the code in here so I'm making a somewhat arbitrary choice but to me it feels conceptually consistent to have the attractor object itself have the functionality to create a force that attracts the mover object but you know if you want to try to redo it and reorganize your code in another way I would really encourage you to do that and share it with me returning to the diagram for a second you know I did make a sort of slight mistake here which I am calculating a force and I talked about wanting to calculate a direction and a magnitude but this whole why whoa what just happened all right everyone don't worry I have a solution for this apply force to get momentum yeah now I didn't make a sort of small error here or inconsistency where is that I'm saying I'm calculating a vector but all of the variables and aspects of the formula that I'm working with here or just calculating a scalar value the magnitude of that vector so let me be a little bit more clear about this diagram if I have two objects each with a mass and I'm calling this vector or this if I have these two bodies each with a mass Matt this one being the attractor but that doesn't really matter so much and I think of this vector pointing from object 1 to object as a vector R then the the distance is really the magnitude of that vector squared and then the direction is the unit vector R which I don't really have a lot of room here but I could say which I could write as our with the hat on it so now this formula is more accurate and all I need to do is calculate both in my code is calculate both this unit vector and this equation put them together and apply that force and I'm going to do all of this in a new function called attract that's part of the attractor so let me first get this vector R I'll call it direction and it is the mover sorry it is this position the movers position we need to say subtract the distance is the magnitude of that vector and actually I'm going to want distance squared so let's make this distance square it is magnitude squared I'm gonna make up just for right now a universal gravitational constant of one so I could really just ignore it but let's keep the variable in there and just set it equal to one and I'll and I'm gonna use the word strength to calculate the magnitude of that force which is this dot mass times mover mass I'm gonna give myself more room here divided by distance squared and also G times that so this right here is exactly the same formula that I have right over here and I just want to take this vector R and set its magnitude to the result of this so and just to be consistent I'm actually going to rename this from direction to force because ultimately I'm going to use this very lips I'm going to use this variable to be the force and then I'll say force set magnitude to that strength and then mover dot apply force force clean this up for a minute and we can see I have all the steps here get a vector that points from the mover to the position remover to the attractor get a vector that points from the mover to the attractor calculate all of the elements to get the magnitude of that vector put it in this variable strength and then set the magnitude of that vector to strength and apply the force I don't know let's run this this what kind of work I think so I'm not seeing anything okay well one thing would be to actually call the function attract hmm stength is not defined alright that must be a mistake that you've all noticed strength with an R oh oh wait is moving just ever so slightly and snowy this is where having G can really come in handy let's make G 5 and let's make G 50 there we go so I can scale the force relative to that universal gravitational constant but there's actually something else going on here that I think that I would like to fudge while I really would love to stay so true to this formula you are a wonderful formula and I want to stay true to that formula a little bit of wiggle room here because this is this madeup p5 world it's pixels and there's a lot of aspects to what I feeling that I want to create and how it's actually going to behave with this literal formula and one of the like a big element here that's playing a role here is this distance squared do you think about it the amount of pixels apart that these could be could very easily be you know 200 pixels and if they're 200 pixels apart that's going to be um you know dividing by 40,000 which is going to make the strength of the force very very very small so I could increase the mass of everything I could increase G but ultimately something that I might just do is kind of constrain the distance that I'm using in the calculation to a limit so I'm always going to even if there it's farther than 50 pixels away maybe just cat that at 50 on the other hand when they're really really close they could actually be in the same spot in which case the distance would be zero which doesn't make any sense in actual reality but could happen here or even if their distance is something like 0.001 pixels apart if I were to square this to have Justin squared and then divide by it I'm gonna make that strength so strong that things could kind of spiral out of control so this isn't it you could really play with and sort of like try a lot of different scenarios but for me right now I'm going to say that whatever that distance is I want to constrain its range when I go and calculate the forces magnitude to do that I'm just going to use the p5 constrain function and now I am getting the magnitude squared which I don't love so I'm going to constrain it's between 25 which is 5 squared and 50 squared which is 25 hundred twentyfive hundred people and 50 squared which is 25 hundred let's see what happens now I'm just like sitting here all right you know this is like this range is you want to play with it something you know you there's no science to what I'm doing here if it's pitch lately because I've like violating sexual rules of science but this is something that you might these are parameters that you may want to play with based on what it is you're you really want your system to do in this case what I want to see is it actually have it in this case I think I this would be a better demonstration if I give that mover an initial velocity so I am going to do that I'll give it a random one just so we can see different things and it has a bit more of the quality now of a body a body orbiting this attractor it's moving so slow did I have a limit in here No one thing that might actually make sense here is to get rid of this multiplier of mass and actually just give the objects bigger mass so I'm gonna give the objects a mass of 50 each yikes well I guess I let's give them and then let me just multiply it by two oops where did I mess up all right this is what I was kind of looking to see and actually it would be interesting to trace this one thing visually that I think might be interesting to do is trace the pattern over that I can give the background quite a bit of Alpha and we can kind of see the path that it's going in and then even better let me make this an array so now I'm making hope and I'm gonna add this in here now I'm making 10 mover objects oh and I want to give them each at a random location with a random mass so I'm gonna just put 10 out into the canvas I'll make the attractor a little bit bigger with mass and then I have to loop through them all in draw let me give a bit more pixel space to work with here and let's see what this looks like whoa what happened to the mover oh no it's okay let me put the mover in the middle and I think I want to draw the mover a different color to make it more obvious and I'm gonna make this constraint of the distance even smaller so it's still weighted according to distance but it won't be as extreme and let's see what this takes a look look like so now again have what have I made here I don't really know but what I'm showing you and actually I want there sorry I want the initial velocities to be a bit stronger I think we'll also make this demonstration a little bit nicer there we go so this is what I was more hoping to see so what I'm looking to do here is create a bunch of mover objects that are orbiting and swirling around this one attractor and you could imagine oh what's something interesting that I could do here is that I could actually just right now in just a very quick moment I could say hey you know what the attractors position now if mouse is pressed if the mouse is pressed move the attractor to where the mouse is I'm not sure what that really added but I'm getting somewhere I'm getting a sort of swirling set of bodies all experiencing gravitational attraction to this one attractor in the center the upper limit is too low I think yeah that's all coming next what Armour and Simon are both asking about will shouldn't these objects be attracting each other and also attracting the attractor that's coming next I think you might have confused the naming of mover and attractor where what did I say I was going to do next repulsion group behavior in a wall force okay reduce the trails yeah let me just take out the trails completely and removing the trail this is what I have oh I confused a tractor and mover in my verbal explanation a few times while setting the color and mouse position oh I should put the mover in the center all right let me we'll dub it's over later I should put the attractor in the center I should put the attractor in the center is that how I said it I should put the attractor in the center and I should put the attractor in the center right give it some extra audio this example might actually look a little familiar to you I've got three years ago I did a coding challenge called attraction repulsion where I essentially built exactly this but I had multiple attractor objects and I also was took that attraction formula and multiplied it by negative one to reverse the direction to make it a repulsion force so those are things that I would suggest trying like what would it mean for you to add multiple attractors maybe every time I click the mouse a new attractor is placed in here how could you adjust this with repulsion but what I want to do in the next video is make a couple changes to this one is I want to show you repulsion so I'll do that but I really there's a big flaw here in terms of how the universe works I mean there's there's no flaw in yeah right you need to see that but I just read it to the wall over there because I'm frustrating myself so this is what it looks like without the trails and you can see I kind of like wrapped up this example that I wanted to make and there's a lot that you could play with here incidentally this might look very familiar to you about three years ago I did a coding challenge called attraction and repulsion where I made exactly this the difference was I took it a bit further and this is something you might think about trying on your own now with this as a basis for your example is what if I were to click the mouse and add multiple attractors what if some of those weren't actually attractors at all but repellers how would I make a repulsion force just multiply by negative 1 to reverse the direction so I'm gonna actually do some of that in a followup which will be the next video in your playlist here but what I want to look at more closely though that neither of not neither this example or that previous coding challenge addressed is what if I want every mover object to exert a force on every other mover object what if going back to this original diagram right where I'm what if going back to Newton's law of universal attraction every particle attracts every other particle so really there should be a force all of these should be attracting every other one and what does the system look like if I have a lot of bodies floating around all mutually attracting each other so that's what I'm going to focus on in the next video it's a bit of an introduction to a group behavior I might need like a nested loop we'll see and that'll bettle really wrap up this chapter okay all right I'm gonna take a short break right now and I will come back and finish this off I'm glad we have the audio thing worked out how are there's a lot of people watching this right now which is always mindblowing to me I need to get some like water but before I take my short break let me a really thank the sponsor of today's livestream Layne dot Layne which you can go to at link calm so what do I say I have a little story to tell go back so I was talking to back to my son again who's now a programming in scratch my daughter is also program at scratch but she's a lot younger so a little bit a little bit harder but she's just doing a great job but I was he has an account that's part of his school and I was asking him oh what's you know like I wanted to see what he was doing I was like oh maybe I'll just log into your account later like do you know your password and he was like yeah I know my past was like well how did you get a password he's like it assigned to you did you make one up there's like oh well I just keep my password in a file on my computer on the computer that he uses for school at school and as well and I thought to myself oh my goodness I am NOT teaching my children proper password management and if you're doing things like all of your passwords are on just like a plain text file sitting on your computer or you have the same password across everything you're using this is not good you know there's lots of things you I that I like to attempt to do my best to sort of like protect accounts and not use and and and so one of the things that I can't live without really is a password manager and what a password manager does dashlane being a great a service password management service is that it allows you to store to have different passwords everywhere everywhere don't don't hurt yourself and and have them all stored in a single place in a secure fashion so and then you know frankly it just makes life like super convenient when I'm trying to order a very expensive copy of a million random number book a regional print on eBay which is what you're seeing me do right now only I can't because I can't find it can I please find it on eBay somebody help me so I could use my dashlane to quickly enter in all my information to buy that expensive random numbers book what else do I want to tell you about dashlane so there's a few things that are important so one thing is lean is different than other options that you might have already for automatic logins solutions like keychain and krob they lock you into a single system so your passwords and info are trapped in one place signon solutions like login with Facebook and misuse your data because they make money from collecting it selling it and using it to annoy you with ads so dashlane ever has access to your personal data and won't trick you into subscribing there's no credit card required at signup not even Lane can see your data and it's always an adfree product so really I mean for me this ability like fill in forms fast with oneclick logins and autofill you saw me do that with the people I've web editor is just so incredibly convenient it's so nice to have something that I can use across a Mac Mac Windows a mobile device whether it's Android or iPhone and really sort of like respond easily to breaches and hacks with personalized security alerts so if you're interested in giving dashlane a try you can go to Lane comm slash coding train if you sign up through that link it lets them know you found it from the coding train thank you very much and you'll get 30 days of free premium subscription to all of the features I mean and then if you also if you choose to purchase it after those 30 days you'll get a 10% off the premium so I thank you again thank you Josh lien for being a sponsor it really helps make all the stuff that I'm doing possible and I am going to take a break and come back to this coding example so I think it'll probably be about five minutes I'm just kind of like getting all my various windows back up here and um a few I've benefited I'm gonna do the next part of this I think I'm hope I wanted to get to chapter 3 today we'll see if that happens I've got until about noon so I'll have when I come back in five minutes all about 40 minutes left till like plow through some more examples and stuff thank you for watching and I will see you in about five minutes everyone eat about one more minute so I'm going to set the music back a little bit okay sorry for the delay of praying alright I've got some water thank you Lane as the Kotick train sponsor and also water which keeps me hydrated all right what is next what is next spill the water on the computer everything's gonna be fine like that up and who okay so now I can move this here and this is the last video tutorial I am going to make as part of chapter 2 and I guess chapter three will probably have to wait until another day I mean I could there might be enough time after I'm done with this next demonstration for me to continue into chapter 3 but I sort of feel like I mean if I'm gonna do it would be so much nicer I think in terms of keeping everything together and having a nice flow to the videos for me to do a session that's dedicated to chapter 3 as opposed to like starting it at the tail end of one and then coming back a week later so you know if I have a little extra time I'll answer some questions or talk about something else but I will be here until noon either way hmm okay now we're talking yeah I could just sort of dance around and act ridiculous at a minimum for like the last ten minutes all right I'm gonna save this and duplicate it all right and ready to go okay I don't know why not let's let's let's keep going with this I actually really like this example I am back with one more demonstration and really I this finished whawhawha whawhawha whawhawha whawhawha whawhawha whawhawhawha one more one more video here in chapter 2 I want to just do a few more things with this example so the previous example I built this sketch where there's a single attractor at the center of the canvas and all these other mover draw objects are experiencing a gravitational force pulling them towards that attractor and all of that happens in this function called attract where I am writing code to realize this particular formula formula for the universal law of attraction but this is not really how the universe works in the sense that there aren't separate attractor entities and separate mover entities so let me take this a step further and have every one of these mover objects I really want to just call them particles but I'm gonna wait until chapter 4 to call things particles but every one of these mover objects attracts every other mover object and I'm gonna get rid of the attractor no more attractor concept whatsoever yeah before I get rid of the attractor but before I do that I let me save this code because I'm gonna want to use this code so I'm gonna take this code and put it actually just in the mover object itself then I'm going to delete this file get rid of the reference in index.html get rid of the attractor here comment this out and get rid of all this nope let's run this sketch and see what happens great all of the mover objects are moving with their initial velocity but there's no other forces now I have a loop here that says for every mover inside of the movers array update and show but what do I also want to do for every mover in the movers array each one of those movers is in a tractor to attract all the other movers so inside of this array while I'm looping through all the movers I want to check every other mover so I can write another loop inside here for let I'm gonna call it other of movers other dot attract mover or mover dot attract other I don't know both would really be the same I think mover dot attract other makes a little more sense update the move or show the mover and that mover then should attract all the other movers there's a big problem with what I've done here but I'm just curious what happens if I run it whoa oh cool it kind of worked what a nice coincidence I'm surprised didn't get any error but there is a there's an issue Emma it nicely just sort of like bypassed this issue and I got no errors or nothing really crazy happened but this particular loop is going through all of the elements of the array oh no so is this one so for every element of the array go through every element of the array I'm saying the same thing a lot I know and so it's technically possible that the mover at some point is going to attempt to attract itself because this given mover will then appear during this loop as well so I want to avoid that and something that I can do is actually check to see if the two objects are equal which is sort of a weird thing am i checking to see what am i checking exactly so this is a little bit of an aside but what's actually stored in a particular variable and we're talking about an object is so if I'm talking about a specific move or object what's stored in that variable is the memory address where all the data for that object is stored so it's kind of like a pointer so we can think of this variable as storing a reference a pointer to some place in the computer's memory where all of the data for that object is stored so if it's stored in an array this mover of the movers array that pointer is moving around and pointing to all the different objects and maybe they're stored continuously etc etc so at some point other will actually be pointing to the same data the same memory address will be in both of these variables so if I check if they're equal it's actually checking if they're both pointing to the same area of memory which is different than if I had something like Val equals 5 you know Val 2 equals 6 and I'm trying to say is Val equal to Val with a primitive value like a number it's actually checking to see if the actual things stored in memory is equal the data is equal here we're just checking to see am I looking at the same object that was kind of a longwinded explanation don't know if we need it in the video but and maybe that didn't make any sense so I can check right here now as long as other is not equal to mover then the mover can attract the other and the result visually doesn't really look any different but it is but the result visually I don't not really seeing anything majorly different here but I've now protected the system from having that from from a given object attracting itself which I don't want to happen Alvar says I can't believe you explained pointers faster than you explain static functions well that's sort of true but I don't know if I really explained pointers they're just kind of like glossed over it all right I'm going to take this variable G outside of the attract function it's a nice to have this global variable that I can use to just kind of scale the strength of the attraction force across the board we just lower this down to two little little little less frantic one thing you might notice is the system is not very stable as all of these objects are pulling towards each other they're kind of as a group just moving off and out of the canvas and it kind of makes sense that that would happen but what if what I want is to experience this but have everything really stay within the canvas but what if what I want is to sort of experience this same animation the same feeling that I've got with this sketch but not have the stuff just fly off and eventually disappear so there's a few things you might be thinking of that you could try I mean one is I could have a lot mover or tractor in the center that's always attracting everything so that at a certain point maybe a little bit stronger I don't know if it needs to be stronger or not that everything is kept within the canvas I just realized I might have a nono I have that's fine another option could be to go back and get that edges function that I wrote so every time one of these objects hits the edge it's a hard edge and it reverses its velocity bouncing back on that would be interesting I'd be curious to see what that looks like but I think this is a nice opportunity for us to look at I mean this is quite artificial what I'm gonna introduce here but what if I just created a force that is activated from the edges of the canvas pointing inward and the strength of that force is mapped to how close a given mover object is to that edge so to do that I'm going to reintroduce the edges function I'm trying to have not done this before so I'm like thinking about I mean I've done this with the steering behavior stuff and let me just start with the left edge so I'm gonna say the the difference between of the exposition of which is zero I'm actually just going to look at the exposition of the object and I'm gonna say the strength of this force that I'm being introduced is a map mapping that exposition which goes anywhere from zero to with and of course it could be a negative number but the way I'm gonna do this is going to account for that and when and and when the distance is zero I want that force to be really strong so let's make the magnitude just five arbitrarily and when it's when it's far away I want it to be really weak I think I should only activate this force if it's within a certain distance let's not worry about that right now let's see how it goes and I'm gonna have it zero if it's all the way on the other side and the force itself is a vector that just points to the right so I'm just gonna make a force that points to the right I'm going to do force set magnitude to that strength and then I'm going to apply the force so this is left edge let's call the edges function and let's see what happens when I run this well you can see the whole system is kind of fading off to the right because there's that left edge force that's always in action now let me do this again whoa I don't know what just happened there and so I'm gonna reuse all the same variable names and there's probably a more elegant way of doing this but I'm gonna say right edge and DX equals the width minus that position that's the difference and that also can be the same mapping would apply but the vector should point the other way let's see what happens now okay let's do the top and the bottom okay so I've built this out with all of the edges and there's a lot of redundant code here that could be reduced but let's just see what happens better right not perfect but the system is staying kind of within the bounds of the window now that the strength of those gravitational forces are getting bigger and bigger the accelerations are building up I might want to put a cap on the velocity of the movers also something quite artificial that I'm introducing here but I think this could help so let me limit the velocities to like I'm just gonna I'm gonna give it a pretty large number like ten whoa come back that's weird [Laughter] so what's interesting is that gravitational attraction force is so strong when they get close that they get kind of locked onto each other and you know maybe this limit was sort of like too strong or too harsh or maybe I want to kind of tune in a different way and go back to this attract function to change the way that I'm doing this constraint but I have another idea I think would actually be interesting to see a repulsion force so let's actually just change this to a repulsion force so I could rename this function to repel which maybe would make sense but ultimately really what I just want to do is say force multiply negative one and let's see what happens oh my wall force is terrible I think it's not really working hold on let's take off the attraction from each other yeah okay the wall force is working do I have any typos in there it's not very strong you know lowering the gravitational constant is something I could try also one thing that I could really do to improve this is this five in there is really construe is really controlling the strength of that wall force as it approaches the edge so it would make sense for me to store that like sort of like max strength in a variable then I'm gonna make that 20 just to make it much much stronger right now let's run this again you know this feels tuned properly with the way that I want that edge force there's no attraction or repulsion between them but the walls are keeping them within the window itself let me lower the gravitational constant down to one and turn back on repulsion the repulsion is just still much too strong let me lower that even more but now I don't really see them repelling each other honestly I think one of the issues here is that I think one of the issues here is that force keeping them on that force keeping them within the edges is so strong it's overwhelming the attraction or repulsion force and it's always on like I'm mapping that force the X I'm mapping the force from the edges in any direction wherever it is so what might make more sense is for me to check to see if it's within right only if it's within like 25 pixels so maybe we can have like a buffer which is 25 if it's within that buffer then map the force according to that buffer and then only apply it if it's within if it's close to the edge now let me do that for all the other ones whoops so I have that check now in for left right bottom and top I'm going to turn off the attraction or repulsion in this case and run the sketch again so nothing is moving because no object was close enough to the edge to experience the force oh no actually no they're not moving because I have an error strength is not defined mover line 46 oh look at this so actually this is kind of better because I I had these now these variables or local variables to the if statements run this again so they're staying within the canvas and that force is only activated if it's within 25 pixels let's make that 50 then let's make that force much stronger because you know this is much more like a bouncing ball sketch in a way because that force only activates when they get close to the edge and it's very very very strong now I think that I could have the repulsion back in and increase its strength the repulsion is so strong they're all trying to stay very far like from the corners but not what I wanted at all let's let's weaken the repulsion let's go back and make this attraction Oh it's a mover train look at what an interesting little weird thing that I created what if the distance is within a certain threshold they repel each other otherwise they attract each other oh that's an interesting thing I could try I want to go back to just using the raw distance not the distance squared which i think is easier for me to kind of think about so we'll make this between 10 and 50 and then we'll actually say here distance times distance and then I'm gonna say if distance is less than what being constrained is equal is less than 20 make it a repulsion force let's see what happens now so they're all attracted to each other but then when they get close they kind of repel interesting there you can see I could play with this forever and ever and I assume while you're watching this you're like oh whatever you're doing is so silly I have a much more creative and interesting way to make this a dynamic compelling beautiful artistic visualization please go ahead and do that and share it with me I would love to see it there is something that I should point out here which is that I am NOT the warder of the movers is kind of playing a role here in the sense that I am updating their location and then applying a bunch of forces and then update in the next ones location then applying all the forces if I want it to be really much more exact about this I would want all of the movers to accumulate all their forces based on their current position and then all update together so it could actually make sense for me to do that to have two separate loops one where I update and draw them all then I apply a whole bunch of forces based on those fixed positions and then update them all together all at once we'll see if this actually has any different quality to it another aspect of this is I'm not considering anything I'm not considering another aspect of this is I'm another aspect of this what was I gonna say Oh another aspect of this is I'm not treating these as rigid bodies notice how they can easily move over each other I'm not worrying about actual collisions here that would be a whole other complex thing for me to work through and implement and in many cases when I'm doing collisions I end up using a physics library and I have some videos that are will appear in this playlist about that using the library called matter Jas but ultimately I think this really wraps this up this wraps up chapter 2 of the basic idea of looking at the universal laws of motion Newton's laws how those laws of motion can be applied in code not in an accurate perfect way but in a way that reflects the sort of core ideas of them but is easy to implement and runs kind of fast and then what kinds of things do I need to adjust your tweak or sort of fudge to kind of keep to create the simulation or visualization that goes with whatever story or that I'm trying to tell with my sketch and I don't really have a story that I'm trying to tell other than I'm trying to teach how this stuff works and how you could apply it but I hope that you have an idea or a story or a project you're working on where this applies so if you do share it with me final link to the coding train comm page where you can share your work in this video's description you could also join the coding train discord and share your work that way and I look forward to seeing you in chapter 3 where I will get into I hope you're excited I'm really excited and I shouldn't have played that sound effect I should play like a beautiful sound effect like birds singing because trigonometry it's our friend we'll be there together enjoying trigonometry together in the next video this one really has to end now I'm just talking way too much goodbye and see you soon on the coding train oh that was like the worst ending ever yes Lucas writing is this an implementation of G equals m1 times m2 bubbeleh so the divided by zero thing is something I really should protect against I should have a check here that says if distance is as long as distance is greater than zero go go forward and multiply but I'm choosing to not bother with that extra error check mostly because it's just not gonna happen with floating point math that these pixel values are going to be exactly the same and then I'm also constraining it Oh actually it's never gonna happen because I'm constraining it to between these two values so I'm actually protecting against that here with this extra constraint that I'm adding all right actually I thought I was gonna have all this extra time which I clearly do not because I only have about ten minutes but ten minutes is actually quite a bit of extra time and maybe people have questions there's are some other things I wanted to mention maybe I should rerecord an aspect of this feel like I was really fumbling towards the end there but it is what it is questions oh there was a super chat from Vito list thank you I'll press my to chew button let's see there's probably people who join now who didn't who weren't here at the beginning of the stream so let's think up let's look at the pi day let's see if anybody added any pi day issues no there's no new ideas for pi day where are you my people let's see what there is previously whoops no no I want to look at pi day ideas generating PI from random numbers I think I did basically that already o coprime oh yeah the standup Mass video okay that's interesting so I haven't done this one the coprime thing I did the thing the dart throwing one idea I like this that's certainly a possible pilot generator what if I trained a machine learning model with the digits by the generate PI that seems kind of silly a good opportunity to talk about Co Prime's literary nerds invented a dialect known as pylus in which the numbers of letters and successive words match the digits of pi for example my Keith wrote the book not awake entirely in pilus now I fall a tired suburbian and liquid under the trees okay this is kind of Awesome ok pilot this is a this I like I like this idea thumbs up I'm gonna assign myself so that is not at all in the wheelhouse of things I was thinking about but it could absolutely work pi day challenge calculate million digits of pi yeah I don't know how to do that I wrote some code based on somebody else's code based on an algorithm that was doing that pi day challenge 3d montecarlo approximation of pi by dropping raindrops into or outside a puddle that's very similar to what I did already I didn't do it in 3d a lot of visual flair to it but that's that's an interesting idea oh wait I'm already at that one visualize an infinite series I think I need something more specific I like the suggestion pi day challenge Audio visualizer okay this I did with Gaussian rather than a circle this is interesting it's a little bit similar to what I did previously I guess I'm a little less interested in pie approximation since I've done that before although this is really an interesting one to see thank you this is a great example del squared this is awesome um a list of pi day challenges pi art countdown to the next pi day oh I like that use pi any object you make use the line function to manually draw the numbers of pi some nice ideas this I did oh I didn't use matter digest this is what I did last year pi music PI rock concert make a sheet of pi music this I really do like the idea but here's the thing when I when when I've done things where I visualize the number the digits of pi there's so much mystery and meaning in those digits but ultimately they're the distribution of them is really just like a bit of a pseudorandom number generator and I know there's more to it than that but I'm I don't know would I get anything melodic are meaningful by assigning the digits of pi to note values so that I think is a really terrific idea that I would like to do it maybe some of you who are musicians or sound artists might have some specific ideas of how I might implement this but I'm going to keep this on my list who ASCII art I know that violet has done work with ASCII art yeah this one especially whoa so I a ski art with the digits of pi that's an interesting idea I'm not I feel like I need a little bit more focus to this you could use PI's decimal development consecutive digit to represent the PI yeah I think I need something that's sort of connecting to connecting to the the sort of like mathematical aspects of Pi themselves I mean I'm making just like a PI is fun all right pipe rot approximation day which is uh 722 right July 22nd which is 22 so now I'll come back so if somebody remind me to do this in July stem coding project p5 just I have done so many PI approximating staying this is this is similar to what I did already um spiral okay you had me at spiral ooh no that's cool this is kind of fun is there something about this that's tied to the math of Pi probably in the sense that you're I'm doing polar to Cartesian coordinates oldschool PI demonstrations I like oldschool Oh this is super interesting this is actually highly relevant to chapter three of nature of code so I'm gonna consider this one rolling wheel full of paint I like this idea a lot pie is made of pie yeah make a visual image of the character pie made of lots of little pie for you to make the larger character yet so this I could sort of imagine this and that's kind of in the ASCII art territory draw a circle with pine numbers this is a suggestion from Simon Willie oh boy oh boy why are you so these are these are definitely I could consider I think I was looking to do something more visual and less pie approximation II calculate the I don't think this is possible I mean I could I you know I could train gbt to on or like a recurrent neural network on the digits of pi couldn't learn like what I mean that's sort of an interesting idea I I mean I don't think this is gonna work but like I'm gonna like keep this in mind is something that I could do where am I they also need to do a song so I got my ukulele song ideas oh it's noon noon o'clock I got to go search for words in PI this I like oh this I like this I really like okay I'm gonna add that so there's a lot about nice ideas here oh boy there's so many pi city skyline pieinthesky Oh interesting so these are like the digits of pi in a skylight it wants so much nice a nice idea I see there's like it looks like there's a three blue one Brown video being posted okay I think I got to go there's actually quite a bit of all okay yeah yeah these are the original suggestions yeah so I've done stuff like this which I really like but I don't want to just copy somebody else's beautiful art so I would need kind of a a new creative idea but that I have done oh here we go so that's the proof okay so I'm gonna look through these some more thank you for those suggestions someone added a new suggestion I don't know why I'm not seeing oh because it's not doesn't have the label yet so let's label this pi day bake up high I mean I kind of really want to do that I pie day comes at a very difficult time because it's written sort of like the prime like March 14th is like Spring Break for NYU is the week after they were like a week later I have a lot more time to like maybe do something kind of special or have like a hold a stream and it's really busy right now for me so I might have to just do something quick but I might record it in the Cabana although those take a look longer and harder to produce so anyway thank you for all these ideas I'm gonna get going thank you again to dashlane as the sponsor of today's live stream link comm / coding train will get you a free 30day trial or in 10% off if you purchase the premium subscription Elaine is a password manager and cookie hit the cabana and I'll see I'll be back next Thursday so I'm pretty locked in to this Thursday thing I can tell you though that just look at calendar for a second what month is it today's what is today March 5th hello Michel watch Johnny we're yeah okay I was gonna open up Google Calendar I'll just open this so I'm gonna pause for a sec March 12th we're on Oh pi day is Saturday the 14th which would bring like a good time to do something but I'm gonna be travelling assuming traveling is still a thing it's close travel but I won't be available to livestream so March 12th will be next week I guess I could like maybe try I could like do actually some of these challenges and then Matt you and I could edit them together quickly well hey we will do it and I'll be like thank you but to come out on the 14th and then March 19th I will also be doing a livestream the 26th I am NOT available so I believe the live streams for this month will be 5th 12th and 19th and then if I can get my act together and at some point the channel hits 1 million subscribers maybe I'll try to come come do an extra like sort of bonus live stream whenever that happens there's a little celebration so thank you everybody any more questions to ask before I go shabam says you talked me p5.js and ml5 Jess and I got an A grade for the project thanks a lot congratulations I'm glad you got an A and every grade is a great grade to get if you learned something has got to be I congratulate you as well it's always nice to hear when people are applying stuff from this channel to school or to work or their own creative just hobby is that I love hearing that thank you JMP asks what classes do you teach on campus so I teach a variety of different classes at NYU part of the ima program and the ITP program um those are at Tisch School of the Arts I also teach some online classes for NYU using some of these videos learning to code and currently I'm actually teaching the nature of code course which is why I'm focusing on making the videos during these live streams that get edited into a playlist and I've just been really behind but I do do the the playlist is there and I'm gonna make it unlisted available for people to see pretty soon so if you a videos will slowly be made public on the channel so if you're subscribed you'll get notifications to click the bell blah blah blah but if you join the discord that's a place where I'll make sure to share when there's some extra unlisted videos that you might want to check out as well thank you Jason writes I love your book which book I wrote really trying to get a new edition of nature of code out I was actually working on it I kept probably working on it maybe an accident like two hours per week and it really needs like eight to ten hours per week for me to make more progress but I'm editing and it will be a new version out soon enough Guzman writes I am new to programming alright there were only ten seconds left there so I had to pause so one thing and thank you especially to violet who has done a lot of this work oh you can't see this but the coding train website you you should be able to find things on YouTube itself but the website mirrors the all the YouTube content and has extra things but it one thing that it does is it kind of highlights specific playlists so under beginners up at the top p5.js this will take you to the beginner decided beginner videos so if if I were to go click on watch on YouTube it's going to now why does it not oh it's going to show with this hello first video and one thing that I would also note is that a lot of these cuttings are in these learning playlists so if I click here you'll then see this interface which has all the videos and different sections of all this content so you know if you're new to programming there are many other places and videos and books and tutorials and communities where you could learn to code this is just one of many but this would be my playlist that's designed for people who have never coded before alright thank you everyone I am going to say goodbye I will play you out with a bunch of the coding train remixes there's some new ones that have coming in and it crossed my peripheral vision that I saw someone post there's like a new remix with maybe a position let me see if I could find it all right hold on somebody help me find this there was a new coding train remix which I am now at going to attempt to play you out with so we open up the discord somebody posted it in the discord where where where a remix maybe if I search for position oh yeah oh I posted it I posted it let's try it let's try this one oh the track was not found maybe it has been removed oh wait maybe somebody else posted one my position remix of today's livestream it's gone does anybody know what I'm talking about I really have to go but I really want to find this remix let me just search position I guess oh boy there's a lot of people asking questions about code examples with the word position in it alright I guess I can't find it it was Titan a user named Titan had created a remix with position let me go to SoundCloud so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in there more random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four nine two this by the way is the SoundCloud play literally noise I pick numbers like a lot of reviews and I will play a bunch of em thank you I really gotta go now guys performance part two three four three four five six five these look like birthing noise performance apart with curly noise I might pick numbers like this by purling noise that is early noise this is Hurley noise that and it's Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that it's her Hurley know her purling noise that is Hurley boy this is Hurley noise that it's hurtling this is this is Hurley noise that is Hurley so this is Hurley noise that it's early early early early early but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this I always forget to do this star this star this star this star song never forget the miss start somebody composed that song for me this neighbor count equals zero blood fill time it's flood filled time yeah how could you better but anyway there was an error the song didn't load and then there's a callback that's like it's loading is loading it's the loading song it's loading loading it's the loading song so let's see if this works the loading song of course I could do sound synthesis myself all aboard and autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinates our coordinates it's the phone to Cartesian coordinates its Cartesian coordinates the chords and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind kittens I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound what else is there unicorns kay that would be valid syntax I forgot one other thing here that I will use the tingly over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis states that I will use continuously over and over again the first thing to do is we're gonna do
