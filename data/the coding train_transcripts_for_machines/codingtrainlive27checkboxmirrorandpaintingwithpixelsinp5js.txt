hello welcome my name is Dan and I am broadcasting live from the school for poetic computation in the West Village New York City there is a river behind me there is a brick wall that way I guess this is a green wall behind me actually that's not a river that's my screen I'm kind of still waking up I feel like it's been so long since I was last here but it probably hasn't been um but I have some new lights so I think hopefully you can hear me uh hopefully this looks pretty good I've got some new lights in here it's brighter unfortunately these are H hallogen lights and so I was trying to avoid using them because of the heat that they emit but I do think the quality of the imagery will be better today do have some LED lighting over here as you can see this glow coming up here and then hopefully this key should be pretty good and I don't look as orange as I have in the past I'm looking at it looks pretty good um what I would like to know from anyone watching and who is either in the chat either on Twitch or YouTube is is the audio okay is there any crackling skipping breaking up or the levels good and is the image quality good can you read this code uh can you see me do I look okay and in particular um can you read what's on this whiteboard and actually I'm going to take a moment here to erase what's on this whiteboard doesn't seem as bright as it did earlier today when I had first turned that light on I moved it further away but um the question would be you know what's the sort of focus and quality of this how does this particular image look I'm going to take a look over in my preview screen looks decent I'm watching myself now um I think it looks okay so nobody's uh I don't know if twitch chat is going the twitch I'm gonna not focus okay so um I'm back please let me know if the audio is okay I would really like to know that oh I'm over here there we go um everything is okay for me thank you um so what I'm going to do uh I'm GNA let me let me let me try to sort of get situated here I am currently working on a lot of different tutorial topics let me pull up My overall list uh get the browser going here and let me go to this so I keep this particular gist which has a lot of topics um and this is where I'm hoping to get to although get get get so I have like some big topics that I want to do that'll be a series of videos uh probably you know five or six on Chrome extensions two or three on Raspberry Pi two or three on neural network stuff maybe I'm going to do that and then uh what I'm what I'm going to do actually uh first though is a whole set of tutorials about git and GitHub which people have been asking for but I'm not doing that today because I am still uh um now I feel like actually this setup is finished so as long as this goes well today it doesn't get too hot and the Lighting and Sound seems to work I'll be ready for some of these larger topics but I have been last week when I was last here uh I recorded if I go to youtube.com shiffman and oh look I'm live now uh if I go to I don't know where uh playlists and here this one so um last week I recorded I guess I got through four videos I looked at just the basics of live video and capture into P5 I looked at uh making this sort of like video photo booth thing uh pixel array and made a little brightness mirror I'll run that example in a second so what I would like to do today I think is make a few more tutorials one is I thought we we would do I would make a tutorial about something a little bit strange in that taking the pixels from live video and mapping those to Dom elements um so make like a mirror with checkboxes that's what I was thinking of doing uh I want to look at um kind of a painting thing um and I want to look at um maybe slit scan somebody had asked about and maybe look at seriously. JS I'll see if that works uh okay so let's look and I see a bunch of people 14 people in the chat which is great people are saying hi like hearing that um uh somebody on Twitch is saying a slight fuzz in the focus overall but probably um if I walk close to the camera that's what happens so uh so everyone says things are good so um so um now that people have joined let me just recap sort of like a quick intro my name is Dan uh I uh work on different open source projects but in particular I spent a lot of time working on tutorials and examples and documentation for processing and p5js processing being something built on top of java P5 J being something built on top of JavaScript and I have a new recording studio at um a space here called the school for poetic computation and I'm just trying to make lots of video tutorials so here's another day of doing that I what I do is I broadcast live so you can ask questions in the chat or you can tell me things that I got wrong and then while I'm broadcasting live periodically I hit a separate record button to make these you know somewhere between 10 or 15 minute tutorial chunks which I then upload later to YouTube as Standalone videos so that's kind of the summary of where I'm at um this is kind of my list of topics I'm going to um get started with making this checkbox mirror first um and uh I'm looking at different cameras to that's the camera I'm looking at now and um but if anything's a Miss please let me know in the chat okay uh okay um so let's see here I'm gonna um close this close this so one thing I'll mention right now is that I'm working in as using Sublime Text as my text editor a lot of people have mentioned in various comments that they love uh Adam which is another text editor development environment Maybe download that at some point and use that actually maybe not right now um and then the other thing that I do oops it seems to be closed is I will run a little web server on my computer uh come on Terminal and you can maybe you can see that make it a little bigger uh I run a little web server on my and let's see where am I uh desktop uh using python so once that little server is running I can go to my browser oops I forgot that this was there and I can type in Local Host and I can see that I have all the examples I've been making and the last thing that I did whoops not sure why this is not working no error what's going on here uh huh huh this is I'm just trying to run my last example I don't know why it's failing uh let's restart Chrome everything seems fine we'll try running some of the other examples I even see this red light here but my green light is not on on the laptop so let's go um let's look at some of the other examples let's look at this one why is the live video dead on my computer perhaps I should just restart let's um let's run processing for a second all right so I'm into a little technical glitch before I get started making this first tutorial I need for the live video to actually work um somebody wrote in the comments your library for using the camera with processing doesn't work be glad to see if I can offer any help there but I would need more specifics which Library what do you mean by doesn't work is there um right now I just want to see something else uh uh examples oops uh video capture uh let's just I don't know open any of these does this work I wonder if uh all right I'm gonna try restarting this computer this doesn't seem to be working either all right one more thing to try I'm just for some reason I'm not getting any signal from my uh webcam so if I say new uh movie recording I believe it should FaceTime HD camera built in it must be like caught somewhere something's like using it so I have a feeling that uh just restarting uh the computer all right close so you can see I've gone blank I'm floating in space now nowhere to be found myter is rebooting I'm going to see if there's any other comments uh it's craft cake who wrote the library for using the camera doesn't work is Right didn't seem to work come on computer you can see this loading loading loading I'm entertaining myself much too much so I don't know what to say while I'm waiting I I will I will use my magic water this is my other trick this is you can see it's not really that magic oh did you hear that sound that's the restart sound so as soon as this thing restarts here's what I'm going to look at doing um so what the the tutorial that I want to do involves looking at every single Pixel and doing a thresholding effect meaning let's see I want to log in as the processing user type in the password uh um which means I want to look at every single Pixel and determine the brightness of that pixel if it's greater than or less than a certain thresold then I'm going to either draw a white or a black pixel uh this seems to have restarted um let's just let's just look at quick time for a second see if that uh seems to have come back uh there we go there we go camera seems to be working guess I should have tested that before I started streaming uh am I in the right directory yep I am so I just need to get Chrome back up and I need to get Sublime back up look at this and I need to go back to there and go to here and Shrink that and there we go so this is what I had hoped would happen before so this is the last example that I made whoops which involves just taking all right I Was highfiving Myself um which involves taking a low resolution capture we can see it down here this is very low resolution and what I'm doing is I'm reading every pixel of that of this like video that's coming in from the camera and I am mapping it to a rectangle on the screen and those rectangles are getting bigger for brighter pixels and smaller for darker pixels okay um so uh um okay so sorry I'm noticing there's a comment which I will see if I can answer in a second I'm GNA fix this camera sorry I just had a little camera mishap um okay so UMO rudo if I pronounce that correctly writes I have a problem using the brightness mirror effect the image freeze when I open it in my browser um I uploaded the code so um to uh GitHub repository um that's linked to the video so check to see if your code matches I you know it might just be you know try try restarting your computer try a different browser try a different computer there might be something just some glitchy thing happening in your particular browser it's sort of hard to say if you're getting a freezing effect um okay so uh I'm going to make a video tutorial in a second but first I want to even see if this idea works so I'm going to sort of just test out this idea and I'm going to go to finder here uh my video examples and I'm going to make one called 05 a checkbox mirror and I'm going to close this and go here and go back and okay so this should look similar to what we had before so I'm going to change from drawing rectangles to a canvas and actually make a grid of Dom Elements which is going to be a little bit crazy I hear footsteps hello okay so um where was I I am going to uh modify this example for a second to demonstrate a particular idea which is let's say that what I do is just do a a sort of threshold test so let's say what I'm saying is if you remember if you watched the previous video if you didn't kind of get your mind to catch up for a second but what I what I'm doing here is looking at every single Pixel getting the red green and blue values adding them together dividing by three to get the average brightness of each pixel and a threshold effect means if the brightness is greater than some threshold do this if it's less than that threshold do something else and that um and let's make that threshold arbitrarily now 127 which is kind of like halfway between 0 and 255 and and what I'm going to say is I'm going to fill 255 if I'm above that threshold and I'm going to fill zero if I'm below that threshold and I am going to draw then draw a rectangle so I'm kind of simplifying this example now in a way back to it's it's similar to what it was before but you can see now I'm always drawing a um I'm always drawing a rectangle and you can see that with there's only two colors being drawn black or white but I'm able to um but really convey the content of the video even just with um even just with that simple uh um kind of threshold effect H this is good that I'm like wandering around saying all sorts of words that don't make any sense because I'm I'm GNA about to I'm I'm I'm gonna about to I'm in a moment I will actually kind of go through a tutorial here uh uh okay um okay so what do I want to do with this next the thing that is important here is I want to be able to adjust that threshold so the the thing that I'll do there is I want to create a uh slider and I'm going to say uh slider equals create slider and the threshold should go between 0 and 255 and start at 127 and then what I can do is here instead of testing if the brightness is just greater than a hardcoded value 127 I can always get the existing value of the slider and uh and now we should be able to see how this affects it right the threshold is really high or really low and you can see like I don't know what works best this is kind of interesting you can see the sort of like low resolution Contours of my face now what is the question would be here what so I want to replace all this with checkboxes that's my next step I'm going to do this twice I'm doing this now to figure it out and then I'm going to do it again as a kind of tutorial although both of these are really tutorials here um okay so what I'm going to do is I'm um oh look at that uh okay sorry I shouldn't read Twitter a while I was noticing there were some tweets about Atlas uh the O'Reilly engine that I used to write the learning processing book shutting down but anyway that aside here uh I'm turning look I'm turning picking my phone this is my phone putting it on airplane mode okay no more notifications I don't need any like CNN headlines put that away okay now uh what I want to do is get rid of this let's leave create canvas there for a second so what is the video's height and width the video's height and width is width divided by V scale height divided by V scale um so I want to make a grid of checkboxes that exactly that size so what I'm going to do is I'm going to make a variable called columns for calls for columns which is width divided by V scale and I also want to floor that because I I think it'll be a um it will be a whole number but let's just do that just in case to protect here uh rows uh height divided by V scale and so I'm gonna I just want to have those in I want to have those in variables which I think will be particularly useful uh and then what I want to do is I want to say for VAR I uh x equals z x is less than the number of columns x++ and then do the same thing with Y but Y is for rows oops what I want to do ah what I want to do uh is uh what I want to do is say create checkbox I think that's how you do it in P5 create checkbox and see what happens there we go see all these checkboxes now I have all these checkboxes I can check them and uncheck them so that's the right idea now I want them to be uh I want them to be the exact uh right now they're just like you can see how their the the wrapping is based on the width of the browser itself H so what I want I need them to be exactly in that grid the other thing is I need to store I need to have a reference to all of them so I can like act on them so one thing I need to do is not just call create checkbox but I need to say something like um uh I'll call this uh check I'll call this boxes I need to make an array called boxes and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a VAR box equals create checkbox and boxes. push boox so I'm also going to put them into an array I probably should if I'm doing this create some sort of like maybe div that everything gets like put into let's do that I don't know if this is a good idea or not I'm figuring this out then I'm GNA erase it all and do it again but let's just say I make like a div I'm my HTML file and I call it uh mirror so what I want to do is now for each box I want to say box parent mirror so that means all of them will go in that div after I make each one there we go so we can see that they're there at the top now but now I should be able to do something where maybe I can make the div a certain width maybe I should put I should put line breaks probably or maybe I should absolute position the check check boox hard to decide what to do here kind of don't want to Absolute position them I want them to maintain their sort of natural flow so to speak so I certainly I could put a line break after so right these are the X I'm doing every column I'm doing every X first which means uh yes so I want to do the Y I want to do all the xes I want the X to be the interior Loop this is one of the few instances where this actually matters right because after I do each row I could say something like box I could say VAR P equals create P put nothing in it like make a blank paragraph element and then say p. parent also mirror like so after I make a whole bunch of check boxes I put a paragraph like an empty paragraph This is a bad idea yeah so that worked but it left all this space in between them so I think what would be better is just to say create span and put in the span just a line break maybe I should make that a div I don't know somebody who knows HTML elements can tell me there we go there we go that's what I'm looking for so there is sort of the problem if the browser window isn't wide enough it does wrap there's probably some like style CSS style that I could apply to force it like make sure it doesn't wrap somebody could probably tell me that if you know um or probably actually I want wonder if I just make the div like um a certain width right like so if I add some style here is anybody watching this are you in the somebody in the chat like say something because I've sort of lost uh it does say that 21 people are watching but um I would like to know if anyone's actually if this if my audio is still working and all that so if I add uh something like this like a fixed width to that div does that work hey that worked I don't know what the right width is let me let me see like uh let me give it a background color just so I can see it that's about right actually we'll leave it at that so so that's good so that uh that makes it like a fixed width I don't need that background color how do you comment something out in CSS like this right okay so now we've got this so what I want to do right like right now you can see down here let's let's get a good threshold going kind of like this as the threshold so what I want to do is I want to see maybe I want to see checks for white pixels and um no checks for black pixels I'm not sure so let's give that a try the other thing is I don't really want the canvas anymore but I'm going to leave it there just for reference so as I'm looping through the video I um I need to I'm trying to decide if I should make this array a twodimensional array doesn't really okay so I want to look up the correct checkbox in that array let's see if that works so uh um I don't know if this so I don't have the um X Plus y times uh columns and then if I say boxes index checked true this is another index I'm looking up probably doing something bad here I I don't remember what the P5 function is for setting a box to be checked or not let's just pretend it's that uncaught reference calls is not defined ah okay so these need to be Global variables uh so I can use them I mean I could have used just video dowith but I kind of like having those in variables oh look at that it worked so so let me do where's my threshold there we go now can you see boy it's kind of kind of hard to see that but you can see that the checks are going on and off I'm not really getting the visual effect that I had hoped for it's not there's not that high a contrast between having a checked and not checked it works I'm trying to think maybe if I put um I don't know if anybody has any ideas I mean I could sort of play with this threshold you know that's oh maybe what I want is the inverse oh I know what I want uh maybe what I want is this I want to say false true and then what's the Threshold at right now it's like I should figure out what that is and set it there by default uh right that's better so you can see there I am checkbox checkbox Dom element mirror okay so that's uh so it does work people are watching uh and saying hi okay that's nice of you guys okay so I think that this works so now I'm going to have a little water here it's actually not getting it's a very cold day in New York which is probably helping the fact that it's not getting super hot in here even with these new lights so that's kind of promising um okay anybody have questions or comments about this particular example I'm going to now hit um I'm going to kind of go back to the code and I'm going to hit start over and I'm going to try to make this example in 10 minutes kind of diagramming and sketching out um anything that I need to do to cover it my brain is so not working today bad it was was kind of out late last night it's a long story it's not very it's not as interesting as it might sound um okay um I'm going to erase this I'm going to cycle these cameras is 110 right now so what I want to do uh actually is make sure I save this code somewhere um just in case I totally screw it up and can't figure out what I did um let's just save a backup of it in like text edit or something and then I'm going to go back to this example which was this and I am going to I am going to make a tutorial how about radio buttons that is a great suggestion the the reason why I'm not going to do it's a really good suggestion so visually the effect might be better with radio buttons um the P5 um API for radio buttons is a little bit uh trickier um and because it radio button is kind of like a collection of things and their options it's more like a drop down kind of menu so I'm going to um I think it'll I think it would be worth doing but I think it'll it makes for a cleaner video just to demonstrate with the check boxes but that is a great suggestion yeah a CSS background on would definitely help so I might I might do that um let's see the twitch thing by the way doesn't seem to be taking off very much I've got 22 people watching on YouTube and three people watching on Twitch but I'll leave it running see what happens okay um so let's go let's see um so hold on let me minimize this and let me get code up great and this ah I'm going to take this out out in and I'm going to take this out going to show how to do this okay just getting myself ready and here we go last check okay going to try to make this checkbox mirror in 10 minutes explaining every piece of it talking to the camera with enthusiasm and making sense uh okay here we go hello in this video I'm going to take this example which is currently I called a brightness mirror where each pixel of the image is drawn as a rectangle brighter pixels bigger rectangle darker pixels smaller rectangle I'm going to turn this example into what I'll call the checkbox mirror so instead of drawing to an HTML 5 canvas based on a video Source or an image source I want to create Dom elements checkboxes that get checked or unchecked based on the brightness of a pixel and incidentally while doing this we're going to look at an image processing Effect called a thresholding effect so I'm just going to Dive Right In um if you uh into this code example which was covered in the previous video which you can go back and watch watch if you haven't but I'm going to Dive Right In and start making it so let's go over to the code and the main thing the main sort of piece here in the code is that for every pixel I'm getting a brightness value that brightness value is the red plus the green plus the blue divided by three the average of the red green and blue components of the color so a threshold effect is an effect where you say ah there is a given threshold 127 any pixel that has a brightness over 127 I want to do something any pixel that has a brightness less than 127 I want to do something else typically I might assign the pixel value for anything over 127 to White and anything less than 127 to Black so let's do something like that I can say if bright is greater than threshold fill 255 so just anything above 127 make it 255 anything below 20 127 make it zero now I could set pixels but since I'm doing drawing stuff I'm not going to bother with setting pixels I'm just going to go I don't need to do this mapping anymore to a size of a rectangle I'm just going to go right down get rid of this fill and just draw a rectangle at the full size that is either white or black based on that threshold so let me Zoom back out Let me refresh this and we should see now you can sort of now you see exactly what I'm talking about each rectangle in the screen is is either white or back and you can see how it's white or back white or black and you can see how I'm getting the sort of Contours of the video almost like a silhouette low resolution silhouette with this threshold effect now one thing about it you'll notice if I go back to this example that I hardcoded a threshold value of 127 what would probably be more useful is to have a slider so that you could adjust that threshold you based on you know whatever the sort of existing video is so let's actually do that so one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make a variable called slider in P5 an easy way to place a slider in the browser is with the create slider function of course there's a zillion other ways you can get a slider there but this is just one I'm going to say slider equals create slider and when you make a slider you need three values the minimum value for the slider the maximum value of the slider and where that slider starts so zero is the minimum 255 is the maximum and we'll start it right there in the middle at 127 so if I go back and refresh you can see there's a slider down here now that I can move around the issue is I want to take the value of that slider and I want to um I want to assign it to the threshold and that's actually a really easy thing for me to do right now because here I said threshold equals 127 all I have to do now to change that is say threshold equals slider. value the value of the slider is the threshold sometimes code it just reads like language in its own sort of way if you read it backwards um so now if I hit refresh you can see here there's the image and I'm trying to look at the camera look at this but as I slide it up you can see that threshold is changing and you can see now with a lower threshold all of the pixels that are rather bright behind me are getting white and actually only my shirt which is kind of dark and my hair which is kind of dark and you can see this is what the actual video is right all those dark pixels are getting assigned um a black uh a black value so I I kind of want to um remember what this value is so I can actually just here in the console type slider. value to see 77 I kind of like this as a threshold value so I'm going to now I'm going to go and change the slider to start at 77 of course I can still adjust it but now each time I hit refresh it'll just start right at 77 okay so now we have this thresholding effect the thing that I want to do is I want to take each of these rectangles that I'm drawing in this canvas and not have it be a canvas with shapes and colors that I'm drawing I want to actually make Dom elements checkbox Dom elements so let's look at how we do that if I go back to the code uh here I'm recording this yes okay just checking if I go back to the code see how I said create slider there's also a P5 function called create checkbox I'm just GNA toss that into setup and you can see look there's a checkbox now there's a checkbox there now what I want to do is I want to make a lot of checkboxes in fact I want a checkbox for every single Pixel in the video so I need a loop to to make checkbox after checkbox after checkbox so I'm going to go back to the code and I'm going to say now what should I Loop through how many checkboxes I do I need well I need one for every X and every y pixel so I need as many checkboxes as the width and the height width times the height of that video Source um I was going to draw a diagram but I think you're with me so um one thing that I think would be useful is actually to just keep track of uh variables for the grid so what we've got here I have this whiteboard I insist on using it so in other words I want a checkbox and there's a certain number of columns right and a certain number of rows and those map to the width and height of the video so what I think would be useful is to have variables called columns and rows so I can just keep track of that number um throughout my code because I'm going need to use it at a bunch of different places so what is um columns the number of columns is the width of the canvas but the canvas is going to go away so I'm going to say 640 it's it's funny how I could I could actually just sort of interestingly enough you know what I just realized these this should be actually a hardcoded value so let's think about what is uh 640 divided by 16 you know I could probably do that math in my head but I got a console here 40 so let's say we're going to have 40 columns and 30 rows that's kind of a reasonable number of checkboxes so uh so my video definitely needs to be the size of columns rows and I don't need to worry about all of that math anymore of scale of canvas because the canvas is going to go away I'm going to leave it there right now because it's useful to have it there as a reference so now what I need to do is I need to say for every column and for every row Create A checkbox and D there we go so now look at this look at all those checkboxes so I now have a checkbox in the browser page for every single Pixel but they're not really organized through by any logic right they're just all next to each other right and so I need them to maintain the same grid right I need to have exactly the number of checkboxes in the first first row the second row the third row so I need to figure out some way of doing that so one way of doing that I knew I had to use for this whiteboard is that let's say I have I have this web page right this is the browser and what's happening when I call create checkbox is it just sticks a checkbox in the page then it sticks another one then sticks another one I'm doing that Millions not millions of times 40 times 30 times you do the math right and it just keeps doing that it gets to the edge of the page it wraps to the next one what I want to actually do I think is establish a div a div being a a container a box an area in the web page maybe I'll call that div mirror and I want to be able to always put the checkboxes in that div that way I could control some style of the div it's width and height its position on the page all of that sort of stuff so I think it would be useful to put a div now I could say creative because P5 has a function creative to put a div in the page but I think this might be a moment where it's actually easier to just dig into the HTML itself so I've gone to the index.html file that's associated with this particular sketch and I'm actually just in the body right here I'm going to add a div and I'm going to say div ID equals zoomed in way too much ID equals mirror so I the ID is very important I need to give that div an ID so I know how to reference it from my JavaScript code for my p5js code so I want to put all the checkboxes into that particular div so let's do that uh whoops um let's go back to sorry I need to go back to the JavaScript code and I need to I'm just going to I need to assign a variable to that checkbox take that Bo that checkbox I made put it in a variable say box. parent mirror and the parent function what it does it say this Dom element you've just made put it inside that div so that div the mirror div becomes the parent to those checkboxes and if I run this now you can see there they are now you're noticing they're above because the canvas and everything else gets created after that particular div now what this allows me to do if I go back to the HTML file is add some styling for that div so pound or hash mirror this is CSS I'll refer you to my CSS tutorial videos but I can do some things like say uh width and I'm going to make it a fixed width of 800 pixels I think I kind of worked this out earlier today I think that's going to work about right you know trial and error would probably get me that number and also just so I can see it for a moment I'm going to give it a background color like something kind of light um just so we can see that that div is there I'm going to hit refresh now you can see that that's the container essentially the Box the div and all the check boxes are there and you can see it has a little bit of a background color now notice this didn't really work out I didn't get the exact number of width to like make sure the the um make that sure the checkboxes wrap appropriately but I'm going to I'm going to actually do something to like 100% be right about this so in the sketch I'm looking at every single column and every single row and what I want to do is when I get to the end of a row I want to add a line break an HTML line break so the checkboxes then go onto the next row right I want to do you know 40 checkboxes and then put a line bre oh I came over here and I didn't change look I'm over here now sorry uh I want to put 40 uh checkboxes then do a line break and then do the next 40 checkboxes okay so where do I do that in this loop I need to put a line break well incidentally I actually have my Loop this is one of the few times where whether the x is on the outside or the x is on the inside is quite important right because what I need to be doing is I need to be saying uh first do the first row then all the X's then do the second row then all the X's so y needs to be on the outside I have to do all the X's for every y so I've actually got to fix this and put y on the outside and then what I can do is after I do a whole set of x's I can say uh uh line break equals create div I'll just make a div with a line break in it and then also put parent that to what the uh mirror so now I'm guaranteeing that after every row of checkboxes I get a line break so now let's run that oh that doesn't look right uh you know what let's try using Create span I think the div has a lot of uh stuff it's not like in line so let's let's use create span there that's better I knew I missed something so I'm trying to put something in there that doesn't have any padding or line break around it already and a span element allows me to do that you can see 800 pixels was about right for this particular area I could have you know maybe it's 750 or whatever but now I can also get rid of that I don't need to uh see the background color anymore that was just sort of for debugging I can take that out and we can see now I have a perfect grid of checkboxes the exact number for every single Pixel in that Source video and you can see here you know I can check them and uncheck them but that's not what I want to happen I want to maybe check the dark ones and uncheck the light ones so how do I do that well first of all I need to have a way of referring to those checkboxes like I made them all and I put them on the page but I didn't store anything so I need an array I need to keep track of all those Dom elements over time how am I doing here uh 13 minutes I was trying to make this under 15 minutes it's not going to be okay so make an array called boxes and what I'm going to do is for every checkbox that I make I'm going to put that checkbox in the array so I make an empty array and I'm storing them all so I now have this big array if I refresh the page and I go over here to the console and take a look you can see I have an array with 1,00 checkboxes in it because 40 * 30 is 1,00 1,200 pixels 1,200 checkboxes there's a lot of them they're all P5 elements okay and you can there's all sorts of stuff associated with them so now how do I check or uncheck them so right here where I was saying with my th threshold effect I was previously saying if the brightness is greater than a given threshold fill white otherwise fill black instead what I want to do is I want to say something like check oh boxes index checked false boxes index checked true so what I want to do is I want to uncheck the bright ones check the dark ones and this is a P5 function the checked function is a way of dynamically checking or unchecking a checkbox with code if you don't give it an argument it just gives you returns you whether it's checked or unchecked which is usually what you use a checkbox for okay but this index isn't exactly right remember because the index was this thing where I was trying to look up a pixel and the pixels are like RGB so I need my own own Index this index of looking up the pixels is different than the index in into that array of of checkboxes unfortunately so I'm going to make a new variable I'm going to call that a check index and it is equal to x + y time uh the number of columns and then I'm going to use that checked index so there we go what I'm doing is in I'm doing both actually I'm going to get rid of the rectangle in a second but instead of ultimately instead of drawing rectangles based on pixels I'm checking and unchecking checkboxes and I have an array of pixels that I have to look up the color one way using the X Plus y * 4 a whole nonsense and I have to look up in the checkbox array a different way because there are not there's not an RGB and Alpha for each checkbox or just one checkbox I had to say this to myself because it's very confusing okay let's take a to look now hit refresh and we can see here come on video there it is so you can see that right there I am I'm going to high five myself again that's not really working but you can see my face here in checkboxes can zoom in a little bit you can see those checkboxes are going um Up and Down based on my face here I don't know what I'm looking Atmore okay this was exciting it worked sorry I wasn't sure whether that was going to happen so what I want to do now is just get rid of I'm going to say instead of create canvas I'm going to say no canvas and I'm going to get rid of I load pixels which doesn't need to be in there uh and I don't need background anymore there's no canvas I don't need uh these fills anymore I just want to simplify this I don't need this anymore and now if we run this again we should see just the checkbox mirror on the page and you can see here I can play with that threshold still you can see based on what I do with the threshold we get different sort of effects and there it is the Dom checkbox I refreshing it because I like that value of 77 the um Dom checkbox mirror so I don't know so um somebody met in a comment ear said oh wouldn't radio buttons be better maybe you'll get a a better effect you know I would encourage you could you do something weird with like sliders make just regular divs text on the page what kind of um I would love to see people's Frankenstein creations of Dom elements visualizing image data with no canvas and no pixels and no drop just manipulating Dom elements themselves so give that a try tweet me or write in the comments if you make something I would love to see how it turns out thanks for watching okay so that was medium smooth uh so I'm looking at the comments says um somebody said cool man how was that was that okay to that makes sense I kind of feel like I lost myself in a few uh tangents there I'm going to check twitch type tighten up the checkbox grid maybe somebody uh yeah I think somebody on Twitch is very confused probably because they just uh so um San Diego classic says uh I'm confused or if you're confused imagine probably goes so if you are if you just accidentally came here I would and you um and you're confused I might go back and watch some of my earlier tutorials that kind of like led up to this I don't know how else okay uh spectron writes would it be possible to have a dynamic threshold calculating the average of the brightness value of every pixel and set this average as the threshold or something absolutely that's a great that's a great suggestion so you could you could have a threshold value that adjusts based on what the camera is actually seeing so if in a bright room it has a sort of higher threshold in a dark room it has a lower threshold and there might be some other sort of magic learning types of algorithms you could think about applying so certainly that I mean that's something you could absolutely do um all right so that recorded let's look it's 135 I was going to try to do this until like 2 I wouldn't or a little bit after I've been streaming now for uh 50 minutes I don't know how much I have a sore throat today uh where is my uh list of things videos to do oh yeah we should definitely do the next one this one is one of my favorite ones okay so I'm GNA um so if you guys have more questions type them into the chat I'm going to start opening up some examples and getting myself situated to make another tutorial which is about kind of doing a painting So what I want to do is I'm going to show uh let me see if I can find this uh uh this is see if this will open so what I'm doing now is I'm opening a project that I actually made not in processing but I made this project in 2002 and it is a um I'm going to see if this runs um so what this project does is it has all of these flocking agents and what they do is they um color in uh sorry I'm looking at to see how this looks they smear colors that they're picking up from a camera so what I want to do is basically like show how you make something like this but I want to um there's a couple things I want to do with this so I think what I want to do is uh just add a few things where where am I am I in draw here yes uh so like if Mouse pressed background uh zero oops oh yeah that's fine uh let's just uh put this on the desktop uh oops ah desktop desktop so I want to uh I think what I would like to be able to show is this so that's really what's going on there are all of these uh agents moving around uh and then when I Let Go there's the background is not cleared okay so that's I think that's a and then I wonder if it's worth um just putting video in the top left corner so you can kind of see it actually I'm just going to do that in the in the debugging so let me do this where's the mouse come out oh right so you can see that's what it's actually doing and then it's doing it as a mirror though okay so I'm going to show this as an example and then what I'm going to do is make a project that does this ah I know what to do and I'm going to base it off of the example I have from a previous video with all those things that move around randomly storing their history okay uh so what I need to do very quickly is not very quickly actually I just need to do this is do uh I'm going to call this 06 painting and um I'm going to go to Sublime and I'm going to uh um oh I kind of want this checkbox mirror would be a better oh this brightness mirror would be a better one to start with with oops just sneeze it's going to be loud okay okay uh just checking the chat there might be some questions in the chat I'll get to them in a second let me get what I'm doing here uh so I have a basic example now uh which if I go here should just have this and the video and now what I want is I want to get so a a while back I made a video let's see if we can find this um it was called uh let me go under playlists it's under p5g tutorial additional topics drawing object Trails so uh now I'm I'm watching it this is an ad inside an ad so uh P5 just part uh 9.4 so I should be able to go to um GitHub shiftman video Lesson materials and go to code p5js 9.4 and I should be able to grab the code for this particular kind of particle I'm going to grab it and I'm going to create a new file and I'm going to call it uh particle. Js and to paste it in here now the interesting thing here is I realized I don't actually need the history even though that's what that whole example was about um because I'm just not going to draw the background so I'm going to just do this so I just need the particle which is just a randomly moving thing obviously you could be more thoughtful about how you have things move uh and then I'm going to I don't need that anymore so let me just make sure this works I'm going to say VAR particle particle equals new particle particle. update particle dot what did I call it maybe I called it show uh particle is not defined right because I need to reference it in in the HTML file I don't need this styling I don't need this div and seems to be working so let's take a look particle it needs an X and A Y and it also uh let's make it white it needs an X and A Y so let's put it in the middle great so we have a particle moving we have a video so I want the particle to pick up the colors from the video then I want to have a lot of them then I want them to smear um so let's just let me just take a do a few more things just to sort of see how this is going to work I'm not going to go through all this I'll start recording in a second background 51 okay so you can see how that works but probably one thing I should change is have no stroke and you can see so this is now in essence smearing colors uh and those colors could be picked up from the live video okay let me check the chat this I'm pretty much ready I think to go with these examples to set the stage okay um so I'm I'm looking at the anyone have any suggestions for playing with midi with P5 that's a good question I don't so I'm move on to the next question although I will say the P5 Sound Library has a ton of features you might check that out to see if there's something in there that you could use um what's your view on VAR creation should vars only be created outside a loop does it matter with JS my view honestly is an um you know I'm probably going someone's going to like the the variable police are going to like charge in here the and like take me out in variable handcuffs but you know I kind of feel like whatever works it's fine don't worry about it too much I you know it's kind of I think there are larger questions of kind of efficiency and optimization when you get to a certain point in a project but I think while you're being creative and trying to figure out an idea or make something work however it kind of like makes sense to you to organize stuff is just fine I do think on some level though um having variables scoped to only where you need them can help you from an organizational standpoint so there's not really aot good reason to have a thousand Global variables if certain variables are just sort of local to inside a particular Loop somewhere I would declare them in there but there's a lot of particular JavaScript stuff with that that's that would be a perspective I would say um what if you wanted to manipulate heading size correlating to the amount of similarly grouped pixel colors um I I I lost track of where this is um what this is referring to but maybe if you're talking about the flocking you could would be interesting to think about having those agents that are painting colors actually move towards certain kinds of colors have forces that drive them I think that's a very interesting idea um okay um uh oh brackets someone mentions brackets which is also a great um editor environment that you could potentially use um I should probably do um I should probably do some more tutorials with um other editors like Adam or brackets ah let me mention something to you guys really important if you're trying to play with my examples there is a bug in P5 let's go check on the current status it is bug I have this one memorized uh uh it is it under issues 1079 so there's an issue where when I'll show you exactly in the example what the problem is when you call video. size and scale it down the pixel array doesn't actually scale down as well which you Mo almost always want because you're making the video lower resolution so you can look at fewer pixels so I have made a modified version of P5 Dom .js which you can get if you go to the video Lesson materials GitHub repository um that fixes that bug and that bug has not let's see if there's any additional discussion um that bug has not yet been resolved so I'm making these videos the tutorials that will live on YouTube without really referencing that bug because I at some point in the future people will just be like watching the video tutorial and p5js will do that thing but if I just want to mention that because if you're following along and playing with the examples what you're going to want to get and I'll just be a little bit more clear about this is if you go to/ shiftman video Lesson materials code P5 jet JJs and oop sorry the ones that are 10 point whatever I haven't uploaded the ones from today yet but if you get the one that's like 10.4 p5js brightness mirror it's going to have the P5 Li the modified P5 Library files that I'm using that have that bug fixed in them and then at some point the actual new release of p5js will have the bug fixed in them but for now and I'm so anyway if that's unclear please ask in the chat um so uh people are suggesting you do a tutorial with brackets and with atom so let me make let me add that um to my uh list of things so I'm going to um so I'm going to make a item which is like different editors with p5js I'm going to add uh brackets Adam Etc so there we go uh where am I here little lost why did I oh update okay so uh that's just a note that I'll remember later to do that okay let's see where am I now here we are painting that's here um the video is loading the pixels are loading the particle is updated and showing why oh I'm way too far over that's the problem I'm supposed to have my laptop here so I stand here and don't block the code was I blocking the code in that entire previous video oh God I hope that wasn't too bad uh such as life okay um so let me call this one 06 painting and uh I'm going to to close all these so all I need is sketch and particle particle and sketch and that's running here um can close this I should probably follow this all the way through and make it but whatever I'm going to improvise it and I'm going to get processing open uh make this small so I really need it this is just for demonstration purposes and I wonder if the browser is using the camera can processing use it as well we're about to find out amazingly yes although it is running a little bit slower so I think what I'm going to do is get back here have the code open processing open I am also going to uh erase this whiteboard does this seem kind of dark to you guys by the way um this view of the Whiteboard let me know how the image quality is if it's blurry or dark um it's definitely better than it was uh last time I did this and I could brighten it for sure I know a way of bright but I'm I'm I'm kind of not going to do that right now I might move the light closer to me or whatever anyway just let me know if it seems dark uh okay um okay so we're at an hour I've got 26 people I'm going to just check the twitch chat um uh thank you San Diego classic nice comment saying that there you like the setup I've been working very hard on this setup so it pleases me uh greatly okay so here we are I going to do the next video painting a portrait with things moving and pixels and yada Yad yada yada yada okay I'm going to cycle the cameras and actually you know what I'm going to do I'm going to start this video with this just running behind me and maybe I will even let it run for a little bit uh now the question is oh interesting so also I think what I should do is angle this sorry I'm just trying to get this doing something how look how orange I am okay so that's pretty good for right now okay so what does this look like oh yeah it kind of works I'm looking at the chat could be a bit brighter okay I'm gonna look into making the um whiteboard view a little bit brighter so I can see I'm so much brighter over here and it probably is like a setting on the camera actually there's like what are those things called fstop something frustrum fro frogel from I don't know any it's I'm it's pathetic how I supposedly know something about technology I'm like completely inept if it's not like software it's like the camera is like a physical thing that I cannot touch or else I might break it or hurt myself okay um here we go I have to reach over to hit record uh okay look at that yeah there's I don't know okay I'm going to do this here we go I'm like rolling up my sleeves it's getting is getting warm in here I think but it's okay it's not so bad summertime might be a problem all right let's go hello in this video I'm going to look at how to create a certain kind of effect the effect that you see behind me where you have things that are drawing in a window um let me start this video over uh okay so uh by the way spiky cat who just joined asked what language is this this particular example that I'm running is actually running in processing just because it is a project that I made uh 14 years ago and I recently ported it to processing but I'm going to demonstrate how to code something like this in p5js but I I will Port all of these except for the checkbox one I can't Port anything anything that I can port to processing I will port to processing okay here we go everybody hello I am here to make a video to show you how to program a certain kind of thing a kind of thing like the thing you see behind me which is oh I have to stand still for this to happen but um what you see behind me is a flocking system there are all of these little squares floating around the screen and what they're doing is they're picking up pixel values color values from a CA camera that's in front of me and smearing those colors onto the screen so this is a project that I actually I think that I made around 14 years ago I'm running updated version of it that runs in processing and what I'm going to do is show you how to actually make something like this happen in the browser using JavaScript p5js HTML 5 canvas um so let me just mention a few other things about this that you'll see is that so if I if I click the mouse here which um I'm now I'm clearing the background and what you'll see is they're just all of these squares moving around the screen now they're using this kind of like bees swarming insect swarming sort of kind of like motion and you can see that's what the camera is actually seeing up behind me and so if I let go of the mouse instead of clearing the background these agents will just simply uh you know keep drawing those colors but their their trails are being revealed so how does how do you program something like this let's so I'm going to close this down um and I'm going to minimize processing here and I've got a p5js example that I'm going to start with and the example just has a a couple things it has a live video and it has a single particle now this particle comes from a previous video that I will magically have an annotation pop up that references where I showed you how to have something move around the screen and draw a trail of itself and you can see here and it's going to move randomly so the you know in the swarming thing they're swarming like insects here it's just going to move randomly but if you decide to take this example and do something with it you might think of different kinds of motion spiral Etc whatever that you might think of doing so let me on this particular example right here and you can see this is all it is you can see that there is a video Dom element giving me a sort of low resolution image of myself that I can use to pick up pixel colors and there is a thing moving around the screen randomly a single particle so the first thing that I want to figure out how to do is how do I have this particle actually grab colors from that video and um so notice that I say video. load pixels um one thing that I'm going to do just WR now for a second is put background back into draw and I'm going to run this again so you can see this is what's happening so what I want is for that particle to be colored according to what's in the video so this is actually kind of an easy thing to do surprisingly enough in the particle object itself notice how it gets a fill color which is always 255 comma 150 so it's white with a little bit of alpha but I don't want this to be 255 rather what I want is to get some sort of color from the video. getet this.x this.y so this is kind of the idea here what I want is I have the canvas with a particle moving around and I have this particular video with a portrait you know of myself so this particle should look up the corresponding color in the video and set its f fill and this particle's location is at this.x this doy so I should be able to just say give me the pixel value at this.x this.y in the video only I can't right because if you notice this canvas is actually 640 by 480 and my video is actually 40 by 30 so what I need to do is I need to scale down so wherever the particle is it's X and Y I need to scale it down dividing by 16 to find the corresponding pixel value in the video so let's come back over here and do that so what I think could be useful is to make another variable I'm going to call it PX for like pixel X I just made a weird like arm motion that I don't know what it means pixel X um PX and I'm going to say this.x divided by V scale if you remember V scale is a variable that I have that keeps track of how big is the canvas relative to the video and I'm going to make another variable called py which is this.y divided by V scale and I'm going to say now give me the color at PX py now there's a slight issue P I wonder if P5 actually doesn't care let's keep going there's an issue which is that I might get the number 4.79 83125 which is not a valid pixel value pixel values are only whole numbers integer values pixel 4 pixel 7 there's no pixel 7 and a half so I might need to add something to this to correct that but let's just sort of see at least what happens now what is in this variable Co let's just see if this even works and I'm going to because I'm going to add console.log the color and I'm by the way I'm not using the word color even though I have a variable that's describing a color color the word color is a keyword in P5 it's an actual function so I'm just saying Co for kind of short for color so let's now go back and run this again we have a view of our console here we can see I'm only ever getting black that doesn't seem right I I don't think it should be black uh 00 255 so let's go and let's add this thing that I want to add which maybe we'll fix it saying floor so what floor does is it takes any number that might be a decimal number and lops off that decimal number so 3.8 becomes three 3.3 becomes 3 3.9 becomes 3 7.2 becomes seven just takes that and gives me a nice integer whole number which is what I need and let's run this again still getting only black here oh no there we go just took a minute for the video to like come alive so you can see this is working and that it's pulling out color values you can see they're all very green because it's probably wandering around the green screen behind me so what can I do now I should be able to say and notice by the way that this is an array so the get function gives you a single Pixel and it gives you an array a red green blue and Alpha value so what I can do is I can say now fill now fill the red Val there's a bunch of different ways I could do this but and this might be sort of a silly way but I'm just going to say let me actually now take the red green and blue values to color that particular and I can take out console.log I can run this again and you can see come alive video you can see look it's green and you can see if my face gets in there there we go it's picking up colors so good we're getting somewhere now let's go back to sketch. JS let's put let's take out background and draw and put background back in setup and you can see now it is going to start painting me if I stood very still but rather slowly and who knows how long and how patient we can be here to kind of do this so what what would might make this better is to have a lot of these in the window so what I think would make more sense is for me to make an array called particles let's start with 100 of them and let's say particles index I equals a new particle so instead of having a single variable particle let's have an array of particles let's make a whole bunch of them and then everything I can do a loop here through all the particles and just say particles index I update particles index I show and now I can run this again and we can see there we go as I move around you can see I'm kind of getting this like very pointal list like portrait of myself now there is no swarming there is no flocking it's just random motion also these particles they're leaving the window they're gone forever let's see if we can just make a few improvements to this at least to keep it a bit more stable so one thing that I think is kind of important here um and might be worth it might be worth actually making like a little slider for this I'm going to add a slider uh is that that Alpha value is going to make a big difference in in uh what it looks like so Alpha goes between 0 and 255 let's start in the middle at 127 and so I'm going to make a slider and then I'm just going to take this Alpha value Alpha value and have it be the value of that slider so we can sort of see what happens here with like less Alpha you know no Alpha like uh less more Alpha I don't what is it you could get that so it's fuzzier or harsher so that's one thing that's sort of important to see the other thing that I think might be good to do is add some kind of constraints like uh this.x equals constrain it's valued between zero and width I could probably come up with a better solution this.y zero. height so I don't ever want it to leave the window um so I want to keep it always on in the window and so we can see now uh and they're all starting from the middle maybe I should maybe maybe I want to have them all start from uh you know a random spot in the window just uh so let's do that so you can see here and uh now that's working let's see what happens if now I go and uh make 500 of them is this even going to run come video so you can see there's an issue here which is like performance is a bit of an issue even even though I have so many more now that I'm kind of more quickly seeing the image resolve whether or not I want that I don't know but it's running rather slow so there is a limit to how much we can really draw on canvas let's try 200 and see if it's kind of a smoother animation there we go so 200 seems pretty good another thing that I might add to this I'm stop and is uh maybe a variable for a size so I'm drawing them all as a 24x 24 but maybe I should make a random size between like four and 32 and uh so each one of these particles will actually be a different size um which it might be kind of an interesting effect to have sort of like smaller dots and larger dots I don't know if that's really helpful I'm going to try to stand still for a second um you get the idea I could keep going with this so what I would say there's a you know there's there's a few things that I want to mention here number one is um there's a couple things that I'm doing in the in the original example that I showed you that maybe I won't add right now but I'll mention one thing that you might that that can be an issue is that if you have depending on what your motion is if you have a particle that's here and then the next frame it's over here there's going to be this sort of jump so one thing that I did do in that you could consider doing is wherever the particle moves to also draw particles in between them so you always get this continuous line you could also use actually just the line function and keep track of its previous location and its current location that's one thing that you might consider consider the other thing that you might consider is averaging color over time so let me let me let me explain what I mean by this so let's say there is uh this is the figure that the camera is seeing and this is the particle and it's moving this way and this is the painting that it's making so and this is a red sweater and this is a black background what you're going to see based on what I've done here is red red red red red black right this being that edge the particle is going to instantly change to the next color cuz it's literally drawing the color it sees with the pixel but if every time it moves you just average in a little more color then that creates a smearing effect so what you would see instead is red red red red red a little less red a little less a little less red blacker blacker blacker blacker blacker blacker black black black red a little more red so it's going to average the color as it's moving so in in order to do that what you would need is for your particle object to actually store a color and when you get the color from the video to average that new color with the color that it's storing so I'll leave that as an exercise and I'll try to post an example that does that there's actually a P5 function called lurp color that will do this math of averaging for you that you could look at using uh boy I really kind want to add it right now but I'm not going to um but and then the other thing I would say is to really think about is what is the motion so so you know if I go back really quickly just remind ourselves what this looks like with the background on right you can see this is this is the motion of my particles that are painting the image but what if all the particles just move left and right or up and down or they use a flocking system or they're all bouncing off of each other or they're all spiraling around so what are some other ways that you can think of how those brush Strokes are created and in addition like are you just drawing circles are you smearing like you know image textures or rectangles there's a lot of possibil ities here so think about all those possibilities maybe make some sort of painting thing pixel whatever and share it with me on Twitter or in the comments and uh ask your questions and I look forward to see what people make under 1550 minutes thank goodness okay uh see you soon okay I there's something to be said for practicing these videos before you do them okay um boy there's a dis a whole discussion here in the um in the chat uh people are talking about neural networks uh yes uh you know um nion cat fan you know this is I'm glad you brought this up um I don't maybe this isn't what you U meant to discuss or what you were actually talking about but in the nature of code book I do have a chapter on neural networks it's all the way down here uh chapter 10 and I would say it's this chapter is a little bit of a copout uh it's I kind of it's kind of like a little bit tacked on like the whole all this material flows together one from the other tells this story and then there's this kind of like tacton neural network things it's kind of like ah this is sort of what it is and here's some examples and then here's visualizing drawing the diagram but no actual applications so I'm actually working on a revised version of this chapter um uh based on new things that have come alive in the world of machine learning for artists there's a great Caden course uh by Rebecca Rebecca febr if I pronounce her name correctly from Goldsmith it's an online course from a company called kadenz about machine learning for artists Jean kogan is somebody that you could look up who's creating a tons of tutorials and information about machine learning has showed me he showed me the other day some different JavaScript libraries for using neural networks so you know I don't I I don't um so I'm going to try to make that chapter it's not going to be a comprehensive suddenly like machine learning book but have a bit more depth to it and perhaps one or two actual practical examples that you could apply to the some of the motion based stuff that's in the book so we'll see if that's kind of on my list of things to do now this springsummer um okay let's see here um uh some people are saying hi James Johnson says you're late sorry I'm just about finishing up for right now today it is oh yeah it's after two so I unfortunately to go um I let's look at my list here um videos to do all right so I didn't get to the slit scan or seriously. JS I'm going to see if I can come back later I by the way so every time I've said this I haven't come back but I but I'm going to see if I can come back in an hour and a half or so two hours and do one or two more videos this going to be tight today to do that however I will be doing more videos on Thursday and Friday of this week so I'm definitely going to get to these last two topics on Thursday and or Friday and then I'm hoping now that I have a sort of better lighting setup in here um to be able to uh start I think what I want to do is uh this week sorry let me go back my plan is to do the um get tutorials get those going and then also um because I'm a workshop next weekend on twitterbots I want to um I'm probably going to be making some more examples with node and P5 and so I might um try to do these sort of like node uh tutorials um next week as videos as well so we'll see if I get to that um let me just see if anybody has any last questions um I have not seen Mario but I'm going to look that up oh and somebody asked what's the difference between lurp and lurp color great question so lurp stands for linear interpolation it's a way of linearly moving between two values and the regular lurp function just says like if I have the value zero and the value 10 and I want to lurp 60% I'm getting the value six so it's just luring a single value what lurp color does is because color is not a single value but a collection of red green and blue values is it the lurp color function allows you to say take these rgbs and this target rgbs and lurp all three of those all in one so lurp color is exactly the same as lurp but it's doing it with multiple values for a color hopefully that made sense um uh yes yes those are the great feedback about the neural network chapter nen cat fan thanks for that okay um thanks for the nice comments thanks arger ah Mr breitz gamer says I'm French do you speak French well I'm a I'm unfortunately an American and in this country no one ever bothers to like do a really good job of making us learn lots of other languages which we really should to be a citizen of the world but I did happen to learn French when I was in middle and high school so I do speak um but that's about other languages not very much um but I would love to learn more languages and speak more languages I would really like to have all these videos translated and subtitled but I right now it's sort of right now would just like them to be closed caption for people who are hearing impaired um uh and so that's sort of my number one priority right now and then I would also like to have them translated so if anybody has any ideas about how to do that I'm looking into crowdsourcing or paying services and different ways of doing that I will be getting to that uh okay uh make a bot to do that I don't know if that's what you're uh I don't know if that's what you make uh make what you're referring to anyway um okay uh I uh is it essential to write this variable in the class I'm not sure okay I got to go so I'll be back send me your questions on Twitter or in the YouTube comments uh you can always post questions to the processing forum and then send me a link to your Forum post that's much preferable to email questions it's too much I can't I email questions I'll I have a trouble getting to them it's not my that I desire to get to them but it's sort of hard to maintain so if you have questions YouTube comments Twitter sort of not the greatest place to post a question but it's a good place to get in touch but posting a complex question in a processing forum and you know tweeting me a link to that that's a good way okay uh back maybe today if I have time to slip one more in otherwise Thursday or Friday definitely not tomorrow though tomorrow I have other things on my schedule so I won't be here in the recording studio see yall
