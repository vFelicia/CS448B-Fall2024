hello good afternoon and welcome to the coding train a weekly internet thing with me your host Daniel Shipman in a room by myself with some lights and some computers and a door and a camera and a monitor to see that I'm actually on and that perhaps for once I'm starting this livestream without my microphone muted is that possible could it possibly be true I'm looking at the slack channel there is a live YouTube chat which I find a bit hard to follow though I will attempt to follow it there's also a slack channel which is for patrons of the coding train if you would like to join that it's a crowdfunding site called patreon patreon comm slash coding trains something like that so here's the thing actually I feel like I'm saying this all the time but if you notice there's some like bags under my eyes or if I see what sorts things like hair is a bit more unkempt I'm not sure who to blame here exactly but I'm kind of addicted I've got it running over here on this this like invisible laptop thing whew what's this weird like an invisible laptop thing here but there's and I'm rockin don't worry as much as I might have suggested at one point I was going to livestream me just playing this game about paper clips that would have to talk about I'm not going to do that I'm just at least gonna start I'm just gonna like open up a window everything's gonna be fine I'm not gonna get sucked into the vortex of the paper clips Frank Lance Franklin's the director of the NYU game MFA and BFA program here and University of Tisch School of the Arts created a game which I guess is called the clicker it's a clicker and let's see where it lets see paper clip what happens if I just Google paper clips now what do I find a game about making paper clips blah blah blah oh this is my my really just jumping on the bandwagon Frank and so what I would like to go is to let's go find this game we find okay okay here we go okay so the green paper is visible ah I know the magic the magic I meant to bring like a whole bucket of paper clips here with me and I could just juggle them or put them in my hair just play with them but instead I'm gonna go here I'm gonna increase the size and I'm going to make my first paper clip I would like to tell them to tell me if this game ever ends Joe just like to know if there's an end because right now I am working on on this other computer over here if you just will bear with me for a second I've had this I've got a dedicated machine for making paper clips I'm at what is that except iliyan 1.8 sextillion I'm at 1.8 sextillion oh okay oh but I need to have I should be able to get the selfcorrecting supply chain why can't why is it the selfcorrecting supply chain why hasn't it enabled itself yet by the way I know there's a way I could open up the JavaScript console and like to change all the HTML and I could just make as many paper clips as I want but no I I'm I believe in the purity of the paper clip machine and so I'm gonna make a second one so I'm gonna go away in a second I'm what I'm wondering is I've got a little competition here a little coding train Friday afternoon coding show with a person who didn't sleep nearly enough you know not entirely just because of the paper clips probably lost an hour if I'm being honest the paper clips I did wake up early to make some paper clips and wake up early but that's the first thing I thought of when I woke up but so I'm a little tired today what was I talking about paper clips ah so what I what I was thinking is I have these tshirts I'm wearing one today and there's a bunch of different designs I would like to have a little contest here whoever can guess the number closest to the amount of paper clips that are on this page by the end of this live session of the coding train I will send you a free coding train tshirt if you were one if you want to pick out your style now cuz you're so sure gonna win this you can go to coding train dot store and V I think I'd have no idea MV comm yeah there we go coding training dot store envy calm good nice nice tshirt style that you like there's a bunch no no no no no no not just typing your number in the chat and boy your numbers are way too low let me just tell you it's really low because I have my intention is to kind of least get up there at least till it's like automatically making some paper clips did you tuned in because you thought you'd be watching something about learning to code I'm sorry instead you tuned in to a lunatic on the internet every once in a while manages to focus enough to do a coding tutorial so I I think in order to enter this competition I think you're gonna have to have a Twitter account because I think that's one of the only ways I can regulate a time stamp so it's 312 p.m. Eastern Time if your tweet with hashtag paperclip train you must use the hashtag paperclip train with a net single number if your tweet has the number closest to whatever I end with and your tweet is before 330 p.m. Eastern Time that means 330 p.m. and 59 seconds if that's the time stamp is fine but 331 and any number of seconds is not okay I will send you I will I would send you a box of paperclips but then I have to go to the post office myself it's such a pain but this printondemand tshirt send you a tshirt it's just so okay so paperclip train now if you want to play along let's make some more paper clips alright do up to like 16 what do I need to do here so I need to get someone I got a what do I need to do I need to let's just keep making some paperclips I forget I it was so long ago that I started this game I'm gonna run out of money I'm gonna run out of money making paperclips I have a lot of unsold inventory oh this has got it get better okay Auto Clippers this is really gonna help alright finally at least now I'm oughta Kagome I will come back to this little later maybe I'll lower the price to sell them but maybe I'll just lower the price of 10 cents I could do that right now right and it's it's it's fine oh I could buy another Auto Clippers okay let's lower to five cents alright let's let it run let's let it go okay alright let's check Twitter paper clip train how we doing here alright look there's a whole bunch already look at this this is exciting alright paper clip train here we go now back to the coding train I did something exciting this morning which is that I recorded look I'm so giant I am a monster on the internet next to some diagrams let me zoom this out a little bit some new videos will be appearing on the internet that were recorded and not live streamed and this is your clue to what they could be about with a special guest appearance by somebody who drew these diagrams so just little little foreshadowing there those will come out next week in the next week or two nine new results okay this is good all right let's check on our paper bliss oh wait I I'm not even looking at the chat and just looking at Mike let's see here I can get some more Auto Clippers for sure really gonna get I need to do some marketing definitely need to do some marketing okay alright so what's gonna happen today on the coding train I'm going to try to actually accomplish something um the things that I would like to do are number one look at some nice particle system things that people made number two I would like to do some more of my objectoriented programming in JavaScript thing video stuff for my intro to learn to program series that needs to get updated with some es6 syntax and then also I am going to make the computer it's over here talk to me so I want to ii've started this series about chat BOTS I'm looking at very simple pattern matching retrieval based chat BOTS I look at something called rive script and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to induce some variation of that number guessing game but instead of typing in my responses and reading my responses as text I'm going to speak iris I'm gonna speak my words and listen to the response from the computer so we're gonna kind like custom build our own you know insert name of commercial product that talks to you at home device here like to make our own and then eventually I would like to investigate making some projects that run on these insert name of commercial device that you can buy and put in your home here I guess I have to name them at some point I'm always worried if I say something like Alexa then all these things in this room will start to beep at me but there is nothing in this room but me and some other stuff but maybe I just triggered your Alexa at home okay viral is gonna go get some snacks it's a good idea I would take your time because I'm really I this paperclip thing I have so many emails I could've been either I need to reply to instead just in case you're wondering I won't i won't i won't look at my eye I got what I want to show you the paperclip thing that I've been working on since last night there has to be an end right there's got to be a reason why I'm doing this there has to be a goal to get to eventually right Frank Frank are you out there you listening somebody get Frank Luntz on the phone Frank tell me what do I do I just I can't that's East I need to work that I really this will I really this okay so here we are let's buy some we're out of Clippers are we are we close no we're nowhere near we have a we have a lot where we need to make some more paper clips let's get these Auto Clippers going up and let's let's raise the price since we're kind of selling them faster than we can make them we need a little more money maybe we'll come back a little while and get get some some marketing going okay no let's get rid of this let's get rid of this is it 330 yet you still have time to guess you still have time to guess I haven't seen there hasn't been a single paper the latest is Jorge who guessed 23,000 250 this will be interesting so distance by integer values so that's the winner will be the closest number you can go above you can go below it doesn't matter the if I take your guess the absolute value of your guess the final number here and that number is the lowest you will with the coding train tshirt and if there's a tie I will send why not right there's ten people who all tie I don't know I'll send ten that's what's gonna happen all right so let's see what's happening now let's so speaking of hashtags with the word training in hit last week I did a what did I do last week I did a coding challenge making a particle system and there have been some really nice examples of particle systems that have been posted to Twitter with the hashtag particle train here's one by Alberto nice I like how these particles are coming from the outside and coming into the center there's like meditative breathing thing going on here I love that this is a really nice one right so this looks very similar to my example but there's some nice variations here number one is there's these there's particles that are colored black and particles that are come from white with some sort of transparency against a gray background it looks like and then there's these little extra yellow popping ones that maybe pop out with more speed and respond to gravity looks like falling down which gives it a really nice quality great work to siren on twitter here's one huh this looks quite a bit like little bursts of fire that's nice I love this oh look at this a drain so if I click here let's see if this runs goes to it which while this is loading I should just check on the paper clips right right it's always okay if something's loading let's check on the paper clips by some water Clippers what do we think lower the price a little bit lower the price a little bit okay okay back back here we can see nice used to the particle system with an actual train and I can move the trains moving ooh and I think I can press on here back here I can change to some stars some rainbows and back to some stars and there we go we don't need paper clips stars and rainbows and smoke from a train made in javascript in the browser this is all we need okay thank you for it so I'm gonna keep scrolling down we've got some nice raining effect whoo this sort of like cool vortex crazy thing this one is on open processing with some sound interaction that's lovely this is some weird something for some hamsters oh this is that same I think this is a nice one looks like that makes a nice circular like Fang there's so many this is so exciting and wonderful to see I hope I'm not missing anybody's butt so I encourage you to check out Parker crane hashtag on Twitter and submit your own you can also find user submissions and community versions of some of the coding challenges if you go to the rainbow code repository and I go down to coding challenges maybe challenges all the way to the bottom oh I mean the wrong on the wrong URL coding challenges all the way towards the bottom I'm looking for a simple particle system and here we can see some here's a link to the particle train hash tag and some wonderful demos by users let's click through these real quick I'm just gonna click on the demos demo demo demo demo demo Oh apparently one of them is playing some sound this one's responding to the sound the music's not actually synced right now pause on get new colors start song again cool here's one called embers ah looks kind of like embers coming out of fire that's really nice here is one called DV k qpe a pen buys oh here look at these nice little bubbles so one of the things I need to investigate today you see a little flickering going on here is deleting particles so that's something I'm definitely gonna investigate today chimney I guess these are the default names if you don't name but I'm like really I'm what is the meaning of MBG mzq there's a queue there's got to be a deeper meaning there does it have something to do with with paper clips possess something to do with paper clips let's check let's check oh how am i doing I have why I need some more wire I need some more wire okay I bought some more wire about a lot of wire how am i doing that's a month's old inventory I think I can lower the price here I need more Auto Clippers okay we'll come back will come back will come back okay where was I where is it okay back back to nice chimney here oh look at this move your mouse on either side of the screen so we can see some smoke from chimney one our smoke from chimney I love that I love the interaction to be able to sort of trigger different chimneys and oh this is the one that is with that sound responsive so as I speak the particles go and if I put on some music oh right I love sound responsive talking me particles out of my sound and then here we go particles towards center from Dave briquette II this looks like maybe the particles are kind of orbiting and circling around the center with a nice rainbow pattern and coming in maybe there's some gravitational attraction there that is cool great work I could have sworn there I saw the name Alka on this list Oh embers was Alka I must be um so this one was Alka what did I say yesterday I said like loyal viewer but I think I've maybe misspoke it's a royal view or something like that great work with the embers I wonder if there's something going on with my computer where things are running a little bit snow okay excellent work everybody uh this computer went to sleep this one which is really forking one might say I'm gonna get Frank Lance on the phone yet I need like an emergency phone where I could just like I need to know the secrets behind the paper clips and the hypno drones and the swarms and the youngbae and all of the things please tell me the secrets do you hear that dinging okay uh yeah so Alka says there's tons of fancy filters going on there it runs beautifully smooth on my machine alright I successfully did just about nothing for the law at least the good stuff it's almost 20 to 30 minutes here so those of you who are slow to enter to join to abort to to to board to board the coding train now you're all here so maybe we're gonna do some actual coding now I like to use this Adam text editor which I will now open these are some of the examples from last week I'm going to open oh I forgot it oh I turn one of these days I will install I term and and and look at the wonder that is I term and do a video about it mmm okay I'll do that right after I do Chrome extension so right before right before I'll do I turn before Chrome extension Chrome extensions are coming this an ester though because they're on my list for the course that I'm teaching right now so all right so what wherever I want to go now I want to go to the desktop and maybe under opie and I want to run a little web server so I can take a look at whatever it is that I'm doing what's what's probably the last one the particles was the coding challenge I'd probably opt to it's kind of where I left off let's see is there an error here oh it's mouse dragged right okay excellent all right so this is perfect this is where I left off so what I want to look at it's a couple things here Simon also loyal royal viewer Simon helped me with a todo list which now I don't have in front of my eyes anymore ah and actually I was looking at let's look at this together so to places where I want to look one is let's see which is this playlist one is foundations of programming in JavaScript and the other one is I want to look at the sorry I want to look at the processing intro tutorials here and because these are a good reference for me the objects and arrays please don't start playing videos here okay by the way has anybody noticed that these days if you're watching one of my videos sometimes I appear in an ad before in my videos it's a strange experiment that we're trying here in that one of the things that I'm helping to promote is a new undergraduate program that's starting next fall it's called interactive media arts it's in New York City this is the website ITP NYU edu slash ima there's gonna be an open house I think maybe even like this coming weekend oh that's right the dates are on this website if you're interested you're planning to schools University College and you're thinking about doing something in I guess what is this called again Interactive Media Arts this might be the place for you so sometimes you might see a little ad for me talking about the interactive media arts on my videos before my videos I was there my in this picture this is where I am in this picture oh no I'm gone but I was in that picture okay so so this is fine this is this is fine nothing here that I need more on objects yes so these two yeah so Simon's list is really quite good it's pretty comprehensive here because it's noticing it's the same as what I have but if I think about where I left off was here add adding and removing objects ah what sec oh but that's from a year ago so this hmm I I have an idea what I'm gonna do now is so in my in my new one that I made which was 7.3 which was arrays of objects I actually did the adding so what I want to do is I'm going to do a removing and removing objects I'm gonna do the clicking on objects in the same video because when you click on it I'll remove it maybe that'll work and in Simon's big so helpful Scott my full list here so if I'm following that list what I'm on next is more on deleting elements from arrays yeah let's do the deleting interesting let's do the clicking let's do the clicking then I'll do the deleting for the clicking I don't know I'm gonna do something expanding on this video I will improvise okay so let's go back to the browser I guess I'll leave that stuff open here we are this is the one where let me just adjust this a little bit o P too and actually what I'm gonna do is oh there goes the camera don't be alarmed this is just the point on the coding train where I know that a half an hour has passed I better get started doing some coding and it's where I'm going to just I'm going to now also I want to reveal and finders what I want to do is there a thing for that show and finder and then I want to make one called op3 and I want to look at that code and I want open that up here op3 there we go okay so I am now ready I think for the next video that I want to do let me minimize this and I think we're good so what's going on here so one of the things that I do it's very confusing if you happen to decide you want to tune watch what it's live streams why I'm not really sure you would want to do that but people seem to a number of people if I could look it up now I have a lot of different playlists and a lot of different threads of different topics I know I have this kind of like machine learning playlist that's kind of on hold for the moment that I did a little video to explain why mostly what I try to do is I try to make content related to the courses that I'm teaching here at New York University so right now the two courses that I'm teaching are one is an introduction to programming course where people have never programmed before so I'm and I previously made a whole playlist for that course but I use a lot of old older es5 syntax I'm redoing some of these videos with es6 classes so that's that's what I'm about to start with so I'm kind of jumping into the middle of making a tutorial for a playlist you're watching along because hey you might learn something or maybe you might give me some feedback or you just have this on in the background while you're making paper clips just go make the paper clips paper oh we can check on them soon I think it's been long enough since I look that I can look right kind of look maybe maybe okay so that's what I'm doing the other topic the thread that I'm on is for my class called here at HP it's called programming from A to Z but in on YouTube I'm calling it programming with text because the programming from A to Z makes it sound like it's a beginner course and it's not at all and so the topic that I'm kind of working on right now is chatbots and so I'm gonna do stuff with speech to text and text to speech in the browser so that you could create a conversational interface so those are my two goals for today it's 330 if if all goes well I'll be here till 530 if all doesn't go well I will be gone sooner are here lingers yeah but that's kind of my plan so let me take a minute before I go into the first tutorial to take a look at the chat I'm gonna look at the slack chat and the YouTube chat to the extent that I can am I missing something important that I forget something that I usually do is there I do you have any questions you want to ask before I get started let me know oh wait I should say that the time for guessing has ended I should have probably let's go to paperclip train 13 minutes ago and can we guess twice yeah that's a good question well I don't know what to do about that Cubs ten says to notice me how is my day random number reading I did forget oh ok so there's a bunch of things being asked right now I don't know if you guys are just talking about eclipses in the chat or if if that's actually a question but on my list I would love to get to this at some point is to look at how to make up library for processing in eclipse and actually how to work with processing the Java based platform in Eclipse because it opens up a lot of doors for those of you who enjoy that platform that programming environment and want to contribute to it how is my day oh my day was great because oops this is now blank but because this extra video coding challenge thing is coming soon and it was cool it was awesome I'm really excited about it but it wasn't so great because I really did not sleep and very tired and I this is like a holly want some of the busiest time of the year also because I am getting ready for processing day so one thing I should mention is this is next Saturday October 21st at the MIT Media Lab tickets are still on sale for this that just so you know that so probably look at Wonka there's pictures oh look there's a picture of me and some other wonderful people Te'o and Choi who has been organizing this event called processing day there is a community clouds project that I've been working on to make name tags I'm gonna do a coding challenge live at processing day so if you're in the Boston area and are interested in coming please do this is the first time that we're having kind of an official processing community event here some of the other wonderful speakers who will be there as well well look there's like a schedule at 220 this is what this is me at 220 oh boy I'm getting nervous now anyway uh okay answering questions austin asks did we get the nametags sort oh there's a new Adam ID I do not know about this else do we get the nametags sorted out that's in in progress there's a nice me I am so me built a really nice system to generate SVG's and hopefully that's gonna be enough to do the printing is it like scratch day well I didn't attend scratch day so I couldn't say for sure but certainly scratch day is a impetus and in inspiration for us doing an event like this there's also in our do we know day which is I would say like a similar event and scratch is a wonderful project I'll use it I've used it a lot for with kids and stuff like that so you can work with processing by eclipse yeah processing and I should processing is a if I if I run it here and I think I need to download the newer version this is a selfcontained application that you can run on Windows Mac or Linux you can write code in here whoops you can write code in here it look if you've seen my recent videos where I'm mostly using p5.js the there's a lot that's similar in terms of the naming but this is actually Java syntax so the syntax the language that this is built on top of his Java so this environment is meant to kind of ease you into programming and make creative sketching coding design stuff I do a lot of coding challenges in processing I don't use it as much as I would like to just because it's so convenient to be able to put the p5.js stuff in the browser to share and get contributions but I aspire to go back to my processing roots and use it more in videos but since this is built on top of Java if you want to contribute to the development of the IDE itself or to the library itself behind all of the functions that are part of the code you might write or add a contribution like a library or a tool or a mode there are modes like for example I could switch this to Opie 5 jazz mode I always forget this is there did I do a video on that because I meant to or Python mode there's different modes and things so I would encourage you to take a look at that if you're interested okay so I think that was my that was my that was my answering some questions and making sure I didn't miss anything somebody said I should read some random numbers but I'll come back to that later okay let's check on the paper flips I need some I need some paper clip music it needs to be very relaxing I'm looking for something I don't have anything if I play this like these like Mozart tracks that I downloaded from Audio hero which is a service that has royaltyfree music that you can that you can get you can sign up for and pay for but once I put them on one of my videos it was immediately I got a copyright violation notice alright can you guys hear the chairs and furniture going by in the hallway right now I've got a thousand paper clips I have funds are in serious trouble my unsold inventory I've got a pretty decent amount of wire whoo boy I just bought a lot of wire I didn't mean to do that all right let's let's lower the price a little bit and that's good and let's let this go all right I'm not doing very well the paperclips don't makes it excellent point and the chat it's not your paper clips it's our paper clips I still haven't come up with a I think what I'm gonna have to do just for fairness is if you make more than one guess I'm gonna take your first one or I'll take your I think your last one I'll seem like you change your mind I'll take your last one up until the 330 p.m. cutoff 34 minutes it okay good to keep me in check let's do some coding if anybody really wants to help me out I could just really use like a whole new sound board with like a little button for like beginning to code and some music for reading random numbers and some waiting musics and debugging music some other like weird sound effects Emily's going to hear as if they exist but they don't I like this one though let's do some code my hand is cut off kid okay what workshop that let's come over here and erase some whiteboard my physical therapist says that erasing a whiteboard it's actually a really good thing for me to do so requires need to use my tricep muscles which are still very very weak apply pressure to the wall and let me see if these the corners is that a corner no the corner is more like here that's fine the corner is like here how's the glare how's everything alright so here we go hello this is a good question there's a good question in the chat loesel macho's asks can you experience li explain why you can't use the random function outside of set up in the p5.js web editor well first of all this is not this is not editor specific if I say let Val equal random 100 like this seems like I should be able to do this right right why not let me go and refresh and I've got an error and look at this did you just try to use five Jazz's random function if so you may want to move it into your sketches setup function for more details see frequently asked questions why can't I assign so first of all you can take a look at this error message click on it and take a look but I'll I will I will I will explain to you what's going on here this is a sort of a strange thing so when a page loads you can start executing JavaScript immediately this just javascript file is loading as its reference in the HTML page but you cannot guarantee that there is an event that happens it's often called like onload maybe are ready and that event is an event that occurs when everything associated with the page loaded all the JavaScript files the style SCSS file all the elements on the page everything is loaded and one of those things that has to load is the p5.js library and the setup function p5.js is the place where you can which guarantees that everything is loaded loaded so far so while I could do something like let Val equals math dot random times 100 which would essentially be the equivalent and I could say Val and I've got that random number this is totally fine because that's coming from native JavaScript that's just the math library is just available for you instantly it's part of the browser itself essentially whereas the p5.js library isn't available unless it's finished loading and it's not finished loading until setup and random as part of that so it doesn't know what it is unless you're in setup alright hopefully that answer that question and now let us begin I'm gonna move this bug out of the way this is going to be something like objects and mouse interaction or clicking on objects something like that it's back for another video about objects and classes and stuff using javascript and p5 GS so one of the things that I get asked all the time I think you know I'm wider around the street people with like hey you there if I made a bunch of bubble objects in a canvas in the browser you imagine if this actually happened to be on the street and I want to like interact with them with the mouse individually like how would I know if the mouse is hovering over one versus the other how would I deal with that well it's just a little bit of an aside first before so this is what I want to implement in this video how can you as how can you have the user interact with individual objects how do I set the code to make that happen how's this work so here's the thing what eventually if you're watching all of these videos in the order that they are there's going to be a time in the future I recording these videos in the past but for you it will be the future where I will add things below the canvas like there'll be a button here or like a box with text in it and the canvas is actually one of those things too while on this page is a canvas I could put other things on this page everything on a web webpage can register events it can register this event of like a click on that's not really an event or I mouse over right I and and there's all sorts of fancy ways in JavaScript and in p5.js to handle all these different types of events to know how users are interacting with things but this thing here this thing here is one thing the canvas the only thing that p5 just knows is if you're clicking on the canvas or not and actually to be honest if you click off the canvas it's gonna make one kind of like it is mined off the canvas that might wander on which it just saw happen because I'm using this global mousepressed event I have an event it's just press the mouse anywhere but what if I want to have an event that's like only when I click on this circle so because these aren't separate the circles are my own invention they're pixels that I've drawn in their space it's up to me as the programmer the the person who designed this sketch to figure out how to handle that and so that's what I'm gonna do in this video so let me think about what would make sense I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna rewrite this sketch a little bit I'm gonna get rid of this mouse press function I mean I'm gonna come back to it but in in setup I'm going to say like let X equal random with let y equal random height let R equal random 10 comma 50 and then I'm going to say I'm gonna just make this new bubble I'm gonna take this exact code from the bottom you're over there never know where to look one of these days I'll figure it out take this exact code from the bottom and I'm gonna make a new bubble alright so actually let's do this first let's just pretend we only have one let's go let's peel away from the array for a second and let's simplify our lives and let's I'm just going to make a single bubble object and that's gonna be it and forget about this array just for a little bit and so I'll come back to the array eventually now notice that this I'm not changing this bubble class at all it's still the same thing what I wear is it ah but I do need to say that individual bubble move bubble dots show so you might let so what I want to do is I want to have something to happen when I click on that bubble so your first instinct might be AHA well there's this mousepressed function that I can write out here oh ah look at this I wrote this nice mouse press function right out here yeah so why not why not there's this bubble class that I've been learning all about right I just do I know let's just do this console.log clicked on bubble right won't that work that'll work oh I'm so excited this is gonna work nothing's happening nothing's happening so I've sent you in the completely wrong direction although the instinct is kind of right yeah this is like a function that's just out in the wild it's global so it's for any mousepressed this is a function that's inside of the bubble so it's fine but here's the thing this this function mousepressed is a special function that p5 recognizes just like set up a draw or special functions of p5 recognizes p5 is not going to go inside of these new classes that you write and somehow recognize that you could have a mouse press function know where the object is figure out its this is not part of its capability wouldn't I don't even know how it could even be capable of that but there isn't any reason why I couldn't write a function and you know it's a little bit problematic for me to call it mousepressed so maybe I'm just gonna call it like let's just call it like clicked for right now there's no reason why I couldn't inside of the mouse pressed function say hey whatever the user clicks the mouse I know that globally why don't I just call another function inside any of my objects that need to handle that click so I'm gonna say bubble clicked so now look at this it's gonna work let's get a bigger one it's gonna work okay I'm gonna click on it okay look I clicked on the bubble look at me do it again oh well the three times I'm gonna take out over here now six times seven times eight so here's the thing remember this is a global mousepressed so I can call my function on this bubble object but it's just gonna do this every single time it's up to me to write some code to figure out wherever wherever I click the mouse I know where the bubble is and I know how big it is I know it's X and it's why it's our I know it's this dot X is this that Y is this not our what I need to figure out now I'm thinking about the paper clips don't think about the paper clips somebody will watch this video and no idea what you're talking about because they're not watching the live stream don't talk about the paper clips back mystery mystery the mystery of the paper clips this dot note if you know the X the Y and the R we can write some code so I could say something like hmm if okay well how do you so here's here's here's a little bit of a moment here let's say what I one of the things I need to figure out and I've probably done this in other videos but this seems like a nice time to to talk it through is if I have a circle how do I know if a point is inside the circle or is outside the circle because what I'm trying to do is figure out is the mouse that's the mouse arrow did it did it click inside or outside or inside the circle I could ask the same question for a square I couldn't ask that question for a triangle I could ask that question for some arbitrary strangely shaped polygon and all of these are going to get progressively more complex the square in the circle are pretty rectangle and a circle are pretty easy to do this is much harder but all of this is possible the point is I need to write some code to figure that out that code needs to go here did wherever that mouse is is it actually related to where this dot X that's not why did this not our R so how do I do that so one of the nice things that on P 5 and both processing if you were using that instead have is a function called dist which stands for distance and I can give that function two points arbitrarily x1 y1 x2 y2 so if I make one of those point to the center of the circle maybe I'll call that CX CY and then the other point over here for example is the mouse where the mouse clicked we'll call that MX my I could pass these values into that distance function and get the length of this line call that D something that I happen to know from my code oops wrong button is R the radius of the circle now I'm actually using it as the radius I am because remember the ellipse function itself wants the diameter so R really means the radius which is half of the diameter what do I mean by that so I happen to know this dot R is this distance or another way of looking at it it's this distance right here so guess what this is probably popping into your head just to count now if the distance between the center and the mouse is greater than the radius then that point is outside the circle if it's less than the radius then that point is inside the circle okay so now we could come over here and I could start to add that code I can say let me find the distance between Mouse X Mouse Y and this X and this dot Y and I can now say if D now this is not this dot D because this is a local variable that I'm using just to calculate for at this moment the distance is less than this dot R then console.log clicked on bubble now we're really getting somewhere whoa what just happened did I am I playing something sorry okay do this again now we're really getting somewhere okay so this is a moment of success and that was really loud that's gonna ruin this video so what I've now successfully done is I'm able to determine and only print out this statement so what's the full story here this is where I know that the mouse has been pressed anywhere so it's up to me to now to say like well if the mouse is pressed anywhere let's check if the mouse is pressed for this bubble and guess what let's go back to the array now let's put this array back let's make this a single bubble let's put that into the array and now this loop here just like in draw when I want to move and show everything there's no reason why I couldn't when I click the mouse use that same exact loop and just call clicked on all the bubbles that are in that array so let's see if this works whoops okay I have some air bubble is not too fine a draw so I forgot that I still have this old individual bubble that I don't need anymore so I can click on it it worked I can click outside I don't see anything let's let's actually add now let's do this five times in setup so I'm gonna add five bubbles and now in theory it's we're getting that message if I click on any of them but here's the thing I really want something to happen so I could change its color let's let's actually here's the thing what if I what if I were to just hover over these bubbles and I wanted to change their color if I were to hover over the bubbles and then have something on it so actually you know what there's another important point that I want to make I don't there's something about this function that I don't really like and yes I'm gonna do this from time to time and you will too and it's okay but right there I don't love the fact that I'm using mouse X and mouse Y those are global variables in theory I want my bubble class to only know about itself it doesn't really need to know about the outside world is it to know what's on a canvas that there's a mouse and in theory what I want to be able to do is right of generic bubble class that I could say hey is the mouth cooking on you or is this other sensor overtop of this other object at the same location as you or you know I switch it to using like a Kinect to track my hand is my hand location near this bubble so really what would make more sense is for me to actually put arguments into the clicked function and again I'm doing this sort of awful thing where I'm giving them the same name as arguments in SSR as properties of the class itself I'm giving these parameters X and y the same name is this dot X this that Y but javascript is very good at distinguishing because these this x and y are the ones that are coming in through the parameters and these here are the properties this dot of the object itself but maybe if I want it to be like a little less confusing about I might say like px py for like pixel X or pixel Y or something like that and so now what makes more sense is what I really want to do is pass in Mouse X Mouse Y because what I want to do when the mouse is pressed is ask does this point and really I might do something like contains or inside or it includes likes I could name that function in some other way because really what I'm asking is is that is that is that point inside that object so interestingly enough what I could do is let's let's give the bubbles a color I'm gonna give it like a brightness and make it zero and I'm going to say fill this dot brightness and I'll give it some alpha and then what I'm gonna do is when I've clicked on them I am going to say this dot brightness equals 255 so the idea here is that now bubbles each have a new property a color it starts at zero and any time I click on one of them I turn that one a different color so what's really nice about this is I have one function one function that's part of the class and I could use that function in any way that I want though it just all that function does is test if any generic point is inside a given object and if it is if it is inside that if it sorry inside and I'm inside that shape the geometry of that object if it is I change its color and the way I happen to be using it is by saying hey whenever the user clicks the mouse anywhere let's go check all the objects in our array and see if the mouse is inside them so all right I think this ends this particular video I need to do something where I one thing I would really actually like to do what you should usually do an exercise here so if you're watching this I'm trying to make it head do something different if you hover over the the bubble change the bubble to a rectangle see if you can make the same thing work with a rectangle allow yourself to click on it twice turn it on and off that's something you could try and have a different behavior for when you click on it versus when you just mouse over at those types of things but what I want to do something I want to do and may be able to in the next video is when I click on each one of these I remove them from from the world so I can i can add bubbles and delete them somehow so we have to look at how to delete things from an array okay see you in the next video perhaps okay bye all right people still actually watching this I have 5 new notifications whoa whoa alcázar doing some kind of like magic and the chat there about getting objects to like use mouse press that place outside the scope of my video here where did I do with my uh here's my mug that I put over there oh boy I better check on the paper clips huh these guesses are too late by the way the guest has had to be timestamped where do I see the timestamp if I go here right 1220 oh wait so is this oh oh the timestamps on Twitter maybe I'm seeing them at Pacific time okay so let's check on our paper clips boy them to be terribly definitely more auto clippers I'll just get as many as I can all right now I need to lower that price that should be better camera went off all right so I did Simon your perfect timing placing that list in again so deleting elements is definitely something that I want to do interacting with objects is done objects is talking to other objects clicking on objects in deleting them okay and to out more okay so let's see the paper good things gonna speed up right you know I just got to get to a hundred dollars let this go to a hundred dollars I think I've got plenty of wire well look at this oh boy oh I've got computational resources now I've got conversation okay you guys mind if we just take a couple minutes here so this needs to get to a thousand or 750 and I can improve the auto cliff burrs I can't quite I have two extra let's oh no no I only have to trust so I need to get three thousand clips and I'll get an extra trust which you can give more memory or more processor I don't know which one so what should I do next I think probably Oh paper clips isn't running when I'm in another tap did anybody know that when making their guests let's check this okay oh boy I wonder if I take it out and what if I do this now it's running but I can't have this in the background of my video tutorials oh but let's see what if I put it behind there okay so here I am I'm like dude do I'm making a video tutorial about coding this is me making video to talk about Kony I already forgot and now I'm gonna check the paper clips twentyseven twentyseven hundred so if I go away again to this other one and it's like if I wait a little bit whoa this one laptop it should be above 3000 now right let's see oh oh yeah well I got 3000 I ran out I need wire do I have money for wire thank God I have money for a wire I can improve my Auto Clippers oh I definitely want to definitely need this revenue tracker that's gonna be really helpful let's raise the price a little bit let's buy some more wire I really don't want to run out of wire let's buy some more Auto Clippers raise the price again and am I at 500 yet okay I need to get this revenue track go to the next video I swear let's get to this revenue tracker of case 69 cents per second let's see him let's move that up to $1.00 per second okay that's good and this should be good this should work for a little while a dollar 36 per second okay I'm gonna let this go I think I'm in pretty good shape oh I've got more we need some more memory so let's go okay so the next thing I want to do is a video I'm gonna do one more of these object tutorials and by the way added to that list I should do something about getters and setters because I do think that's a it's kind of beyond the scope of what I'm doing in my video tutorials but it's a useful feature of es6 classes that's something I'm not completely used to because it's a little bit different than how it works in like Java or C++ but I should do that alright yes check I'd know making a paperclip game coding challenges like the worst idea for me ever I will never leave this room I already have a problem I already have enough of a problem Frank why what have you done this to me why please just tell me is there an end let me let me just check I'm gonna check my actual oh this is not going because self cricket oh I can get the selfcorrecting supply chain you guys can't see this but let me just okay alright I don't know what's going on here I'll come back to that later back to the selection the whistle is mountainy all right so if you're joining late I'm so sorry if you've been here old time I'm also very sorry so now what I want to do is let's do the clicking so first of all these these bubbles are really making me crazy the bubbles are so nervously bouncing around let me let me just adjust the class a little bit to just be a little less frenetic okay so I think what I'm gonna do ah and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna quickly take this op4 and what I'm gonna do is what I'm going to do is I'm gonna call this point I'm gonna call this point over or maybe mouse over I don't know call that mouse over it's probably terrible name no no what should I call this does a generic just call it contains maybe that'll work and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take this and just move it to draw I don't need to move it to draw just gonna say bubbles index I'd contains Mouse X Mouse why I know what to call it roll over that's what I want roll over and I'm just change this to rollover and I'm gonna say otherwise this dot brightness equals zero so what I want to start with let's see if this works OOP something the wrong one for uh oh I edited the wrong code didn't I that's fine at least I saved it back up yeah okay hold on let me rename these so this one this one is actually four and this one is now three and yeah okay so this is what I want I want them to be generally bigger too because it's a little easier to and I can take this out this extra code and I am going to just have them be generally a little bit bigger in size whoops this I don't need okay so I just quickly changed this to be have a rollover and let me also make ten of them just to have more whoa hold on did I hit safe oh I mean three still ah crud I'm gonna have to pick have to fix this later I saved over what I was doing oh just bear with me everybody this will get fixed eventually okay make twenty to sixty and make ten of them yeah if by the way a little note to self e'er if you mess with the file system outside of Adam but leave everything open and Adam your move files around you save them it's gonna save it back to where it was originally so doesn't know about you moving the file system okay so what I want to add to this is click to delete click er I should really name things better yes I definitely should when is the paper clips reveal it will be whenever I am done with the whenever I am done with the live stream and I will review wait a second oh no it's still it's a different I was so worried I closed it by accident oh no hold on I've run out of stuff okay any more wire we just buy some more wire here let me improve the wire extrusion buy some more wire dollar okay we really can't have I I need more memory I should really add more processors and I should get some more Clippers cuz I'm running out of there we go so I want this to stabilize a certain amount of money / yeah I want this just maybe I should some more let's make some more Clippers we want this to stabilize let's lower the price a little bit yeah that's good that's what I wanted to see I'm running out of I'm not clipping them fast enough I'm selling them faster than I can clip them let's go back to five cents I want this to settle at least $1.00 per second right now okay before I go back to the codec okay that's pretty good all right what am i no no no over here for ten we've got lots of time at 430 no no this is not my game I did not make this game Frank Frank made this game Oh Frank the tain whistle anyway all right so hello it's me back again with some these bubbles again Oh a the bubbles someday I'll think of something besides bubbles but the bubbles kind of works so I the last video I kind of looked at how I could click on the bubbles and change their color and now I just adjusted the code a little bit so I could mouse over the bubbles and you know I could show you what I did I did this inbetween where I now I'm using this function called rollover I rename the click function to rollover I gave it these arguments and in doing the same sort of thing if the distance is if it's inside the circle I turn it white if it's not I turn it black so what I want to do now is I want to click on the bubble and have it pop I wanted to disappear how do I do that well good news everybody I kind of did I didn't all of that in the last video except for the whole what did I forget to do oh the deleting from an array so let's let's think about that so okay how do i how do I remove something I mean one one way I could remove something is just stop drawing it or move it way off screen and there was it there were in the old days without the code with like 6 feet of snow next to me sometimes you had to do that because it'd this fixed array you couldn't take things out you couldn't add things to it so you would kind of like reuse elements and move them off screen but here in the land of JavaScript there's a really nice thing you could do it I'm gonna come over here to this camera that's not on and I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna erase this distance thing and at some point there's gonna be a jump cut to where I have erased it and now what do I want to talk about so I have this a ring one of the things that I showed in a previous video okay so let's say this array is called bubbles because that's what it's called the whole array when apart the whole array I'm saying the word bubbles when I am referencing a specific element of the array I reference it by its index often within square brackets and the index numbers are 0 1 2 3 4 5 so this is bubbles in deck now one of the things I showed in the previous video is that there is a function called push that function allows me to add something to the end of the array in fact there is also a function called pop and that function allows what it does is it will take something off the end of the array and pop it off so if what I wanted to do is always delete the last element of the array I could use the pop function now there are lots of other functions there's like shift I think there's even like an unshifted be crazy could just be making that up shift manager snow but here's I think where do these functions come from so there's this question that comes up over and over again in these videos and you're probably sitting there asking it to yourself wait a sec my learning JavaScript I know I sort of made me learning to code but I have my learning JavaScript my Lenape 5 is the same thing is it different well this is a complicated question and I would like in theory in my mind's eye I would like to say that these videos are just about learning to code and think about code and think computationally I happen to be using the programming language JavaScript I'm using this library p5.js to make the drawing stuff easier and it all kind of mixes together so that was kind of larger question aside this stuff that has to do with an array is not coming from p5 GS if I say ellipse this is a special function that's in p5.js what it does is it call some other functions that are just part of JavaScript without p5 GS but it's I can only say ellipse because I'm using a p5.js library these functions don't come from p5 yes they come they're just part of the JavaScript language so how do I find out a list of these and how I can use them come back over here with me alright so the place that I like to use is the Mozilla Foundation Docs I'm just saying Mozilla Foundation array JavaScript that's going to be my Google search and I'm gonna go here so this is here's the thing one of the reasons why I like using p5 Jessen tutorials is look here's the reference here's all the stuff it's kind of like one page if I'm actually stuff but it's kind of selfcontained and it's it has a smaller world view so to speak it's like it's a walled garden so to speak this is like the JavaScript documentation there is so much here you couldn't possibly mean you could but it would be it would take you a long time to read through everything but here I am at least on a page that's giving me some information about arrays and you can see look Obeid there's this what is that oh my god okay it's a for each loop someday I'll have to come back and look at that and what does that do and why would you use it oh my god oh my goodness okay but you can see here look pop oh I'm not I'm not crazy shift on shift you can see what these functions do where are you you're over there and look there's a whole list of them so let's look through them maybe we can find one that removes something from an array pink at copy within entries every filter fine I got it go for each okay well looking for own so here's the thing us place I happen to know wouldn't it be nice to just be one that's called like delete or remove but the one that I'm looking for is this place and this method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and or adding elements it can do a lot of different things I want to use it for the deletion so if I come back over here I want to use this slice function so can I ran up here and you can see it yes slice slice takes two arguments and there may be other ways to use slice but for the purpose of this video tutorial the two arguments are what matters the first one is an index and the second one and I'm kind of moving sorry doing that thing where I'm drawing off the whiteboard gasps okay go to town here that's a little bit better the first one is it index the second one I'll just call how many so if I say slice index how many comma 1 what it does is it just takes this element and slices it out removes it from the array let me show you what I need so one of the things that I could do to sort of investigate this is I could just use the JavaScript console here in the browser that I'm using right now and I could say let's words equal you know rainbow and unicorn and kitten I was gonna try to think this thing else turtle paper clip paper plinth words dot push paper clip okay so now we can see I have this array with five things in it and if I were to say words dot splice index 3 comma 1 what should happen here 0 1 2 3 I should look at this whoops so one thing is interesting about slice is as it deletes it kind of like hands it back to you I'm not gonna use that in this video but it's kind of interest that it does that it's probably too much information here but if I look at the array words right now you'll notice turtle is gone it's just rainbow uniform kitten so the idea here is that even though I can do a lot with this slice function if I just want to delete one element from the array I could say hey this particular number index just that one and so that's what I want to do what I want to do is how could I then with this code example click on this and remove it actually delete it from the array well I know there's so much here you know what I should do here's the thing look at this function rollover hmm there's something kind of interesting about this function which is that I'm doing two things at once one thing is that I'm checking to see if the mouth if that point is inside that bubble and then I'm also changing its color and it probably makes more sense for me to have this function be much more generic for it just to like return true or false because I might want to reuse this ideas it was a point over that is a point over that object that circle other times so I'm gonna change this to return true whoops if if it's rolling over return true otherwise return false and then I'm gonna write a new function called change color and I'm going to say this dot brightness equals 255 so I wanted to remove the idea of the changing color from here because now I can say if write that function you might not have you you know I covered return what return means in my functions video tutorial but you know when do I ever need that well now I need it what I want to say but not remove I'm not removing it sorry a change color I'm that's what I'm gonna do eventually right I want to say and and maybe I shouldn't call it roll over anymore I should just say contains let's call it contains and i'ma change it to contains what I want to do right this function is going to return true or false and I know some of you are saying I could just return this this statement itself violates true or false so it's redundant to say if it's true return true if it's false return false I could just say return its value true or false I'll let you do that to simplify your own code as an exercise but now what I can do here this should be exactly the same program oh I have an error contains is not a function bubble index i contains mmm you know what is contain something oh boy am I not allowed to use the word contains what if I missed I think I might not be allowed to use the word contains I'm gonna sort it let's pause for a second here I keep closing this lecture includes as part of an array oh oh you're telling me the slice displays did I write slice okay record scratch sound do I have that hold on a second apparently I've done something horrible oh look at this this whole time maybe much good could do a magic thing where after I write slice he can fade it in this should say splice apologies this should say splice splice splice splice is the correct term I will leave that up there for a second and that's gonna have to get fixed I was saying slice that hump dub over my voice and then the function need to use is nice and after that to remove an element from the array please use splice no work right yes place is kind of a say can I do you slice but just say begin and end such as always the next one I really kept saying slice yeah maybe but we'll dub it that'll be good or I can just we could put a little like popup that says I should be saying splice their help how bad could it be thank you Matt huge fudge tree extra paper clips is something wrong with the paper clips now that I'm taking a break I can check them whoops oh shoot why is this contains not working oh I just didn't save it I can't look at the I can't look at the YouTube chat because I know they could be like messing with me but okay let's see let's let's just at least check wait oh there's here's the paper clips how's the paper clip string oh I ran out of inventory again I ran out of wire there's a thing that I can get for a Y first of all I definitely need these better Auto Clippers I'm gonna need a lot more wire well let me see if I get up to the marketing real quick if I could get up to the marketing before I go back well it's actually gonna be a pretty low number for those of you are guessing low although it might just sort of like explode at a certain point okay let me get the marketing so now I can raise the price why is mine no I want to know I okay I made a dollar 67 $3.00 per second am I making enough well let's really let's lower it but I need to make more Clippers and I've got more let me get some processors I can get the creativity now let me raise the price a little bit cuz I'm I really need the thing there's a thing that you can get which like auto buys wire whenever you run out which I'm definitely going to need because I'm oh because I'm just gonna I need to buy some more auto Clippers just to get this going faster that's a little bit better now because this you can see that I could get $3.00 per second if I could make I guess I could go to four cents more of these I should really stop this right I need to come back okay this is good this is good we're at four cents I'm gonna just buy some more wire it's gonna run on a wire really fast I'm not making enough money okay let me just quickly buy a little bit more wire before I go back no it's fine I can't focus on this let's go back all right so actually I don't know how to I'm back after some mishegoss there but contains is fine I've got worried like a my overriding some builtin name but and that a my oh my hold on a sec do you think let's is object dot prototype dot contains objects dot prototype dot contains is that a function in JavaScript at something can contains no it's has own property is if it could so I think that's okay so I'm gonna just skip over that discussion I'm gonna go back to okay so so I'm gonna change this to contains which I just did and that didn't work but now I'm back because I just didn't save the file and whoops oh yeah no I do want that page and so now we're back to exactly what I had before but the point of what I was doing was that now that I've separated out the logic of just checking if a point is in something I can now in mousepressed I'm going to just grab this exact code and I'm gonna add mouse press back in so in mousepressed I can check hey does the is the mouse in there now this is when the mouse is pressed check again and then what do I want to do bubbles dot splice I comma one look that's beautiful look at this thing a beauty here I'm able to reuse that idea by saying okay just during draw all the time check if the mouse is over it if the mouse is over it changes color I know I spelled splice wrong in mousepressed when the mouse has been clicked anywhere check to see if it's in there if if you click on a particular bubble and if so delete it from the array which should cause it to disappear from the page and there we go now I kind of alright it doesn't oh I lost my changeback how did I lose that oh look at that I forgot she look interestingly enough I had this feature that one it doesn't and so what I probably should do here is give this an argument so I had this feature where it weight it changes to white when it's over back to black when it's not so I should probably give this change color function and argument like bright parameter bright and pass that in I did that kind of quickly but that fixes that and then I should be able to just delete all of them okay that's basically it now I feel like there's so many things I wanted to do with this we tried to think for a second yeah oh I'm missing an important point oh oh boy that's not it I'm missing kind of an important point and I did cover this there's a particle system coding challenge which does this but I I think I should talk about it here which is something strange just happened which is that I was iterating over the array I was checking elements zero then I was checking element two one sorry then I'm checking element two and at that little bit when I checked element two if that's the one that I clicked on and I should really call these I'm gonna call these abcdefg I pretend the particles have a letter because these index values are gonna change in a weird sort of way let me explain this again I'm checking a don't delete it I'm checking B don't delete it I'm checking C delete it so what happens next when I delete C the array all of a sudden looks like this one but it's got one fewer element in it so we don't need to race with my fingers and it's got a B no c d e f g 0 1 2 3 4 5 what was the part with what was the bubble I last checked the last bubble I checked was 3 in index 2 so in my iterating I'm now going to was set it wrong what was the last bubble I checked the last bubble I checked was bubble C in index spot right here so if I is going up by 1 the next thing it should check is index 3 and but this is what the array looks like now so if I check index 3 now I'm gonna check and see should I delete e what happened I didn't bother to check D because as soon as I removed C D becomes 2 got moves to index pot 2 and my counter moves up so I could do something like if I could add like an eye so I could say like oh if I'm deleting something like set the index back to go check the next one there's a bunch of different ways around this probably if I use that for each loop maybe that would help me somehow but I actually in this case it doesn't matter because here's the thing it only would hopes over using that sound effect in this case it doesn't matter I you know if I look at this like there's nothing wrong nothing bad happens now you only would it only would be bad if it so happens that I tried to leak two of them at once and the other one that I delete happens to be the next one in the array so none of these are overlapping right now that's so let me try to leave both of these they both deleted but yeah I could get bad luck where the I'm hovering over both of these and so only this one gets to lead and then this one doesn't get checked so again I could decrement the index but another way I could do it is if I'm actually iterating through the array backwards it doesn't matter if I remove something and the array slides could chunks back over I'm still going towards the beginning I won't miss any so you'll see that in a lot of my code examples some people like to say I I prefer generally speaking if I'm deleting stuff from the array to start at the end which is bubbles dot length minus one then have my iterator go down and then where am I where do I end I go all the way down to the first element which is at index zero the last element is the length minus one like if they're five of them zero one two three what four or five of them zero one two three four so start it 51 four go all the way down to zero so let's just make sure that this works and it does still the same exact result I can delete I can hover over and delete all of them so there you go this is a a little video about clicking and removing things from the array there's some other things for things I could do I you know here's the thing the point of me telling about this going backwards thing is more to say that hey if you are manipulating an array while you're iterating over it you should probably be careful what if for example I were adding elements to the array want it and I could maybe never get to the end right so anyway so this is really something that you need to think about so let's see what should you do in this video I have an idea something you could try is have HAP make a sketch where you can make as many bubble objects as you want but delete them when they've left the window you could try that you can also do something action I'm gonna do something for you right now which is kind of an interesting effect there's a little bonus for the end of the video that I think you could probably make something with let me save this timeout we think here I'm gonna make a new version of the code really quickly even though I've already messed that up I'm gonna make this Opie 5 I'm gonna check the chat why is this computer go to sleep filter filter still has the same issue ok for 8 look at hold on come back I'll come back to that so let me just give me a second I don't know why I'm stuck on demonstrating this but I think this is kind of useful so hold on a sec I want to demonstrate something real quick am I in five now so four there's one more thing I want to demonstrate here because I think it leads it lends itself to an interesting exercise before I do that for each apparently has the same problem but there are other fancy ways to remove things from an array okay um maybe I don't need to say that on my own so I really wanted just finished let me do this extra thing and we can decide whether it include it or not before I finish I want to add one I'm just gonna redo this example a little bit just to demonstrate one thing I'm going to put it back to the version of it which sorry which had me where I added bubbles whenever I drag the mouse so I'm gonna say Mouse dragged and I'm going to just I'm gonna add bubbles at the mouse and something like just give them all the same size just for simplicity right now so what I what this should do is give me back to this I'm kind of drawing with these bubble objects the reason why I'm showing you this is this I think might allow you to plea bit more playful and how you think about removing for example one thing I could do is I could say just if bubbles dot length is greater than is it's greater than well ten bubbles dot splice zero comma one so I'm saying like hey only just only ever have ten elements in that array and there's maybe there's a bigger news shift there to like remove just the first one but and you can see this is gives me this kind of like snakelike thing but notice as I let go each one of these is still an individual object now I've lost the clicking on it thing but and I can come back so that I think there's some more possibilities there's almost like a little object that's like a little thing that's storing its history and the reason why I talk of this is I have another video this is a kind of a hard exercise but um something good think about what if this were its own object and you had a bunch of these on the screen so I have another video that about object storing their own path that all that I'll link to from this video and so hopefully now you've got some ideas about how to remove things from an array thanks for watching alright I think I was worth keeping this video I feel like that was like a really long tutorial but probably just because it's been so long since I looked at the paper clips I'm sure I've run out of wire totally run out of wire by some wire what can I get let's get some more trust look what I want is I really want the thing where I can automatically I'll do this you slogan Oh marketing effectiveness so this is all good now I can add another processor and some more memory could buy some more wire I can buy some more auto Clippers really can lower the price a little bit raise the price there we go this is good Oh where's the price again buy some more Auto Clippers now I'm just clicking on stuff with no oh I have more processor more memory I really just want the thing that I could buy the wire automatically then I can let this go I'm at like 17,000 I think my inventory is kind of stabilized that's good buy some more wire buy some more wire buy some more wire buy some more wire by supplier and then I'm gonna go back to the tutorial stuff all right a little bit more Auto Clippers okay that's good enough for right now now wire will hopefully last us my inventory is stabilized let's go back the wire buyer comes at 7k7 7000 operations so actually I just need to I need to get this memory up to seven alright alright oh yeah 7000 down there so I definitely need that okay so let me talk about what I'm gonna do next so I have a hopefully like a little less than an hour left but I want to go back to the chat bot stuff and I'm gonna use this library call p5 speech so p5 speech p5 and so let me get this stuff out if you want github and I'm gonna go back to my chat I'm so I'm gonna that's gonna be enough for the object stuff today I still have more of those to make but I feel like it I like to be able to do both courses in the same live session so now I want to go to make a let me go to was it P 5g beat generate B speech 1 okay so now I have another and then let's run the server and what I want to do now is I'm gonna open instead the chat bot stuff in Adam I haven't Adam there it is and let me go to localhost oh I'm in the wrong I'm in the uh hold on a sec I mean the rock I mean the the did I get to 7000 wait wait hold on we're close let's please glad to get to 21,000 and the memory up to six oh I should definitely do this buy some more wire just because I can't in a little while later and I'll slower the price to five cents yeah we're doing well now alright so what I want to do now let's get to here and just get rid of this and say so um let me get I also want to do everyone can just bear with me for a second do I have I want to get my examples from my A to Z course I'm gonna need to reference them I don't know that oops so I just need to clone this repo real quick and let me let's just let's just see quickly let me just briefly see chatbots speech basics sketch let me just make sure this example works hmm whoops it's not loading the library p5 speech because I made it a submodule because I'm a lunatic hold on everybody oh yeah well I know what to do I'm gonna do this in a bad way but it'll be fine so I need to get the I need to get the P I forgot that I didn't update this which I wish I had I'm going to go here and week and then I want to say get so I'm gonna say remove our p5 Jess speech and then I'm going to p5.js speech one of these days I will get all this stuff ready beforehand and now I need to clone this don't worry it's not this complicated to use it it's just the ridiculous way that I've set this up and so now my hope is that here okay now can you hear that but probably not so let me I need to fix the sound settings here sound multi output device I think will work a lot of coding trainer can you guys hear that now hello coding training how is the how's the volume there hello okay alright so so I want to make sure that this works and I'm gonna locally bring the locally bring the locally bring the locally brain all right so now what I'm going to do is do a tutorial about the speech library I'm gonna build something like this but not as fully fleshed out and so this having that open is great I mean this open this open I can close this this is the thing that I'm gonna this is the window for what I mean a code I can close this I can close this okay so Simon's saying the sound is layering over itself many times so just to confirm if i refresh this page is easy hello to Z it's normal read the chat hold on the audio is coming from two sources now well because you're hearing it through my microphone also yeah I can't really the problem is I can make this quieter Lauro to Z alright have an idea I kind of need to be able to hear it otherwise I don't know what's going on but I can change this volume hello Josie hello Josie so that's probably not so bad hello Josie once I lowered the volume of my laptop hello Josie is it okay yeah all right I don't want to make it a little bit louder because I can barely hear a Z so let me just try to make it a little bit louder let me just put it to the middle tell me if it's okay hello Josie hello Josie is this hello okay do I need to turn it back down not bad okay I could use headphones but that would be such a like complicated nightmare hey sean is in the chat already talked about ima John ok I already mentioned ima alright I'm just reading the slack channel where I know people are vaguely trustworthy there alright let's see ok so now I'm going to talk about the ability lab or the ability project I feel like it's called the ability project now yeah so I need to say ability project okay and Luke dupois all right so first let me say something about this before I go so I'm gonna do a tutorial where I talk about what this library is and who made it and show the basic features of it so there'll be three videos I don't hopefully I can do all this before I go one is just the basics for getting the browser to talk to you two is the basics for getting the browser to listen to you and say back but now now stay back listen to you and like recognize and convert it into text so texttospeech and speechtotext those are two videos the third one is I kind of want to make that into maybe I'll do the knockknock joke thing I'll do a little chat bot knockknock joke thing where it where you do it through voice so that's what I'm gonna do before I get there so this library is here in github it's under IDM which actually is another wonderful program at NYU called integrated digital media it's part of the Tandon school for engineering Luke Du Bois who was a wonderful artist I encourage you to check out his work is also is a professor there actually a director of the IDM program and created this library p5 speech and it is just a extension of the web speech like what comes I believe this so this I think you need to use in Chrome or if you use it a different browser you're sort of I think you're reliant on what the what the what the browser what the browser gives you so but what I wanted to say is this is part of a wonderful research group at NYU called the ability project and I guess they're the ability project is an interdisciplinary research space dedicated to the intersection between disability and technology so um you could imagine why speech detects insects texttospeech is useful so I'm gonna say this again when I record the video that'll get edited later but the thing that I wanted to mention here is that this library is pretty new Luke implemented it I with the help of me I am so me recently just like changed some syntax stuff to make it a bit more a bit with the p5.js style but I this library could use probably some help I think there's some issues filed maybe you'll find some bugs if you're using it would love people to help contribute to this library I won't mention that I mean I'm and in particular something that we could use help with is that I updated those syntax and that's what I'm gonna use in the tutorial but I didn't take the time yet to update these examples with my new naming and syntax and update this documentation so if anybody wants to help with that it probably could use a little more thought in terms of the naming and the API could even be improved further but I want at least do a round of that before I made the videos so anyone who's interested in that please please participate and contribute to that okay okay I should check the paper clips right it's okay to check the paper clips now what could get marking level 200 I need to auto by I need to get that auto wire buying thing so could I possibly get up to what do I need to get 34,000 can we wait till I get to 34,000 we're making paper clips today paper clips today yes we're in the factory 33 thousand paper clips no that's a wire buyer 7,000 I just need 7,000 and I just need to get the 34,000 so oh no 55,000 clips why didn't I think 34,000 I mean I could optimize the auto clip let me just buy a lot I have got I can buy a lot I'm gonna just fill up on wire he's all my money on wire then I'm gonna make my auto Clippers even better oh I get more trust there we go that's all I needed I get to trust the processor now you got to get to 7,000 there's no end to this you have no idea how far along I am on this other computer and yet here I am starting again I'll never be able to close this browser window ever it's more truss get some more processors to get up to 7,000 how am I doing here four dollars four dollars per second that's pretty good inventory it looks kind of stable buy somewhere owner Clippers buy some more wire okay fine we've got to go do this tutorial I'll come back I'll get that in a second okay okay here we go alright so this video is going to go it's like ten point three or whatever in my chatbot series hello I am here again in my chat pot series I'm going to do two tutorials and then some other stuff about something called p5.js speech so I'm gonna get to what that is in a second but the reason why I'm doing this is as part of the chatbot series I want to investigate chatbots that a human can interact with by typing and chatbots that a human can interact with by speaking and so in order to do the speaking part without purchasing some kind of proprietary device from some company that's supposed to be your assistant or something like that all right which I will look at later eventually I want to see if we can do this in a bit more of an opensource way we looked at rive script can we just can we converse can we talk to the browser the web browser have it listened to what we're saying and talk back to us and the answer is yes and so there's a library for p5.js which is which was created by Luke Du Bois from the integrated digital media program at New York University standard school for engineering the ability project is part of the ability projects research which is an interdisciplinary research space then it came to the intersection between disability and technologies so it's a great program it's great research group you can you can imagine why speech to text and text to speech could be useful in this area for for for accessibility of different tools that exist on the Internet okay so there which is a really important topic so but I mean this video just want to kind of learn how the library works and kind of do a few playful things with it so this is the web page for the library I recently made some changes to the API the naming convention of some of these functions and so who what's it what's here right now might actually be different than what you see when you go to this page but so I'm going to use this new naming oh and this is a demonstration but I'll come back to that all right so let's just let's first look at how easy this is to use which I think it is it is it's easy it's gonna be easy and I just realized I'm gonna pause for a second because what I want to do is grab the library separate file desktop oops chat bot speech one library's so so the first thing that you want to going to want to do is actually download the job the library from github itself and I will provide in this video's description a link to where you can download that javascript file you can see that I've downloaded is here already and it's part of my project now how you end up incorporating this library into your example it can be different depending on what text editor or development environment you're using and hopefully I can help you with that but for the way that I'm working right here is I just have all the people I've just libraries and I'm adding p5 speech KS and I've got to make sure all so then I go to my sorry I go to my index.html file associated with that this sketch and go right here copy paste this and I'm just gonna add a reference to p5 speech touch ass so let's even see if that does anything we go back to the browser hit refresh okay nothing but at least I'm not I don't get I'd not having an error so what's the what's the basic sorry let me look at the most okay let me look at the most basic thing I can do with p5 speech and if I go to the get up try the Kip sorry let me open up this computer that keeps going to sleep let me look at the most basic thing that you can do with the speech library which is just have the browser speak so if I go to the github page and I look down here this is kind of just a little bit of code so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna go to my sketch KS in setup I'm going to add and I'm gonna change this to let and I'm gonna say have it's a coding train so what I need to do and I think is gonna be okay there's the there's a bunch of a variety of issues that I'm going to show you and things that you could do but just just for the basic idea I need to create a p5 speech object voice equals new P v dot speech and I just need to call voice dot speak let's just see if this works ah this is something I'm gonna show you in a minute coding train did you hear that coding train it speaks to me okay so that's basically it so one of the nice things is I'm done like if I have some text you know I could have a whole interactive system when I click the mouse or I do this button or whatever and it's then it speaks it doesn't speak it could say anything the text could be generative it could use any of my you know weird crazy like generate poetry examples but there the reason why I this not gonna just end this video right now is the library actually provides a bunch of other features now these features are dependent on the web speech API and if I understand it correctly you're kind of limited to what the browser supports so which voices are available does it actually work so I'm doing this all in Chrome on a Mac and I imagine some of you might try this in different browsers a different operating systems so let me know what works and what doesn't work maybe we can contribute to the library if it doesn't work in a certain browser to help it work but again the browser has to support the web speech feature and okay but one of the things you can do is actually change the voice so let's let's look at how I might do that so I think I can say something like console.log voice dot voices so in this voice object I probably I'll call this speech just to be less confusing there is a property which is a list of all of the different voices that are supportive so let's hit refresh and look at this of poises not defined all right speech coding trainer but look it's empty so here's the thing you don't have to wait for it to be ready if all you want to do is use the default voice but if you want to try a different voice you need a callback a vend callback that says like hey i've loaded all the other possible and the way that you do that is by passing in an argument to the new p5 speech constructor I can say something like voice ready then I can write a function called voice ready and in that function I can console.log speech type voices I think this is gonna work coding train so now we can see this whole list of voices and witty what there's a lot of them like there's 82 of them and what's one that I might want to be interested in look they all have names so we could look here and the name is actually important it's the key word you can use to assign a different voice I happen to know there's one called cellos I think so one thing I want to just add here is I'm just gonna add the mouse pressed function and in the mouse press function I'm going to say speech speak coating train so let's just make sure this works oops ah so I need to make speech a global variable let speech timeout now we need to make speech global variable it did that hit refresh coding train coding train coding trains but every time I click the mouse it speaks but in theory now I should be able to say let's just try assigning a voice speech dot voice that's what was the one I just looked at was called Moira let's let's look at in a different random one Alice let's try Alice now I don't know if this is right let's see if this is right I don't remember their speech that voice is not a function pause I forget what it is but look at my example which I forgot cuz I don't remember the naming of the functions normally I would just go and look in the reference but I didn't speak set voice that's a much better name so it's not voice I should remember this it's set voice I could say set voice Alice clothing today clothing today so there's Alice one of my favorites I think it's called cellos I'm sorry three beings are weird I can barely hear that voice but it makes me want to do something when I hear at the cellos um so let's just do something one thing I could emphasize here is if these are the voices I could say let voices equal speech voices then I could say let voice equal random voices so the random function in p5 will pick a random element from the array and I could do set voice I could probably actually just say set voice the voice or set voiced/unvoiced name let's see if it works with just that voice object so I'm going to say console.log voice name so now we'll get a random on each time coding train coding train coding train noting train it's the same voice so I think we might actually have to say set voice voice that namecalling train codes in plain gold ink so now you can hear all the different speech that all the different voices I'm not going through all them but I'm just picking a random one each time all right what are some other things you might want to do well let me add a canvas here this is like that's really useful create canvas let's say 400 comma 100 and what I want to do is I want to display some information like I want to animate something when this when the browser is speaking and not animate when it's not speaking so there are some callbacks if I could just remember what they are speech dot start did maybe start speaking and speech dot ended and ended and speaking I think these are so this is just like with the Dom library if we've used the p5 Dom library where you have like a slider or a button and if you have a callback that you assigned if you press on the button or if you move the slider I'm now assigning a callback and I might have gotten these names wrong I'm gonna fix them if I got them wrong but I'm assigning a callback to when when the browser starts speaking and when it ends speaking and so this means I need to write these functions so I could say start speaking background green and then function and speaking that and this is I'm not doing anything sophisticated in terms of the draw loop or any animation but you could imagine doing something background 0 and let's say background zero when it starts so now if I load the page building frame oh yeah it's working I have this whatever so that canvas turns green whenever the voice is speaking so that's a useful thing you can do and the other thing you can do which is kind of nice is you can change three things the rate the pitch and the volume and I believe so I believe it's like set volume so if I made it like point one it should be very quiet set rate so let's let's actually let's just so volume you can imagine I believe the range is between zero and one it might be something else but we could look that up or experiment with it but let's forget about the volume for a second because I want you to be able to hear it let's try it set rate and what I'm gonna do now is not give it a random voice anymore because I want it to be able to recognize what it's doing so let's take out the set voice so it's gonna be the default voice now oops set rate is not a function timeout so what is it Oh set rate is a function set rates the fonts are pitch Oh set rate is not my naming is a bit confusing set rate is something that you assigned to the speech object itself the voice is the you know each voice doesn't have its own rate it's the rate that it's currently gonna speak with that voice so I'm just doing this wrong because I this should be speech set rate tota trainer Tony trainer so you hear that twice as fast right and if I were to say 0.5 coding train coding train it's much slower and then I could also I can also say speech dot set pitch I don't know what the range is for this I should I'm gonna just say 5 just to see anyway so you get the idea let's put this the rate back to 1 and put the pitch to like 0.2 coding training coding training Oh coding training I wonder if I need to give it a negative number coding training coding train so I'm trying to make the pitch lower Kodu tree yeah that's definitely higher coda tree so I wonder and one would be the default I say right coding training coding train I don't know how to make it lower timeout a second look anybody know I'm looking in the slack channel here set volume set rates that Leto set Lang set voice voice doesn't seem to use anything from oh but there's a list voices function shy I probably should have used that so that's good to a fraction trytry decimals right because it might demo I'm pretty sure let me look at this for a second hello Josie this is my demo hello coding train hello coding training oh hello coding training it is lower it's just I'm not slowing it down at hello coding train so yeah I think it is lower I'm just not really noticing it maybe it'll be more obvious with a local ding thing yeah but the difference in the coding train yeah with a different coding thing yeah so let me let me do the cellos voice see if that works well alright let's double back quite a bit Matt yeah when we edit this because I was like testing stuff quite a bit we'll just go to the pitch so I think what's happening here is this particular voice it's sort of hard to pick up the lower pitch so one thing I could do is just try let's assign a specific voice let's try that voice Alice and let's listen to that whoops I'm the wrong and let's listen to that clothing today coding today and now let me set the pitch to lower good evening yeah this voice you can hear it a bit it's a bit more obvious just with this voice no that's a higher pitch so set pitch set rate those are things you can play play with I just realized by the way that I believe if I say speech dot list voices that's a function which will actually just give me an array with all the voice names so this actually would have been a little bit more useful like if I say list voices and then I don't need this extra voice dot name thing and I can just say voice so now I could just pick around I don't need all the other aspects of the voice the full voice object I just want the list of all the names and I'm gonna take this out and let's just see now we're back to coding train coding train oh I'm whoops coding train coding train well what happened what's happening here what just happened here coding train whoa am I like editing the wrong sketch why is it printing everything out start speaking and speaking voice ready coding training 20 slide 2600 this is not I did something wrong coding training waitlist voices is it just I thought that what did I say Oh oh it just lists them in the console it doesn't actually return the array so nevermind forget that whole thing I mean that might be a nice thing to probably make sense to adjust the library to return the array that's just doing a fingerprint to the console I didn't realize that so scratch that whole little like spiel I gave and let's just and I don't need a second it is a little silly that I made this like separate variable whatever okay sorry oh where was I sorry to scratch that whole part coding trainer so let me put it back to where it picks a random voice and sorry hold on this was commented up so let me put it back to where it says a random voice so now the code this is the code that I'll release a different different voice each time but I want to show you I have another example that I'll link to which actually sorry pause why did I close it lol chazzy I have another example that I will link to as well which just has a bit more so this is an example I'm not gonna go through coding all this but as an exercise this might be something you try this is an example that takes all of those voice names and puts them in a dropdown menu so I could pick bells I can you know I can change the rate I can change the pitch this one is a weird one it's catching up I press the button to any time so the cue of its speaking I kind of so anyway so I encourage you to check out the code that drives this particular demo there's some other examples that are part of the p5.js github repository I mean p5 jest speech get a repository as well so see what you can make make something that talks to you in the browser and let me know how it is in the next video I'm going to do is have the browser listen to what I'm saying and print out in the browser itself what I'm saying okay so this was texttospeech right and I want to do speech to text in the next video thanks for watching alright so what did I miss Oh point oh one two two thank you for clarifying that stuff for me alright where are we five fifteen I won't try to get this so I definitely want to do that now let's check the check the paper clips alright I can get the wire buyer which I definitely need so now at least it'll by wire I have so much more I can get more memory and a little bit more processor oh I'm almost a quantum computing that's good and it needs some more auto clippers for sure I mean just oh I should get more marketing oh my god I have so much money more Clippers let's just like use up everything here and now five cents is still pretty good based on looks like this is kind of staying pretty even seven dollars per second if I lower the price it's more per second but that's gonna drain my inventory but I can just get more auto clippers I think I'll raise the price to five oh boy yeah it's like it's really really touchandgo they're here like I want I need this to sort of balance out as having some extra inventory let's try this but now I'm not selling as much some more Auto Clippers just like a couple more Oh let's double the marketing effectiveness that's that's a look at that that was good but now I really just need to make more stuff let's raise the price again let's do it ten cents eleven cents twelve cents okay I need some more Auto Clippers okay I'm gonna have to leave this gonna have to leave this where are we 154,000 okay let's go back to a speechtotext all right that's pretty good oh hello are you were still watching are you still there is the could you possibly still be there 200k all right all right where's my water you know what the problem is I'm not staying hydrated so I need to do p5 texttospeech let's do that so let me get the demo of that and see if that's working this is kind of interfere interfering pattern okay let's go here hello how are you are you listening to me one two three test four five six hello mmm what am I doing wrong that I'm not getting did I turn the continuous thing off so hold on we've got a little bit of an issue here did I break something in the library continuous true I want that not one time only I don't want to use the interim results is this not actually setting hold on did I mess something up in the library where it's not actually doing it oh look at this so I messed up something in the library so there's probably a bug in the library that we're gonna have to pull request but I should be able to fix this now it's my fault because I made changes to the library and what I'm looking for now I'm gonna fix the library Oh call back no wait so where's the okay hold on set what was that function called where am I here right no I want to go to this one I'm looking at start the start function Oh where's so let's look for start there it goes oh I could have sworn I don't know I must have messed this up but this is the definition for the start function and what I want is continuous and interim results and like I want instead of having it be variables that you said I thought the function could just set the values let me just do this right now and have to think about a better way to put this into the library but hopefully this will fix this hello one two three four hey great alright so this is working now it's what I'm not doing I don't have I have continuous on but not interim results so weirdly it's not gonna do the speech of text until I pause but it listened to everything I said and waited till I pause which which is pretty good well I'm quite impressed with how well this works all right so now we need to make this example basically so which is a pretty simple example to make but I need to also so we're gonna have to me I am semi if you're watching maybe you can help me figure out to pull request to the library because I broke the library or somebody watching could just pull request to it already but I think the reason why I'm not so sure it's like it's possible let me if you guys don't mind humoring me for a second I'm going to so in theory there are also these instance variables which should get set to these values and they should have a default can I like can I do that if it's not es6 so I'm going to do continuous sort of silly or false I don't know I don't know the best way to write this so I think the default should be I mean maybe the default should be true right when do you only want to get one thing I don't know but the interim results this should be the default definitely be false and then I can so that let me just make sure this still works I messed something up sketched a chest line 18 Oh continuous is not defined okay 1 2 3 test 4 5 6 test coding rainbow coding rainbow alright I'm great so I think it's gonna just keep listening to me no matter what I say so anybody watching this who feels like contributing to the library and at least at a minimum needs this fix but I have to think through whether this is the correct fix let's see here so now I need to do is copy paste this into this is my demo that I need to reference I can close and I need to go into speech oh no I need to make another example oh boy too many things are doing here speech 1 speech recognition let's just do that this is speech speech to speech speak and what I need to do is cop close everything because I messed everything up don't save and what I want to do is work on this sketch and I need to go to my example code in case I need to reference something so shut that open and this open and then I also need to take this fixed version of the p5.js library and where do I want to put that I want to put that in the example that I'm building now in libraries here okay I think I'm okay I think I've done everything that I meant to do save close so this is my reference this is that what I'm gonna make okay so I need to get rid of everything here and let me look at this code just so I remember so I make a new piece I've speech recognition object give it a callback then I sell it to start with the properties that I want and then I just used the callback and we can investigate what's in there okay great this is going to be really easy actually this is gonna be a pretty short video I almost don't need that but I'm gonna leave it there to reference and then I need to go back to the browser and go to here and we're good all right everybody you guys with me let me check the chat oh yeah Tim this buddy had a great point I did the worst thing ever okay I did a terrible terrible thing so my fix for the library is horrific so let me at least not do that right now it should only be if it's undefined so let me fix this this is worth looking at right now so so this is terrible because if I pass in false because I want continuous to be false that's good about to false it's gonna set it to true so that this really doesn't work I need to say if couldn't continuous equals undefined that's if I didn't give it an argument then I could set continuous if I wanted to make the default true maybe the default should be false and then this dot continuous would not would just be this right this should fix it again I'm not suggesting this is the most elegant solution but this should be if you didn't bother to define it then set it to true otherwise if you defined it as false it will be false okay I think that should fix it I'm just gonna kind of hope that I did this correctly why is it so cuz I was looking for or okay oh yeah alkis giving me a a better way to write it so why why while I'm here I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that so this is another way to write it I'm gonna thank you to Alka in the chat with Doc continuous equals continuous beep undefined oh my god true oh I can't bear it continuous commented out because I might have gotten it wrong and I'll come back to looking at that later so the what's that what that operator called the question mark oh I am trying to use es6 but the p5.js project hasn't like fully adopted es6 yet so the libraries are often written with previous to es6 syntax so while I'm working on this library I'm just keeping with es5 stuff all right well let's make this let's make this project a little worried that the I'm gonna just turn the camera on and off so it doesn't do it in the middle and I'm going to you I'm gonna have my I might as well have the example running while I'm talking cuz it'll be kind of interesting whoops hello and welcome to a video about I put the mouse in front about speech to text or speech recognition so this is part 2 the previous video I okay I'm gonna stop waiting for it now in the previous video I looked at how to take text and have the browser speak it with a variety of different voices using the p5 speech library which is built on top of the web speech API in this video I'm going to look at the p5 speech library but texttospeech or speak recognition which is actually quite an easy thing to do with the library now how you work out the interaction and how it works that's a the design is a the design problem is hard but that technically getting the library to work is pretty easy alright so I'm basically gonna this is an example running I'm going to try to build this example from scratch to look at how this works and I'm going to close this window around so this is an empty sketch right now and the first thing I want to do is create I'll make it a global variable a speech recognition I'm just gonna call it speech rec so I'm gonna create a variable called speech rec for speech recognition and I'm gonna say speech rec equals new p v dot speech rec so that's the name of the object that's built into library I've already downloaded an import of the library to this project I talked about how to do that in the previous video so the library is already available to me the p5 Jess speech library now let me run so ok no errors I'm refreshing the page no errors so here's the thing when when what we need a callback there's an event so whenever the speech recognition object has decided its listen to what you've said and knows what it is it's going to trigger an event just like a mousepressed event or a mouseover event so i'm going to call that event got speech and I'm gonna write a function got speech I'm gonna give it an argument and I'm just gonna say console.log so the idea here is that this function will will trigger it will run every time speech library things okay I heard what you said I've got it into text let me give it to you and I just want to put it into the console right now I do need one more line of code though I need to explicitly say I want the speech recognizer to start and so here speech recognizer start now if I just call dot start it's gonna start with some default settings but there's two important settings that I want to mention to you one is called continuous I'm gonna make that true and one is called interim results I'm just making up variables just to store the values true and false I could just write true and false right into the start function but naming them so we know what they are continuous means that without continuous it's just gonna listen to your speech one time at one time only and then it's gonna be done if you want to listen to somebody over time you want continuous to be true which is what I want and interim results is the funny thing and it's I haven't fully figured out how to get this behavior to work really well but you'll notice when I was demoing it before it would waited until I paused before it gave me what it recognized if I set interim results to true it's gonna try just keep giving me information as I'm speaking so we'll try it with true in a minute but let's leave that as false and these are by the way at the moment the libraries default settings although that could change I suppose if the library API changes okay so this is kind of all the code Redeem easiest coding tutorial video ever we have to see if this works now one thing is again you need to have a browser that supports the web speech API is probably gonna work immediately for me but if you put this on a web page or if you use it in different contexts it's going to ask for your microphone and you probably that also probably means it has to be on a secure website one that's hosted with HTTPS so there's a bunch of like security all sorts of requirements here I'm kind of bypassing that as I know it's just gonna work in the environment that I've set it up at least I hope it's gonna work so now let me hit refresh oh uncaught reference continuous is not defined I cannot spell the word continuous continuous continuous oh wait first of the steak of the p5 library if you guys speech library because before I recorded this video I was messing and I just made a mistake so I'm gonna disappear and come back in a second seriously I corrected it with the wrong I still have a spelling error can't in u.s. I'm back and I fixed that error and one thing you'll notice is now this red light is flashing up here this is something that Chrome will do to let you know that it is listening that the microphone is on so the microphone is on and let's say I've been talking for a little while this open let me just pause it's very hard for me to stop speaking sometimes but I'm going to stop right now so this thing appeared here in the console what appeared in the console it's this this object there's a whole object there what's in the object let's look at it it's got a confidence score this is really good how sure is it that it figured out what you were saying accurately so 92 percent confidence that's good the highest would be 100% it's got success it's the success which is like did it work that could be true or false and it's got the text there also is this object called data which has lots of other information timestamp and all sorts of stuff that's coming from the browser but the the things that you really want or did it work what did I say and how confident are you and I got another one so let's let's do something right now let's just say create P speech dot txt so I just want to make a new paragraph element on the page with whatever and and if I want to be really sure about this I'm going to say if speech dot success so make sure that's true create P with speech text and now I'm gonna refresh the page hello unicorn nangou reindeers are better than people why don't that song in my head oh my goodness did you think that learning oh that's the old Sun I can't anyway the point is I think this is working I lost I got lost in my own thoughts and I'm like the computers talking to me I stopped working oh yeah so maybe it just didn't have success a couple times so you get the idea interesting interesting okay we're in good shape here you know what actually is happening when I look this way I think I'm kind of quieter than when looking at anybody okay let's try this was one more thing we refresh the page let's see what happens when we set interim results to true and see what happens just let's just see I am now attempting to get interim results oh it wasn't autoscrolling so you can see now I'm making a new paragraph and so this is like it's continuously giving me more and more depth so this would be interesting like as it's like trying to interpret it whoa this is crazy so this is interesting to try you can see what that's not like losing my mind here it's the paragraphs aren't scrolling automatically and I am all working no play make Kody train dull it's behind so I'm gonna stop here so you can see this is the basic idea now you could probably do something much more creative with this in terms of how this fits into an interaction scenario but the core basic ideas are start listening and whenever it's recognized something you've got data back you've got confidence you've got the text and whether it worked and some more stuff too and how you display that information back to the user is your choice so I'm gonna do a coding challenge where I make a chat bot that listens to what I say and then replies with listen to what I say was speechtotext and replies with texttospeech and that will be in the next video in this playlist if you're in the program with text playlist see you soon paper clips why couldn't I remember that all right I don't know if I really have time to do this do you think I could do this coding challenge well I'm at 300 let's let's work on the paper clips for a little more I could definitely get some more Auto Clippers here and I have so much unsold inventory and you lower the price 42 how much trust do I have 18 all right all right oh I can start in a minute Beall start investing all right by the way it is just kind of nice to make these artisanal paper clips by clicking the button I saw that joke from somebody else okay do I have its 540 the American League Championship Series game does not start until 8 p.m. I would like to have dinner with my children do you need to get going I'm looking what's with the Capitals that's an interesting question yeah okay I miss dot text so before I move on I by the way I borrowed that our T's an old payperclick joke from somebody else on Twitter who made it that wasn't my joke but it was a good one so I had to borrow it oh boy I mean you gotta raise the price I need more Auto Clippers oh no I definitely need this 500 oh now now now we're cooking I just like I really I just want a big box of actual real paper clips right do the coding challenge then I turn Oh Austin lost it that's a good point all right I'm never going to do this coding challenge so the question is kept me just can you do a video on using speechtotext to do activities like your computer like play music Oh could I control the computer well this would be this is something you certainly could do but I'm limited to controlling the browser because I'm just living in JavaScript in the web page and the browser is not typically allowed to reach outside of it you know it's not like I could make a web page that I could suddenly delete files off of somebody's hard drive that would be a big security issue and in fact that's why you have to give permission to use the microphone or the camera that sort of thing so how am i doing balance wise here I need to raise the price a little bit I just need more Auto Clippers they're so expensive but now looks like my inventory is kind of balanced I do cobain ambrose says why does it Dan upload the live streams after I do so immediately after this is over the live stream is available it's often becomes an unlit by default it becomes an unlisted video so you might have to tweet at me or ask in the chat for the link and then once once I've had a chance with Matt Matt's help who helps me manage the channel to add time codes and description and a thumbnail make sure it's all kind of like set and there wasn't like a private email address in it by accident or something then I'll release it and make it public and that usually happens sometime over the weekend my phone is okay hold on I definitely want the trading engine ooh okay hold on we want some highrisk investments let's deposit some money just posit all our money and let's start investing okay my inventory is kind of going up our buyers on all right all right little let the investments go we're gonna come back to this so I think what I'm gonna do I mean I could just do the number so I just do the number guessing chatbot and just build that that will be easier because then I don't have to like design a knockknock joke and this thing is still running I'm gonna turn this off so the let me let me at least start I think I should at least start from this chat bot code whoops that'll make things because I the previous let me just open up the previous coding challenge oops what am i doing oh my god chat bot I made everything so huge oh you know what this gives me a chance to fix something that I messed up in the previous video so this was the this was the previous chat bot where then I would say five and let's say pick a higher number seven I got it so in a way I kind of want to just use this have I been here for three hours 345 no two hours right I've been here for about exciting start though I started at 300 315 two and a half hours it I just you know if you if you want if you want to assign the blame did I mention its Frank Lance Frank Lance let's think that first of all he loves Frank Lance who is Frank Lance you might be wondering speaking of Frank Lance is the director of the NYU game center runs the MFA program he is a game designer he made the perfect game to torture I pretty sure he made it to torture me specifically I mean in some ways my life has all this meaning now because at some point I will get to the end right I will have made all the paper clips that anyone could ever have made and then I will discover the true meaning of everything that is to be in life right right Frank Frank are you here all right how do you guys feel about me I think what I want to do is I just sort of think that knockknock joke is maybe a little bit better of a chatbot so but I could do that so let me do that let me change the knockknock joke I just want to remember because that's gonna be easy to change and then have it speak okay this is the last thing I'm gonna do today for sure besides read some random numbers this is the knockknock one so if I look at this like the knockknock chatbot Chapa is pretty it's pretty simple okay all right so now close all this out Oh Eric Eric in the chat hi Eric is telling me that thick payperclick game never ends the universe resets actually true mates think like let's do the Wrath of Khan oh I'm getting a little dizzy give me a little dizzy everything's okay all right ready everybody we need we need to we need some warm up here pull the muscle of my dad all right let's do this this last exciting chat bot the music's messed up I'm not worried about it the sound is broken but hold on probably because but this is still working and can you still hear the speechtotext thing texttospeech yeah I messed it up because I change the volume for this but I can fix that back later okay I wonder why that is I really shouldn't worry about that right now you guys are getting to me here oh maybe it's the loopback audio that I want to use all right I'm gonna not I'm gonna not worry about that mouse over this stream okay how's the paper coop don't ask me how the paper clips are coming along that's a very bad idea I'm gonna be I want to get home by 700 so let's do this coding challenge let me fix this a little bit okay oh the Texas speech sounds bad so I messed something up so we have to fix this it looks like stuttering hmm tell me if it I know that's right I'm checking them kind of let me unplug and plug some wire stuff in oh I hear it crackling did it fix shoot let me see here there's a couple other places I can try to check not fixed okay thank you guys for letting me know let's see I unplugged and plugged a bunch of things back in let me do that one more time oh wait a sec I'm so silly that I can actually I'm waiting for you guys to tell me if it's fixed and I forgot that I have a monitor here I think it's okay now I'm hearing it fine so when I was listening to these headphones you guys heard it clipping and stuttering that's weird cuz it's fine for me in the monitor so where could that mean it's having a problem yeah I'm trying to think I guess I could stop I'm gonna hit stop streaming and start streaming again instantly I think it won't split this up into two separate streams I'm sorry everybody I know this is so the right physical issue but what this is in theory no you understand that the what I'm listening to here is the final audio before it goes to stream so something is happening this is not like this is not connected to my laptop this is connected to the live streaming computer and this is the monitoring that output so like I can hear myself talking if I put these on hello hello and I hear no issues so so yeah but my voice is fine too isn't that weird that's very weird but I've unplugged and plugged everything in that would the only thing I can think of as restarting OBS you know what but wasn't doing it before well I'm gonna try stopping and starting streaming real quick okay I'm gonna try that ready here we go one two three all right I should be back let's see if this is the music bad two or just my laptop turn the interim thing off what's the interim thing am i back can you guys see me huh is the music bad so now you can't hear anything oh it's working now it's fine okay are we good was the was the speechtotext fine yeah Oh still bad what but the music is fine why was it fix I did every say was fixed for a second hold on I think it's this cable hmm all right oh I hate having these technical problems hold on I need it I think this cable is bad whoa something just happened different mic picked it up alright okay [Laughter] ignore it play through the air into the mic that I could do still that okay so definitely if I'm gonna do this I need to just out of curiosity I'm plugging the output to YouTube button I did that fix the music by any chance I'm probably just gonna do it emergency Chrome extensions yeah no okay so I'm gonna basically unplug this turn this all the way up how's that yeah so now it's just coming out of my laptop speakers and being picked up by this mic which if that's good enough then accept the ball then that that's what I'm gonna do hmm all right well I lost all my momentum and energy I'm at 1 million paperclips though I kind of want to restart everything and make it work but I'm no I can't play the music now I mean the music is completely is nonexistent it's plugged into something that mean it's just coming out of like random speakers now okay let's do this oh my god I plant them computing now oh my all my stocks are doing terribly got a lot of unsold inventory lower the pricier I'm sort of get some high risk money going okay I need photonic chips okay all right shall we do this just get everything oh I completely forgot I was lying all right here's the thing should I just go I think I'm gonna go ahead and do this the computer I feel a little sad that the audio is gonna be a little like not great but I think we're just gonna have to live with it and I'm gonna do this okay it's a little quiet oops so I don't know how to make it I'm gonna do the bots don't worry yet I'm trying to just think if there's a like if I just I think it came let me just try one more thing which is to oh wait a second oh because I turned off the laptop audio well weird hold on a second just just bear with me for a second why does the oh oh because I put it on internal speakers okay okay so I have one more thing I can try if I might as well try this one last thing which is that I have a duplicate cable I just want to know if it's the cable so if you don't mind I'm going to very quickly swap cables it's probably a different cable because this one I kept unplugging and plugging in but let me just give this one last try and then okay this is now gonna go out through the HDMI again how's that i awkward dev for hiding the 13 yeah sounds bad okay nevermind it's something else I don't know where it's happening but it's not this cable I mean I could try swapping a different cable there's so many things I could try swapping now but I'm gonna have to just forget it okay thank you for that was one last thing I could try I could probably restart the computer but I prefer not to do that alright I should turn off the paper it's gotta be that it's got to be the paper clips it's gotta be frank Lance how am I doing here oh I really need to I need to get this marketing going this is ridiculous hold on everybody I know I'm distracted to there we go fifty dollars per second that's good all right I'm gonna let that go and here we go really lost my mind here six o'clock all right here we go hi I'm gonna do one more a chatbot I'm kind of gonna do the exact same chatbot I just did maybe I'll change it from a number guessing thing to a knockknock joke thing just to change it but instead of me typing guess the number between 1 and 10 ok let's try 7 pick a higher number let's try 9 the lower number let's try hate I got it instead of typing I want to interact with this chat bot through voice so it just recorded 2 tutorials about the p5 speech library 1 tutorial looks at texttospeech so having the browser speak with a voice and another tutorial looks at speech to text listening to what I'm saying and and turning that into text so let's first so let me first cup two things let me deal with this chat bond a little bit let me first say one thing that I got wrong in the previous coding challenge video that I that I should as I as I created this like elaborate system if you recall to say to the chat bot set a number and then set the variable to whatever so I had to like secretly talk to the chat bot there's actually a set var method that's part of the rive script JavaScript library so I didn't have to use that convoluted methodology if you don't know I'm talking about you didn't watch the previous coding challenge you can go back and watch it and this will make sense but this was an unnecessary step thank you for internet for correcting me and helping me with that but I'm actually going to just kind of get rid of this brain and I'm gonna start over I'm gonna do a sub I'm gonna I want to make sure cuz uh with a knockknock joke you might say who is there or who's there knockknock no but that's the box saying that anyway so I don't need this sub what I'm gonna do is do I'm going to have a catchall which is anything the user says I'm going to say try saying knockknock and then optionally if the user says anything we the phrase knockknock in it so this is like a channel wildcard I wonder if I need that optional around there then I'm gonna then the bot is going to say who who's there okay so let's just try this and this is one of the examples from the rive script website so I can say anything I want and it's gonna say try saying knockknock and then I could just add knockknock and it's gonna say who's there or I could say knockknock and it could say who's there now here's the thing now what I want to do is say well whatever they say in response to who's there the bot should say star one who and then at the end the bot should say haha so this is the sequence knock knock who's there Frank Frank who Frank Lance ha ha ha Franklin's making a weird nonsensical appearance in this video tutorial for no good reason but that's besides the point so here's the thing though VI can't have all these stars what I need is something to help me sequence and I'm kind of forgetting what the what the command is for sequencing but I'm gonna remember in a second because there's gonna be about to be an edit point we're gonna look it up now I'll just look it up with with you and watching me do this so I have an example that already does this I was trying to do it from scratch and here it is so ah the percent the percent means if the last thing was who is there then I say whatever who if the previous thing was whatever who then I can say haha that is so funny so I need to add this in to here right think about this this is saying this is a catchall but only if the previous thing that the bot said was who is there ah but the bot says who's there this is why I want to have this substitution I knew there was a reason this substitution who's and who is our equivalent so whatever kind of mechanics is working have them be equivalent and then I also want by the way I don't usually do this in a coding challenge just like a copypaste from an example but that's what I'm doing the point of this was to add the speech thing so I guess I could cut me some slack here so then at the end if the last thing was star who now let's see the order might matter let's see if the or let's see if this works I put these in a different order than in the example but let's see if this works so let's go back to the bots and I'm gonna just type in some nonsense so say try saying knockknock so I'm gonna say knockknock say who's there coding coding who coding train yay okay so we have a working knockknock joke chat bot thing because by the way if I were to say now coding train it's good as they try saying knockknock right because it only laughed because it was part of the sequence but the whole point of this video however long I am in is now to 10,000 steps so I walk back and forth what it's really good to do a like live YouTube channel with a Fitbit on okay I wanted to speak so how do we do that so I need to import download and import the p5 speech library so if you want to know how to do that I cover that in my tutorials about the p5 speech library right now I'm just gonna have a moment where I disappear and reappear with the library downloaded so let me just grab the library because actually you know what I should no no let me not do that I I need the p5.js library so how do I get that I think the piece I need the p5.js speech library the v5 speech library how do I get that so I have that open here this github repository if I just go into here Lib and I see this particular file p5 speech Jas this is the file I need to download and include it as part of my project so I'm not going to go through the steps to download it right now it's already there it's not already there but I'm gonna have an edit point and now and now I'm gonna go chat no speech rec library p5 speech chat bot to libraries p5 speech ok I'm back and you can see that I've now added p5 speech Jas to my folder with libraries in it and actually with the thing that I didn't do is I need to go into o index dot HTML and also add a reference to that P v dot speech jeaious library ok now I have this p5 speech library now what I want to do is I'm going to say let speech equals new p v dot speech and do i need an argument there i can't remember but i think no if i wanted to set a voice you know i'm just gonna use the default voice voice speech dot speak hello so let's just see if this works so unfortunately my sound system isn't working so great so you're hearing it out of the computer speakers and in through my mic hopefully you can hear it ok but you can see this is as simple as just creating a speech object and saying it's speak hello my other video I go through how to pick a different voice how to change the rate and pitch but I just want to use the default voice and now instead of wherever it says sticks the out put it in HTML thing I'm gonna say speech dot speak reply okay here we go so I'm going to type in some nonsense all right now I'm gonna say knockknock coding coding rainbow okay so we get the idea we get the idea this works now I kind of want to remove the text there the point was this but now what I need I need four instead of me typing in the stuff I want to now be able to say it oh this is gonna be fast so now what I need can I do this in the same sketch is I need a speech recognition object which I must say new p5 speech speech rec okay and I need to give it a callback got speech so this is the tricky thing the callback is for when asked equivalent of when I hit the submit button so whatever I did in that submit button that's the callback when I hit submit I want to just process what I said well I think this is gonna work am I making I might not be making any sense but I need I need to add this I need to add a function called got speech speech so I just want to make sure this works and I'm gonna just say console.log so this I go through this in more detail in that other tutorial video but basically this speech object comes with a property called text so and I forgot that I need to say I need to explicitly tell the speech recording object to start and there's some things I can configure in the start function I'm gonna use the default settings all right so let's just see if this works now so you can see that it's listening to me but if I've done this before so normally we would have pop up with like can I use your microphone thing you might see that and you can see that I'm getting the text that I'm saying here knockknock great alright so this is working so now what I need to do is I need to change it from basically the user input is no longer what's coming in from that text box but instead it's what's coming in from speech text so it needs to reply to speech dot text and I'm gonna do something really ridiculous which is I'm gonna say input user input dot value speech tech so I'm gonna put what I'm saying also on the screen just for debugging purposes I'm gonna remove all that before I finish so let's let's go knock knock okay got an error speech dot speak is not a function ah what's happened here these callbacks maybe live somewhere else oh look at this I name the same variable too why I called this speech I should call this or some camera stuff I don't know we wrote a speech let's just call this speech speech data oh I I need better variable names somebody will think of better variable names and I'm gonna say let let input equals speech data text and then I'm just going to use input here input input and input all right let's see if this works hello knock knock Daniel Daniel sheath Mon wow that was exciting it worked could you hear it could you hear it so this is great I think I'm done oh let's let's just remove let's remove everything from the HTML page just for the the sake of argument so I'm gonna just comment all this stuff out I'm gonna go into my code and I don't want any Dom elements I don't need talking to me I don't want to use this Dom element I don't want to use this Dom element and I don't need this function alright so I just commented out all the stuff that was for the HTML stuff hello bot knockknock coding train coding train coding challenged completed yeah alright I don't know that was up let me try it one more time oh well let me do a different demonstration with a I need a real knockknock joke oh I got one I got one I got one Matthew edit that out this will be the real one use hello bot knockknock the interrupting cow Moo well it doesn't work can I interrupt it it oh let's try another one knock knock knock knock okay am i back you can't see the computer can you see me can you hear me I'm sort of hoping I wonder if that fixed by the way I had to restart the computer so I sort of wanted to see if the audio problem got fixed if you don't mind so let me see if that fixed the audio problem I'm just curious so if I go back to the sound settings and do multi output device hello charging knock knock who's there alright did that fix the the audio thing I mean it's you're gonna hear twice because I turned it up so it's coming through my micro yeah it does great well let me just go redo the whole video again all right let me turn it down I can't oh so frustrating should restart I would have restarted the computer if I knew it was gonna crash in the first place and I think by the way unfortunately when it crashes I think that corrupted the whole recording to disk so I think of course me to edit these challenge we're gonna have to like suck down the livestream archive off of YouTube anyway if anybody knows how you could because I the data is there like I know right now let me look let me just if that happened because I can ask there is yeah there is a whoa oh my goodness a huge file here that I can get rid of there is a 7.5 gig video file which was the whole livestream archive which won't open because it's not closed properly there must be a way the data's got to all be there there must be a way to like just fix a it's like a dot mp4 file if anybody knows how to do that let me know because we had this problem before if I am writing to mp4 yes so Alka maybe I need to write to something some other like they can't deal with this right now but maybe I need to change the settings another time alright let's let's finish this out by gonna break it again I hope not alright knockknock knock knock who's there wait Larry hold on hello bot try saying knock knock knock knock who's there the interrupting cow the interrupting cow moo moo moo it doesn't like the interrupting okay knock knock knock knock just knock knock who's there orange orange home orange you glad I didn't say Paperclip oh so this is the end of this code challenge this is a chatbot voice conversational interface thing that runs in the browser with rive script and p5 the p5 speech library I hope you enjoyed watching me make this I hope that you make something fun and interesting that's different and please share it with me this is a little trickier to share especially if it's a rather than just like oh it's an interesting like rainbow particle system but figure out a way to share it with me share a link in the comments or tweet me at Schiffman and i will see you in a future video goodbye try seeing knockknock oh really good bye good bye I think that should get edited right like the video should end right after the computer says try saying knockknock alright everybody it's me I am sue me is telling me it's fairly simple to chunk it to the last total frame or whatever so I could use some help with that I'm gonna upload these files to Google Drive alright everybody I don't have my music thing plugged in but you probably hear it that way so let me work okay okay paper clips 625 I I get 1 minute and 30 seconds to the end of this song whatever the paper clip value is I'm gonna do a screenshot at the end of this song whatever that number is it's the number but I get some time here what can I do really quickly mega Clippers oh my god be some mega Clippers quickly just as many as I can get raise the price well it's going down no lower the price lower the price I want more money deposit some money highrisk stocks ooh let's let's run some tournament what else can I get I don't have any quantum computing yet do I can get some more of these things all right make some extra ones all right this is this is how far we're gonna have gotten by the way everybody let me see if wait I'm not looking at the YouTube chat I'm not by the way Thank You Alka for that remind me you're so I'm not I forgot when I when I went to restart the computer I didn't load up the YouTube chat let me see if I can look at it real quick on this computer here Dan when will you be back with a neural network series I hope to be able to announce some stuff about that soon and it will be towards the end of this year or early 2018 until you know the reality of my the way that I do this channel is that I'm trying to support the courses that I'm teaching and so that content doesn't you know I wish I had done it over the summer I wanted to but that content just doesn't fit till later Oh next week I next week I will be in Boston for processing day there will be no live stream next Friday so the next live stream will be unless I can find a time in between now two weeks from today that that live session will be recorded so hopefully that'll be another video so there are two chats I'm using a crowdfunding site called patreon patreon.com slash coding train and so for people who are members or patrons of the channel through that there's a pipe there's a private slack channel that you'll get an invite to wait hold on what ah wait why is my oh there we go zero all right no thank you so this is the final number this is the final number I should be on the desktop where do the screenshots go hmm yep here it is this is the final number for the live stream by the way if I had just focused only on the paper clips I would have gotten way way way past this is the final number three million fiftyfive thousand seven hundred fifty one the rules are just to remind you your tweet with the hashtag paper clip train had to be a timestamp 330 p.m. Eastern Time and your number the difference between your number and this number the absolute value of that has to be the smallest of everybody and if you did multiple guesses your last one in a valid timestamp is the one that will count so I will look through and try to find the winner but if anybody feels like looking through the hash tag with this number and helping me find the winner and like doing some kind of like certified authentication I will then direct message you and get your address anywhere in the world I will send a coding train tshirt so so that's the that's that there's 400 people watching right now which is kind of insane this has been going on for three hours and 23 minutes which is the good sign it leads me to believe the interface is leading me to believe oh I that I'm completely brain dead right now I'm gonna go which is it leads me to believe that the hashtag is particle known paperclip train I believe let's check it a Twitter comm hashtag paperclip train so we can just sort of scan over this to see this is pretty good noah van boven is looking pretty good this is the end of the game right all right so I'll look through this later thank you guys for watching I hope this was a helpful session I hope to have more sleep before the next time I will see you two weeks from now thank you for joining the coding train I'm gonna check the slack channel to make sure I didn't miss anything thirteen million is maybe the closest me I am Samia there's a 1 million yeah 1 million is gonna be closer so c'est la vie okay so I don't know I'm done I can't end these things oh and I have some exciting new videos that will premiere before hopefully before two weeks from before my next livestream that were not done in the live stream so there will be some for those who watch this live and here I almost I didn't read any random numbers I gotta go like the sound board is not hooked up somebody wants to help me with the sound board I would love that I have an iPad which drives it but I would be totally open to using a different solution and let's try just everybody I leave you with one last thing which is try seg knockknock okay goodbye
