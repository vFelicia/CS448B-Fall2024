let's find something we wanna make some crazy idea we'll figure out what it takes to make creation hello good evening wait Here I am again just as I was this morning but only after a very frantic day so I might be a little bit more disheveled I thought I'd play the coding train intro song just you know the morning was like this serious like I'm gonna do a real tutorial I'm gonna be a good person on the Internet who takes making tutorials seriously it does a very good job and now it's the evening I don't have a lot of time we got about an hour and I want to do two more things I didn't get to this morning one of them is gonna be about kittens the other one's gonna be about p5 my voice you can hear that cold it's kind of a little bit back so let's not overdo it everybody let's relax but I'm gonna be fine my voice is fine I have some water over here and have some sound effects ah here I I guess I'm not bothering to do like my usual like intro blah blah blah blah blah so it did all that this morning I just want to kind of get into it but if you want to mention I'm really looking for a coding train like breaking news sound effect so I feel like what I want to be able to do is like get some breaking news my and then be able to report it so if anyone wants to make for me a good like did you know breaking news sound effect that's absolutely completely ridiculous please let me know please make that okay so uh let's gooo echo 34 is saying I sent you an extension I may check it out on my profile echo 34 underscore YouTube okay hold on Twitter actually mmm people sent me a lot of actually interesting things but I'm not logged into my Twitter I'm logged into the coding trained Twitter's here let's look at the notification and see if people sent it to me here so yeah wordless web thank you Gottfried a creator of the processing for the Raspberry Pi oh yes Thank You Nicole first of all I mentioned Nicole he's amazing mystery animal project already you've mentioned it this morning go check out Nicole he's amazing mystery animal project but this is a wonderful chrome extension I wish I had hat had it in my original video I wonder maybe we could splice this in Matt show this probably won't work at all but I'm gonna like talk about this Chrome extension for a second and if it works still I kind of like splice it in to that intro video that's great but if not this is a Chrome extension by Melanie Hoff called decode Elia and I don't know if I pronounced that right it's a Chrome extension and glasses set that uses basic principles of color theory to render your browser's content visible only with the use of red red tinted glasses so you can see here I can't see what's going on here but if I happen to have the red tinted glasses so I could essentially if I'm in a coffee shop and I didn't want anybody to see what I'm doing I could wear my glasses and use my computer without anyone be able to see and this is probably a nice video summary Melanie is an alum of both the school for a poetic computation and ITP the graduate program where I teach so I encourage you to check out this wonderful Chrome extension I just want to see if there's a right so so you can search for some like things on your this is obviously a kind of like an art project but it actually does work I've seen it it's great all right what else echo 34 says I made a Chrome extension for you okay echo that's wonderful and I'm sure that you have posted this here and it's something perfectly appropriate for me to look at in a live stream but it would be helpful if you just gave me a little bit more information I'm sure you know just you know I live in a world where I risk somebody putting making it doing a Chrome extension that as soon as I load it does something embarrassing on the screen which I seriously doubt no one in the audience really and that I've had those intentions but if you could just let me know what it does and maybe I can we can take a look what else is here whoa that's funny all right and so that's I think those are some things that people sent me on Twitter all right Cole if you make that sound effect please make it I'll use it anybody or it could be a I could have a lot of them I would love that okay search to Schiffman on twitter boy see breaking news I hate it right now breaking news I'm being told that you could search on Twitter to Schiffman I don't need the at Schiffman let's see and there we go and they I can actually just do latest and we can see oh here's an idea and make a QR code out of a bookmarklet that's interesting oh this is an important little clarification I saw in your live stream you used self calling anonymous functions well the reason you have to put in the parenthesis around the entire thing is because the parentheses are returning the object inside as a function and not as a reference thank you for that explanation I think I kind of understand that and also alka let me know that you don't actually need the wrapping function for a bookmarklet but otherwise you can run into scoping areas if you're just sort of in the global namespace all right I could appreciate simply a search engine type thing for your YouTube channel just opens a small window okay let's try it so I'm going to try echo 34 x' extension well this is exciting this we're living dangerously downloads do I have to be able to get this ready a dime oh the camera went off I need a looping snare drum okay oh okay oh yeah hold on here we go we're gonna go to Chrome colon slash extensions we are going to disable this one we are going to load an unpacked extension desktop no downloads Dan's extension select coding trains YouTube feed oh this is really intro I love this okay a excellent version number 0.1 that is the version number that I love as well Thank You Louise in the Patriots as you are on the office big screen for everyone to watch which office and everybody who's at the office go home go to your families and loved ones and friends enjoy Friday I know it's freezing in New York but maybe you're actually in an office in the tropics and you could just go have a nice walk on the beach and make a bonfire and have a salad although I don't think salad is a really good food for eating at the beach to be perfectly honest right I don't know what's a good beach bonfire bonfire that's a little bit scary don't that sounds a little dangerous actually be safe everybody okay version in the popup shows points you okay um coding train extension to in enable so how do I make this happen let's see let's just go to YouTube maybe I have to go to YouTube this is it here click it oh look at that I can search oh it's just maybe it's just a look at this so I haven't done popups yet I'm gonna do popups let's look for its person point to mmhmm version MIT smash there oh but maybe it's just maybe it magically upgraded in the time in between all right visit site where does that take me oh the coding train com so I took me somewhere weird but that's fine let me do this again and I but what so I assume I don't actually have to be on YouTube to look at this let's do this and so video name what's a video I'd like to I love you I love flowers don't have a video about flowers yeah I do I have a bunch that is wonderful the coding train No yay thank you echo this is the coding train Chrome extension maybe we could make a we could put this on github and make a community coding train Chrome extension that'll be great alright so thank you now what am I here to do this evening before up until about 630 let's see if I can do both of these things if I go over to my kind of road map here I want to get into popups can't erase this this Hestia this is gonna get erased I was going to take a picture of it but it's in the video so I don't have to I wouldn't get two popups and I want to do the new tab thing but I want to do two coding challenges I want to pause at content scripts only basically and do two coding challenges one whatever webpage you're on it just replaces all the images with images of kittens why not maybe it should be rainbows or unicorns or whatever but let's use do kittens and number two is I want to do a Content script that whatever web page you're on it allows you to draw over it using a p5 canvas and we saw a nice example from that I mentioned earlier today that has a much more sophisticated version so that's the two things that I'm planning to do and I'm gonna do those those coding challenges the question is when I do the coding challenges I like to start from nothing but I could just start from my basic content to know let's start from nothing I'm gonna it's not that much stuff to type and it kind of works that way so we're gonna do two content script coding challenges Chrome extensions well do I hear the train coming into the station it's a train if that's like it should be and then like the train comes in and there's like oh look it's our friend however remember and then the guests would be here but there's there's no guests maybe there's a guest it's completely empty in the hallway there's nobody around I should really just pick up this camera and bring it into the hallway no it's Jude it's too crazy okay back back cohhd cohhd cohhd cohhd cohhd see I was I took it very seriously this morning and I don't know what the point of that was all right so what I need to do is make sure that course like one thing that I need to do is get some kitten images I'm just gonna so this has it this is um Thank You Austin I think who showed me this website called unsplash.com if anybody can fact check me on this I believe I can use these images for free and they are public domain or their Creative Commons or something that I can use them in tutorial so let's get some of these kittens this one looks nice this one looks nice it does have an API and so I think as like a challenge is you could try to get the kids did I just do five I'm just gonna do five and oh they have people's names and them I shouldn't I download a couple of them twice so one two isn't there like that don't say aw aw challenge let me try it you have to like look at the image and not say aw Oh again try to get that alright you gotta love the kittens alright um I want to rename these you know what no problem I'm gonna leave their names because I want the people who took these images to have credit for them so let me grab these and I'm going to go to the desktop I'm going to go to Chrome extensions I'm gonna say Oh three kittens by the way I just wanted everyone to see this if I stretch it out did you get it pretty straight all right okay I think I'm ready and let me get Adam open and kittens all right license unsplash all photos published on unsplash can be used for free you can use them for commercial and noncommercial purposes you do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or unsplash although it is appreciated when possible place kitten yep Gareth and the chat mentions Gareth and chap Benson's place kitten aye I do know about place kitten and I was thinking of using it but it doesn't seem to be working right now okay so I'm going to remove these extra extensions thank you again echo we use 34 underscore or YT 4 that was awesome if people are interested in doing like a community coding it got Chrome extension I'm open to facilitating that through the coding train github organizations so tweet at me at Schiffman if you want to participate in that now now I am going to uh people are asking about where this song came from what he's asking about that I think I could just make up stuff that people are asking in the chat and you guys won't know but you're watching and you can see the chat leader who people watch this back they won't know somebody was mentioning the song that they liked it but they weren't asking where it was I just made that up I want to show you guys something to which I think you'll find really amusing how can I show this to you mmm ok I have an idea this is kind of you guys are gonna find this to be quite amusing so I am just opening the camera on this webcam so I'm gonna turn it around and I want to show you the wall that's for the cameras this is what I thought would be helpful this morning yes I over here this is the camera this is very like meta now like weird meta craziness whoa I will shake hands with myself but I want this hand to talk to this end okay this is where the camera is this is my sign that reminds me to look here actually I didn't make this sign somebody else made the sign these for office attacks stop from Chrome extensions I thought usually I'd like no stuff off the top of my head and that sounds I don't I can look it up or but I thought let me try this I never I always get the thing where people say like oh I know what you do you you have a second computer and that has all the code and you just retype it which I never have actually done this is my first tip it's not a second computer that must be a much more logical thing to do but a little behind the scenes for you to today's coding train I hope you enjoy that okay I'm gonna come back around I'm over here I'm over here so much going on I'm gonna come back around what we're here now and I'm going to turn this back around and you can see this is me with a green wall for a public Lucchese shirt on and here we go oh this computer went off okay so anyway what do you see me like looking over there to figure out what goes in the manifest but I have no signs for me for the kitten stuff here we go yeah I guess there's a little green screen challenge for you all if you want to do some kind of weird take that video and key out the green that you saw Sarah Sarah alright let's let's go everybody I sorry I've I get lost in this beautiful kittens eyes so I'm gonna do a coding challenge right now and the coding challenge is the kitten eyes or chrome extension kit narrator kitten extension kitten Chrome extension chrome kitten at up I know what to call it somebody give me a name we'll put it in the first comment I'll pin it but I'm going to make a Chrome extension that replaces any image on any website that you're on with an image of a kitten I'm gonna do in a really simple basic way I made earlier today a bunch of tutorials about Chrome extensions I might suggest you go and watch those for more depth but I'm gonna still do this from no code at all the only thing I'm going to start with is these five kitten images and they all come from unsplash.com which is a website with free images these are the images that I have randomly picked for this coding challenge and as a challenge to you after I make this if it's successful you might think about making a version of this that pulls the images dynamically from unsplash or uses something besides kittens or tries to replace the image with the most appropriate kitten that matches what the image originally was I don't know use your imagination but let's get started so the first thing I need for a Chrome extension is what it is a file called manifest.json okay so what do I need in the manifest.json I need to say I need to have all the configuration stuff for my Chrome extension manifest version 2 which is the version of Chrome extension whatever that I'm making someday I'm gonna look up what this means but I think it used to put one but now you have to use two maybe someday you'll put three I don't know could you imagine a world in a world where the manifest version is number seven then I'm going to X kittens Gen X kitten shouldn't thank you that's a good good one okay Chrome kittens okay now I'm gonna say named X extension and then X kit tension I think like that X kitten should Chrome X kitten chin that's is not so great but we'll keep this for right now Bo version everybody knows what version this is right now say it with me 1 2 3 did you say point 1 yeah that's what I said I don't know whatever doesn't matter and I think I should put that in quotes who knows and then I'm making a Content script so what I need to do is have a Content script and it's content scripts cuz I could have multiple ones so I'm just gonna have one if you don't know what a Content script is you could go look at my previous tutorials which I will link to in the description and my content script this is going to be for see how do I do this Isis hard to talk and think and type at the same time all URLs so I want you might someday want to make a Chrome extension that only replaces kittens on particular websites only place images with kittens but I'm gonna do it for all URLs and then I need to have a JavaScript file where I'm gonna have all my code I think I say J s and then I could have multiple JavaScript files but I'm just gonna have one I'm gonna call it content J yes although you know what no I'm not no no I'm kidding getting done is okay now here's the thing let's just first make sure this works I got to deal with the images that's one thing I didn't do in my tutorials I probably got some syntax wrong here cuz I never get it right but I'm at least going to now make a new file which is called kitten J s and I'm going to just in that say console dot log kittens of the world unite as one okay so I will east now I'm gonna have a Chrome extension that when I go to any web page I will see this in the JavaScript console that's our first step and again if you want some of the details about how this is working go back and watch my I'm gonna stop saying that so now how do I install this I've got to be in Chrome at the URL Chrome colon slash slash extensions I've got to have developer mode enabled and then I can say load unpacked extension I can go and find wherever that was was on my desktop under Chrome extension zero three kittens so I'm going to select that and I didn't get any errors so if I had made a syntax error in manifest.json some stuff would show up here and then it's enabled I'm going to just turn off this other extension that's final leave it on and now I'm going to go to a web page like what's a good web page where we want to replace all the images with kittens I'm afraid to go to a news website although it will be nice to replace everything on the news website with images of kittens let me just go to go to the ITP website for right now just to just to see okay whoa oh this is something else this has nothing to do with me and we can see that this extension is working because kittens of the world unite as one there we go so my extension is working on the next thing I need to do is I need to figure out from my content script I need to look at the content and find all of the image elements on the page now there's probably a variety of ways that you can have an image but let's actually just play with this here for a second let's use the console to kind of like mess around to understand what we want to do so if I say images equal document get elements by tag name IMG hmm Oh images right so we got a bunch there's a whole bunch of images so that's good and we can see images has a property called source I believe somewhere in your boy there's a lot of stuff yes it's an attribute source and you can see that's the source of the image some are at Tisch gift preset square JPEG so what I want to do is look at all these images find that source property and replace what's in there with a URL to an image of a kitten now I'm not just any kitten the kittens that I happen to have as part of my extension of course they could be URLs to other places but I have these particular now I know I could probably load these in like an array but what I'm gonna do is let me just first let's this is gonna there's gonna be a little tedious go make yourself a cup of tea or something for a second so I'm just gonna paste the names of all these kitten images real quick into my I didn't want to change the names because I unsplash I don't have to you do not require to give credit but I can't go to the right place but I would like to give credit these are that I assume presume the name of the photographers maybe this is their kittens I think it so I have five five will be pretty good I think one of these days I'm gonna alt tab to the right thing there we go now I'm gonna grab this one there we go okay so now I've got the images here's the thing files inside just like in manifest.json I have to say ah I want this javascript file to be part of my content script I always also have to say I don't remember somebody in the chat correct me it's something like web accessible resources is that right somebody will correct me alright just I have the file names here thank you very much that would have been more efficient breaking news somebody I'll have that sound effect okay so I think what I can do now is just let's do something fancy I'm gonna do something fancy just for fun for no reason I'm gonna copy this into here I'm gonna do the fine I'm gonna get rid of all those slash slash space then I'm gonna do I'm gonna use a little regular expression and I'll show you what we do I'm going to do beginning of a line dot star question mark end of line this is a regular expression to find all of these things then I'm going to replace and I just want to do it I'm gonna replace it with and do I need to capture I need to capture this if you don't know about regular expressions might I refer you to my regular expressions tutorial that would pop up right here except there's no way for me to do that unless some magic postproduction thing happens I'm gonna replace this is really ridiculous that I'm doing this with quote dollar sign one end quote comma replace off boom now I have an around now I have it formatted to go into an array oh it needs to be double quotes for JSON that's fine uh so find a single quote replace it with a double quote there we go so now I have the web accessible resources and maybe somebody has told me I am being told breaking that is correct alright so web accessible resources so now these images are available to me as part of my Chrome extension so what I want to do if somebody by the way is watching this video could find me a good just like maybe in the in the patron group in the slack channel maybe you could post some links to some web sites that might be good to run this on that have nothing to upsetting or embarrassing on them it's all order I know with the internet familyfriendly coding show here everybody so now what I want to do is I lost my train of thought that's really ok so now what I want to do right so what was I doing over here let's get this I want to do this in the Chrome extension itself now remember a content script and let's say let's say file names and I can get this from that you know there's probably an automatic way of doing this but I am very prone to doing things in silly manual ways so I have an array now with all those file names and I'm going to ask for all of the image elements then then I'm going I know I'm using double quotes and single quotes in the same page don't everybody freak out all at once let's live with it let's come on we can do it double quotes and single quotes can be in the same page and everything will be ok all right now let me say my new favorite thing which is this fancy for loop thing that I learned about recently for image element of images I want to say I'm just gonna actually console.log image element SRC let's just do that so I just want to see the Chrome extension on any page that I'm on give me a list of and I'm just going to check the shot here for a second web accessible resources should be on the top level of the manifest also put them on a folder and just do so these are great suggestions from the chat thank you so let's make some improvements here silly me so first of all this is not necessarily specific to the content script this is a toplevel thing for the manifest thank you for that correction and there's no reason for me to do this when I can just say star jpg so this should be better so any images and by the way it would make more sense as I'm being told to make a folder called kittens and that way this is cleaning this up a little bit all of this goes in here then I can say kittens slash so how am i doing think I'm in better shape let's reload the Chrome extension and see what happens so I'm going to go back to here and hit reload right anytime you make changes in your chromic skit insertion hit reload hit refresh and I could see this is some nonsense that's happening nothing to it and I can see look here are all of the images that are on this page now the question is to do the there's gonna be a sizing thing that we have to deal with at some point but I'm not gonna worry about that okay example page image J nih.gov slash Doc's okay hold on let me find this you really need a good way of getting stuff from the slack chat into here can you give me a Google search Ruben to find that page okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to I think we're kind of so all I actually need to do is I want to say let R equal math.random times images o filenames dot length math.floor so I don't have not in p5 so I've got to do this with native JavaScript I want to get a random index and I could do this all sorts of other fancier ways I'm sure but I want to get a random math dot random gives me a number between 0 & 1 multiply it by the length of the array take off the decimal place and if I have 10 images getting a number randomly in 0 through 9 and then I want to say let source equal file names are and then I also need to do let URL so here's the thing I can't just say image alt equals image alt dot source equals source so here's the thing about a Chrome extension these files like where do they live they're part of the Chrome extension the source the source attribute of an image element on a web page has to point to a actual valid path and those chrome extension paths I live probably they're like a weird thing that we don't know it is fortunately for us the Chrome extension API so let's actually try to look up where this is Chrome extension Chrome extension Chrome what do I Chrome extension get URL image or something so I want to find it in the documentation ah extension dot get URL so this is what I want I want to say browser is this right I thought it was chrome dot extension oh is this like am I in the hah oh this is like a generic thing even higher level than this is just like a browser interestingly enough a lot of the stuff that's part of Chrome extensions while part of the chrome API is modeled off of this more generic somebody will know more about this than I do okay so I'm looking for this in chrome Chrome extension I just want to find the page get URL here we go this is what I'm looking for this is the API this is what I want so this is the documentation page on include some of these links in the video this is a Chrome extension this is part of the API and I won't get URL get URL gives you the URL of a path that's part of your Chrome extension so I should be able to say equals Chrome extension dot get URL source and let's call this file source is sort of the wrong thing and just because I'm curious let's actually do this let's put it in a variable and then set that to URL and I just want a console log that URL so here we go I think we're actually pretty good I think this is done we just need to find some better web pages to run this on oh I need to reload the Chrome extension I didn't work at all let's look at the consult mmm Dan nine load Oh wet resources must be listed in the web accessible resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension yeah yeah web accessible resources hmm oh wait a sec oh no oh oh I know what the problem is I put everything in a kitten's folder and then in my extension I forgot to say they all have to have the kittens folder prefix okay here we go again here we go again I have to reload let's find a better web page how about using lazy doubt house okay what's that is Z dot house hey what is this it's all kittens what's going on what kind of internet is happening here I'm I'm gonna be bold let's mess with let's let's just be bold and go to the New York Times and let's see if we can replace the image is on the New York Times with kittens Oh kittens kittens kittens kittens all right so we can see here there's some work to be done here oops let's just let's browse the web now Google Books let's let's just enjoy browsing the web NASA seems like a website that I might enjoy going to look at oh look and look at this NASA website what's happening in NASA these days but actually I like the fact that when I google image search for something like puppies it's all kittens look kittens oh boy kittens puppies but that's a kitten so even if I search for unicorns it's all kittens and I could go to the unicorn Wikipedia page and it is a so interestingly enough not everything is getting replaced so I probably should finish this video and be done with this yeah something's I'm being point out that the New York Times loads a lot of oh that was my extension working so that was my extent I went to hold on a second lazy what okay what is this website this is actually working I thought you guys were trolling me and giving you madeup website really quickly I had all the kitten images in it oh I'm losing my mind here so I'm going to disable the extension just for a second I should make it tie it to a button lazy house okay this is something about home automation and stuff you can do and now with the extension work I get it I get it I get it so interestingly enough not all images get replaced let's so near times for example I bet you load some images through JavaScript in a different way let's inspect this element here it is I don't know why so I'd have to investigate there's this looks like source it's like a thumbnail that it's actually looking at maybe over the image so there's all sorts of complexity with how different web pages work so we'd have to have to Wikipedia is not a good example of this let me think of one more let's just go to a Schiffman net there we go this is nice so thank you that you've got to definitely do quite a bit more to make this the robust kitten eyes there her Chrome extension that I always hoped it would be so let me give you some exercises if you want to follow along with this coding challenge think about other things that you might replace on a webpage how you might replace text how you might replace images how you might play sounds there's all sorts of possibilities there find a different set of images maybe you could actually use the unsplash api to dynamically pull different images I will post the code to this you will find a link to the github repository where this code exists in the video's description and in the next coding challenge I'm gonna do something very similar but instead of replacing with images may be able to leave the kitten thing here I'm gonna make a Chrome extension that I can draw over the page thank you for watching I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat now replace ads it uses the source set attribute right I could probably I'm sorry I'm reading the chat yes source set attribute but I've seen this question many times do I listen to Lady Gaga or Daft Punk I have listened to that music before I have heard it into my ears yes can it replace ads probably yes but you'd have to be more thoughtful about you'd have to be more thoughtful about your I mean I haven't done very much with this coat here like this is kind of all I got right it's not a lot of code alright so I heard a noise it's been scratching at the door maybe it's the cat army of kittens alright so I'm it's 615 I'm gonna do one more coding challenge and then I've got to go I'm gonna drink some water there's a spider on my head will you ever make a coding challenge on tictactoe with the minimax algorithm that sounds like a fun idea okay you guys are asking me so many good questions but I I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to questions later because let's let's move on to the next coding challenge maybe this one I'll start with the manifest.json file already and I'm gonna call this sketch j/s this is gonna be oh for sketch and we get rid of kittens and I'm also gonna get I want to get the p5 libraries let's go to let's leave this extension I should have been using github the whole time that would have been a good thing I don't know why I can't let's go to the p5 libraries oops I'm gonna leave this extension on always no releases what am I doing here code Rose releases how bout releases let's get p5.js and just in case we need Dom so what I'm going to do here now is copy these library files and put them in Chrome extensions sketch and I'm going to p5 sketch extension p5 sketch and ok so I'm gonna start this coding challenge with this manifest js5 and do everything else from scratch oh use let in for of loop otherwise you will create a global variable that oh thank you that's a good correction so I'm not going to go back and redo the video but at least in the code that I publish I will have that corrected thank you uhoh I totally did that wrong Thank You Alka so I added the wrong file so I can fix this no problem yeah put this here so I think I'm good now let me open this manifest.json and this sketch oh this should be empty okay here we go everybody the cold was a bad one and it really went away but there's still remnants Chrome extension coding challenge number two I'm also going in this coding challenge I just made one that replaces images with kittens if you didn't watch that already you can also check out the Chrome extension tutorial playlist for a lot of background information but in this video I'm going to attempt to make a Chrome extension for any web page that you're on like the p5.js library page that I can like doodle over it so and I'm going to do over it with a p5.js sketch so how do I do that so one thing is so I I did already one of the first things you need for a Chrome extension if you've watched me in other videos you already know this is a manifesto JSON file that is the configuration and all the information about your Chrome extension that you need so this being just a Content script I want it to work on any URL and more likely I probably want to do something where I press a button and then I can draw on maybe I get a pop up with an interface to pick the color but we'll get to all that later right now I'm just gonna do the simple thing that for any web page I could suddenly draw on it so I'm gonna put all the code for drawing in sketch j/s and just to show you what I mean like a simple p5 sketch would be something like this function set up function draw I'm going to say create canvas I'm just gonna just give some arbitrary size right now I'm gonna say I'm gonna like absolute position it so that it is over and I'm gonna say clear so I don't think I need to say clear I think by definition is cleared so that it's a transparent canvas and actually I'm not even gonna do that I just want to see the can on the page so I'm gonna say background zero so here's the thing now let me try running this extension let's see what happens so I put I I have this manifesto JSON I have this sketch let's load the extension let me close a bunch of this extra stuff if you're wondering why everything appears to be an image of a kitten it's because I'm still running my other Chrome extension so I'm going to I'm gonna keep that enabled I'm gonna load a new extension called because I can't turn off the kitten the one sketch and so again you need to be at Chrome slash lash extensions and you need to have developer mode on and you can find out more about this in some of my other tutorial videos p5 sketch version 0.1 is now running so let I'd probably should turn this one off but let's go to this web page now that I want to draw on open up the chrome console I'm gonna let this give myself some more space here I'm going to so actually it's time I've got to disable this because this extension is spinning out a lot of stuff in the console and I want to just look at this stuff for the p5 sketch so I don't see anything like the extensions I think nothing going on here well let me at least say console dot log sketch started sketch looping I know why this isn't working by the way and being I'm kind of like setting the stage here for what I want to talk about and then I'm gonna say console dot log its sketch blah okay so let's reload this extension reload and I'm hit refresh sketch blah but no set up a no draw so here's the thing well a couple things number one is I didn't include the p5 libraries I mean I have them in there I have sketched out yes p5 dot JSP five dong yes so I've got to at least in manifesto JSON reference those so let's say I'm a not p5 d'en bas and this be double quotes so I want all of these JavaScript libraries so this is by the way how you can reference another JavaScript library in a Chrome extension and I think there's a way to do this with a URL path I'll have to come back to that another time so I can do that let's reload the extension I'm gonna laugh if this works which it really shouldn't hit refresh ah there we go Oh Sita whoa oh my goodness it sort of did something well it actually ran set up whoa weird so interestingly enough I'm kind of intrigued by this because there's a thing that I was about to explain which is that I have to use something called instance mode opening up so I'm gonna just let's just just humor me for a second I'm gonna take out this and let's just see what happens now for some reason the Dom library didn't seem to work but the other stuff too which is weird let's run this again whoo weird oh it's there I'm shocked I'm shocked it just worked that's so weird but the Dom library stuff didn't work why does the order matter oh maybe it's just that interesting something changed since the last time I tried this this is gonna be much easier than I thought I thought I was gonna have to explain instance mode let's try putting the Dom library gigas they order late load in these orders let's try this again reload so now let me let's try sorry let's go back to sketch and let's let's use the Dom library now and once again reload again and it refresh yeah look at that huh well ladeeda so amazingly I can actually just put a p5 sketch in the content script maybe this is a bad idea for some reason it when I made an example for this last year I had to use something called instance mode and if you want instance mode is I will include a link to a video tutorial about that I thought p5 does this thing where it before to be beginnerfriendly it allows you to declare set up and draw in the sort of global world of JavaScript and for whatever reason I thought that that didn't work in a Content script and you had to kind of namespace things in the instance mode way these terms might not mean anything to you but you can watch that instance mode video if you're kind of wondering about that let's keep going so let's let's let's let's finish this off so I'm gonna take this out I'm gonna put clear in draw I'm gonna say a line from Mouse X Mouse Y to previous Mouse X previous Mouse Y and I'm gonna say stroke zero stroke wait for and what else do I want to do ah so this is the other thing I probably want to make the canvas fill the page so right now I'll just use window width and window height so let's go back now and reload hey where's my canvas let's see do I have an error sketch blah now alright let's let's see hmm so how do I D bug this mmhmm let's not put let's put a background here what a pain to reload can I just I can just do a refresh no okay refresh okay that worked ooh and it's there oh oh oh weird okay hold on a second so why didn't that work first of all I wanted this I want to say if mouse is pressed hmm so it's working that canvas is there it's interesting how its underneath some things and I wonder if that's kind of the issue so let's reload reload again somebody in the chat I'm sure it's telling me exactly what I'm doing wrong and then oh well it works I don't know why it work before okay so I can do things like I love p5 and I'm going to make a little hard so this is this is just a very beginning stuff here now here's the thing there's some some flaws here that I can give you I'm gonna scroll and I can't I can't draw down here anymore cuz that canvas is actually just a very is I said window width and window height so I could do something like get the body height I think of the whole page to make the canvas over the whole page but it could be a really long page another thing I could do is like move the canvas as I scroll I couldn't like just do the body height but I could also deal with zindex would be important which is a CSS property that allows me to put things book under and in front of so there's all sorts of like cleanup stuff I could do here but this is the basic idea now one of the things that I want to do is I also could make this have a popup where I could click a button here and have an interface to change the color and it would be gonna be interesting to think about what if this is something that then gets saved to I don't know local storage which is kind of like a database that's sitting inside of chrome itself or your drawings get saved to some server somewhere so when you come back to the web page your drawings are there you can share them with somebody else that's browsing the same webpage so many possible possibilities there's actually a project called shift space which is by Dan Pfeiffer and mu Shan shift space who Shawn Dan byebye this is a project from it and development ended up in 2011 but I encourage do you encourage you to check it out it's really interesting it was started by Dan Pfeiffer and Michaan's there Aviv so that's um which was a way that you could annotate web pages collaboratively and if you're browsing the same page as someone who's a friend of yours you're gonna see those annotations at the same time okay I'm looking there's positionfixed which would which would anchor it to the browser rather than scroll with the page but maybe you want your a anyway there's so many possibilities I'm gonna stop I'm gonna stop here this is what you can now do by putting a peu 5 sketch overlay now I will make one thing clear I can no longer click on these links because of the way that I've sort of like put this canvas over and what's happening with focus and mouse press so that's probably something you're gonna want to think about I wonder if I could set the zindex to further back it might then not get it might not get the mouse events then which is kind of an issue let's see so let's reload and let's run okay so I'm still able to draw but you can see the the links now work oh amazingly great why would it the canvas is still there from page to page so that's an interesting thing to know when you've gone to a new page or was that oh maybe that was not that was not that actually wasn't going to a new page that was like a refresh in the same page cuz right I'm I'm staying on the same page I'm just anyway there's so much can you mean could this video just have ended five minutes ago please thank you for watching I have made a Chrome extension and I hope to see that you did something creative with us with adding p5 GS to your Chrome extensions and I will be back again in the future with more tutorials in particular about popups more about messaging and more about using an API with a Chrome extension so many possibilities okay thanks for watching point your events none pointer events breaking news all right hold on hold on timeout let's let's pretend we can go back and redo the end of this video not to me maybe you can like I don't know because I feel like I was so scatterbrained where was I where I was drawing on the page so let's see so there's let me try to learn some of this stuff see style pointer events oh that's what I want none oh look at that I'm trying to understand why some stuff because I am going to a different page right going to this particular issue page and yet that remains there interesting all right let me go look first of all this is kind of messed up so I'm not to do your magic whatever you do is gonna be okay with me but I'm going to I'm gonna I'm gonna add this in but as if okay so one of the things whoops oh I have to relook oh wait a second I didn't reload the extension it's then Z X okay hold on let me reload the extension to what it was why did I think you had to use instance mode so one of the things you might notice here whoops one of the things you might notice here is that I've really messed with your ability to click on links because the canvas is kind of stole is overlaid on top of everything and it's stolen it's stolen a focus from all of the underlying stuff so thank you to me I am so me and others in the chat who have given me some good advice about this there are some CSS properties that I can try to add so since I've got the p5 library loaded anyway I could say see that style what was it pointer in the pointer events like this is a CSS property that will say like hey I don't want the canvas to receive any pointer events so those pointer events will pass through underneath now this might not totally work hit refresh so now I'm sort of able to get it but like it's working but and you can see yeah so this is kind of and interestingly you can see that the the canvas is still there that's because github is actually not going to new pages it's kind of refreshing within the same page but if I really went to a new page which like me went to the github home page yeah it's gonna go away so now this seems to be working fine it's doing some weird stuff with me like highlighting as I'm dragging the mouse around but I'd you know there might be some things I might need to also a property that I might need to work with is the Z index Z index is a CSS property that keeps track of things layered um so there's so many possible things I can start adding CSS wise to this but I think I'm gonna stop here so this is the basic idea I'm giving you a challenge to do afterwards number one is be more creative about what you overlay on top of the canvas this is just me drawing a line think be more thoughtful about how you handle the interaction maybe with some CSS and Z index as well as think about the page how you're gonna handle the full page let me figure out this body thing I'm pretty sure I can say client body height or something right somebody must know this sorry okay wait Papa Papa papa Bubba so hold on and that's you maybe let's make let me just look this up talk about everybody I don't like to do this but I'm going to the way that I did this I'm gonna look at my example from last year Chrome extensions it's funny still going p5 sketch this is what I did see look I did it with instance mode because I thought it wouldn't work document that body client height yeah that's what is document that body client height okay doc you Minister body client okay so I can get the height of the page by saying a document dot body dot client height I think and then so I could actually put that in here and so now if I reload the extension and I go back to github.com ooh look how slow this is now I mean I can draw all the way down here and I can keep scrolling but that's because I have this huge large canvas that's covering the entire thing so I probably have to be more thoughtful maybe I just like move it around or I have multiple canvases or I give it a sort of maximum amount cause it could be a really long webpage but you can see that's how I can actually get the full bodies height in pixels and I can draw all over the entire thing okay anything else that I want to add to this SVG would be better that makes a lot of sense outcomes that canvas is kind of a problem and that I'm and an SVG wouldn't have the same problem so I could do something like that and I think that's it so I look forward to seeing what kind of creative possibilities you make from this I will mention I think I kind of had this like crazy conversation about instance mode versus not instance mode I suspect that there could be some issues with me declaring global variables in the content script and if I'm using let I should be okay because let scopes thing in a different way but I you don't want to in theory there could be some conflicts between the JavaScript you're writing in your Chrome extension and the JavaScript that's executing on a page so maybe that's one of the reasons why at one point I did instance mode I'll just show you what that looks like because it happens to be on this page under these examples Chrome extensions and with p5 sketch so this is what instance mode looks like it's a way of having all the p5 stuff happen within namespace you always have to say p5 dot this or p5 dot this that way you're not running into there's only one kind of variable that's oh it's that's global this is so fun there's only one variable it's like a smart board except it's not very smart ok do it anymore of course it doesn't work now there's only one variable that's global ah I shouldn't make videos late in the evening when I really should just be gone so I hopefully this wasn't like enormous incredibly long with me rambling I hope you got something out of this and I look forward to seeing what kind of creative Chrome extensions you all make thanks for watching okay body dot scroll height could be used turnoff text selection that's another thing I could do as we're all so much smarter than me so anyway how's that I feel like that video was kind of a disaster but I think it can be made into something user select none okay fine hold on let's let's let's let's go from I got an idea sorry my tía let's go from here when I added that pointer event and I was on like what's it like six thirty seven we're fine oh I think I'm crashing it because of like how long this is so let's go back to I did it on a disease sorry it's on here you know it also the power is not plugged into this computer sometimes document.onselectstart function return false is that better then user select none on the body or that's the same thing we'll try a different thing we'll try some oh I have to do it in JavaScript so I could I could include CSS you can't include fields oh okay hold on reload I appreciate that you guys like the disasters they're an error sketch blah did I put Z and X in there or something it's funny how it's not working all of a sudden of course the camera goes off no sound document that body that style that user select equals none yeah thank you call no loop on Mouse released and loop on Mouse of how these are such good ideas but why isn't it even working at all why did it stop working let's go to like whoa that's something else this is so weird oh there we go I wonder if there's a loading issue and that's why you actually need instance mode I wonder if it worked by accident right good things not be loading in the right or because here's the thing you can't guarantee that all you can guarantee that the page has loaded but I don't think you can guarantee that all of these have loaded I think I just got lucky I know I used constraint right don't you think I think maybe you have to use instance mode because right it's only working like a random percentage of the time right of course now it's just working consistently right p5 didn't load it floating when I have the console open but not without it why is that right consoles not open who consoles open it loaded looks I think p5 actually hooks into the document load which has already happened so it's it's there it's called before you script or not is probably random yeah if it so don't you think that I need to do the instance mode thing that I've just got lucky all right where does this video is gonna keep on going I just want to hear from people I'm gonna wait and drink some water here so I think I'm gonna rewrite this with instance mode it might because I have it stored in my cache or something as I use p5 a lot well I really need this breaking news sound effect you could also totally hack in a second load of yes so that's the thing I mean I am swimming is saying you could also a hack in like I could write some JavaScript code to like load the p5 library and then but I think it's better for me just use instance mode so I think that's what I'm gonna do okay so that's yeah when you watch this first I am sorry second I think we're going to go from again I trust your judgement more than my own but I think we're going to go from where I add this I think we can leave everything up to and a lot of other stuff get cut but where I add this and I'm going to now realize that it's not working every time and I'm gonna realize that I actually really did need instance mode after all and I'm gonna add instance mode and what's gonna fix it then I'm gonna add Alka is again going to then because the chat in the slash settlement way past its gonna tell P what code to add again for the user select thing and then that's gonna be good alright here we go coding power form of p5 debugging person ok it's all my guy I really got to leave by 7 so here we go all right here we go I kind of want to put the kittens back do you think I can put the kittens back hello there was a weird edit point there but I discovered something while making this video tutorial look how nicely this is working this is me on my Schiffman net website and i refresh the page and it works nicely it draws I close the console i refresh the page again it's not working anymore Oh weird it's sort of worth so that's not working out no that it's working so here's the thing I think I got lucky remember earlier in this video I started rambling about this thing called instance mode well I think I got lucky in that V ok so a Content script by definition executes after the page has loaded but the page itself is not does not include the p5 library and the p5 these these I don't think the order of this really guarantees you much of anything could it could I put sketched a s first let's just try this I really don't think so I think p5 what it's does what the p5 library does is it looks for your setup and draw function and it that that Sketchup JS file might not really like the content script might not be available when it's like loading the p5 library and then something not finding the set of a draw function and everything so I might need to actually explicitly say like hey hello p5 here's my set up a draw function which I'm gonna show you how to do in a minute using something on instance mode unless this fixes the problem but really do you really think they load in that order in some way that's logical but that doesn't make any sense cuz sketch would have to come after I can't load it first let's try so I'm gonna go to reload this extension reload I'm gonna hit refresh huh not working oh now it's not working at all oh now it is working it's the same thing I think I'm getting lucky sometimes and not because maybe I have things cache things over to ram or somebody much smarter than me we'll know detective but I I think I really want this to work I am going to have to I'm going to have to use instance mode and I'm getting some other Oh me I am Sania Singh I can all global in it to make p5 checkin again so let's try that so I kind of want to show you instance MA but that's sort of interesting you mean I could just say like here global in it which is like I could do something like this which is like a secret function as part of p5 really in the weeds here in this videotutorial supposed to be like why is this video why is this particular video 7 hours long that didn't work oh now it worked p5 global in it okay I'm I'm going to what about my eyebrows I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and do what I think will work which is instance mode so what is instance mode I have a video tutorial about it it's a way of name spacing everything in your p5 sketch and kind of wrapping it into a function so what I'm going to do is I think I have to say let's look let's let's go to let's go to the p5.js wiki because you might as well know about this page which has a little tutorial about instance mode and by the way sometimes oh I'm like killing okay first of all let's disable the extension and let's go to instance mode it's probably under I because I start global and instance mode so this webpage is going to explain this is global mode everything living in the global namespace this is instance mode so I am going to just copy this over and I'm gonna I'm gonna probably change this to using let instead of R and that sort of thing but I'm basically going to take this out and I'm gonna put my code in there whoops and what I'm gonna do is put it in here and I'm gonna say how did that work I need to say sketch dot setup you function I'll try to explain a little bit more about this and sketch dot draw equals function and then everything that's a p5 function I just say sketch dot so sketched out create canvas sketched out clear sketched out stroke sketched out scrote stroke weight if sketch dot mouse is pressed sketched out Mouse X sketched out mouse Y sketched out P Mouse X sketched out P Mouse Y and then this is fine so this is just now this is actually instantiating the p5 sketch I'm getting some more these are injected in the order they appear in the array so from breaking news from the Chrome extension API this order actually does matter they are injected in into the script in the order that they're in the array so let's do this I think sketch touches should be last and now what I'm going to do is this should be exactly the same now this is instance mode it's the same exact sketch but I've so let me explain a little bit what's going on here what I'm doing is I'm saying I want to make I want to make a new P 5 thing and so normally this happens automatically the p5 library starts to make its own P 5 thing by looking for your global setup and draw but here I'm saying I'm gonna make this wrapper function and it's going to have setup attached to it and draw attached to it and this whole thing is the thing you can make the p5 sketch from a bit more to it that you can read the wiki page but that's the basic idea let's see if this works I'm sure I made some mistakes Oh window with is that's a p5 variable so sketch that window with I think I'm gonna have to say all right let's see what happens here so one thing I want to do by the way is I'm gonna just change this to I want to change this to sketch dot window height again just so it's just so it's only covering part of the page because that really just slow it down if it tries to make a sketch a canvas the size of the whole body alright so let's now reload the extension enable the extension reload the extension and refresh the page okay and hold on refresh the page uncaught reference this line is not defined who sketched outline thank you very much so it's very easy it's kind of like forgetting this dot I kinda have sketched out for everything that's p5 so I'm going to reload the extension again I'm gonna come back here hit refresh there we go this works hit refresh again it works I'm gonna get rid of the console ah so now it's working consistently no matter what I do let's make one more thing a little nicer about this notice how I keep selecting the text box in it while I'm drawing out cuz the chat gave me some code to do that I see it now I can change I can affect the CSS of the entire body and set the user select property to none so user selects the property meaning making something available to be selected and so what I'm gonna do here in setup is I'm going to say document dot body dot style right dot user select equals none so and I kinda I don't know why but I have this like habit of doing this because a lot of the CSS properties are not valid keywords that you can just say dot like background color you wouldn't be able to say style dot background color but so you can user selected work cuz it's like a valid variable name so let's try adding this see if that's in the right place I'm going to reload the extension refresh and now there I am drawing it's not selecting the text I can still click on the links I can go over here I can draw on here and then I can also because I can also enable my chrome kitten extension I can go to this web page and I can draw oh I can draw books I can draw I can draw on the kittens yay I love you kitten oh you're a star kitten rainbow okay Oh are you still watching this video cuz I'm just gonna be here doodling on this webpage for a while okay so I'm gonna leave it here I did show you how you could actually create the canvas to be taller with document.body that client height one other suggestion from Austin and the chat said I could start with no loop and only render when I'm actually drawing that'll actually really help with performance as well of course there was another suggestion being like well if you just used SVG's you don't have this giant canvas that's probably a much smarter idea but the point is I'm showing you how you can have a canvas overlay with p5 and load P 5 P 5 library and by the way you can load other libraries the same exact way whether you want to use jQuery or a 3 J s or anything this is the same exact way so I hope you enjoyed this coding challenge about creating a canvas overlay p5 sketch in a Chrome extension content script if you made it through this whole video MA thank you something good bye where did I forget sketch dot did I did I I finished that video finally didn't I I see lots of facepalm emojis keep going I am learning I see there's an interesting there's a discussion maybe about the Chrome extension it's it scrolled past me so I can't see it I see me I am to be an echo or discussing something I'm happy to engage in that discussion kebab case in the bracket notation wouldn't work Oh sketch dot on line but I fixed it okay great can I go home now so this by the way I know how I like this is to live streams in one day I'm glad I was able to do this especially cuz I missed last week I haven't gotten I would say I've only gotten like halfway at most through the Chrome extension stuff let me look at my examples actually so I'm gonna come let's first of all let me turn off these Chrome extensions well I'm gonna leave the kitten went on obviously let's go to github.com slash Schiffman rainbow code so I am going to whoops oh no coding train let's look at the calendar here readme edit I don't know who I'm logged in as I think I might be logged in as myself so today was Chrome extensions next week we need to continue Chrome extensions so what do I need to do I need to do popup popup with messages I need to do what else I want to do what's the thing called where you tab override I mean I think I'll skip the omnibox thing I mean it's there I could get to it someday but you know omnibox probably should skip I definitely want to do WebGL I got a bump Alexa skill so I don't know what I'm gonna get to work to vac I'm in a bump so I think this is what I think I should continue the Chrome extension stuff next Friday and maybe look at WebGL see if I can get to some of these I'm open to your suggestions but that's kind of my plan oh I turn alright alright alright let's put it on let's put it on the agenda it's not on the agenda anywhere in here oh it's here so we have some extra bull bull we'll put a bayesian ticket by the way as you can see this document oh you can't even see what I'm doing I apologize you can all pull request this document to try to get me to change my schedule oh but maybe there's actually a helpful way you can make this better so I will be back next Friday it definitely won't be in the morning next Friday I know I have an appointment and some other stuff so I don't know if this is the exact time but this will be it'll be something like this so let me commit this changes so I kind of remember and pull requests here okay Oh somebody Thank You Lucas could be a little added awesome amazing look at this wonderful thank you I need a like a really great like thank you you win Lucas for your contribution you win my undying gratitude thank you and I apologize if I've got your name wrong Lucca kabil sorry I said Lucas the github name is Luca qabil Thank You Luca good night everybody this has been the coding train with your host me i term yes Austin I turn will be our new new Chrome extensions joke I appreciate you enjoying that Ricardo asks I'm gonna do a couple questions here from the chat before I go do people recognize you on the streets and ask for selfies no if I go to like when I went the processing day and there are lots of people there who came because they know frosting and watch videos people recognize me or they just said hi to me and maybe I took a couple of pictures but I you know I've have a pretty low profile nobody's the record axis behind the street check Twitter know what the answer is always in doubt don't check Twitter Twitter is kind of a really awful place all this 280 characters nonsense I can say hello to shy L I am 44 years old do we have any plans that come to the UK for any reason I would really love to come to the UK I was talking about this earlier today I did live in London in 2015 for about 8 months and had a wonderful time there visited all over the place around the UK and went up to Scotland what to Cornwall I never made it over to Ireland and I had lovely time there so I hope to yes I hope to be back sometime alright what is the best video for me to watch I don't know you're gonna I think that chat should help you with that question let me I haven't done the little goodbye song in a while Oh fiftyone thousand three hundred and forty eighty four thousand seven hundred forty eight seventy one thousand five hundred sixtyeight fifty three thousand four hundred eighty three I really need a system like I could get through this whole book if I actually I look I hear there's a thing called a bookmarklet do you think there's a bookmarklet for this I'm gonna use this it's the ITP winter show postcard today is the day I'm gonna start from the first page of random numbers that is maybe I should actually just read the whole thing I should start with the forward I'm gonna read everything in this book and then someday somebody will splice it all together as one video okay let's make an agreement on that well how long do you think when will this be done I have no idea but every time I come on or I have a guest I'll do a little more and eventually the whole thing will be available the audio book for a million random digits with video accompaniments maybe I shouldn't play the lullaby because that's gonna make it so people can't remix and do stuff with the audio later hmm so right now I won't do it with the lullaby music this by the way this is a momentous occasion I'm deciding right now that I'm gonna start from the absolute beginning of this book the cover and I'm gonna read every single word and number that's in this book hopefully before I you know we're whatever happens

order at Randwick I'm starting to think I should have skipped that page when somebody makes the full compilation that can be edited out or not so I'm gonna read right now just the forward it's kind of long actually but I'm gonna read the foreword forward the volume you are holding documents are remarkable undertaking by a group of mathematicians engineers and data processors at Rand in the 1940s and 1950s the corporation's formative years to create a very large assembly of randomly distributed numbers or digits within such an assembly if it is truly random no pattern of occurrences whatsoever as measured for example by frequency or by serial Association exists regardless of the users starting point in the array pattern lessness is in fact salt for ideal to what purpose in a recent article in the science section of the New York Times the author George Johnson explains for cryptography game playing sociological surveys and various scientific calculations people often need series of numbers that are devoid of pattern and that is a tall order generating true randomness is one of computer sciences most difficult challenges so there's a footnote reference to George Johnson connoisseurs of chaos offer a valuable product randomness through New York Times June 12 2001 given a state of randomness predictability fails in a decimal table the probability for the occurrence of the next digit is everywhere the same whatever the number selected from 0 through 9 once they are equipped with a sufficiently large sequence of random digits like the present one political poll takers for example can confidently calculate outcomes that depend on probability assumptions in the area of engineering use of the tables assemble it here assemble tear can save both time and money take the problem faced by a quality control team tasked with inspecting critical welds in an aging metal bridge instead of in effect dismantling the structure to accomplish the mission the inspectors can select a sufficiently large random sample of welds for examination a reliable surrogate for the whole bridge and proceed to measure the integrity of the complete structure or consider the case of a submarine commander who is reported to have kept the copy of the set of tables by him on patrol duty using selections from it to randomize a jinking course for purposes of evasion early in the conduct of rand research a demand arose for random numbers to be in solving problems by probability procedures known as Monte Carlo methods existing tables of such numbers were limited in size applied to ran problems they would have have to be used repeatedly thus introducing the danger of unwanted correlations the construction of a table with the capacity of the present one resulted from ingenious exploitation of punched card computational techniques then available has become a standard reference in engineering and Econometrica textbooks details of the production of the one million random digits contained in this volume are provided in the introduction several short tables draw on the expected and the actually observed frequency of occurrence of familiar poker hands together with a goodness of fit calculation an electronic roulette wheel if you will was used to yield the basic randomization the team members then applied rear and omission steps to produce the random digits of the whole modern random number generators use radioactive decay or atmospheric noise among other methods the 100,000 normal deviates cited in the title of this volume constitute a subset of random numbers whose occurrence can be plotted on a bellshaped curve Rand legend has it that this seemingly selfcontradictory mathematical expression caused the Newark Public Library to miss shell the volume in the psychology section the volume you hold was first published by the Free Press in June 1955 it had sold 500 copies by October by September 1971 the collection was in its third printing and it sold nearly 7,000 copies after a distinguished history as a standard reference it went out of print in 1989 and was placed in rands reprint series RP 295 to reach a wider audience in a more fitting form it is today being reissued as a Rand monograph report this is written by michael d rich executive vice president of rand so that's the foreword which explains how this is a reprint one of these days I'm gonna get myself a copy of an original prime know if that exists have to look on ebay and so I'm now realizing interestingly enough that yeah there's some this is a copyrighted and there might be some issues with me producing my own audiobook P without doing it slowly over time in pieces on a YouTube channel no I don't know if you're a lawyer out there heretics or if you know somebody at the rehab corporation to think I'm to get into trouble doing this please let me know but so far all I did was read the introduction which probably falls under fair use not to mention the fact that I'm promoting this book in fact if you oh I should do like an Amazon thing but if you want to get it I will include a link to the reprint on Amazon alright so thank you everybody thanks for watching thanks for tuning in thanks for being here again if you want to support the work that I'm doing you can join the patreon I always appreciate that it helps out and I hope to see you next Friday and if any of you will be at CC fest in New York though it's already sold out it's free but it's full please say hello to me I will be at CC fest dot is it rocks or NYC CC fest rocks which is apparently all about kittens thank you very much alright do I have any plans on doing a tutorial on the neat algorithms yes I do neuroevolutionary stuff the whole book is available for download for free from the rand website that's a good point good night I will be here for two and a half more minutes or I'm happy to answer any questions that I see in the chat can I get some free stickers for my classroom send me a tweet at Schiffman if I can mail you some stickers for your students I would love to do that that's a question from Peter thanks for asking good morning I guess some people are waking up it is 710 I'm gonna get home by 8 o'clock I think do I have anything planned for Christmas well I am of a certain persuasion where I do not celebrate the holiday Christmas although it does get celebrated quite a bit around me I hope to get some time to relax and spend time with family and friends and not code very much I might be getting a Nintendo switch though anyway everyone's wanting to free stickers now listen so the stickers are something that I will mail to you as part of the patron rewards it does take me quite a while if you really want the stickers the best way is to come to an event that I'm going to where I can hand you some stickers and there's also a ticker mule link you can just buy them online but they're kind of expensive so but I I'm definitely happy to send stickers to say a group of students in a public school somewhere or something as a gift but just randomly sending stickers to everybody in the world I'm not sure I can do that easily yep had Daniel gue hey is going to get some pointless recognition I am going to combine neural networks with evolutionary algorithms that is a plan of mine and or asks are we able to live without coding I mean I think so we're probably just ruining I mean this coding stuff I don't know if it's really helping that much so think about think about doing some good for the world and always ask the question is is what I'm coding should I be doing it is it actually a good idea can you please shout out my library called see creative which is a csharp version of processing so see creative as a csharp version frosting I haven't seen it a tweet me a link at Schiffman I love to take a look uh here's a question whoops I'm gonna look I'm not even looking at oh there's an oh yeah there's some amazing Amazon reviews I think of a random number book oops it's gone okay ah Peters asking I'm going to have my students recreate a coding challenge for their end of semester final project let me know where you send me get send me a tweet like where are you teaching maybe I can I have 280 characters now this is ridiculously annoying so maybe I could respond to you that way with some ideas but people from the chat write in the chat which of the coding challenges might be good I don't know if your students are in college in elementary school where they are in the world what their background is so that that kind of information would be helpful in terms of which coding challenge okay Wow mouseka Mouse Moscow Russia is watching amazed by the international audience here oh wait this was my bookmark you viewers of the coding train please help me remember maybe we can put this somewhere on the Internet I am on the contents table of contents it will put this bookmark in here but I will not be surprised if it gets moved so somebody invents a system to keep track where I am in the million random book um thank you all for watching I will see you next Friday and I don't know thank you I'm gonna stop streaming now I suppose I just don't want to leave but I should cuz I feel like I haven't wrapped up things properly like I just said this or say this other thing and I could have thought of this thing but I really just have to go what's that what guy just can't say the thing that I want to say that mix everything sum up so nicely so I will just say goodbye send me or breaking news coding train sound effects and make sure there's a copyrighted in them because otherwise YouTube will kind of go after being Monti monetize everything and there we go goodbye
