hello this might actually end up being a new playlist I'm not entirely sure but this is the first video in what hopefully at some point will be many videos about WebGL in p5 yes so first of all this video this first video I just want to talk about what WebGL is how that relates to p5.js how that relates to maybe other JavaScript libraries like you might have heard of like 3j s and kind of like how do you just get your sketch basic sketch set up to use WebGL okay so first of all where do I go for this I guess I'm just talking what is let me let me go to the whiteboard that's gonna help me organize my thoughts there is something called WebGL WebGL web obviously like the world wide web GL stands for graphics library now this term comes from another term you might have heard called OpenGL and OpenGL is an open graphics library this is a standard this is the library for doing computer graphics that exists across many different languages and environments and contexts one of the key things about OpenGL is the fact that it is hard where accelerated meaning it uses the graphics card the GPU the CPU is the central processing unit I think so the GPU is the graphics processing unit now someday I'm going to come back and talk about the GPU in a totally different context related to like machine learning that's not what I'm talking about right now the GPU is your graphics card that's been heavily engineered and optimized to deal with grids of numbers matrices of numbers pixels images any image is simply just a grid of pixels and OpenGL graphics library is a standard to work with rendering images to your computer screen via the graphics card so you might have used us you might have used p3d mode in processing that is using open jail that's actually a java environment so it uses joggle which is like java OpenGL you might have worked with open frameworks which is a c++ a creative coding library which you can write OpenGL calls directly in open frameworks in C++ etc etc I'm not gonna go down the road of all the different 3d environments and how they make use of OpenGL not WebGL is a standard for doing OpenGL in the browser and there's you can you can write raw WebGL code you could learn WebGL and you can make 3d hardware accelerated graphics things happen in the browser it's very exciting I am NOT going to teach you WebGL in the lower level WebGL on its own oh what a lot of people do if they want to do 3d in the browser well you can do WebGL directly or you could use a library that kind of sits on top of WebGL and wraps things in a friendlier way with a lot of features to like make all the WebGL stuff happen for you probably the most wellknown library for doing that is 3j s maybe I could pull up the 3j s website and show you some demos 3j s is amazing it has it's been around for a long time it's at many versions as tons of features in is really robust so if what you watching this video really care about just like I want to make the most 3d stuff ever in the browser you probably want to investigate this library p5 as you know as I maybe you know maybe you don't p5 is a beginner friendly creative coding library for JavaScript mostly focused around 2d drawing but it also has a lot of other features like there's a Dom library for manipulating HTML elements on the page you can get the webcam view there's a sound library for generating music or listening to the microphone um one of the other somewhat newish capabilities of p5.js is a WebGL renderer and kind of coming back from the history of processing one of the ideas the central ideas of processing in the beginning was the what you you could sort of flip a switch you could write all this code it renders in 2d you flip a switch to 3d and that same code works in 3d and you could start to add more stuff whereas working with something like three J s it's really a whole different way of thinking about things because 3d in the end kind of works in quite a different way so p5.js in the same way as processing the sort of goal here is can you write a p5 GS sketch and sort of just convert it into 3d and add some new functionality and that's what I want to look at in this set of videos so how do you enable WebGL in p5 it's actually very simple create canvas is the function where you specify a width and a height for a graphics context that you intend to draw in and by default that graphics context is a 2d html5 canvas if you give this create canvas function a third argument web GL suddenly this context becomes a 3d context and there are new functions that you can call I should make a list of these things things that I want to go over are 3d geometry camera stuff what's the camera ooh texture oh my goodness textures what else a material lights they're all these new in some ways your relinquish a lot of that control when you draw in 2d your you really say like this pixel this exact pixel set that exact pixel this color working in 3d often becomes boring exercise of setting up a scene and placing the camera and adding some lights you're kind of relinquishing some of that pixel by pixel control by getting an engine that can create this illusion of 3d perspective for you so this is what I want to in this video series I want to look at all of these pieces the is the overall picture so let me go back to the computer and I'm gonna see and I've got a chat going to see if there any questions come up but first I want to give credit to where credit's due so lots of people have contributed to p5.js so the Creator p5.js is Lauren McCarthy and many other people have contributed to p5.js the the WebGL library was started by Kevin see you off I believe Karen Peng did a lot of contribute contributions to it as well and most recently this summer to students whoops and went the wrong way Cate Hollenback and stal Jia Grigg both worked on overhauling the 3d rendering mode WebGL my shoe is untied so why you're reading that text right there about the amazing work that Kate and algae that I've tied my shoe so did a ton of work and so I'm just going to quickly click on these links read more from Kate here Staal jia here this is some documentation and whoops and about all the work that they did over the summer and the different features what's still missing from WebGL it is pretty new I'm sure there are bugs but I want to make sure I sort of credit this work and then the other thing I would mention here is this tutorial getting started with WebGL and p5 which is a wiki page is pretty much what I'm going to go through during this tutorial we may find some bugs I did a video on WebGL like probably a year ago which was just kind of like looking at what works what doesn't work so but but the work that Kate installed you did over the summer was tremendous and getting so many features back up and running and working so I'm excited to be a look at that with you ok let's do something really exciting just before this video ends I'm going to go to my code and I'm gonna say create kit wait oops create canvas 400 300 and I'm going to say background 51 and I'm going to say a rectangle 0 0 50 50 and then I'm going to say fill 255 0 150 and now I'm going to go look at this sketch in the browser whoa first ah I want to do let me let me let me remove the reference of the sound library so I'm not using it okay there's the sketch okay all right now now everybody stay with me stick with me I am going to add to my code I'm gonna make this sketch 3d okay not take a deep breath it's all gonna be 3d now it's gonna blow your mind making this 3d now here we go I hit refresh so one thing that's really important to mention I'm being ridiculous here is that so what I'm trying to point out to you here is that the rendering context has changed and suddenly the functionality of p5 has changed as well why do I not see the fill color here well if I haven't thought about some questions around things like materials and lights maybe I can't actually see that color without light being present to sort of illuminate the color why is this at zero zero suddenly in the center well p5 to WebGL mode considers the origin point in the center of the canvas not in the topleft so as I go through this tutorial we look at all these basic pieces and I go through geometry camera texture material lights we're gonna see how things work in 2d versus 3d what works to mix between those two modes what kind of remains exclusive to 2d or 3d ok wonderful see you in the next video maybe maybe it's ok
