Oh welcome to of this multipart flappy bird coding challenge I anticipate only at least 600 more parts to go I think this might actually be the last one so look what I've got I've got this bird it jumps it doesn't jump it fits through pipes it does what I have always dreamed it would do but I want here's the thing now I have this and what if I just by accident I'm over here and I'm like whoa whoops and I hit refresh that bird that bird that I've loved who's gone forever I will never get it back never I might be able to get another bird that's similar that does as well but I will never get that original bird back however I'm gonna that's why I'm gonna add another feature this thing so the feature that I'm going to add is save and load a particular bird okay so I what what I want to do let me let it let me let it train again so I'm gonna let sit that let this go actually the thing is when I when I tab away from the Browse hurts the browser is smart and stopped the animation from going so it's actually not continuing to train but that's fine and what I want to do actually there is a function inside of the neural network library called serialize and deserialize no I actually didn't implement these functions in a tutorial you can if you want to see how the neural network library was built I have a tenpart or something video series building the whole library but through a pull request I have returned to show you the actual pull request where the serialize and deserialize methods came in thank you engine feeder 101 who made this pull request on 3/10 which was a little while ago so if I go back to those functions you'll see that look at this JSON dot stringify this well okay so let's say I have a simple class like let's say I have a particle class class boy lots of squeaking going on here class particle and in the constructor function I set like this dot X equal to something maybe it's a random number and this dot y equal to something maybe a random number so then what gonna do next is I'm gonna write some code like this let P equals equal a new particle and what if I now say json dot stringify p what do I get well what I get is a strength raw text that is the json formatted data that is part of this particular instance of a particle object now if there's methods and functions in here those won't be included but if all I want are the sort of variables the properties of the particle what's its current velocity what's its current XY location then I'm gonna get that stuff this is going to give me a string that just looks like this X you know whatever it is 100 comma Y you know xx and curly bracket so even though the neural network is much more complex this is doing exactly the same thing it's basically saying hey all that stuff that's part of the neural network all of the values of all of these weights and things just serialize all that put it all in a big JSON file let's take a look what that actually looks like so so now what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go to my code I'm going to go to the bird code and what I'm gonna do I should go to the sketch and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say is there a mouse press I'm gonna just I'm gonna add key pressed what I'm gonna do when I add key pressed is I'm gonna say let B equal population index 0 so I'm gonna pick just one bird from the population right eventually I want to like get the best one the one that I want to save then I'm going to say and I'm gonna call this a bird then I'm gonna say let JSON equal bird dot serialize and all this is doing right I could have just right here I could just say let JSON equal json dot stringify bird so the serialize function just does this for us it calls json dot string of so I'm gonna do that then did you something totally insane actually I'm not just gonna say console dot log JSON let's just look at it in the console and I'm gonna say if key equals s so I'm only gonna do this if I've pressed the S key and I feel like there's something weird in JavaScript or p5 where I actually say that capital S but whatever let's figure that out so here we go let's go here so all these birds are going I'm now gonna press s and population is not defined because it's not called populations called birds it would be nice to call it what it's called and now I'm going to press s bird dot serialized oh right of course it's not the bird object that has the serialized function built into it it's the brain it's the bird brains bird brain so this also should have been json dot stringify bird brain okay we're getting there brain is the neural network object inside of the bird that's the only thing that I care about to save if I wanted to save more stuff I'd have to do that but right now we're good I'm gonna do this we're gonna get it fit save and look at this you can see look at that this is all the data these are all the values that are in all those arrays it's all the stuff so guess what I could do next I can say save JSON bird JSON JSON so I think this function in p5 the saved JSON function will save the data oh actually interesting we enough it's already made into a string oh this is so interesting I think I actually don't need to see so I could just say I could just say save because this is technically as well I've won waited into territory that I didn't want to wait into but this save JSON function in p5 is designed to take an object it hasn't been turned into a string and turn it into a string so you can save it whereas what I want to do is I already made the thing into the string I just want to save the string so let's actually try a few different things just for fun let's try saying save JSON bird sorry bird dot JSON and then bird so I'm not gonna bother with serializing it I think the p5 save JSON function will do that for me so let's do this then I'm gonna hit s and ooh boy we got some crazy air saved JSON so let's look up the reference see I probably got the order wrong save JSON p5.js let's look at the reference and let's look ah the data goes first and then the name of the file goes second okay so bird comma bird JSON there we go now let's try this again alright I'm gonna try this one more time I'm gonna hit s and you can see I'll look what just happened right down here the browser downloaded a file called bird JSON automatically so I don't have any real file management capabilities from the client but I can auto trigger a download to go directly to the default downloads directory of the browser so I can now click here and say show and find her and now I should have look at that this bird died JSON file whoops and what I should be able to do is then drag that and take a look at it in atom so there it is look at this this is actually oh I saved the whole bird look at this I didn't mean to do this I saved the birds X&Y it's gravity it's lift its velocity look now I saved its brain input notes so I forgot of course all I want to do is just save the brain so what I can do now is I can change this to go back to bird and I can change whoops I'm sorry back to sketch and I can change this to save JSON bird dot brain okay here we go ready and I'm gonna save that and now I have another one I'm gonna open that up in atom and we can see this is now just the bird itself so you can see these are the weights that this this is sorry not the bird this is the neural network of the bird and these are all of its current weights all these numbers seem and feel rather meaningless to but they're quite meaningful until how how it works so now we can then write another sketch that loads that JSON file back in so how do I want to do that so actually before I go and create a sketch that loads the JSON let's actually make this load a bird that we want to load so one thing that I could do is after if I'm training for a while I could kind of find the current bird in the population that has the highest score so I could say actually I could say no there's only one bird right now whoops no loop so I'm gonna do this kind of manually this is pretty terrible so now I'm just want to make sure there's just one bird so it's just one bird so this is definitely the one that I want to say so I'm gonna hit s and I got that bird so now I have the bird that's doing really well and it's in bird to JSON so I am going to just call this best bird JSON okay so now of course what I would really want to do and I leave this to you the viewer as an exercise is make an interface well auto detect one that's been doing well trigger the download make like an upload button that I can upload the best one but I'm gonna do this in sort of a hacky way what I'm going to do is I'm going to make an exact copy of my sketch and I'm just gonna call it flappy bird and I am going to go into Adam and I'm gonna get rid of the genetic algorithm code completely I'm done no genetic algorithm here I'm gonna go to the sketch and I'm gonna say hey you know what I don't need all the birds and one'd all save birds I don't need the counter all I need is one bird and I don't need the save thing and I'm going to just say function preload I am going to say let data bird data or birdbrain birdbrain then I'm gonna say birdbrain equals load JSON best bird JSON then in setup all I need to say is bird brain sorry bird equals neural network dot d serialize birdbrain and this is actually so I should call this brain data or brain JSON let's call this trying to make this make sense brain JSON then this is the actual bird brain deserialize the brain JSON and then the bird is a new bird with that bird brain so this is the process of loading the data then deserializing it into an object than creating a new bird with that object because my bird code the constructor accepts a neural network object as the brain it will remake it so let's go back what else do I need to do in sketch adding new pipes you know there's only one bird now so all I need to do is I'm actually not even gonna worry about this I'm just gonna let the bird play and I'm gonna let the bird go offscreen I'll just like you know I hold on so in theory I should do something if the bird hits the pipe I'm gonna just say console.log collision just so we see it doing something if the bird goes off screen I'm gonna say bottom and then here oh that's the pike sorry and this is just one bird now if one bird offscreen I'm just gonna say console dot log bottom oh so much code to write and now I can just say bird think bird updates this is all this stuff for the genetic algorithm so I don't need to worry about that and then I want to draw show the bird and show all the pipes so this is now I just made a version of the game basically all I did was eliminate the genetic algorithm and eliminate the array of birds because there's just one bird and I also need to make sure I don't want to have this J dot J s file anymore in index of HTML and now I also need to go and grab from my downloads where was that I need to grab that best bird JSON file I'm gonna go to the desktop and put it in flappy bird so now this best bird this is the data from that best bird that I saved and I should be able to go back to sketch and say best I called it best underscore bird so give me a second here and let's run that sketch I'm gonna run a little web server so I can look I will run it on a different port so now I'm gonna go to localhost 8001 and have some Harris counter is not defined so I'm using I left this counter thing in there which is oh no I do need counter oh I do want counter so I need to have the the counter I need that's my frame count to know how many pipes I is not defined and sketch at js9 36 pipes ooh this should not be a bracket there right cuz this is me checking all of the pipes unexpected end fit put sketch alright so I think I'm missing yet another curly bracket here and there we go so this should be that bird right so now I've loaded the one that I trained oh yeah that worked I loaded the one that I trained how exciting so now what could I do let me just be sure that this is working let me go back to the other sketch all right and let me save another one so I'm gonna just I'm gonna save like a bad one because I'm this is just going to be an arbitrary one right so I'm gonna hit s and I'm gonna get this one and this one I'm gonna call bad bird and I'm gonna go to back to my sketch and it would put bad bird in there so now I have whoops what is this sublime is open I have bad bird this is all of the waits for the bird that wasn't really trained these are the weights of the bird that was trained so if I go here if I go back to my code and go to sketch that Jay s you know and I could what I what would be interesting is to run both of them like to load a few different birds but now I'm gonna load the one that doesn't do well let's just see and let me by the way let me set the slider the default of the slider to whoops where did I create that slider oh yeah sorry let me set the default of the slider to three just so it starts sped up whoops I'm in the wrong sketch so now this is the bad one that one's pretty good you can see the back of one it's not doing very well right as opposed to the good one which is not colliding it really should be is the collision thing actually saying collide did it say it when I did the bad one yeah it is okay you can see that I'm getting lots and lots of collisions with the one that wasn't trained well so again these could use a lot of refinement like maybe I want to think more systematically maybe I want to have an electron app that's actually doing the training and saves the JSON file so I could have some file management maybe you're asking yourself what's an electron app it's a way of wrapping a webpage basically into a desktop application so you have more control over your file system I could write a node I could have a serverside program written in node that is managing saving JSON files of birds that I've trained and reloading them or I could make a bird flappybird API I'm just gonna give you all these different trained birds for different situations so there's a lot of ways you could go forward with this so hopefully you've got something out of this I think dare I say I'm but right now this part five really wraps it up I will say that even though so you're going on the coding train website you will find the exact code for both of these examples in there kind of raw state but I'm also making a separate example that I've demonstrated which is here I'm just gonna quickly load it up that's going that that has a bit more interface stuff to it so I will also link to this example that will have a bit more that'll be a bit nicer like I'm gonna do I have a save and a load button in here so this one already has the feature now if I speed it up and train it for a little bit train train train train train train train train train train train train train train that I could then say hey just show me the one that's done the best so far so and so now you could save that one and load that one so I will create that stuff I'll make that example available but as an exercise for yourself try to make it what can you do add some design add some saving loading have have a computer bird compute could compete with a human player bird I don't know be creative make something share it with me and I hope to see you in a future video you
