hello everyone just doing a quick mic check although i'm only going to be speaking for the first few minutes so my mic really doesn't matter but let me know in the chat if you hear me okay do all right welcome everyone i sorry that music is going to stop very abruptly there because i don't have a nice fade transition but welcome to night two of the uh mouse sees the collaborative zine for the computer mouse conference simulcast along with the computer mouse conference i've got over here in my monitor the mouse conference stream and i don't believe it started yet which is good because as soon as it does start i'm going to switch over and you'll if you're watching this collaborative scene you will get to hear all the audio from the actual conference maybe you're wondering what is the computer mouse conference and what is going on here so um i um i am going to tell you about all of that sorry i'm like pulling up the page that i have information about it okay so the conference the music computer mouse conference is organized by um emma um and ashley this is the second night of it there are a wonderful set of panels and talks and all sorts of things happening i posted the link in the ch in the chat um which is at uh complicatingthecomputermouse.net let me post that again sorry i'm a little bit it's been a long day how's everybody doing what this stream is is it is one of the most incredible things i've ever had the chance to witness which i got to see the first night of it um this is a essentially like a live performance in a way but of the mouse sees so this is live documentation in the form of a collaborative zine for the conference and it's organized by neto bomani so as the conference is happening in real time neda is listening and printing and cutting and just beautifully curating this physical paper zine um i it's it's really inadequate for me to try to describe it in words you really just have to experience it people are sharing lots of images from it on twitter that you can find and you can also check the stream from last night to see images of it um let me tell you a little bit so um by the way you are welcome to participate in the making of this scene if you go to the twitter account the mouse sees i'm gonna i'll put this in the chat at the mouse seas um you can tweet at the mouse c's with um the answer to the question what does the now see or any other thoughts or reactions you have images you have both neda and i are tracking our mouse movements and those and little visualizations of those mouse movements will be tweeted automatically from that account um neda is an abolitionist who is interested in parsing information in histories while making things by hand together with human and nonhuman computers you can find neda on her website on twitter arena and instagram all of those links are in this video's description i'm just gonna sit here and copy paste them right into the chat so you have them as well so i please encourage you to learn more about neda and her work um i also want to mention that you should join neta the computer mouse conference and the coding train in supporting survived and punished new york's spring mutual 8 group mutual aid group fundraiser so i'm going to paste a link to that it's in the pinned comment i'm going to paste a link to that in the um chat here so survived and punished is a grassroots prison abolitionist organization an allied media project that um that exists to end the criminalization of survivors of domestic and sexual violence so we are raising money to provide commissary packages and other material support for criminalized survivors please donate as we continue and we being survived and punished continue to expand our giving to more survivors and provide care to our communities all donations are tax deductible that's for us to the fullest extent of the law so i want to just say a huge wonderful thank you and and excited happy moment to say that uh survived and punished reached um their goal of a hundred thousand dollars i think to the generosity hopefully of some of the from some of the viewers from last night um and everyone from i see that mass conference started so i gotta wrap this up um um uh from um from the uh people who donated last night the links on the uh com from the conference website um but i just want to encourage you to continue to donate so any extra money raised beyond the goal will go to support the same work so if you were just about to make a donation and you were sad that the goal was already reached um please still do um and um coding train is um making a donation um as part of this um live stream as well and as soon as i stop talking i'm gonna go and do that right now and i hope that you will consider matching that donation okay i gotta switch to the conference audio and to neta's desktop that's what you'll be hearing i'll be in the chat um all night you have questions ask in the live chat um you can go back and forth between the two feeds or keep them both on and um thank you so much to everyone in lots of talks yesterday this theme of trying to unpack the really problematic past of technology in this way shows up time and time again and is as i would say even more referenced today um in talks like dorothy's and all and ryan's as well definitely we have a couple of reminders for you so yesterday we had the i just want to say like the joy of watching neta bomani create the live scene in the stream and the live scene is linked in the website that you're watching this on so just below our video you can find the link to neto bomani's live scene and dan schiffman made an incredible bot that lets you contribute to the zine so if you tweet at the mouse sees then you can send neta screenshots or texts or images or links to videos you know the list goes on and on and neto will fold that into the creative practice of creating the zine which will be really really cool yes and um additionally i think if you're watching right now you should see a chat room on the right yeah some people i know yesterday had issues with this so i think one of the tricks is to refresh your browser and it might take just a second for the chat to show up but it should if it doesn't i'm so sorry it's technical error it's something we have to just deal with um but it looks like a lot of you are in there already there's a lot of ascii art uh we're thankful for that um and before you join the chat please click on the link for the code of conduct before participating so that we can make sure that we are participating in a way that is meaningful and engaging with each other that is linked right below the stream yeah and we've got some thank yous right yesterday was so spectacular and it really would not even be one percent possible without all of the tech support that culturehub has given us sangmin who is just over here again like just doing doing the hard work today of switching between streams and just such an incredible human being sangmin is a culture hub creative technologist and we really just like cannot thank you enough deandra as well deandra anthony another wonderful staff member at culture hub and deandra is the lead technician and we've worked so closely with d'andra getting everything set up and she's with us remotely but like in our hearts as well making sure that everything runs smoothly so we're just really grateful for culture hub as well as the media archaeology lab and the processing foundation and the coding train for all of their incredible support and helping us stream the live scene and be able to pay speakers as well yes um and that they're all linked below as well so take time to check out um their websites when you can um so we just got out of ed's workshop yeah um and ed bear is uh an amazing teacher an amazing artist and technologist and musician and there's something he said during the workshop that i'm still holding on to he said that there is a global infrastructure inside the body of the mouse and this is true yeah and it's something that i i wish that in my own in our own um you know tech educational experience that that was something that was kind of given to us when we were learning about um physical computing and technical objects to kind of engage with this kind of terrible fact that there's a whole global infrastructure baked into a microchip right yeah and emma and i were just chatting before the stream and just talking about how when it's framed that way how just frankly unacceptable it is that we don't have the perception of just how incredibly enormous the impact is of creating these pieces of technology like i'm holding my hand out like this because i'm imagining a mouse and uh and i think that like right exactly put our mice together and i think that the uh the the idea that we don't have that perception even though it's underneath the shell of what forms the exterior of lots of our technology is is just really when it's framed like ed bear has framed it it's really appalling um because when you open up the technology if we had learned about physical computing through the act of a tear down that framed it in that context you would see circuit boards that were stamped like printed in india you would see like elements of our of our components that you would have to unscrew and peel the glue back of right pieces that were toxic that you wouldn't be able to touch it's really as it's very unglamorous it's very unglamorous and it's a very visceral experience yeah to kind of get into a chip um and to kind of be met with the complexity of that chip and like the impossibility of hacking that chip and using it for your own means and another thing we were talking about earlier is like uh just also the ease with which uh which with which we learned physical computing and the ease with which you could just buy new components yeah um and not reuse components there's like a yeah yeah because you so we've emma and i have both done like a bunch of school several degrees in technology when you learn about physical computing or even upgrade your skills there is a glamour to it you do unbox really shiny parts that have like very famous names you know uh like i'm thinking of a very particular blue circuit board right now and that those boxed they have great branding they come with stickers like there's a glamour that feels like you're joining a club you know and i think that the it really it really continues to divorce you from the like possible just the possible and and in fact like actual destruction of a lot of this technology because you start to feel that kind of energy that cesar was talking about in his talk yesterday when you open up your computer and you're met with that like windows 95 sound and that beautiful glamorous desktop background and you start to feel energized and sort of like empowered by all of that which continues to divorce you from the from the uh from the way in which you might feel connected to the destruction totally and uh this is a very very good segue into our first screening tonight um did we covered everything yeah yeah yeah so our next screening um is a video by ryan clark it's titled nature's notifications uh and after the screening we will be doing a q a with ryan we're very excited live live yes this is live this is the first nonhost live conversation we've had so brian's gonna just so save your questions yes he'll be here yeah okay so we'll go to that video now and we'll see you uh in a little bit awesome [Laughter] foreign [Laughter] oh [Laughter] now somebody uh to persuade females to come close and admire his plumes he sings the most complex song he can manage and he does that by copying the songs of all the other birds he has around him such as the kookaburra he also in his attempt to out sing his rivals incorporates other sounds that he hears in the forest that was a camera shutter and again and now a camera with a motor drive and now the sounds of foresters and their chainsaws working nearby [ __ ] uh jesus so oh uh oh uh foreign foreign oh oh oh so all right we're back uh and we're back with ryan and it i really i really feel like this deserves an incredible round of applause and you'll find out a little bit more why even further so um but we're here with ryan uh uh we're so excited to be live having this conversation because emma and i spent all day yesterday just talking to each other so now we get to talk to you as well um so i'm gonna read ryan's bio and uh emma and i already decided that this is perhaps the coolest bio we've ever come across so it reads a selective chronologist r.c clarke notices the passage of time through both an ethnomusicological lens as a coeditor at dweller electronics and oceanographically as a phd student in coastal geological sciences in new orleans louisiana um so welcome ryan thank you so much uh should we reveal what what we learned while we were watching this together yes but before we do that i just want to say that someone said in the chat oh wow did not expect to cry at the computer mouse conference day too and i just want to say that i also cried when i watched this video so did i um but i cried without there being captions we just found out that there were supposed to be captions so ryan's gonna send us another video with captions that we can watch again yeah we'll post the um the nonambient version of nature's notifications but i'm glad it worked um and evoked something uh for everyone watching so thank you and it wasn't just emma and i and this commenter in the chat we have been talking about this video for days and it made people at culture hub as we were recording it recording sessions and talking about sessions cry we have like friends and family who we've like you know let take a peek who have also been really moved by it so i can only imagine how wrecked we'll be in the oh captions i want to so i just wanted to i i after reading your bio after watching uh the video many times i'm wondering like given that your practice and your um research through geology through ethnomusicology given that you practice both of these things i'm wondering like how you define the word chronology or how you define chronology and because i was thinking that um and because your video is like i don't know so much about time i think um uh like my definition of chronology like i've been taught that order is like beginning to end like on a linear timeline or something so i just wonder how you think about chronology in your practice or in this video um yeah um i guess i think of it through the lens of the observer so it has a lot to do with the observer effect where how time can go or how time moves whether someone's actually watching or noting that passage of time can alter so it can like speed up or slow down and considering humans i guess in relation to like deep time so again like as a geologist you know like 4.3 billion years on the earth and then 13.4 billion for the universe you know we're here for such a small portion of that and in doing so um i don't know i guess i guess you start to whether subconsciously or not start to view things a little bit differently and when when you see sort of a a loss of of a time or a climate um it it's you can see that this moment has shown itself up uh before so to speak more literally like the pleistocene like three million years ago uh the sea level was like you know uh pretty much the same levels but uh the difference is like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was like much different so that's us right that's anther that's uh that's anthropogenic change and so understanding time you start to see like the small little differences and i guess i'm interested in what can cause those differences and bringing attention to them because i do think that we have the capability to change change that right and i guess that also it's a it's a really interesting definition of time as well because it also references scale in a way that's different than the way that i imagine time in a very conventional sense right that doesn't like my reference of time the scale is like hour to millisecond that's as far as scale gets but this definition requires so much more observation of of of scale in in a in a way that's really exciting to learn about for sure for sure there's some there's this writer called gabrielle hecht where she talks about uh inter intrascalar vehicles and it's like okay well what sort of um examples or mindsets or concepts can we start to implement to like think larger right in terms of scale and i think going into geology if there's one thing that has been benefited me is it that topic alone is an interscalar vehicle and in watching or making and editing these videos uh yeah i was just trying to produce another kind of interscalar vehicle so we can kind of not remove ourselves but you know see what kind of agency that we either have or don't have and maybe the the text for the the caption version might you know poke a bit more at that um right but you know i think the emotion gets across uh without the captions yeah oh my gosh the motion really gets across definitely i mean i think it it i the interscalar vehicle um i remember reading maybe it's an essay i don't know if it's an essay or yeah yeah i remember reading that and yeah it did really do that it did carry me through like i i really felt i think that's why it's so um emotional because it goes in and out and there's like you can really feel a dissonance you can really feel that kind of uncomfortable dissonance and then that last animation i feel kind of just like draws it all out like draws all the kind of tension out that is held in going in between um yeah we were talking about that dissonance a lot yeah we've been talking about the like video and how it holds this really uncomfortable dissonance because it's peppered with sounds that we have just burned into our memory uh that are really tied to nostalgia and then also shows us images and videos of things we don't see that often unless we seek it out but we subconsciously know are happening and i think we're not often brought to the confrontational moment where we have to see those two things the like tech we have like heartfelt feelings for and the questionable heartfelt feelings for and the destruction that is you know manifesting as a result of that tech we don't we don't have many instances of being like brought to the confrontation of the interlinking of those two things um so there's a lot of dissonance in the video because of that it's uncomfortable absol absolutely and yeah i mean i i'm i will say i definitely have nostalgia like that windows 95 theme i i run back to my mom's you know uh media room with you know fairy wooden you know lots of little diskette shelves and all of that and also like he's like you know being a sucker for micro composition like um in the beginning of that it talks about how brian you know was prompted by microsoft in in i think 94 um to produce a a a very like small amount of sound but evokes optimism uh connection you know all these different things they threw these words at him and one i think he landed on it perfectly but it what it also did is that it sort of um it encapsulates this idea of like this uh blind optimism of the 90s of like that kind of tech boom and uh there's a lag of that feeling that optimism which you still hear in like these ios sounds that i had pepper in um but obviously the world no longer reflects this sort of optimism so it it starts with like again co2 like talking about how co2 uh atmospheric levels are like rising and tipping points for a climate um but are these sounds reflecting uh you know nature uh kind of getting larger and more frequent uh such as like hurricanes and things like that um i would say no uh that's the dissonance that uh is there but um i think it it was definitely a meditation to investigate that for my own sake because yeah i love all these sounds um especially those windows 95 ones there's a special place in my heart for for all those guys yeah wow i mean it's it's both like so manipulative as like a design for sound and it's so manipulative but it's not unlike so many other kinds of like methods of of sensory experiences that are like forcing us to feel a particular kind of way it's just unfortunate that like we're being forced to feel a particular kind of way about such a sure yeah like a particular kind of destructive property yeah what was it like we were wondering about what it's like to make the video right yeah we were wondering a little bit just about the process i mean it was cool to hear that you were thinking about gabriel heck's intrascalar vehicle but maybe if there's any uh i don't know other other ways of making this video um in terms of i don't know how you approach your research maybe or how you even just like sound like music and sound like how that played into the process of putting this video together and also how much footage of devastating natural environments did you have to sift through to get to where you landed like we were we were destroyed watching the like a couple handfuls of clips that you showed us but you know video art as it is you got to look at us so much more just to whittle down to what you want to use right like what was that experience like too yeah oh my gosh um well it's always been tough so i'm i'm in new orleans and i'm from baton rouge so i've lived in the south uh my whole life and so even as a kid you know the idea of kind of hurricanes and hurricane season um has kind of always been around me and so maybe i'm desensitized to it but on top of that being a coastal geologist you know my work is rooted in the sustainability the physical sustainability of uh of southern louisiana and to do that you have to watch so much destruction and that's another sense of scale that um louisiana and other coastal cities definitely face more than you know like more inland cities you know we're kind of faced with tragedy and just complete destruction and into the worlds um multiple times and like almost in a singular generation hurricane camille hurricane betsy katrina um you know right next houston harvey so um a lot of my actual not actually a lot of my research um is you know being very intimate with um a lot of these numbers and understandings of like what happened how it happened at a very almost at a persontoperson level so like understanding natural hazards and mitigation um what's intertwined in that is just unfortunately like incredible sadness so what i have is this whole array a lot of these videos are from classes that i've had since 2011 um like the japanese landslide we're looking at um land stability um due to like saturation of rain water and we're just looking at rock slides and so you know a lot of these videos i've just kind of always been thinking about and um what what better time to show it off than the computer mouse conference that's i guess that's where my brain went i don't know i'm kind of always with these things if anybody knows me and there are some that do in the chat hey um you know i'm always watching youtube i'm always like hey check this article out or the radio is always on in my house so it's always just kind of picking from these trees that are kind of growing around me right well i mean i don't i i can't imagine like a better place than the computer mouse conference we're so grateful uh that you had thank you yeah that you that you sent this video our way and that we get to even further un like dive into it because we get to see like a a more detailed version with the captions that we'll post as well we get like part two of this which is actually really novel in a strange way you know yeah um and i think that we we probably have to close even though i we have so many more questions and we can find you on twitter right to continue the conversation if people have more questions for you yeah i'm uh what is it care forgotten uh care forgotten which is again a new orleans reference i'm just stuck here so um but also be in the chat which is amazing if there's anything i can say is like i love the this chat i was just staying in here after it was over yesterday i'm like i'm gonna miss this when it's over so shout out to the chat i'll be in there and answering questions shout out to emma i'm gonna build the site i see you in there ryan so yeah i'm so glad you're there are definitely also already questions there and we will be posting the video with captions as soon as we figure that out so yeah we're sorry about that but thank you so much for your work um yeah thank you for letting me be included in this i appreciate it amazing okay we'll see you soon we'll see you later all righty thanks bye so our next video is dorothy's and after dorothy r santos uh has her video screened which is just so beautiful it's called beyond the life cycle of the object that video is going to be followed by a conversation that was prerecorded between emma myself and lauren lee mccarthy in reflection uh on that video on dorothy's video yep and then we'll come back after that as a prelude to the panel yes yeah so we'll see you afterwards [Laughter] hi everyone my name is dorothy santos i am the executive director for processing foundation and thank you so much for being here i am going to be presenting today on beyond the life cycle of the object a little bit more about myself i love reading writing researching looking at everything asking questions and making connections i'm really honored again to be presenting my work that i feel and i hope will enable a different type of thinking that goes beyond the life cycle of digital and mobile devices and objects in our lives i also wanted to take the time to thank emma ashley and culture hub and the entire team for putting mouse conference together and allowing me the opportunity to speak with you all today so i have something embarrassing to share uh i've been working on knitting a scarf for my sister for the past decade that's right i said the past decade her favorite color is pink i'm not even sure if that's her favorite color anymore to be honest but the knit and purl stitches and all the imperfections represent these moments of patience in my life that i had the time to sit and take a break and work with my hands in such a way that continues to feel very familiar when i was young my mother taught me how to knit and crochet and you know she wasn't the most patient uh teacher brilliant but not patient but one of the things that i realized in her teaching was how she would tell me stories and how she would uh she would have to actually learn all of these skills so knitting crocheting embroidery uh cooking etc within school it was actually compulsory and it was really difficult to actually mesh a lot more of the filipino traditions within that learning but it also reminded me of how in the philippines there's this really long tradition of weaving and craft within the culture itself but there's something embodied in the practice that becomes ritual and ceremony as well as spiritual so lately in thinking about how i wanted to prepare for this talk i leaned in heavily to lisa nakamura's writing and research about indigenous navajo women and the racialization engendering within the electronic manufacturing industry specifically with the company fairchild semiconductor and the best way that i understood the world or the way the best way that i understand the world i'm sorry is is through artists and poets and more specifically for today i wanted to focus on janice lobo sapigao's work and how she along with nakamura deeply influenced the way that i think about objects in our lives and what it means to hold something in our hands that has probably been held and touched and created by dozens if not hundreds of people and while we may not know for certain thinking about science fiction writer ted chang's work the life cycle of software objects um and even though this story is about raising a digital pet and it that evolves into some sentient mind that's akin to a human mind you know it also makes me wonder well i'm always wondering about what our objects would say to us if they could tell us about where they came from but today i i want to go beyond the life cycle of the object itself whether it is a mouse a microchip a speaker a laptop a smartphone i want for us to remember the human beings responsible for what you hold in your hand and present a type of call to action through the lens of docupoetics the way that zapagawa leaves us these types of instructions in her writing and how we might think beyond these objects and so one of the guiding questions for this conference is this idea of what does the mouse see and while i'm not talking overtly about mice in terms of the computer mouse i'm talking more broadly about how we might want to think about the historical cultural and societal ramifications and impacts of what it means when the technology industry has imprinted and mapped already how a body is seen within its larger infrastructure which nakamura talks about in her title in her essay titled indigenous circuits navajo women and the racialization of early electronic manufacture so i wanted to take a few minutes with some insights um my insights of nakamura's writing before i share janice's work with you all so within this writing nakamura looked at different types of print media from the fairchild semiconductor a company from the late 1960s and early 70s and what it meant to be a woman of color in particular a navajo woman working for the company but most importantly uh writing this as a way to reveal the profound ways in which navajo women played integral and vital roles in the digital revolution she starts off her essay with donna harroway's idea of the integrated circuit from wellknown work the cyborg manifesto and my understanding of how well this is my understanding of how the human body becomes a part of this integrated circuit the navajo women in many ways have become part of the integrated circuits through a mythology and through their nimble fingers delicate hands and precision focused as their eyes looked through microscopes and built the silicon valley we know today i couldn't help but think of the materiality of these objects and from where and how they were sourced this is the ebb and flow of understanding i feel often times gets forgotten when we finally have the object in our hands or how the land for which the navajo woman or how they became known as the creative class of technology workers fairchild semiconductors strategically bought land at shiprock new mexico to create a manufacturing plant on the reservation to provide jobs with navajo people and while nakamura doesn't overtly use the term gentrification she does use the term cultural imperialism that happens at spring rock and there's a type of mapping of the navajo body that i mentioned their cultural traditions and practices of weaving and making situate themselves in the eyes of fairchild as the best type of individuals in particular women to be the makers of microchips and semiconductors due to their dexterity speed and precision nakamura states this notion of navajo as quote unquote industrial produced a complicated identity whose formation relied on the idea that the tribe could be modern even hyper modern precisely as a result of being distinctly indian distinctively indian indian identified traits and practices such as painstaking attention to craft an affinity for metal work and textiles were deployed to position the navajo on the cutting edge of the technological moment precisely because of their possession of a racialized set of creative cultural skills and traditional premodern artisanal handwork end quote we see what nakamura is talking about very much present in genesis or genocide's work fairchild led people to believe in a method in the mythology that mapped onto the navajo woman's body again as i mentioned and now being very redundant and repetitive about this to emphasize and i think that this is something i feel very powerful about nakamura readings and also reminds me of how we might think of cydia hartman's idea of critical fabulation so i'll stop here to just note that what you're looking at was in the um semiconductor you know decorative uh you know um uh brochure it was a commemorative brochure of uh you know fairchild semiconductor company so this is this was included the images you see here were included in that commemorative brochure or print media so returning back what can we surmise from the things that we see in media and archives now someone uh within media studies this type of media archaeology is so very important to me but i want to move on to janice lobo sapigao's work microchips for millions and although i don't like labels janice's work is absolute uh it's absolutely poetry but there's this embedded practice and practice of docupoetics that is in line with many other writers i so deeply admire such as kathy parkhang vanessa angelica villarreal and vanu kapil and docupoetics is a type of writing practice that requires a listening deeply or pardon me a deep listening and intentionality to your subject matter so i wanted to take some time to go through some of the many pages i'm only showing a few here of uh janice's work so to the left you see microchips for millions of the book cover this is actually this this is her mother and to the right you see a page with uh binary code and at the top of the page it reads let the poetry of this page serve as a moment of recognition for the native peoples the muekma olani tribe whose lands we inhabit uh contemporary contemporaneously known as san jose and at the bottom let these pages allow empathy for the immigrant women and their families whose livelihoods are always always at stake and so i wanted to also show some of the poetry which throughout the book it's really reminiscent of a type of concrete poetry as well as docupoetics and so i can't help it i wish this was i wish janice was reading this herself but um hopefully i can do it some justice i do feel it's important uh to to read through some of the poetry she's written that really reifies a lot of what nakamura was talking about in her essay so the assembly line is what we're looking at now and it has some binary code on it and a lot of the poems that janice writes appear in in columns um as if like running texts very similar to what we might see in code and so it reads my mother is a fab operator four days a week ma gets up at 4am boyle's hot water in a kettle showers before it screams ready for coffee watches the news as she pulls on her clothes jeans and simple tea enough to soak up 12 hour sweat resting in orthopedic shoes that amplify the need for health benefits and overtime ma is always on the front line of silicon valley's shadow one of thousands of women whose nimble fingers and silence grumbling spin microchips for millions powering laptops and cell phones that she herself does not find intuitive enough to use at the end of every day she watches the filipino channel her swollen feet elevated on the living room couch a luxury she buys herself and her family and in terms of docupoetics as i mentioned earlier uh some of the things that are included in in janus's book uh are snippets found in uh print media of what has been said of the women who work within these industries so to the left you'll see a quoted text that reads by the early 1980s filipinos were one of the largest ethnic groups among asian workers at national semiconductor corporation nsc in san jose california you see binary code and then you see at the bottom in text again um ma says she's a fab operator and so just to quickly note uh fairchild semiconductor was in in shiprock was uh operational in the late 60s and 70s but a lot of this work um was going overseas to asia as well as mexico and then to the right of the screen you see another quote this mostly female labor force was appealing to management for a number of reasons one many were fluent in english two many had experience working in philippine electronics plants and three they had a reputation for hard work and for they were considered obedient to authority again you see the code and at the bottom it says i know she's an assembly line worker and so i want to show a couple more pieces that i feel really are um indicative of what nakamura was talking about in her research of the fairchild semiconductor archives but you see it almost come to life in uh janice's poetry so again before i end i just want to share a couple more pieces this one is called the clean room in order to come in you must first put on one hair net two shoe covers three gloves four mask five hood six coverall seven boot covers eight goggles nine gloves when you exit you must discard one gloves two goggles three hood four mask five boot covers and to the right you see text that we can assume it is safe to assume again through the docupoedic style that this might be janus's mother uh so i'll read that text to the right column no you cannot bring anything inside the room no cell phones no watch no nothing you have to go to the changing room before you go into work i always wear my headband they don't like you to wear sneakers they like you where the shoes they give you my feet is hurt it's hard to breathe sometimes oh my god you can only call me on my break okay 8 30 or 12 30. i can only wear tshirts to lose kind for work it's better because you sweat a lot i can't balasang i can't you have to wear a suit goggles everything is covered everything you can't touch anything you have gloves they will get mad on you and finally something that i wanted and i'm barely scratching the surface here uh in my presentation for you all but this goes back to what i mentioned with nakamura may not have overtly said that this is gentrification but this is a way of how capitalism works through the environment through um profiting off the land of peoples and the after effects and ramifications of the environment and you know the people that um you know steward the land but then for generations to come we see that in the valley of toxic fright um which is the last uh poem that i'll share from janice's book so to the left there's a screenshot of a map of san jose or um that county and the center of it you see uh you know sunnyvale santa clara san jose and there is a box that is uh you know uh bolded with the text to the immediate right in white that says a plume is a long cloud of smoke a vapor spreading from its point of origin and to the right of that this is on the opposite page of the map is janice's poem the class in college i took an environmental racism class my professor showed a map of my neighborhood in san jose with curious red dots next to the mcdonald's grandma worked at near my elementary school one north of ma's workplace he said the dots indicated toxic waste sites said immigrant women were on the front line of exploitation half of the professor's lecture was about the bunny suit he said employees are told to protect them are told it's to protect them from chemical harm bunny suits protect microchips from human germs and so thank you for listening to all of that i really do highly recommend um looking into janice's work and beyond so as you see here going beyond the life cycle of the object and what does that mean so now that i've shared janice's work i wanted to express how i feel um and how it serves as a conduit to understanding the kind of conditions indigenous women and women of color are subjected to within the electronic manufacturing and technology industries and still to this day and in sharing my thoughts which again barely scratch the surface of what nakamura and zafigo's work or janus's work is doing um with media science and technology studies and within the arts i wanted to share one last important quote from nakamura's work when she reflects on the depiction of women of color within tech through media she writes quote instead we see asian women latinas and navajo women and other women of color looking inside digital culture means looking back in time to the roots of the computing industry and the specific material production practices that positioned race and gender as commodities and electronic factories this labor is temporarily hidden within a very early period of digital computing history and hidden spatially we must look to locales and bodies not commonly associated within these or with these industries in out of the way places to see how race operates as a key aspect of digital platform production and quote so with that i wanted to encourage you all to think about these different ways and that media affects the way we understand narratives being told to us especially queer trans black indigenous people of color and people with disabilities i also want to encourage you to all read and examine the works of artists a lot like janice logos to understand technology in a way that is outside of the reach of the object and outside of capitalism i think that's one of the things i really wanted to focus on within this talk but also to remind everyone of the immense amount of work there is for us to do and learning and being accountable within those ecologies um thank you so much i really appreciate you all and i am i'm done with my talk i think i mean so yeah dorothy doesn't directly talk about the mouse um i don't think at any point but there's so much um like indirect connection and i think like the strongest connection for me was just talking about um like hands and the hands that go into the making of electronic objects and i think the mouse at least in the research that i've done has is so much about the fact that we hold it and it's this very personal object and yet it's very not personal because it doesn't really hold information like you simply hold it all day um and so it's this reminder of the body but it's also a reminder that you know like the violence of the uh the tech that goes into making the mouse or the industry that goes into making the mouse so so for me it is like directly it sits directly within this conference really well um yeah yeah i mean for me it the first thing it made me think about was i guess the thought that dorothy's talk brought up for me was just the way that um when you think about the mouse or any kind of physical artifact of technology um it it feels like there is this direct connection to you know the history of that making of that object like even a mouse that is something personal that you really are the only one that touches maybe was something that was made by someone else and transferred several times and i think a lot of times when we think about you know the way we've been communicating for the past year primarily which is like through screens and networks there's sometimes a tendency to feel like um that history is is separated from it right that there it's more feminine maybe um although it's not and i think that was the the other nice part of dorothy's talk was that you know she's talking about microchips so even when we have that feeling that the internet is something intangible in in contrast to something physical you know there is that whole physical infrastructure um that makes me think of like you know ingrid burnington's work also like just surfacing that that architecture and infrastructure and the physicality of it i think it's intentionally severed from the physicality of it right um and i think what's really interesting about dorothy's is not only does she paint that picture for us in poetry and in storytelling but also in the presumed uh prioritization of technology over people um we were just talking about the as it was airing we were just talking about the bunny suit comment as well that was such a a very intense way to end this talk to really hammer home what is important over who is important in the construction of all of this and that's even more uh extended when we realize that these are not stories that we hear in tandem like we don't hear stories about the technology and the people in tandem maybe you hear about certainly you hear about inventors or you know figureheads like steve jobs and doug engelbert but you don't hear about the fabricators and the technology in tandem um and there's a reason for it and that reason is um articulated inadvertently through that bunny suit comment right um because it's not it's it's not who matters it's not what matters right yeah the bunny suit comment really um or just that idea that it protects the microchip more than it protects the worker or that's for the microchip and not the worker uh really kind of blew my mind at least how it was presented in the poem also like it really hit harder in a way that it hadn't before um and and i think just like complicates the mouse like again it's this personal object but but really is prioritizing your computer over you in many many ways i think over and over again like it's prioritizing the graphical user interface over how you might want to interact with a computer at all i think yeah yeah i mean it's um it's funny to think about you know user interface or user interaction design or any of these things that um or even like user centered design um i think what what the talk pointed to is you know and what we're talking about is how the the whole notion of that is really opposite right that that it is not about the people in the system the people in the system are really there to serve the underlying structure which is you know capitalism and technical solutionism and you know white supremacy at the bottom of it um i was really another phrase that stuck out to me from the talk and i don't remember if dorothy said it or if she's quoting lisa nakamura but just this idea that capitalism works the environment and i was thinking also about like environment the relationship between environment and people and how when you're talking about you know indigenous people like that connection is so strong and i think that's something that we have a much weaker understanding of a lot of time when we're sitting behind our computer so that that's an unresolved thought but those are some of the um like entities that were floating around in my mind when she was talking about that uh uh that really resonate resonated with me too i couldn't imagine and i and by that i mean i very well could because there have been similar kinds of interactions that i've experienced myself but i couldn't imagine the experience of um the writer in that story they were taking a a a technologies class and the professor showed a map of their own home region their own home city with dots articulating that these are the places that have the highest regions of toxicity and the highest regions of exploitation as well and and to be sitting like i i just know firsthand in lots of context but for so many people of color inside of technology classes listening to stories that are not about you but they are about a a group of people that you are also defined with and and and how those stories are so um they really articulate the power and the like economic uh economic and environmental like violence that takes place in those areas and you're listening to that and you have to decide whether you attach yourself to that moment or if you divorce yourself from that moment in order to be able to like participate in the room and i think that dorothy's talk didn't talk about that overtly but it did weave in and out the personal connection to these asian heritages and the personal connection to the like identities that she's talking about and um i just feel like really akin to that kind of relationship understanding um those moments like where it becomes really close and personal and when it becomes really distant and informationally driven uh that was like a intense moment for me in her talk yeah i'm pausing so i'm thinking about that i mean one of the things that um i really appreciated was the closing where you know she's telling the story that like you said some is informational some is very personal to the writer some you know is personal to dorothy too and um but she directs redirects it back at the listener at the end um you know and she started open by talking about this idea of deep listening to subject matter and then she kind of ends it saying okay so you've been listening so how how do we learn from this how do we be accountable um so i really liked that that call to action but i'm also um thinking about what you just said ashley and like how how do you how do you find that accountability um when it um how to say like how to find that accountability when when you how do you balance that with like just selfprotection sometimes right yeah and it's not none of these systems of um of learning about the history of computing protect the person of color that might be associated to that because the way that we learn about these systems is also from the perspective of the most powerful demographics as well so there's no like training that that a facilitator would go through to say oh this is the part where we talk about how this technological company ravaged like an entire black and brown neighborhood i wonder if there are black and brown people who maybe have family who live in that neighborhood or even live there themselves like there is no framework for that so it becomes like listeners choice to engage or listeners responsibility to engage or or more so like listeners like additive trauma so i think that that's the accountability part is still sort of murky because we have no we don't have we haven't built a conversational framework for addressing that headon or in any kind of confrontational way right and that's why it talks like dorothy's are so important because they like peel back all of that um all of that like covering that we have to talk about these things abstractly and really talk about it from the humans perspective like the true lived experience of of like marginalized folks who have made this technology possible it becomes uncomfortable because we're not used to it but from that positionality you know it's definitely i i'm just thinking about um all of the problematic ways in which technology like the pedagogy of technology like how the speed kind of like the the way in which it's taught and the way in which things are glossed over like the violence of of what goes into making a microchip is glossed over when you're trying to learn what a microchip is hi we're back um we're back live because you just saw our faces technically in a prerecorded video it's the magic of the internet the end and so we are so excited because we're closing on such a dynamic note we've got three spectacular panelists and this is really cool for us too because the computer mouse conference in 2019 also closed on a panel and it was so much fun and uh there were so many jumpsuits on that panel there were three three out of four people sitting on that panel or a jumpsuit which is pretty surreal we'll find out in a second if io is still wearing a jumpsuit but we've got one returning uh panelist from last year io and you'll hear a bit more about him in a moment we've also got some incredible incredible people that we really look up to allison and mimi um before we get to reading their bios and telling you more about them um i just want to shout out a couple of things the first thing is that we're in the last chunk of the conference this is really the last opportunity to contribute to the computer mouse zine so neda bomani with help from the coding train and dan schiffman's twitter bot is still they're still collecting assets and people have been really freaking out about how incredible the zine has been today and so this would be a great time to tweet uh a contribution and get your um contribution embedded into the zine because people have been really in love with what they've been seeing and it would be cool to be a part of that artifact um and i think that with that said we're ready to jump into some of the panels yeah so um i'm going to introduce allison parrish allison is a computer programmer poet educator and game designer whose teaching and practice address the unusual phenomena that blossom when language and computers meet she is an assistant arts professor at nyu interactive telecommunications program where i was a student of alison's with ashley where she also earned her master's degree in 2008. she was named best maker poetry bots by the village voice in 2016. alison's computergenerated poetry has recently been published in ninth letter and vetch she's the author of at every word the book which collects the output of her popular longterm automated writing project that tweeted every single word in the english language um the word game rewordable designed by allison in collaboration with adam simon and tim zatella was published by penguin random house in august 2017 after a successful round of kickstarter funding her first fulllength book of computer generated poetry articulations was published by counterpath in 2018. great um so we're so excited thanks alison thanks for joining us um i have the privilege of introducing a very dear friend of mine a constant and regular coconspirator io temo o conciende and i think that it bears noting that io io is the person in reference the the jumpsuit wearing person i don't think you're wearing a jumpsuit today but io was on our panel uh last year and so he's one of two mouse conference returners only two and so we're really happy to have you here i'm going to read io's bio nigerian american artist designer educator and time traveler living and working in new york conciente studied visual arts at rutgers university earning a ba his work range is from speculative design to physically interactive works wearables and explorations of reclamation his past residencies include ibeam ido's fortnite new ink recess assembly and the laundromat project he has presented at the 11th shanghai biennial afrotechtopia brooklyn museum io festival mit beyond the cradle the tribeca storyscapes among others his work exists between physical and digital spaces across the past present and future and ascess via a technological lens to reimagine notions of race identity politics and culture as we travel through time and space io has taught at 9 2y bennington college hostess cuny and new york university io is an anthropology m.a candidate at the new school for social research studying blackness and time and space he holds an mfa in design and technology from parsons school of design in new york where he serves as an assistant professor of interaction and media design asterisk io do you want to add anything to this bio because i think this is just even a few months out of date yeah oh that's that's good thanks hail okay all right thank you for joining us io i'm gonna introduce mimi i just wanna also before i read mimi's bio um mimi was the first person i think that i talked to about this kind of longterm computer mouse project in 2018 and she really just energized the project from the very beginning so i'm very excited to be on this panel with her so mimi anoha is a nigerian american artist and researcher whose work highlights the social relationships and power dynamics behind data collection her multimedia practice uses print code installation and video to call attention to the ways in which those in the margins are differently abstracted represented and missed by sociotechnical systems mimi has been in residence at the ibeam center for art and technology here in new york studio xx data and society research institute columbia university and the royal college of art her exhibition and speaking credits include venues like log i'm going to just mispronounce but log t lyrique uh fiber festival mao jihong arts foundation the pompidou and b4bel4b uh gallery babble gallery uh her writing has appeared in courts uh nishan new dong lanternette 538 and k verlag in 2014 she was selected to be in the inaugural class of fulbright national geographic digital storytelling fellows and in 2017 she was nominated as a technically brooklyn artist of the year mimi earned her mps from nyu itp in 2018 she served as a creative in residence at olin college for engineering and she is a visiting arts professor at nyu tisch amazing yeah amazing so the allstar lineup people are commenting the chat like three of my favorite people what and we really feel that too so thanks everybody for being here um just to sort of like give you an idea of the structure for people who are watching you can absolutely drop questions into the chat emma and i are going to be keeping one eye in the chat to pull questions into the conversation but we also at eight o'clock we'll have a q a session where you can actively post your question and we can pull those into the conversation more intentionally um so with all that said uh i think we're ready to get into it so last year 2019 actually but uh 2019 in the first computer mouse conference uh io and lane nune and tiga brain all joined us for a closing panel and we opened with a question that we wanted to open with today as well which is really simple it's just wondering if you could tell us a little bit about your first time using the computer mouse and because io is our returner maybe you could retell your story and then we'll go alison mimi yeah i don't i don't remember my story that's um that's the thing i hope i don't retell the same story um i i know that when i was really young i tried to build a computer mouse or i tried to build something to interact with the computer um and i was not successful um but yeah i think that's that's one of my stories um yeah i remember i remember some of that story yeah um it was like a story about your mom or dad working on a computer building a computer together yes yes yes it was a story about my dad um we got a computer um no i was i was crocheting yeah and my dad saw me and he he got me a light bulb and a battery and connected it and then ever since then i was like oh wow computers but then i also love crocheting as well so i've continued to crochet and do computer stuff wearable technology yeah right right that's the story which is which is really cool because it connects to so much of what psy presented yesterday and what dorothy just presented before this but maybe we'll put a pin in that and go to allison um and ask the same question what was your first experience with the computer mouse yeah i was i was thinking about this actually um which is weird because i didn't know this was going to be your question um i think i was thinking about it in terms of the fact that i feel like maybe most of the people who are presenting at the conference their first interaction with the computer included a mouse just based on the ages of everyone as far as i can as far as i can guess and mine didn't i i don't remember i definitely like was using computers before there were mice um like our first uh home computer was a tandy color computer too that did not have a mouse um so i was trying to think through like where what what is the most likely scenario where i would have encountered a mouse for the first time because it wouldn't have been in school we would have had like apple twos in the apple in in the lab it wouldn't have been at home like my my dad had like a ibm pc that he used for work stuff um so it was definitely a mac so it was either it was either like a classic mac that was at my friend's house across the street because they always had the newest computer stuff um or maybe it was like at my dad's work or something like that um i i do have a very distinct memory of like with my friends um going through their family computer and we found this folder labeled misc misc and we didn't know that it stood for miscellaneous we thought it meant music so we we clicked into the folder and just started messing around i have no idea we probably messed it up really bad um so i'm afraid george fisher if you're if you're watching i'm sorry i messed up your miscellaneous folder 34 years ago or whatever but yeah i don't i don't really remember but it must have been it must have been a scenario like that that's a great yeah story and makes me i i am like a post mouse my i don't remember either but i'm definitely a post mouse um computer user like i didn't have a pre mouse computer experience the great the great generational divide yes the wellknown generational divide cool uh mimi what about you um yeah i don't know i don't i don't think i can remember you all had nice little neat stories that was very convenient of the two of you um i don't think i remember the first time i used a mouse i do remember i'll say my most vivid earliest memories probably when i was about eight or nine and we had an old we had some mac in our house and i remember there was a summer when one of my good friends who lived close enough that i could walk or bike to her house we were obsessed with just emailing each other back and forth and it was like weeks where we didn't see each other in person because we were like oh my god have you heard email let's do this and it's so funny thinking about now like that is that is not how i would feel today i can tell you that um that's probably my most like vivid earliest memory since i don't remember the first time that's still a good story that's a great yeah i like the stories that just kind of bring you back to like uh when you would just walk down the street or i don't know to somewhere like close by to your friend's house to use their computer yeah i don't know it feels really far away from my experience these days well yeah i'm never walking to your house to use your computer not these days um i mean now you could just um vnc into it right right as we do we we've been doing a lot of yeah uh we have been using this tool called teamviewer with culturehub um yeah where we they take over our computer to do stuff so so yeah it's and they take over the cursor and it's a very weird experience um okay so i want to just i um have a question like th so this year our theme um is a little more specific uh it's what does the mouse see um and so a bunch of people uh throughout the conference as you may have seen have stretched this question in different ways um so like charlton asks does the mouse see race and he actually he answers the question he says yes it does because computing technology is predicated on race and racism and racialization um david kind of asks says that the mouse sees and clicks and that clicks have a kind of currency and that there's all this like meaning that's multiplied on top of the click um yeah and so we wanted to basically ask you the unfair question as if you were presenting like right now like what what does the mouse see and i think that this is like you know our speakers had weeks months to think about what the mouse sees um but i would be curious to know like you know measured in clicks seeing racing pixelizations on a on a track pad like what is the mouse what would you say that the mouse sees or if you just push back on this question because i also like i feel like i still i just can't even answer begin to answer this question even though so many people have answered it throughout today and yesterday yeah yeah i could take a stab at it you know and maybe this is coming from you know from the research that i've been doing lately i i'm thinking about time and i think ryan touched on this a little bit um and really thinking about the scale um of time so i i in a sense for me the mouse is sort of complicit in this um idea of the proliferation of violent images right and thinking about the time it takes so less if we if one takes time as um just even think about the com the mouse itself and the clock in the computer and needing to have that time signature correct to communicate but then also scale back and think about the anxiety of you know clicking on something and the immediacy of okay that it appears and what happens when that breaks down right but then now thinking adding violence and and race to that and thinking about over the over the summer all these videos and images that have been coming out and it is a mouse that enables you to to view that right and by clicking on it you see those images and then even beyond that like then being able to scroll those images right move them faster or slower pause it at the particular place so for me i'm thinking about and then further further more right than the multiplication of that um over you know thousands or hundreds of thousands of people and what that means in terms of the the way the mouse manages the dissemination of these uh of these images um and i i'm going to bring this back to um to ela couti's um water get no enemy um and because he talks about water in this sort of um cosmic way right he starts out this really external about water being used to wash and then water being used to drink and then in the center the core of it is he says when your child dies you use water um and in terms of crime and i think about trauma and and and time we're related to the that ability to sort of instantaneously click you know and to scroll to pause right i mean you're bringing up a lot of parts of charlton's talk as well right um yeah and all of the ways in which like the mouse creates more access as you're describing more opportunity to be connected to some of the movements you saw in the summer but also the the violence of being able to replay and and the like breakdown just destruction of being able to use the mouse in that way yeah it's also i mean i think sometimes i feel like um i put too much weight on the mouse or something like like to give the mouse get to give it over to too much responsibility to the mouse but then i think yeah like charlton says like the mouse is the thing that made personal computer like that made this infrastructure possible like so the mouse is responsible you know given its kind of relational um position and computing for yeah yeah kind of sustaining um yeah all the violence which which it sustains i don't know yeah right but it's but it's also cool to think about the mouse in that violence in the in the timeline of history that the mouse has like witnessed and then thinking about it in like time in relation to ryan's talk as well is really is really interesting and you know no pressure if you don't feel engaged to this question but i'd be curious mimi or allison if you had like a an interpretation of what the mouse sees as well you just you just you took a breath in mimi as though you were about to you know i definitely gestured to you um but no i mean i'm happy i can also talk i don't have anything um really really i don't know if i have too much significance to add i i don't know i have actually thought about this question because it's just come up it's the same in the conference and because i think loads of people all of the people who have spoken or contributed things over the past two days have had such such lovely little takes around this whereas i just keep thinking about my own mouse i'm like what does my mouth seem too much um or and then i actually end up back at this place this thing that you were coming coming to as well io this mouse is witness as mediator as tool as complicit and then also as not as relational necessarily definitely also as something you know the sea i think i also come back i've been circling around this question so i don't have any good good answers just the little things i'm thinking about the things it brings up i think about how i the c what is the mouse c is prop that c is probably the the thing i struggle with the most and i think why does it have to be c and i think i'm not the only person i other people over the past two days i'm sure have brought this up too because when i think of the mouse i think so much more of touching and sensing rather than seeing and i don't have a good answer but that's that's sort of where i end up yeah i mean if it helps i don't have a good answer either yeah yeah but touch is something we want to talk about yeah yeah yeah and the way in which it's relational we're coming back to that too allison what say you um so i was i'm i'm i'm i'm trying to think about this i don't for some reason i didn't imagine that i could help to to answer this question even though it's right there in the name of the of the conference and i'm on this panel that doesn't have any other uh any other mission other than to talk about the conference um i i think i think the talk that that that really connected with me the most was um david bearing porter's talk um about the the semiotics of the click um something that i i feel like happened in that well didn't didn't really happen in that talk but but um thinking about the click as this like um as this like very rudimentary biometric device that is like constantly recording realtime information about what i'm doing in remote parts of the world um which of course is is very true um that was really disturbing to think about it made me think the the next thing that i jumped to in my mind was like um where like uh heat maps of where people click on a web page and it's just something you can bring up in like analytics tools if you do web development like it will actually show you like a picture of your web page with like you know a heat map of where people are most likely to click that's also what um you can get heat maps of that for where people look when they look at your web page right or at a book or something like that they're actual studies where they show like this is this is where people's eyes are drawn and like the order in which their eyes are drawn to things so i think something that that maybe didn't come out in these talks or maybe that i didn't that i didn't notice is the fact that where you move your mouse also isn't entirely intentional right like the the content the thing that's on your screen is conditioning where your mouse moves the same way that a written text conditions where your eye moves from from one point um or like over time while you're while you're looking at the page like the mouse is um i guess here's here's here's the clever phrasing that i came up with it's like maybe the important question isn't what the mouse sees but where does the mouse look and and where is the gaze of the mouse drawn maybe against our intention right right sorry i feel proud of that i feel like i mean now i just wonder it was nice i'm wondering like um i i'm just now curious to know like in my own uh use of a mouse and my own eyes on the screen where they don't where they match up and where they don't yeah like where my mouse is kind of making its own or my hand is making its own decisions and my eyes are trying to do something else you know like where there's uh tension between those two that would be right it would be interesting to see a heat map of the mouse of mouse movement and mouse clicks over a heat map of eye movements right yeah i feel like very very intense choreography that that definitely people are getting paid a lot of money to to choreograph to make us click on the things they want us to perform right yeah really overlap overlaid across some different kinds of like web styles and seeing what prescribes like what kinds of interactions and things like that's really interesting yeah i think yeah this go ahead mimi i was just gonna say to this to this point it reminds me i have this work which is a video piece but it's sort of a scrolling thing and there's one part of the piece which is that there's a cursor on the screen you can't tell i'm moving my cursor while i'm saying this but there's this cursor on the screen and the cursor is sort of a stand in this mouse which is going to stand in for a person who is moving the mouse and it is meant to really do this exact sort of choreography and like this this moving back and forth that you're talking about alison of directing people in this work not just where to look but also sort of reminding them that it's a piece and there's meant to be somebody else looking at it and so it's something i hadn't thought about until you brought this up but this use of the mouse where the mouse in the i'm not getting paid a lot of money to do this for websites small amounts to make a little work about this but really there is this like implication that this cursor stands in for that leads into this whole network that ties to this mouse who's touching it what you're seeing and then where it directs you and then of course that like takes you back to what the uh the work is about and it just it did just make me think about it in a different way so so thank you i mean there's a there's a question of you know is the input that you're getting from the mouse that does that say something about the individual right um and if it does how deep does that say does that what does that say how deeply does that go um if one thinks about let's say anxiety right um i think there i read a paper in um behavioral and information behavioral informational technology that said uh this study where they tried to see if the um the clicks could if one could measure the anxiety of the individual via the clicks and they found that there was no correlation right but at what point does the mouse and the behavior of the mouse leave the body and move into let's say the screen right or into what mouse sees as opposed to what the individual um as opposed to the as opposed to it coming from the individual right right well this was this is the theme that came up over and over again in the conference was um the movement of the mouse is a kind of um divination and divination and biometrics are like two sides of the same coin um that's interesting it's definitely interesting to think about yeah camila and psy both mentioned divination as part of their talk and camilla kind of as like a surprise at the very end um talking about the mouse is a kind of like planchette something that will allow you to point to things to select things to have like power like to have agency in a particular kind of way like a divinish divination tool which was a was a surprise to us because we didn't we never prompted camilla to go in that direction and i don't think camila knew that psy's talk was entirely about the mouse and detonation but uh it was it was really interesting and i think has really shifted the way that i've thought about the mouse as well same i mean i think just just just thinking about it i like i really like this question at what point does the mouse leave the body i am speechless about it in fact i'm sorry go ahead i just wanted to bring something up from um last computer mouse conference on the panel we talked about uh the singularity right and i think this idea of this question of when the mouse leaves the body has been answered between then and now with um elon musk's um neuro neuro link right and what like is the the the mouse now not being a part of the not being digital fingerwise but now being cerebral um i don't know i think it just raises so many questions uh specifically about at what point does it leave the body or if it does leave the body in the new iterations of the mouth mouse of the mices that we're going to be seeing mouses is yeah yeah wait can you say more about like this cerebral um scary elon musk thing because i don't i feel like i shut down every time neurolink elon musk neuralink just um a few weeks ago demonstrated the they had a a monkey using a joystick to control something to get food they disconnected the joystick and the mouse and the the monkey was still moving the joystick but the signal was coming from the brain and then they finally just moved the joystick and now the the monkey is controlling the cursor on the screen with uh neural activity so it's sort of moving the the control of the mouse away from the digital right before it was connected to the computer physically then it was wireless and now it is brain control well that's really well first of all accurate in the reference to scary um but it's also really interesting because we have spent a ton of time this year talking about the necessity of touch and how it creates new layers of engagement because you have to engage because you have to touch this object and so thinking about some of the things that nabeel has discussed over the conference and and dorothy has discussed over this conference in comparison or in you know in juxtaposition to the story that you're telling i mean like it's it's a little bit it's a little bit spooky to see what could be lost in removing the sense of touch from uh that interaction i think maybe that's an argument for why people won't actually use those neural interfaces is because of the because of the tactileness of it um and also like the the the way that using a mouse is socially embedded um for better or for worse like another thing that i was thinking of with that discussion about gays is the fact that i am extremely attuned right now having been doing like teaching for many many dozens perhaps hundreds of hours over zoom over the course of the past year i know what you're doing based on what your face is doing on the screen right like i can tell if you're scrolling a web page i can tell if you're like typing something on your phone oh my gosh i and that's all based on like and part of the reason that i can do that is because if i'm moving my mouse around the screen like you can see what i'm doing with my gaze right and i can also you know you i can you can hear my mouse click when i'm clicking the mouse even even though we're not in the same place right so there's something it's it's a socially embedded thing as well that i think is desirable um and it would be i don't know it seems to me it seems uh for those reasons because it it gives us presence and it gives us this tactile feedback it seems unlikely that like it purely like like a brain interface pointing device would become popular it also seems kind of i don't know inconvenience messy potentially that sounds but i'm interested to hear what other people think on that on that issue i feel like we've had this promise of like neural interfaces for the past 30 years and they've never actually come to pass right that's that's i think um allison you're you're right except if you get a feedback from from right so what what does it mean to have a neural click how do you satisfy that that you know is it that and it this is all connected to like the more the motor um the motor cortex right so does does the click that comes back does that make you feel as if you have a click on your finger right right um or does it give you some sort of oh i don't even want to think this is horrible um give you like some sort of uh oxytocin release when you click nearly click a like in facebook i mean it already does right yeah yeah i um i just it's making me think of like you know the mouse's genesis and douglas engelbart and his whole the mouse inventors whole kind of thing was to have uh computers and humans in symbiosis it was kind of this like anti uh like autonomous ai move but now like this kind of neural click i think it's like the mouse the mouse is like the thing that's allowed us to even get there but now i'm wondering like you know uh i don't know like what if we had what if like the uh we were able to have like a neural interface a neural computing interface uh before personal like what if this was a possibility before personal personal computers were a possibility and would it even be a click like would it be this kind of way of pointing and clicking would it be something else more sensory i don't know it's it's strange to hold on to like the pointing and clicking in in without having to use like a screen or any kind of interface between you i think uh strange but i feel like this maybe is like doug engelberg's dream where like we're just in symbiosis with like you know in this like intellectual symbiosis with the world around us i don't know yeah well what you say does does remind me of the pattern that we just see over and over again which is the new thing that comes is defined in terms of what was there before and so this that click when you're like what well if this were reversed which is of course hard to even imagine and would mean playing this sort of mental tetris game so many things like at the highest level but the idea of the click not resonating in the way that it does that it does now is so just it's just hard it's hard to to even yeah to fathom you know i agree yeah and i think the the click uh and the way that the click resonates showed up in cesar's talk as like also tied to our nostalgia and i think the reason why we like care about it is because it originated at the time that it did so it's really it's hard to untangle ourselves from all of that to feel something different about it but it's definitely an interesting speculative activity i think that tied to all of this as well beyond the click is the the touch that initiates that click as well that feels like such a necessity as part of the sensory you know i think that uh there's you can see it in all of the designs of the mouses or mice over the last however many years that like they're designed in different ways we were holding a mouse just yesterday that was like this feels like a different kind of personal object and so i think that like there's there's so much about the touch that is also connected to why the click like those two things are really in tandem for a lot of computer users um in shannon madden's talk there was a rapid array of visuals of different computer mice and some of our culture hub collaborators were like that's the mouse i loved in like the early 2000s you know we only love the the love comes from also the experience of the touch that's also connected to the experience of the click because as david said the click is also a switch and different kinds of designs also emit a different kind of sound so it's it's so it's so tight to touch and so one of the things that uh emma and i were talking about was we've just we've just been so um excited about what nabeel was discussing when they were talking about touch nabil was referencing a an instagram bio that they have never been able to resurface but that they wholeheartedly agree with which is that all sensors are touch all senses are touch and nabil encouraged us in the talk to think through touch in a particular kind of way mainly that with every time we hear the click of the mouse we think about all the hands that the mouse was in before it got to our hands um which was really convenient because it tied into mindy sue and ali nas interview article i don't know if you wanted to read that yeah i read this quote yesterday but this is ali's quote they say using the computer mouse actually enhances your capacity to have touch and to touch space there were these ergonomic studies that show that the more you use the computer mouse the more your body is capable of sensing touch around it for me for ali this was this radical shift it's really connected to dorothy's work as well we're taking you on a journey through the conference and realizing we've been talking for like six minutes about everybody we like at the conference i think we i mean i think we are it there's something i think because we started with this question what does the mouse see which is so much in this like visual field this like nontouch kind of realm i think when people just kind of brought touch up into that question um it's something that we both really responded to and we think we were i mean our question is um and we're thinking about how we were taught technology like how we were taught to work with technical objects and how we were taught to make them and break them et cetera at itp other places and so we're wondering like how how would one create pedagogy that creates like more space to acknowledge like the importance of touch or like the the kind of ways in which touch is like very much embedded in these things which seemingly have not very much to do with touch yeah um even the object history dorothy talks about all the women particularly women who've been weavers in their black and brown indigenous communities who have touched circuits that have been embedded touched to design and build the circuits that have been embedded inside of our tech like how do we create space to acknowledge them how do we create space to like revere and appreciate that skill instead of like the or maybe just instead of is my is my bias but maybe alongside the doug engelbartz or alongside some of these other people who have been integral to technology out of our tech like how do we create space to acknowledge them how do we create space to like revere and appreciate that skill instead of like the or maybe just instead of is my is my bias but maybe alongside the doug engelbart's or alongside some of these other people who have been integral to technology secondary question is that a question well there's another there's another just like i think we wanted to like just touch on those things but also um i think uh we're wondering how much weight that each of you give in your practices to touch in the things that you make like it's touch something that is important to the things that you're that you're making and that you're putting out into the world but also because you all teach so also just from a pedagogical standpoint also if touch uh is important in specifically in teaching in like a tech in a tech space i think where like it's not i mean yeah i think it depends on what kinds of tech spaces you're in but you know as an opening to maybe a response because we have taken you on a journey you know io for instance you spend so much time connecting with communities that have both in a real time historical sense and in a fictitious speculative sense thinking about how people have designed usually people of color have designed technology and i wonder if you're could you imagine how we might create more pedagogical space to hold them at the center of our tech education like how could we hold them in the in the center of that yeah absolutely i mean i i think back to a student that i had at parsons that talked about the fact that his grandmother would say that she was native um indigenous native american right and he said in his thesis talk that that was not true and i countered and i said wait what do you mean that was not true it was true for her she needed to construct that story right and to to to be able to survive and you know this is also about this about um hardness um critical tabulation right and the the construction of these these identities these speculative spaces um that allow for that allow for survive survival so thinking on that in relation to the mouse you know if we say that there is this history of oppression that's attached to it um how do we create new spaces um how do we how how can we create new spaces to rethink that and then i think what's really key there is then how do we make those real spaces real so how do we make mice mouses is that let's say when they scroll against a video of um of a black body actually being extra judicially killed will not uh excuse me i'm on on the call here um that will not um allow you to you know play the video or that will twist that twist or re or supposed reality into that fabulation and i think for for that you know it's touch is absolutely important i'm thinking about teaching over the pandemic and actually not being able to demonstrate to students you know this is how you connect wires together here take the battery stick it on your tongue this is you know what it feels like i think physicality being in proximity um and touching is absolutely critical yeah yeah well i wasn't expecting this hypothetical mouse that you're describing i wasn't expecting uh the idea that like a mouse could avoid certain actions or could um change our reality as you're describing i think it's really really interesting and i guess also just like helps me sort of sort of think about how we how when we say how do we create space in pedagogy it can it can be in lots of different ways and outside of the classroom and in terms of technological design as well alison how much weight do you give touch in your practice i think it would we were really curious as a person who works in like tech and poetics um i don't know it's a super interesting question i let me think about it for a second i think i think that there there's like a really easy way to turn that question into because when you think about um language and touch primarily what i do is i work with language you start thinking about physical materials right like the the paper and the ink on the paper and things like that um and i think that's something that i've been trying to emphasize in my own work recently is thinking about thinking about physical material and thinking about how how the material substrate of of writing is something that you know can be a part of the piece even if you are working with computation which otherwise tries to abstract language in various ways but i i want to i i'm i don't want to limit that idea of touch just to like that physical dimension of it even though that i feel like that's where we're going to be drawn automatically even though i don't know what else i'm going to say counts as touch in that in that area i think um what i try to do in my own practice in my teaching is trying to bring out embodiedness um and that's not the same thing as touch but um always making sure to emphasize with linguistic artifacts and especially digital linguistic artifacts that they they come from the body they come from speech acts that have been recorded turned into data um whether those are speech acts from like somebody talking or speech from somebody typing or speech from somebody like using their phone or maybe using their mouse to type i don't know of anybody that does that but it's certainly possible um and that we make it physical when it comes out of the computer so emphasizing like both parts of that and how the output depends on the physical output depends on the physical input um and that's sort of like i feel like that's like sort of a super set of of touch um but i think that's the best that's the best answer that i have for that from a pedagogical standpoint i think um the it's really an uphill battle to make students care about that issue because i don't think we're we're not just talking about like tactileness here if we can if we can usefully separate these two categories like something that involves feeling and something that involves touch which i think we're talking about in like a more specific way isn't like uh uh an encounter with the actual material the material of the world and not just like the thing that's predetermined by the abstraction of the system that we're talking about i think that um where the glitz is and where the money is in technology right now is in those systems that abstract away the material history of the of of the artifacts that we're using right um to make them replaceable so that we have an infrastructure where you know you upgrade to the next thing and everything works seamlessly and and things like that um so that's that i think is like really the difficult thing to do in pedagogy is to say like i know you're super into this new machine learning model that came out um but we need to think about how that actually came into existence like we can't just use it as it is yeah um so getting students to sort of like understand that the thing that has all of this like shininess to it um uh may need to be further uh investigated and not even to like a critical like i'm not saying that every single uh interactive art piece needs to be a critical interactive art piece um but just getting students to consider that extra step is is kind of a struggle fortunately i've had students like you who didn't need to be controlled to cajole to you to do that um yeah yeah mimi what do you what do you think about that actually i have so many thoughts i'm trying to put them in order i've been trying to put them in order this whole time and then they get more jumbled as i listen listen to the other two talk um maybe i'll start first with the first that original question that y'all you would ask when the two of you were going back and forth in this lovely way when you said how you the two of you said you're thinking about touch and thinking about the way you've been taught technology and how do we create space for that yeah and i think that the answer to that is kind of simple and very complicated and the simple part is we just do and the complicated part is to do that in a way that doesn't rely upon the tools that we already have or the particular ways in which we know to create space for things um i'm gonna try to make that make sense i think that in some like i think you know so much of what we've inherited in a lot of the spaces that we are in and especially the university as an institutions machine as complicit and involved and so in the maintenance of so much is of course site is foregrounded and sight is very much about legibility and i i guess the thing i'm trying to or to figure out how to articulate is that in making room for other senses and also putting them not just senses other ways of knowing because i think that's really what we're talking about yeah that might also demand not having them be it doesn't it's not like touch but make it visible show me how we're doing touch in the same way i don't think i think it means coming at this from a completely different point and really thinking well what are other ways of knowing and maybe it's not in the same tradition that we've inherited in the classroom maybe this is something else and maybe it means thinking like also push pulling away from some of the the hierarchies for what we think of as something being uh foregrounded or centered which is like it's on a syllabus and you know we talk about it in a class maybe that means a different way of approaching things entirely which i realize is a kind of is a i know it's a slippery thing um a slippery thing to hold but i think i also feel this way because i i also really enjoyed uh nibile's a talk i loved what they were as oft as as always i loved what they were saying and i and i but then i also was like oh i'm not really ready to i still you know we're jumping to touch i'm still here thinking about sound too i think there's something so immediate about sound and this click and what you know with sound it's sound is about this temporality something you often it suggests the kind of like embeddedness and connectedness as well and so that's not to say oh this is more important but maybe part of what we're talking about is a kind of fluidity of being able to switch between different ways of knowing and be okay with that depending on what it is that we are trying to know and how and who with because i do think also a lot of this is connected to when i think of touch i think of all of these i'm we're thinking of a kind of relationality and relationships and connectedness um or at least that's what i am thinking yeah i think like one one very very simple and i'm not sure if it's effective uh way to to do this is when i'm teaching to try to break as much as possible the the myth that the computational abstraction is actually encompasses the the phenomena that it claims to encompass um and that's like the whole history of computation has that idea that eventually like everything will come underneath computational control everything will be part of a computational ontology that we will eventually be able to understand the entire world as a sequence of zeros and ones and like at a very basic level like just saying to students like no that isn't the case every computer program every computational interface is is a take on that it's somebody's opinion about it that they've turned into a system in order to express that opinion or you know turn that opinion into something that controls other people um so just just trying to point that out like every single time very insistently that like even though the person who made this maybe claims that this tells us everything about motion movement language in my case or whatever it's actually just like one potential take on that that has its own thank you do you are we allowed to ask questions too [Laughter] how does that how does does that work do you find i say i don't know what that means for that to work but well yeah exactly like i mean have i done like a user study in a survey and like use cases and have i subjected it to design methodology so yeah i don't know if it works i mean it feels good so um i say that because i think what you're saying is for me just one of i think the best strategies is this taking something and saying actually this is not the one way this is a way which means that there are other ways and that you know usually that it's like a practice i think for me i think now i'm thinking in the classroom and thinking about it uh pedagogically that that is a practice of undoing for me and for like the students that we're often doing together right but i think also it's the that there are other ways but those other ways are also intertwined with the way right with this with any particular way i i'm thinking also about this you know we've been talking a lot about click about touch about sound as if they're as if they're different right um when it's a click right it's not just a click right it's also the sound it's also where you are at that time there's all of the all these senses are or are wrapped into um into one so it might be a sort of understanding of the totality of the senses at i'm going to say at those particular times or at those particular moments and maybe i don't know maybe trying to suss something out through that right right yeah i think that i mean i i think i agree like when we're talking about touch that it is we're also just talking about different ways of knowing um and it makes me think like yeah can we i also had this thought like do we just need to like yeah suss out more this idea that like maybe the mouse is like what we're doing in our hand is different from what we're doing with our eyes and that like that whatever's happening there in like the touch phenomena space um you know like that we could just privilege that or privileged sound like just privilege these things more than we do and that that might tell us something new about like how we think or how we come to know that like how we where intelligence actually is like it's not necessarily just in like your like it's in your body you know it's it's it's it's outside your body also too so right yeah yeah we've been thinking about how different computational devices also satisfy different kinds of senses like the same way that maybe like a joystick might satisfy a different kind of like arm and hand sensory experience than like a mouse would um and a keyboard as well in different ways we have a con we have like a risky question um not risking a nefarious way risky in terms of like what we have built but could this conference be about any other object like do you think that this could be about a different thing than the computer mouse like all of what we were talking about could we be just scooping it and talking about it on top of a completely different object keyboard like the keyboard that's a bad example but like i feel like you know yeah any other kind of technical object yeah are y'all trying to pivot are you trying to get ideas from us we're trying to crowdsource ideas we're like when we were talking about this earlier we're like oh gosh like should we ask this question i hope people aren't going to be like when's the joystick conference when's the yeah i'm putting together the joystick conference next year i'll have it on the same day as a mouse conference no i'm not going to do that um i like that question because i i think about it in terms of what i would tell my students right um there's so much in the in the computer mouse and i almost feel like say it should just go deeper and deeper and deeper right um there's something so wonderful about everybody that that um that spoke um what presented just new information um and i wonder how how how how much information is in is in this um i'm eager to find out i don't know i think i'll go because i keep stealing the coveted last spot um i think i think for me the answer is yeah it could be but that doesn't make this any less it doesn't make this any less important and useful though i think it could be in that way of just the beauty of focusing on something and then doing that allows you to see so much more and then it shows you all these different relationships and connections and that in itself is a really wonderful act and practice that i think the two of you along with this community that you've assembled have been demonstrating over the years so i yeah yes and that's not a bad thing yeah i think i mean it's i think that's sort of like asking like could this reading be about a different tarot card right um and so like like maybe said yes like you know if we if we drew the the seven of pentacles instead of the ace of swords or whatever the reading would be different but the methodology that you would bring to that reading would be would be substantively the same right um i think i think the facts um that that you're enthusiastic about the conference or about the topic about the mouse as an object like he gives an engine to this this conference that it's actually really difficult to find an engine that can drive organizing and events and getting people to to come together around it so that's that's pretty remarkable um and just being able to like you know talk to shannon matcher and say like you know just pull a random card out of the deck and say like here's the topic of your talk and then have shout out to matcher and do it that's like that's kind of a superpower right um so i i think i agree with mimi like yeah you could do it on a different topic but but there's something about the confluence of interest and and personnel and also this object that you're talking about computer mouse which has so many interesting affordances when we're talking about researching it um and thinking about it and and using it and clicking with it that i think kind of makes it a unique confluence it's such a great constraint it's it's a beautiful constraint and you know like that is what drives really really good design it's like you have a constraint you just have to work within it i think sort of thinking about what sort of iterations right um so for example if one year the conference is about making um computer mice mouses mouse mouse yeah um that could be i'm going to continue that that could be like right yeah it reminds me of the um the like 10 years ago uh rhizome did a conference about ecigarettes was anybody there for that i would just like sound like sound off in the chat if you were there and i i for a very long time just thought that was completely ridiculous that was just like just like the height of like um doing something super like trendy in order to gain interest around it um now i'm like bad knocking people i don't even know who i'm about but now i can like that it's okay to sit one out right like even though this was like an important event at rhizome it was like it was fine for me not to care about ecigarettes and incorporate them into my practice um but i think what this conference is showing me is that like actually you can gather people together around a topic that maybe doesn't have this you know this immediate like um isn't isn't obviously urgent right um but then like actually show how it is urgent and how people how paying attention to that thing can can actually give can be valuable and and fun and interesting and what do you what do you two think yeah and he's out here really asking all the questions we shouldn't have we shouldn't have let her ask ask that question about asking questions it's really making me miss being um in class with both you allison and mimi um because it's just a familiar dynamic uh um but yeah i think i mean like the computer mouse now through doing this conference i think it's become this like like now it's like this this this like meta subject for me which which yeah has to do with like what it means to study something through through a limit through such a limited object and so i'm curious i mean i am curious like what um what are like the meta things that can be pulled out from this conference that might not be true in a conference about a joystick like what are the things that are unique to the mouse in its limits like it's not just that it's a limited small object i think that there is there are some like um unique limits that i can't name right now but i think if i were to like study back on this conference and all the content and the conversation that's come out of it um that that i don't know it would say something new about the mouse that i haven't been able to say yet um yeah and also i mean we've talked about like you know we we did this conference for the first time last year while we were in grad school and we've talked about running a class like that there's just like confidence as class like hey you have an idea like you can do a conference and it's actually a really kind of like amazing way to stretch your research like it's a really amazing way to like think differently about what you think about all the time and to get other people uh to think with you and it's kind of like a vulnerable act um yeah it's definitely vulnerable because i mean shout out to the poor person who created the ecigarettes conference i mean people could really just pull you into pieces right and say like this is the conference is amazing it might be like the most important intellectual events of the century for all i know definitely not i mean there's probably there's probably probably shouldn't have even said that thing about i mean there's definitely allison's out there thinking that about this conference there have to be sure like 10 what a joystick conference or a trackpad conference would mean might that elucidate um the distinction with the mouse right what what what uh what sort of regimes um uh are there within a trackpad or joist i mean the joystick definitely right like militaristic blah blah blah right but how does that distinguish itself from the mouse right that might be a good way to start thinking about yeah that's super cool and and also i don't know where if you all have done sort of looking at the production of mice right and sort of looking at the manu like going into the into the manufacturing um bring in people that actually make um the companies that make it um mice um come to the conference and maybe maybe there's something there as well right totally yeah well for me in terms of this question you know i i think about this question a lot because emma and i we kind of it's like almost like a longstanding joke in a way and a longstanding like serious question in a way but you know yesterday we talked about the origin of this conference and a conversation that happened um in our grad program where um you know emma had just presented some research and i like went over to her in an attempt to make friends as well and to say like you know this could be a whole conference this could be a whole conference on the mass and the initial idea was that we had version one was that everybody at this conference would make their own mouse just as you said io that the initial idea was that cool we'll bring everybody together you make your mouse from the positionality of like what it means to you to hold this object and what holding an object signifies for your own for your own discipline or your own creative practice or your own life and i think you know thinking about that in relationship to like psy's physical object for uh divination is really exciting because that's i imagine what we what what could have manifested if the converse if the conference was all about like creating one mouse per person i think that uh for me it's been really exciting to have the things that i care about outside of this show up inside of this so all of the things that i care about in my in my practice broadly around like racism and like dismantling systems of oppression through technology in terms of like acknowledging like black and brown and indigenous women who are like unsung heroes and unsung like the unsung oppressed demographics of some of this technology i've been really shocked and excited to see that content show up in this conference because when i when we started this i wasn't imagining that it would be so so often that that talks would emerge both last year and this year that talk about like the politics of labor that talk about like the politics of like gender and race um and uh the politics of the body so i wonder what that would look like in another object but i am also just like so convinced now that those things that everything is interconnected and everything is embedded inside of everything and that the mouse has been like an incredible conduit to just doubling down on all of that research that exists mouseless in the rest of my practice you know yeah i mean so charlton charlton i think like he says uh the mouse is fundamentally relational and i don't know just the way that he said it with such uh i don't know eviction yeah i i i think that is the thing that allows for this conference to happen in the way that it does i mean i i don't think that a joystick conference would be quite like this um it wouldn't be quite as generative i don't know maybe i have no idea one maybe one limitation on the mouse conference is that there is and this came up in the in the chat box chat there's the the frison of nostalgia like shooting through it yeah so i don't know if like 10 years or 20 years from now when when the people who would be organizing a conference like this may never have actually held and that was right right um they wouldn't have that same connection to it right right also by my suggestion for next year would be like mouse mouse conference but you can't mention douglas engelbart i love that just completely forbidden you can't share the image of like the first mouse with like the two little gear heads that move perpendicular to each other yes like off off limits i've been i've been um trying to i like i've been joking that i'm kind of like a doug engelbert look like she's dressed she's dressed as him today just yeah just just repeat replace every mention of duggan will part with emma and it's all good um yeah i think you know we're we're like 10 minutes from the end the the stream is five minutes behind us so this request might come in five minutes from now but if you have questions for our panelists the chat is chaotic it is very exciting but it's also hard to sift questions from it because everyone is responding to each other's questions so maybe if you could write question at the header of your of your line and then write that question afterwards we can ask that question to the panelists um but uh yeah so if you have a question please drop it in the chat and we'll we'll uh make sure that we get we'll try our best to get to it um and i think you know in in the meantime uh we wanted to just sort of kind of land in our portion of this on the topic of fundamental fundamental relationality um and really you know going back to charlton we've quoted this so many times over the course of the conference but um charlton talks about how the mouse also forces us to take stock of what we see and how we see it um david uh bearing porter's call to action is to become more aware of the kind of multiplied meaning of clicking and the kind of currency that it has within surveillance capitalism for instance and so we were hoping that maybe you could comment a little bit on how we might create a new practice of intentionality knowing all of this how do we create a new practice of intentionality with with the operation of the mouse and clicks or is that even possible so we'll sort of like send that question over to the panelists now and then again like if you have questions drop them into the chat clearly and we will try to also pose this to the panelists too i'm searching for questions in the meantime yeah so what how could we create a practice of intentionality around how we click or is it possible alison you're smirking a lot i don't know if you've got an incredible answer you like really look like you've got something smart i think i think i've got the the 90 minutes into the panel uh whoopsie doozies uh and i'm trying to think of an answer to that and i can't i can't come up with with anything i think i mean so one thing that i do is i don't do any kind of metrics tracking on my websites at all i don't include google analytics um i have no idea who's visiting my websites i'm not interested in your mouse movements i don't know how far down you scrolled anything like that um i could probably benefit from having that information um but i don't i don't capture it because i don't think that that's any of my business um and that's something that's really small but maybe it counts i don't know i like this question um i mean it's kind of related to what we were saying like how long until the mouse is a pointing icon like the floppy disk has been forgotten and renamed like how long it wait maybe i'm reading this wrong um i think i mean i'm reading the question as like how long until like the pointing icon i think how long until like obsolesces like when is the mouse going to become obsolete like it seems to like i think for a while i thought it was like this forgotten device and it was already on its way out but it seems to really still be here it's really like a main kind of tool for a lot of people who do like heavy work on their computer um i have one that i use i've been using it this whole time it's wired and everything it's wired wow that's great yeah uh i have go ahead i know three three three three three three of them right here wow i don't know why [Laughter] um i guess since we're doing this one one really old school i'm like embarrassed to even even have a ball yeah listen i didn't expect to be asked to show this i was like no one has to know actually my um my track pad broke and then i went back to my my old school mouse and i serving me well um i can i take a stab yeah at the question that you had asked which was about intentionality in relation to the mouse and i think that there are some there are some really clear questions clear answers like allison actually gave one that was really nice and really direct and there's we can talk about ewaste and talk about um oh that is trippy to see myself with double meanings wow i'm seeing myself playing ah this is awful wow okay i'm going to try it out it's very it's very mysterious because we just see one mimi so you're seeing into some other digital world than we're seeing [Laughter] wow yeah there we go now it's better no it's better um well i was gonna say there are some answers to that question around this this how do we have a more intentional um kind of i don't know whatever with the mouse along the lines of um what who david and charlton were both saying and in their talks yesterday i think or to i can't remember i don't know um and yeah i feel like there's a part of this that is about the mouse specifically where it's like oh what allison had said already around clicks and surveillance and tracking and there's also thing i think of ewaste and just this kind of question of oh my gosh just the turning over of equipment and that lifeline and what that looks like and where they come from so on there's so many questions there but i also think that the question you're asking is great because it is as much about the mouse as it is about everything else that has to do with the mouse and so that question of intentionality to me you know we're talking about relationality but relation up the mouse is a relational object but even within relationship it's how do i say this oh my gosh y'all i j i'm telling you the shot i'm like affected i just got this second vaccine shot today everyone knows um that's what i'm talking about not like uh not like not like a shot that i took oh okay relationality within relationality i think also that you need to speak about hierarchy because hierarchy is a form of relation of of relationships and part of the cause of being intentional i think means being aware not just of how things are connected to each other but the ways in which they are and how that differently impacts different folks and of course we've already talked about how black and brown people are like when we these systems often supposedly at the margins but really at the center um but like told we're not at the center and so i that's what i come to oh i'm hitting the 90 minute mark too i don't know if that made sense i hope so oh lord good luck to y'all i think it makes sense i tried i mean i just think um acknowledging that uh in relationality we have to also acknowledge hierarchy uh is that that hit pretty hard over here at the 90minute mark yeah some some rephrasings of that question somebody wrote oh sorry io uh one one quick thing yeah i just wanted to say like a reframing of that question that i enjoyed was like this question posed uh line 844 what would a low click diet look like and i think that's like a different adaptation of what we asked which i think is like very i love that phrasing um uh sorry io go right ahead i i think i'm going to try to tackle the obsolescence question i don't i um from what i've learned from this conference um the mouse is not going to go extinct because the mouse is not what this is not the mouse right the mouse existed before this this you know is just a standin for something and i think that that's something is that ability to that and it comes from maybe from the digit right the ability to sort of point the ability to manipulate um so i i don't think that the mouse would ever um disappear it would transform right but i think the question should really be in the ability to manipulate right would it always with the mouse in whatever form it it's in would it always have that same type of power to oppress or is there a way to change that the way the way of the finger that points or the the the and even you know projectiles missiles guns right um is there those always existed it's just gonna change form is there a way to change the way that they interact and i think that's really the question is there a way to change the way the mouse interacts um whether it's a finger whether it's a a stick or whether it's a mouse right yeah yeah right i think i think that phrasing of like what would a low click diet actually be like i think that phrasing is revealing because you know the idea of a diet is also somebody gets sold right um like when you go on a when you go on a diet with food you just buy different food products that are specifically marketed to people who are going on a diet right so even even trying to envision like even trying to envision an intentionality around it um the metaphor that comes to mind for that immediately to people is like you know doing something else that's already preconditioned by by by capitalism right right right right yeah i oh you're um um so we're we're at like the like one minute okay does i owe your your comment about um i don't know the possibility of changing the power of the pointing act i think that's how i understood it like it right like is there is there a possibility for like shifting um the like oppressive power of the of the point pointer and it just reminded me of jonathan zong's essay that he wrote for the conference and um he's he's kind of he's talking about in hci this idea of like you know like we think we are we are in in this power position we are clicking we are like moving data around et cetera but the computer is also like acting back on us um and so i don't know i just wondered if in your question that has something to do like whatever's on the other side of like the pointing i guess like i don't know in terms of computers like what needs to be there in order for it to act back on us and is that something that like we need to pay more attention to right yeah i mean i i think um allison um alluded to this a little bit it's this this onion of capitalism right that you know it's not it's not the mouse clicking and you know that it's the system that we're that's embedded in that enables or you know that because we don't have if we don't have a mouse to click i'm sure capitalism will create a space for something else to do that same thing right that's what capitalism does so i think thinking about this within these systems um these onion systems i call them and this also goes um to a point on pedagogy um and educational institutions as well like it's all embedded within these systems that enable and create space for these objects that then do the extraction yeah and yet i completely agree with you i just want to make sure we don't end on the the note that i feel like everything i participate in ends on because it's right where it's like capitalism eats everything it just takes it you know it coops it and that's true and yet at the same time we do see so or at least i feel like i've seen so many different moments where despite that there are these little like you know these wonderful glimpses of okay this is a different way we can use this we can think of this little this device in a different way and it can allow us to open up some different ways of being that push against capitalism and push against racial capitalism and i think in many ways that is some of the space that y'all have created in this conference thank you yes it's amazing we'll join us next year for the mouse conference number three why not ecigarettes as the theme joystick like mashup yeah exactly i want i want to thank you all so much and also allison and mimi my heart goes out to you all you know i miss you all yeah um in the in the coming times we might see each other physically somewhere yeah yeah yeah me too adore all of y'all thank you so much yeah thank you so much so so fun so nice to be with you all i know and i'm so glad mimi that you were able to be with us the whole 90 minutes even though you got a shot you don't know how much i'm like holding it yeah in a minute i'm about to melt okay yeah thank you so much and we we have been so lucky to be in person doing this like it feels like a dream honestly meg like just it's beyond belief that emma is truly like the only person outside my family and roommate that i have seen in person in so long and we are still so far apart um even though it doesn't look like it in this graphic uh but i i really feel like the three of you are here with us and i think that's a lot of culture hubs magic in in all of the technology that they've used to make this feel really intimate even though we're remote and even though we are you know in various states of spiraling as ingrid burnington said at the beginning of the conference so um thank thank you so much for the three of you for joining us and thank you so much for to culturehub for being able to make us feel like we just hung out for 90 minutes we're on the big screen there right yeah you're on the big screen you're on like you're here you're you're up on a table you're also in the in the um dressing room in the screen so many different places yeah um i think we've got a lot of people to think so maybe we'll go through that list now okay yeah you do we can the panelists can yeah can go we can we can let you go live your lives but thank you again thank you so much it was such an extraordinary pleasure and there's more action in the chat so if you wanted to go take a look at all the beautiful things people had to say about you but we'll let you we'll let you go thank you thank you bye bye oh my gosh we did it wow we made it end of computer mouse conference 2021 yeah a million thank yous yeah thank you to everyone um who's still hanging out on the site watching like um we're so thankful for your presence we're so thankful for all the ascii art and all of your contributions in the chat um i guess yeah i want to especially thank culturehub uh deandra anthony songmanchei maddie barber bachmann billy clark um for supporting us and getting a lot like i don't know helping us set up this insane setup that we're in um and getting to do this with you all it's been really really amazing so there's so there's so many people behind the scenes yeah um that cluster of people made us feel like we were all together yeah which is a miracle in covent times the other cluster of people behind the scenes i mean hopefully you've got in a different tab neto bomani zim playing because oh my gosh like in some moments i felt distracted by this scene because it's so beautiful and i'm like right we have to host this i forgot so neda thank you so much for being such an incredible foundation like honestly like the skeletal structure of how we'll look back on this conference and the coding train has been streaming this zine and you know which also seems so incredible because what uh what a what an what a different piece of content for the coding train to be streaming so we're just incredibly grateful for the just the space and the trust that the coding train has had in letting us stream this zine and collaborating so vigorously with our team and with neda to make it as beautiful as possible with the like most effort as possible um thanks to dan schiffman who was championing this in in many ways including uh the design of the bot that allowed for people to contribute to the zine because that has been instrumental in designing something that people could feel connected to even though we're all like separated and we're not able to like hand meta a piece of paper that we wrote on to include in the scene you know i'm i'm i'm so excited to go look at the stream of the scene after this yeah we also have the processing foundation to thank for helping us be able to host this event and pay the brilliant minds that have spoken at yesterday and today um we are also in enormous gratitude to the media archaeology lab for similar reasons for really making it possible for us to bring so many people together everyone's in like various levels of financial insecurity i i can only assume because of the situation that we're in and so we're so grateful to be able to run this conference and also pay people to participate in this conference as well yes big shout out to media archaeology lab and processing and the coding train for for supporting us and thank you to all of you for purchasing tickets to directly support the participants and um culture hub yeah exactly and you know thank you to all the speakers who i can't like and ed who run who ran the workshop because this everything everybody is excited about is is really coming back to all of the points um inside of the talks and i really hope that we did it justice to have your talks like referenced in other places like you know we did it because we we were so blown away by the content but i host i also hope you felt the thread of your work over the course of the two days because i i think people have been um weaving with us all of the pieces of your of your talk uh throughout the evening up until this point totally um i think also i so this this will we we did record this so this whole conference uh the chat and the stream will be archived on this website um shareable at some point um what else do we need to say um i think you know our our incredible writers mindy sue alina jonathan zhang really wonderful work that you can go continue to read and continue to engage with um huge thank you to you for giving us some uh some written content to participate in as well um and i i think we've thought i think i mean thank you emma thank you so thankful i'm reminded that we had this idea to do like an open gratitude might we're just yeah that we didn't anyway i have so much gratitude for you in doing this with you um that's right uh we will be doing this again so our computer mouse conference schedule is um every one year and a half we've decided that'll be um fall 2020 2022. we'll see you again hopefully some kind of inperson and online mixup would be cool i think because i think being online with all of you is really fun this year in
