hi I'm Dan schiffman and I wrote this book called the nature of code the question I started with in my mind is what are the things that exist in the natural world that are beautiful surprising complex and how can those things be simulated with code this book is for someone who just learned to code especially if you just learned creative coding with processing or p5js and you want to explore a little bit further maybe you've been intimidated by different algorithms that you see you want to dabble in concepts of machine learning but I would just love to see what you're making with the book um in particular the coding Train website has a whole set of video tutorials that go along with the topics in the book and each one of those tutorials on its page has something called the passenger showcase where you can submit your own creative variations of the examples in the nature of code share them with me and share them with other visitors to the website as well
