do do do do do do check one two just testing my audio i'm trying to get this live pole thing going but it's not working just yet hold on ah i don't have enough time please give me some time all right rewinding the music back a minute do do do hello good morning happy friday on the coding train it is me dan your host coming to you live from an attic in brooklyn um i'm a little bit discombobulated i suppose that's what i say every time i live stream um but i was attempting to get this um live poll thing working um and i must be missing something um because it didn't work the way i expected it to i don't know if this is how i should open but everything is all all awry here let me start over hello happy friday welcome to the coding train it is me dan your host coming to you live from an attic in brooklyn maybe this is the first time you're watching the coding train live if you are if it is welcome thank you for joining um i am a very disorganized person who just like throws this stuff together at the last minute so please be kind be generous talk amongst yourselves in the chat thank you to marek for a very kind super chat that just came in much appreciated um i have a list of topics to get to today i also would like to just sort of give you the latest in coding train news update you on my schedule tell you a little bit about what videos are coming out in the future um and just sort of hang out here for uh i am not wearing a watch but um hang out for like one two three four five hairs and a freckle about that no time i expect i'll be done at around 12 30 p.m eastern let me say hello to a few folks in the chat hello to fox the bomb and coder prith and marek and victor um and all that this is kind of amazing marek said he said my name but somehow i don't understand how you possibly there's usually like at least a 30 second to one minute delay but in any case oh let me also uh before i forget um um thank uh one of today's or the today's the sponsor there's only one sponsor folks and that is brilliant um i personally like to learn my maths from my geometry mug over here uh which everybody should have their own geometry mug this by the way was purchased in bletchley park if you've ever been to bletchley park one of my favorite trips i ever had the chance to go on uh i was in the uk for a little while and i actually went to blessing park twice or three times i loved it so much but um another way that you can learn um is um by watching me on youtube you know your mileage may vary with that strategy but i can tell you that a very productive and positive way to learn is through interactive lessons where you get to try stuff out on your own supported by a community of other folks who are interested and brilliant is a place where you can do that i've been following the geometry fundamentals course that's on brilliant i'll come back and halfway through and try to do the next exercise that i have not looked at yet since last time i live streamed so i'm excited to try to do that you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain um and you could if you know if you want to unlock all of their premium content all their courses the first 200 people to do so through that link will get 20 off all right so what's happening today uh oh will says in the chat i am sitting here right now only three miles away from bletchley park oh i am jealous i am many many many miles away from fletchley park right now i would love to be able to visit there again i haven't really done any traveling beyond uh places that you can reach by motor vehicle within a few hours from new york city um in over a year so i don't know when my next actual like airplane trip or trip to uh you know across water a giant body of water by a boat might be actually one thing that i did this is a little little little uh tidbit stories from the coding train um i have lived in new york city um since 1995 so about 26 years if i'm doing the math correctly there for the first time ever really i think i mean that i can remember recall at least earlier this week i took a ferry from manhattan to brooklyn because i was running an errand and i was doing some jogging and i was like oh there's a ferry goes here from this pier to this pier and it was absolutely amazing just public transportation not a tourist ferry or anything but i felt like i was on some magical journey so highly recommend that um all right so um let's see are there people here watching you know it was a little bit street what huh i don't know what's going on ah concurrent viewers there we go there are there are there are a fair amount of you here um um anyone hanging out in the discord for the live chat yes me me i'm in the discord i'm in the youtube chat got them all up here on my console so here's the main thing that i want to look at today if all else if i get to nothing else at all the main thing that i want to look at today is something called move net which is here this is a ultra fast and accurate model that detects 17 key points of a body oh hi celeste come over here so i'm fostering an elderly lady cat oh my god she just gave me a very weird little meow can you hear her meow i'm afraid to pick her up she's a little bit sensitive um but we've got we've got a lot of animals going on in this house she's a 13 year old cat whose owners sadly um passed away and she was left all alone in a shelter and quite terrified and so we've taken her in with our other two younger cats and gloria pickle who you may recognize from some of my videos but she seems to like to be up here in the attic she's giant she's a really big cat hi is this not what you signed up for me talking to a cat that you cannot even see you know hold on a second let's make this a little bit more interesting for you all so you know what i'm talking about here can i get this to work um i'm adding a video capture device epocam oh boy that's a bit extreme all right let's see if i can get my phone oh no celeste she's going away don't go celeste don't go i'm just about to try to get you on camera uh connecting to your computer oh there we are there's me all right let's see if we can find you oh why is it it's there we go celeste there's celeste okay everybody come here okay okay celeste a tual is her name a little peek into my attic and my green screen i think i can shut this off now and close that down where were we move net so you might you might remember me from my videos like uh ml5 pose estimation with pose net so posnet is hey posenet is a machine learning model that estimates key points on a body um and it was developed by researchers i believe at google it's one of the models from tensorflow.js and it's always worked quite well i assume if i go to this page here and just click on the web editor version of the code if my website works as it's supposed to um there we go we can see here this is my exam postnet example that i developed for this particular video tutorial now the question is uh is movenet in theory is perhaps a improvement in theory so from what i hear on posenet and i'm wondering if um it is something that should be added to ml5 as an option so load a pose detection model choose pose net or move net or just simply replace it so i wanted to do a little exploring of this model today so that's kind of my main agenda item i should also mention that if you go to thecodingtrain.com you might notice that a new coding challenge video was released yesterday so for all of you who have been saying over and over again on many of my recent video releases that have been some beginner p5 and some nature of code videos like where are the coding challenges where are the coding challenges i missed the coding challenges here is one so um the question is and i actually haven't looked what's the chance that there are any community contributions to this coding challenge no no you could be the first there have not been made there haven't been made it seems like there haven't been made i think i need to work on some of the copy are you a writer if you are a writer um and would like to contribute i kind of feel like i want to go take a pass over all of my materials and rewrite everything and create kind of a style guide for descriptions and the language that's on the website so reach out to me if you uh have any ideas for how to um create sort of friendly fun welcoming um language little quirky to describe all that i do here on the coding train because not my skill set um but you could add your own community contribution i was hoping i might have some to show let's look at all the the various examples from this um just so you know what you're getting yourself into if you choose to watch this video so this is the core basic example every time i run it it runs a selfavoiding walk which is a random walk which will take a step um to a new spot in this grid but it can't go to a spot it's already been to so um so we can see the results of that here this actually this example is completed within the first 12 minutes of the video it's a 40 approximately 40 minute video but this example is completed in the first 12 minutes because the next thing that i attempt to do which takes me quite a bit longer is add something known as backtracking so what you'll notice the difference here is what you'll notice the difference here is whenever it gets to a point where it has no other option it backs up and tries to go in different directions one of the things i discovered while recording this video is the you know the possibility space of all of the selfavoiding random walks is so massive that i don't think we could none of us could live long enough who knows if the universe could even last long enough for one of these uh examples to complete um unless it's a very sort of like low resolution space but so i think there's a lot of creative possibilities here um i've explored um in a in a live stream recently taking this idea and putting it into 3d and if you tweak this a little bit you can really start to look like the windows pipes screensaver this is a version i did uh by just changing um what i'm drawing to bezier vertices so it has this sort of like strange almost like alien like uh curve path um instead of just the perfect uh square grid this is actually thanks to uh dusk who does a lot of work uh managing the coding train uh github repos and the different um metadata associated with each video this particular um uh version which uses recursion dust created i i mentioned in the video like oh i should make one with recursion so that's not an example that i've covered or explained but uh you should certainly take a look and join the discord and ask questions if you have it and then this random walk with alpha oh this is just from the very beginning of the video where i was just trying to show how you could create a random walk that visualizes the amount of time amount of times a certain space has been landed on so that's if it weren't selfavoiding um so i i don't know i kind of want to anecdotally get a sense of how many people who watch the live streams who like are watching right now so according to my youtube console here there are 211 people that have this page open in their browser that's all it tells it doesn't actually tell me how many people are actually watching but how many of you noticed that a new coding challenge was um was released noticed it and watched some of it versus noticed and watched all of it let's make that a live coding train poll okay create a poll so this system by the way that i'm not sure i don't know if um foxy is watching right now but i i you know i really need to look at this stuff in between live streams and not just like expect it to magically work but foxy who is a viewer has been doing a ton of work and people are now in the chat are telling me i did me i watched but let's see um let's say self avoiding walk no idea it was released saw it was released didn't watch watched part watched all okay so these are the options i'm gonna create this poll so the idea here ah this is what i'm looking for the qr code so you should be able to scan this qr code um and go right to voting um and then this is what will give me the results um and the question is how there should be a view which is called overlay oops no over lay equals true so overlay and look at i love how it's live updating overlay mode yeah monotone simply are font um but i don't there's a view that shows the results and the qr code and i don't remember how to get it let's look in the merged pull request which presumably more green integrates compact compact oh compact view is what i want newest is redirected uh obs redirecting kills the url parameters i see the europarole compact is removed completely also the this is the view i'm looking for oh qr code ah that's the one i need to use okay i have discovered it so let me go back here to camera and go to um the poll and go to properties and go this is the one that i want here qr code so i just forgot what we did and when i say we there's no we about it um so uh transform reset transform there we go oh but it doesn't show the results so i want a page that shows the results and the qr code i want where did i close that out i want this where how do i get this view obs oh incredible fox is there use newest it wasn't did i not bring in the most recent code because okay so if i go here slash newest this is maybe i didn't import the most recent code the idea was to make two obs instances uh sorry incredible fox you're doing an amazing job it's me that has no ability to uh follow and like get this right um it can't show both at the moment ah oh make two got it got it got it got it got it got it got it got it got it okay okay so let's try that now i've got it so this is should be the qr code to the poll so there we go now this is i'm going to rename this to to um rename how do i rename rename qr code okay now i'm going to duplicate this or no i'll just make a new one new browser um call this one pull and now we're going to give this the live pole newest and uh my poll slash newest there we go i've done it everybody the qr code should be in front of me oh the pole should both should be in front of me i see it's an overlay that's the idea okay i think and then let's move the qr code up i think we've got it people okay it's done i now have this has been my this is my dream uh apparently don't tell me i should just use streamlabs no i want a custom special coding train only live poll application so 46 percent of you watched the entire coding challenge uh is the scanning not working for people let me try it uh it worked for me i'm gonna say i why i watched all of it because i had to check to make sure there were no like huge mistakes so i'll click watched all and i should get 36 votes as soon as i oh no 37 i'm going to press the button 38. i haven't pressed the button i want to see my vote be tabulated 39 there we go okay it worked for me um this is amazing um i don't know why oh i see if you don't have your phone you can't scan it so i don't know what the best solution there is um we could we could probably if um if you just go to um this url live poll live dash poll dash coding train dot glitch dot me um i think you won't see this you have to go to uh newest that's gonna give you the results i don't know how do people get there i guess i could post the link i will post the link to this poll uh for anybody who can't get there so uh go to vote is this url and then if i go to um my actual live stream oh it's already 11 o'clock i'm doing great uh and i'm going to the live stream now and i'm going to paste it into the chat there you go that should be the voting link which is now in the chat for you now the question is as soon as i do a new poll will this refresh automatically i'm imagining i have to click away i don't think i have the button checked where it refreshes the page that's an interesting question like do i want it to refresh the page um control audio refresh browser when scene becomes active okay so yes it is doing that what about this page and then now this is the poll properties refresh ah refresh browser okay so now uh if i do whoop it disappeared um okay came back great so the thing that i'm trying to test is if i now do a new poll and i'm gonna go back to here and i'm going to create a poll and next up so now we're going to everyone's going to vote on what i'm going to do next community contributions read random numbers just get to coding with movenet okay so these are the three options and by the way i'm famously i never follow what people vote for so don't get your hopes up but it's this is a useful experiment so now if i create this poll uh and then a celeste is back and then i go back to here it should refresh no why is it not refreshing newest is like the cat is it cashing something refresh cash um let's go to here newest hmm it's showing up as newest when i look here oh this is sad no reading the random numbers and community contributions that's what brings us all together i'm not sure why why won't it why won't it refresh here the qr code refreshed but the poll didn't i can't get it to refresh oh obs your cruel cruel cruel um shut down source when not visible community contributions where we all send you pictures of our cats is a great idea well here's the results of the poll i know but i have a link uh you know what though oh i think obs it's a redirect i think we need to not make it a redirect so i think it just can't be a redirect it has to be its own view uh that pulls um i think that's probably the issue obs probably can't deal with the fact that it's a redirect and it's sort of caching its redirect even though i've cleared the cache and all of that because the qr code obviously is not doing that and that's why it is has updated so i think we'll have to change it to not be a redirect so for now what i'm going to do is um one of these days gonna be a very old man when this live pole thing actually works the way uh intended okay overlay mode okay so i can do this uh overlay equals true there we go so i can force it by putting it here there we go so by the way though if you add up community contributions and read random numbers if you add those up there's more votes than just get to coding with movement so really those two should be in a runoff although i suppose community contributions is getting up there it's not too far not too far am i reading the chat asks rainbow skeppy i don't need overlay equals true according to incredible fox does it detect that it's like an obs browser maybe that's a new feature that was also added so by the way so the history of this project was um that i started actually making it during a live stream in a very sort of simplistic and basic way um and a bunch of different people have made various contributions but incredible fox who is in the youtube chat right now um came in just swooped in and added like a ton of really critical features as well as of this particular design that it currently is i really love um and so um yeah right so everything everyone's just here waiting i'm just here waiting for community contributions to overtake uh movement the thing is i would my plan was to show community contributions from uh the selfavoiding walk but there are none i am sad like a sad trombone oh you can't see what i'm looking at uh this was my plan all along community contributions from the latest coding challenge because of course i release a coding challenge video and millions of viewers around the world watch it immediately make their own artistic creative version of it nope someday that might happen but it takes a little longer and um this is a pretty tricky one um let's look by the way and see um what if i go to the coding train website github repo let's look at pull requests and let's see what is the most recent i'm going to go to closed community contribution looks like the most recent one uh was a contribution by rosa marco on menger sponge so today we will choose to look at the community contributions based on oh and this was by the way coding challenge number two in 2016. the mentor sponge let's go to the challenge uh and marco rosa menger sponge in opengl let's take a look at this it is a github repo uh and it's done in c plus plus with some like raw magic opengl code amazing beautiful looking uh thank you for the shout out in the github repo and this is how to build and run the project let's see if this works what's the chance i could get this to work i haven't tried to build like a c plus project does it just work out of the box on my mac uh presumably i would need to have the sort of xcode developer tools installed but let's see let's see if we can get this to run this will be fun so i'm going to clone this repo first by saying git clone and then just paste in the path to the repository oops i actually i really should have thought about where i was doing this because i always make this mistake i'm just in users coding train the sort of like root user directory of my computer and uh i generally oh look at this community contributions overcame i have i have influence still um so i'm gonna delete this actually by the way this is so funny i'm looking at my um computer and i have this folder called just in case underscore get what do you imagine i have in that directory i'm pretty sure it's some project that i was just completely having some kind of get slash github disaster and decided i needed to start over and i just like threw my directory in here and just called it just in case get like if i needed to go back to it but i couldn't get anything to work oh that happens a lot that happens a lot people oh i wanted to show one other thing um before i get to okay i'm thinking of things now that i wanted to look at so let me go to the desktop let me clone the repo again here it comes let's go into the repo and let's see here c make dash s period dash b build okay so i don't remember any i've done this c make stuff before i don't remember any of it i'm the dot presumably uh means you're going to maybe dash s is like the directory you want to look for your things you want to build and then dash b is where you want to put the stuff that you're going to build so i want to look in my immediate directory dot and then look in and then build it to the build directory okay uh so let's see yes let's let's uh do what we all do which is take this error message you know i'm gonna leave the specific uh shell that i'm using in it uh zsh just in case there's some uh let's see um let's let's look uh mac uh how do i uh install cmake on my mac i guess i could brew install it probably uh mac install cmake okay unix linux mac os there are precompiled binaries available on the download page for matt as the after copying cmake.app into applications run it and follow how to install for command line use menu for instructions to make the command line tools available in the path it's not just part of xcode developer tools all right fine let's let's go down this rabbit hole this is definitely what i plan to do during today's live stream you can either download binaries or source code archives okay latest release mac 10.13 or later that sounds right let's try this ladies and gentlemen we are installing brew install cmake all right good idea let's try that i just take suggestions from the chat what could possibly go wrong oh no oh no oh no oh no okay i don't follow these directions all right why not looks good to me what could possibly go wrong [Laughter] no i'm not going to put in sudo permission denied oh wait no something's working this looks promising by the way should i be updating my mac os the profimesh is very upset with me uh i think that worked i thought you're never supposed to run brew with sudo maybe that was something else somebody once told me that don't be like me kids i have a bad example uh all right here we go let's try this now oh this is promising oh look at this build files have been written oh my god okay what's next oh where's this project okay cd build now i have to type in make okay oh this is exciting i'm building a c project i'm like a real computer person now i'm being told prophet mesh who i trust dearly uh is telling me to and simon of course who is uh um always giving me excellent advice both of them are telling me to update um so i think i will probably not during this live stream mergers by the way i believe it's menger sponge is that correct am i confused men just at least that's what i called it there's a couple different merger sponge menger sponge here's a merger sponge i guess it's an easy typo to make all right let's try to run this wow oh my goodness this is amazing can i make it full screen whoa okay uh oh i've now crashed my computer for sure oh wow so look by the way let's let's compare the performance of opengl native opengl on this particular mac versus p5.js webgl so presumably um i think i click the mouse so let's count one we're good we're good with one two we're good with two three oh see three we are already like lost our frame rate exiting potential infinite loop so we couldn't even get to three with uh webgl with p5.js now let's try running this uh one two three no problem at three four ah even going well at four five i think is where we hit crashing yeah it's actually pretty impressive that it's able to render something i don't recall i think i originally did this in processing so we can actually download the original processing code oh i have something exciting to report i'm just like everything is just a random tangent or digression on the coding train live stream um i guess you all of you are having trouble seeing this with um um the um what you may call it the youtube compression okay here is my processing uh p3d version of it so this is using i believe joggle or java's implementation of opengl okay let's try this uh one two three now can we get to four we got to four with yeah so look at this it's really interesting to see the major difference uh so javascript being the slowest at uh in terms of being able to render the recursion processing java being the let me do it a different way javascript was great it was great the way it rendered that measure sponge processing is like oh awesome the way it rendered that sponge and then c plus plus transcends the medium just like incredible so they're all wonderful but just uh and and speed isn't the only value here in our programming journey but hardware um so the browser is making use of the computer's hardware in the sense that it is using the graphics card if it's rendering with webgl but still lots of other things that are slow let's take a look at our poll and as requested oh my goodness the random number so we looked at that was looking at a community contribution uh the random numbers are um i'm sorry i'm looking at reading some of the random numbers if one more person would just vote for the random numbers i could read random numbers i guess it could be me i could push this over the edge vote yeah [Laughter] it is time everyone for um the i need a random number song i guess the closest i have is this so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like i'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10. 9 2 7 6 1 9 four eight nine two one three i picked nine a lot apparently but with pearl and noise i might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five all right folks here we are um now if you recall i have a new system couple things let me let me tell you a little bit about the discord because uh a goal of mine for this summer is to use the coding train discord more um to have a coding train discord that's uh accepted into the partner program with discord and one of the things the reasons why i can't apply to the partnership with discord is the my audience retention rate is below the 20 meaning uh let's say in the last month there were 500 people who just joined less than 50 of those are 100 of those people sorry 20 um come back fewer than 100 of the people who join come back like a week later to post or check something so i want to do more activities um try to do some q a stuff and different things in the discord to sort of liven up that community one thing you should be aware of is if you join the discord uh first um you'll need to read uh the code of conduct and emoji react to that um maybe we'll switch that over i know there's some new onboarding stuff that discord has i don't know where we are actually but if you i don't use the at everyone uh notification on discord unless absolutely uh necessary those first like really important announcements are sort of emergencies related to spam or some type of other issue um so instead i will notify everyone by um tagging at notifications but you do not if you enter the discord you do not have that role automatically so to subscribe to that role exclamation point subscribe exclamation point subscribe will it's going to remove it for me you can see um that's the bot command is that will also remove that role if you don't want to get the notifications which is very reasonable as well um but that's what i use if i go here under um like schedule um if you know i'm gonna do a new live stream you can see i will tag it with at notifications if there's gonna be a new video coming out or a new thumbnail um also under um i don't know where there's other places you know where i will use that um um yeah and so you'll want to go to the cafe under bot talk so um you can do that do that command in the cafe under the bot talk um so that's my main discord announcement for today there were some other things i thought about um ah so this couple other pieces of coding trade news one is uh i do finally have uh in the channel if i go here under videos and go to this selfavoiding walk there's a little spot in here where like i google um how to how to clone an array in javascript how to copy an array um so one of the things that um i have is now this is in beta or whatever is this clip functionality so if i wanted to i could click clip and then i could say googling searching how to copy an array and then let's just see here uh and then i don't know how do i get the i guess i have to then clip it out like where i want it to oh i want longer than that and then i just want the beginning of how do i copy an array so now if i share this clip how to copy an array in javascript share clip it gives me this link i guess to just that particular clip so i'm just mentioning this because especially with these long live streams and other videos that are very long if you wanted to find a little clip that you love and share it with me or share it with somebody else you could do that i should be able to now just go and paste this into the chat right here uh right here uh so now you should be able to get that clip so i wanted to mention that because i want to encourage people to use it in case it provides any value or fun or a usefulness in terms of sharing stuff um there we go okay i wanted to mention that the other thing i wanted to mention i was looking at a particular youtube channel called free code camp so let's take a look they are a nonprofit and they have many uh technical courses and one thing i was noticing was this eight hours three minutes and 17 seconds data structures in eight hours python in four hours four hours 26 minutes and 52 seconds i on the coding train the aforementioned coding train youtube channel have been creating content in a different way here is my you know learn to program with p5.js one two three four you know if i go here to this is hopefully the playlist right here's all of the videos you know this is probably four hours five hours six hours but they're all separate videos and i do think that does have some value um having this be sequenced i use it in curriculum to you know as kind of like chapters watch these than this but i'm i'm kind of amazed by how uh hearing about how these are used first of all this python one is 24 million views which is quite incredible so um i was thinking this august is the 20th anniversary of processing the processing project created by casey reese and ben frye the first version zero zero zero zero zero zero one was released in august 2001 and if you go to um i guess actually let's go to here this is my website is how i try to keep the videos organized if i go here to processing this particular video which is my this is my series of learn uh to code in processing uh separate videos these were these were recorded in 2015 quite low production quality compared to what i'm doing these days i have much less gray hair oh and it looks like my muscles are maybe a little bit bigger but i working out then yes that's uh obviously the picture this is like a picture of working out is right there yeah sure um but um um i was thinking of rebooting these but instead of like recording them as and editing them together as like a whole sequence what if i just took a day and just recorded like everything from start to finish of like everything you need to know about coding and processing and release it as one video i don't think i'll do it as a live stream i think i would still do it as um i'll record it and it'll have some light editing into it because i want to take breaks and things like that but have the video be so that's what i'm thinking about doing sometime this summer will take up a lot of time and energy curious to if you have any feedback or thoughts on that i'm curious to try a course that's just instead of sequence videos one long video and ideally youtube would have some a nice interface for you know you can time code it for being able to move throughout it please do python says rainbow skippy unlikely look you can uh you can go to free code camp you don't need me for python all right oh i wasted enough time that i've gotten to the break yet i think i have so i come back from after the break i'm going to look at movenet it took me an hour to get here um can we have all the courses in a playlist format so this is by the way you know this is the bane of my existence i don't youtube works really has uh really powerful discoverability tools their discoverability tools are mostly search like presumably i would assume if i look for selfavoiding random walk i'm number three here so we can see there are two other uh videos and here's mine on the homepage so it works really well and a lot of people find my videos through search um i think it's more likely people are finding them through search with looking for things like you know javascript promises and there we go number two here um so you can see that's how most people find my videos otherwise it's also recommendations and you could see if i go to the home this is a very dangerous thing for me to do but this is for whatever reason what um what youtube is recommending to me it kind of makes sense some netflix and some linear algebra and coder coder which is a really really awesome uh youtube channel that i've been checking out recently so mostly um that's how uh youtube works it does not um work well for somebody who wants to consume something like a course or a linear sequence of many videos i'm gonna be kind of guided through them uh ayub is saying i can use shorts to increase the visibility of your already existing videos youtube is pushing them now make another channel with 30 second videos for your topics and link them to the videos well i don't know why i would make another channel just put shorts on this channel but one of the things that i definitely do wrong is i do everything in one channel live streams sequence tutorials project videos and it's really amazing to see like when i released a little inside baseball here on youtube when i if i go to uploads just under videos here when i was releasing these videos like 2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 youtube was all about like boy if your viewers are watching your videos these days maybe you should consider like looking at the videos that were more popular i'm like no no no no i'm doing what i'm doing it's right i'm doing the right thing these aren't meant for people to watch right now i'm gonna have to release them they're not meant for people to watch right now youtube they're meant for people to watch later when they're coming to do a course on p5.js so please don't count this in your like magic algorithm thing that's deciding whether you should be recommending videos for my channel but i can't there's nothing i can do about that whereas this particular video youtube's like oh hey hey uh your viewers are watching this more than usual they really seem to like you today and by the way it's like this really has an effect on sense of selfworth all these sort of messages and stuff you know um so i think probably if i wanted to build a much larger viewership um having the sort of more popular content on a separate channel that's like dropping on a regular schedule would probably be but i just i can't manage to do that but all of this is to say the canonical resource for finding coding trained videos is the coding trade website i've given up um i'm thrilled to have this youtube platform it's allowed me to earn some income to build this thing up and be able to like have lots of other people who collaborate and work with me on the coding train it's found me an audience that i never could have imagined i would have found but it is not helping me keep my content sort of organized as well as you know there's so much metadata that goes along with any given video of mine such as the code examples the other other challenges and papers and things that i'm referring to so the website is for that now here's the thing there is a somewhat semisecret project going on right now to completely redo the website by the fall so uh you know it will oh who's to say what it's going to be but it will be hopefully an even better way to browse and find the videos you're looking for understand the sequence of the videos as well as find the code associated with those videos um so anyway i'm sorry i am just going on and on um about all of this and this is this is the way of the coding train these days the live streams are just me rambling talking to the audience hanging out responding to the chat maybe eventually getting to some code which i really will do because i only have less than an hour left and the um the real coding content is coming through uh released videos now uh and just to let you know the next video coming out is uh 5.2 uh i also recorded that bezier curve coding challenge oh just a little so i recorded it yesterday i'll just show you this is like a really really cool example this is the code example from the end of my there's four examples but this is the last example oh this does not let's that was like a bad big like hold on um yeah this is a little bit better this is um this is the example of doing all of the math for bezier curves and drawing these like sort of rainbow string art things so the next coding challenge video uh this is the final result of it recorded it yesterday okay um parmier is asking can we have a complete js course from beginner to advanced with projects so i mean maybe i'm wrong about this but to me that is uh exactly what um this is uh this code program with p5.js course is your start to finish beginner learn to code in javascript with p5.js it's got a very particular point of view in terms of drawing and animation uh you know towards interactive systems generative art data visualization which is different than maybe building full stack web applications or proper web development although if you're interested in that i would suggest this working with data and apis in javascript so if you're looking for more of a start to finish now this you have to have some basic javascript knowledge already to start this particular course but this will give you sort of full stack and i'm not using there is a little bit of p5 sprinkled in but it's much more node and uh working with some database stuff and geolocation web api so these um um these i would say are are often the course that people are looking for um yeah so you can see i actually redid my youtube homepage recently so just like there's the coding challenge you know there's the beginner p5 the coding challenge videos ml5 machine learning videos which is what i want to cover today nature of code which is what i'm working on still data and apis this i would love to redo this get github one um and then i haven't been able to continue this code in cabana series and then just the uploads down here okay ah now i need to take a break but before i take a break i would like to thank today's sponsor brilliant and i'm just gonna regurgitate a little bit of what i said earlier because it's so true i'm gonna give you three ways that you can learn stuff in order of least productive to most productive i don't know it's really true i have my geometry mug so if ever i'm drinking a little coffee or tea i could always be reminded what is the area of a circle pi r squared but i can't interact with this i can't draw my own circle can't twist a slider i can't do much more other than read the formula be inspired have a nice little sip of coffee i could also watch somebody on youtube that i enjoy three blue one brown is a wonderful youtube channel that i enjoy and i get inspired i fit filled with knowledge um but often i have trouble retaining and maybe i'm that channel for you obviously not today because all i'm doing is just rambling on and on about topics that pop into my mind just in a minute but for me the the most productive and valuable way that i learn is through interactive lessons where i can uh read and watch and see a concept and then try out that concept myself through some kind of interactive mechanism um i can also and also be a part of a community where other people are trying as well and helping each other to learn and that's really what brilliant is for me so they have uh um a wide variety of courses um this you know speaking of which it was just requested like can you do a course on python if you look at the brilliant python course there are uh stepbystep lessons to learn programming with python and a code editor right there in the browser that you can try all of the kind of stuff that i love so much about math and physics and computer science this is the course that i have been going through called geometry fundamentals you can see here is a concept about the pythagorean theorem which is explained and you can also explore in real time through an interactive diagram so um if you want to try out this style of learning and i'm just going to go to the brilliant website myself there's also an app you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain and you can just get started right now looking through the courses and trying different lessons and if you want to unlock everything that brilliant has to offer through a premium subscription you will get the first 200 people to go through that link will get 20 off now another thing that i'll say here because i already have brilliant and one of the things that you can see up here in the top right is a gift premium so this is something you know it's not traditional gift giving season right now but for me summer birthday is everybody in my family summer birthdays don't know what to get somebody a premium subscription to brilliant um for the the kid the adult the anybody of all ages who loves math science and and sort of con lifelong learning would like that so um let me go uh continue beautiful geometry so i'm five i've got five problems to go into this chapter um this is the one i did on the most recent live stream which i like shocked myself by getting this correct um if i remember um the explanation here is can be thought of as a series of progressively smaller upside down l shapes each one with dimensions half that of the previous so the red makes up one third of each shape since all the l shapes are similar they're the same fraction of red so the entire figure is onethird red okay so that's where i was last time let's look at the next one all right um so in answer to the prior problem okay another approach take each red square and make two copies one to the right and one below done in purple we can see that it's one third right red one red two purple one red two purple one red two purple one third okay all right so oh did i do this one already i guess i got this one i did this one too all right i haven't done this one okay um okay so let's look at this one to make this figure oh you know what's awesome about this is very quickly before i solve this i have a really interesting idea one of the things i love about brilliant by the way is it just gives me ideas for things to code so this is a great this would be a great demonstration of recursion so i'm gonna i'm gonna write um a function called uh my my square and it's going to take an x a y and a width and i'm going to draw a square at that x y and width let's fill it with blue you'll see why i'm calling it my square in a second i'm going to say my square 0 0 200. there we go and let's set the background to zero so we can see it there we go so now what's going on here if we go to this particular brilliant problem oh it's one quarter so that's not did i do did i just do one quarter i'm like lost my yeah that's one quarter okay so now this should be the next one should be one quarter so i should call then my square of x plus w y and i'm going to need let me set stop and then w divided by 2 or let's say times 0.5 and i'm going to say if w is greater than one pixel i'll let it go to one pixel actually let's just let's go to 20 pixels so this is recursion right to draw a square is to draw another square to the right of it that's half the size there we go does that look like um this it certainly does right and i think we can just go like keep going right there we go uh you know as long as it's greater than one and let's just say a stroke zero zero 255 now what's interesting about this right is i could have a global variable called sum and just say sum plus equal w times w that would be the area and now i could say console log sum divided by what's the area of the whole thing width times width one third so i'm solving the problem through without thinking it through onethird so if i did another square um in the bot and below actually what happens if i would do this x plus h no no x y plus h well there is no h y plus w oh look at that that's one half clearly but hold on let's go to uh oh this is interesting uh stroke oh look at this lovely pattern look at this lovely pattern of course that's one half but that's not the point the point is with this and if i did two of these two thirds so the answer should be twothirds where's my sound effect now oops oh i'm oh go back go back go back so now i did that in a sort of like weird way but um if looking at this i can see like the way that the brilliant website explained the brilliant website explained how to do it is i have one quarter one quarter and then i could take that square and put it here right fit it here and then i'm doing the same thing here uh with these two so so 1 two three two thirds it would be twothirds i don't know i don't think i it was like it made sense in my head but i without being able to diagram it i'm sure if i show the explanation right we can see that's twothirds because look it's always two out of three two at two out of three two out of three and keep going two out of three um so um by covering with blue and red successfully you can see that it is twothirds this is interesting because i often think recursion will lead to an infinite area like if we look at the koch curve um or the the fractal snowflake this is one of my coding challenges here where if i this successively will create a path of infinite length and i've worked out this math before based on the rules of the recursive rules the um the measurements go go to infinity whereas in this case even though it is a recursive process as you can see the area uh converges to one half so the more you know the more times the closer i get to actually 0.5 now how how close could i get to 0.5 before i crash p5 you know let me hit save here uh recursive and i can just um uh this is um for this so and let me by the way put this into the discord um under uh links look i did some coding today um so if you want to look at that code i just posted it in the discord geometric series an infinite sum so uh this converges to a constant um this length of the square circumference is also infinite yeah so i would assume that if we looked at the length of these uh you know if i added up w times four right if i um that's going to go to um well i don't wanna it's the sum 9 600 so let's let's look like if we stop at 10 we get 4 800 stop at five fifty six hundred stop at one seventy two hundred 0.1 i'm just 9600.01 i don't know if we're ever going to 12 800. so you can see that this probably tends to infinity um which is super interesting um the area is finite the circumference is infinite that's actually the same thing as within the koch curve okay um let me hit save on this this can be done uh let me let me actually uh put this back to like five i like how it actually looks with this little i'm not getting all the way there okay thank you to uh brilliant for um sponsoring the coding train i am going to take a very short break just for two or three minutes and when i come back i will actually look at and see if i can get the movenet machine learning model running and compare it to pose net so if you came here waiting for that you only had to wait uh of seven hairs and two freckles or one hour and 20 minutes so apologies for that let's look at my viewership here how many people have i lost yeah i gained some people amazing all right uh it's not pronounced coke i thought it was i say koch i thought it was coke somebody somebody who can help me with the german please let me know i always get it wrong i will be back in less than five minutes thank you for sticking with me see you in a moment it's do do do do recording training breaking breaking news i should never look at my phone when i take a break i just got this notification from twitter and it says i'm going to read it to you live on air right now unfortunately the request to verify your account has been denied i don't know if you can see this can you see this it won't it won't uh it won't focus on it very sad oh well i don't need to be twitter verified i never wanted that blue check anyway twitter all right that was a short break i've got about a half an hour and let's take a look at movenet all right everybody uh so i'm gonna just close all these windows um we're gonna go look for move net tensorflow.js um okay so how do i get it tf.js models all right so looks like so let's just do this in the p5 web editor i was thinking i wasn't going to but now i think this actually makes sense um and i'm going to uh move net test let's grab the um i guess all we need we need all of these script tags okay put them all in index.html up here so i've got p5 and then all the tensorflow ones that i need um and then oh i don't i don't can't do that okay single pose create detector estimate poses all right so this looks like ah i don't wanna okay create a detector pass in pose net pose detection supported models move net okay single pose lightning model that let's start with that so hold on i need more space to code people yes yes comment this out there we go okay so um i'm going to write an async function init and let's create these two i'm just going to make them i'm going to make the detector a global variable and uh initialize it here and we can say um init and i guess does it work to make setup asynchronous i think it does okay like will draw not happen until um this is complete we'll find out so now uh what do i need to do next i can estimate poses from an image okay estimate poses from an image now what kind of image tensor 3d image data video element image element canvas element well that's great do i dare just start with video so now async function get poses and let's make that a global variable let's go to my pose net coding train example and let's just kind of grab some of the stuff that i was doing there so i have like a video element and i made the canvas uh let's make the canvas let's actually make it uh 320 by 240 then i need to create the video does this work create capture video am i getting how come i don't see oh why don't i see the video oh cause i could hide i forgot that i had hide okay great there it is let's do uh video size 320 240. oh i think my kids are arguing with each other you might hear some shouting i have i have a emergency mute button if i okay all right so now let's just see if i can do video.elt uh console log opposes and let's just say let's make a button create button pose uh mouse pressed uh and just call get poses oh no mouse pressed get poses alright so now in theory when i press this button i should see and he poses it to text here in the console oh nothing happened did i press the button oh no stuff happened oh look at that so it looks to me like this is actually a hundred percent the same exact data and technique as posenet it's just a different model so to put this into ml5 would just be swapping out loading a different model interesting um so uh let me so here's the thing so okay now the question is let's get rid of this can i call how do i um await init uh so create capture i think i get a call back here video ready so i can say video ready get poses let's see if this works no i didn't see okay hold on does that call back work just trying to figure out the sequence here of what it is i want to do yeah okay great get poses await detector estimate poses can i just call get poses again then um it is the same number of key points i believe 17 key points by the way now i'm reading there's a nice chat in the discord uh uh okay uh exit page how much did i lose there not too much um huh we do this in let's give it like a little set timeout oh wait a second oh wait a second wait a second wait a second i know the issue awaits i i'm do i forget that i've got everything like with the crazy asynchronous stuff going on here okay let's see video ready oh i didn't console log the poses console log poses we're gonna get this people there we go okay it's console logging the poses now um let's look at one of these uh here let's just try to draw something score key points so unfortunately um i can't remember which one is the no let's see okay like pose so ml5 we put all this stuff in to make it nicer but here pose api all right so these are got it move move net blaze pose pose nut so these are all doing the same thing um so the key points are is there a name and i didn't see a name nose is the first one though it looks like oh it is the first one is no it does have a name okay great so if i say um if i say um background uh ellipse this was the poses index zero dot key points index zero dot dot x can i do something like this uh let x x y equal pose a zero dot key point zero and then i should be able to just say ellipse x y 20 20 and like make it red so this is my new trick that i love which is if i have an object that has different properties like this object has an x and a y as well as a score and a name i can destructure the object and pull out the x and y properties into separate variables and i this is probably a case where you know technologies use const because those aren't going to change um let's see if this works um see what i get here and let me just take out the console log which is already out okay uh cannot read property ah so one thing i will need to say because it's going right to draw is if poses and poses dot length is greater than zero so as long as there are some poses and the length is greater than zero then time to find my nose i'm not taking so long to start up so it's definitely working um it doesn't seem to be in the right place is it um by default kind of giving me the information on the sort of 640 by 480 video see what happens here okay so that looks right now let me go back to hiding the video and drawing it this auto i got to kill this auto refresh auto refresh is killing me image video zero zero oh i'm missing a that's why it's not red oh and i don't have auto refresh on um let's sit here okay now it's really really slow but i've artificially made it slow by putting that set timeout in there so what happens now if i just call this over and over again oh no no no no no oh wait get poses yeah okay right let's see come on let's go what happened have i crashed oh and i didn't hit save stop what am i doing wrong here i guess i'm not supposed to use the single estimate poses let's try the demo well this is look i made it work yay me so what did i do wrong here i guess do i need like a little set timeout oh i'm gonna have to well this is sad that i crashed the browser okay let's see line 31. all right so all right i guess but i want it to continue to call itself after it gets new poses i want it to call itself again i need to do a set timeout with a delay of zero interesting like how far can i push that delay why do i need that yeah interesting all right let's go through everything so now let's go through key point of let's go through all the key points and then um and let's let's see here how it goes let's see how fast is this okay what not iterable sketch dot length line 40. oh i used i forgot that i used a for of loop yes somebody in the chat wrote damn has had a long day and it's in fact definitely true yeah so if i were building my own system i would use like get um whoa what is going on here it's definitely pretty fast the question is and i think i'm going to need to step away from the camera here to get a better um view of it so let me give you all you you're all going to see that i'm wearing shorts today my pants are falling down that's not a good sign yeah so one thing i probably should do is only draw the points if they have a certain confidence above a certain level so it's hard um if um so what was it it was um score so if score is greater than 0.5 let's draw those circles so i think there's you're seeing a lot of noise because there's a lot of points like my feet and various things that can't see and so it's drawing them even when it has no confidence but now we can see and it's it's definitely very accurate now it can't find me it doesn't really know how much of my body needs to be visible it really needs to see a head to be able to see the arm but full body it's working quite well so the question is like how different is this from posner like can i very quickly just load a different model this is single pose lightning um what were um i wanted to see this is a blog post about it which is not what i'm interested in here's what i'm looking for i wanted to see here supported models so what are the supported models um where did i do that oh this is my posnet example like like if i change this to pose net what would happen by the way did the interact did an interactive console while just appear in the web editor why it wasn't looking like hold on i have to show you all this uh oh something crashed no it crashed again uh pose net has blue and move net has red overlay them with different colors ooh that's an interesting idea um okay hold on i don't know what's going on here but is this the working version look at this as soon as i run the sketch this interactive thing appears this is this is new like this was recently been added oh but i it crashes the crash soon as i try to log something it crashes it that's what was crashing it so maybe it needs that needs a little like the interactive console must needs a little bit of work maybe i'm not using it in the proper way um okay so this is great um um alpha equals confidence that's a pretty cool idea actually um um use the use hue for the confidence yeah these are these are some great ideas um so of course there's all sorts of possible things we could do with this let me just make sure this example is still working and will it actually work with set timeout zero i find that hard to believe but let's try it yeah this should crack oh no so set timeout zero it actually works amazing and this does i mean i don't know if the one millisecond makes a difference but it feels very responsive very fast i don't know can we um all right let's try as was suggested but we're going to have an issue though well let's just see if we can anecdotally kind of see so this is pose net in ml5 i don't know why it's not nothing is coming up that's weird is it like not want to have both running at the same time so can you get a sense of lag and accuracy so look at me moving back and forth what's the lag what's the accuracy let's look at this model which in theory should be an improvement can't necessarily tell much difference can you um does this have to be on a person or could it be for objects too so this and simon fletcher writes set timeout zero just adds it to the end of the execution queue so that's super helpful thank you um yeah so my my next question here is if i go to um the ml5 library and let me bring this back down to some more space here and i go to source and i know you can't entirely see this and go to posenet and look at index.js so what this is doing is it is loading um a particular model with a particular set of settings mobilenet v1 a weight pose net load what is pose net so like how how hard would it be to change this to um movenet this is a project that i would like to work on and you can see here this would all stay the same it's more about it's interesting it's called confidence rather than score so this is something that i would definitely need to up pose net here um okay well this was a live stream it would be great if you draw an eye texture instead of eyes try the cat it's a great idea uh will it detect the cat can you have them running side by side in theory yes but i'm not sure the best way for me to do that right now or if that's worth doing um i'm kind of lost as to what i what today's live stream is about it's been a long week this week was my kids last week of school everything is all turned upside down i need i need uh i need us to like something to do to finish off this stream oh read random numbers i forgot about reading the random numbers i should just do that i'm looking for suggestions i like the eye texture idea um i thank you uh thank you cp can you make a data set um well i'm reading the chat here um rigging this to a 3d character actually so one of the things i wanted to explore was v tubing um it's not really my wheelhouse but i thought it would be fun to try to do like a live stream as an animated character and um that's definitely something that i could do here with um pose net or move net in this case probably what would make more sense would be in case you're not familiar with this would be also to look at the face face mesh so um this is not one that i spent a lot of time uh exploring but this could be good for my vtubing idea let's see how well this works this is the uh a new this this was a new model that was added to ml5 fairly recently holy smokes okay that is insane that is an insane number of points what the oh my goodness i have never this is not what i expected to see i knew it was like a mesh with a lot of points but that is wildly accurate in fact i mean it definitely has trouble when i turn my head but you know that's to be expected um that is crazy what could i do with this look at these points here so if the predictions just gives me a lot of key points and each one has an xy i guess i could i could definitely feed this into a classifier can i break it the triangles are not there yeah um this would be interesting to actually create uh to actually make it a proper mesh and then texture it so i don't really have time in the next five minutes to do that oh look my ear is a face look at my ear it's a face my hand is a face beard detection algorithm that would be an interesting one um but this is this is cool to see um i feel like this um this live stream today is is uh just like falling i'm like falling over the finish line ending with a a little splat supposed to a grand finale of something exciting that anybody could use can i make something out of this um let's try i have an idea let's make something out of this okay i got four minutes and i'm gonna make something out of this so first thing i'm gonna do is i'm not gonna draw the video image background zero then i'm going to go to my go to you know particle i need just any old particle system example shader webgl that would be an interesting one to try but i'm a little bit afraid particles following the mouse um particle emitters color sure this will this will work okay this is great perfect so oh the emitter that's fine so i just need an emitter class i gotta make something today i gotta make a project a four minutes left this is the coding train is me rambling for an hour and a half two hours realizing i have five minutes left and i need to make a project just coming up with something i guess i should really have these particles coming out of my eyes which i only need the um uh um movement for it's gonna make them coming out of my mouth as i talk but i don't know which key points i'll just have them come out of all the key points that'll be fine what could possibly go wrong particle.js okay um so now uh i need to link to both of these um in here okay and now let's also grab my so this is an example from this is an example from oh i'm in posenet here no i want to be in face mesh from nature of code particle systems chapter in case you're trying to follow along good luck to you sketch.js let's just grab this uh and let's just create an emitter in the middle all right let's see what happens here do i dare so right now i should have my face mesh what's happening stop close close too much open uh what just happened what did i break is there's some other error i don't see ah emitter is not defined i lost i didn't notice i lost the body tag that'll do it oh wait a second it happened it happened welcome kay you have joined the passengers of the coating train here in the building still the pole is still there in the very last negative one minute of the coding strain you have boosted my energy you have brought me you filled me with joy and happiness and you are going to get your very own random number um which is on page 283 uh row 14 130 column zero the sequence is four one five three seven and i have so much to say about the random numbers and the whistles and the discord bot but no no no no no back to what i was doing oh so k uh since you actually are in the chat um make sure you see the google form fill out that google form that when you join as a member and uh join the discord everybody should join the discord but if you are um signed up as a supporter of the coding train and join the discord and link to your youtube account you'll have access to our memberonly channels where we have um where we talk about uh random numbers and train whistles that's literally what you get okay um now back to this get this to work before i go all right i really messed something up here how did i mess up this html so badly i have to make the font smaller i cannot i just do not have enough space something is oh slash body oh no no no this goes here oh my goodness no i put it all in the wrong place there we go emitter is not defined oh my goodness what is going on the order here shouldn't matter right somebody tell me what i did wrong oh this is the worst uh sketch line 10 emitter equals new emitter oh i didn't copy paste the code that's what you've been telling me for so long [Laughter] oh hilarity and hilarity ensues oh gosh i'm i'm fired it's not given this is my last live stream ever sorry everybody i can't do it anymore oh no this is the particles okay we're gonna get there people okay come on come on computer you can do it bring this over so i can see all right so now where are my particles oh i commented it out okay great now the face mesh is about to load i should really just be doing this with the move net example this is very silly that i'm trying to do it with the face with the face mesh but here we go now i know what to do uh now instead of we're not going to draw this image um we can do emitter show emitter update but here i want to say i'm not going to draw i just want to release some particles so update the emitter's position to that x y and just emit one particle also let's only do this like one percent of the time and so one out of a hundred key points let's see what happens caution to the wind everybody okay so uh you can't i've completely lost any sense of my face um but i think i have an idea for how to get it back so the particle can really just fade out super fast so much faster then i think i might be able to manage to do it for a much higher percentage of the points i want to make my face is like the end of um raiders of the lost ark my face is going to melt oh interesting i could have them move up and be kind of red and they would be it would be much more like fiery so where's is there a gravity force somewhere um i can't remember how i'm doing apply force is there a gravity force somewhere yes so the gravity should point up and be let's make it much stronger let's also do um a little bit risky but blend mode add and then particle where's let's not use any alpha it'll make it uh just give it like a red color based on its lifetime and let's see no i can't maybe it'll work better if i remove my hat no then you will see my hat hair can't have that oh oh right i need the clear um i don't know why i'm trying to make my face somehow be like fiery but um not really what i was thinking i was doing but let's see what happens oh and i need um of course for the additive blending to work we need some amount of green and blue and also the background should be zero why am i okay there we go i think this is going to be what i meant to do come on uh why why why okay couple things let's let's get rid of the stroke very unnecessary i really gotta go but i may want to make a project here uh very unnecessary um let's uh let's pump this up i don't know what i'm doing i'm just playing with numbers if i make lines between the particles yeah this is what i was trying to get um i now i understand what i need to do i think this is what i am meaning to do okay not exactly what i meant too much it's amazing how fast it is i should probably put the video back which would be interesting oh i forgot that i have to keep having to reset it particles are too fast says k yeah i think you might be right about that i think the additive blending isn't really doing the job that i wanted it to do let's try making that uh force a little bit less and i also i really would love to be able to get more particles out actually so where where where did i do that um let's double the amount of particles texture mapping on the mesh would be nice too yes i probably should make them smaller well now they're just kind of uh sparkly um that's not really what i meant either let's let's i'm gonna get the effect that i'm looking for radial forces centered around the eye positions yeah there this is kind of this is more like what i was imagining it's a little bit too so this is definitely more like what i was imagining there we go now the real exciting moment here that i'm going to finish with um is adding um the video back and these are just cpu particles um luneo music is asking i mean we've completely lost the face mesh so that's a little bit unfortunate um i could try um i could put the face mesh on i actually like it better without seeing the video image something i had earlier i feel like was better let me go back to this i've got to stop i'm gonna just play with a few more parameters and then be done looks like diving in a bottle set up yes sliders would really help sliders would really help um bubbly face i gotta end with something here yeah there we go now now we're talking don't worry i'm gonna get this exactly what i'm going for you'll see [Laughter] low cash says i left for three minutes and dan has a burning face bubbly face well i'm sure somebody can make a better version of this but i'm i'm happy with what i've got so far i think i like it uh with a slightly larger circle and what's the chance i just want to just try one last thing what if i were to do every single point and have the particles fade out quite a bit faster okay this is probably going to run way way way too slow but i'm going to leave this code with all of you to experiment and make a better version of this yeah okay so this is what i was imagining um and now i'm realizing that it kind of works but and i really just get rid of the red color i just need to yeah what i really just need to do is not use all of the face mesh points and then i'll be able to have this run fast enough where i can have the particles trail off more but this i do kind of like now in the sense that uh i can see the pattern and it would make sense for me to get rid of the video and maybe maybe maybe just let a little bit of like 20 fewer spots and this is going to be the last time i run this i promise well thank you for watching today's episode of i should just do this yeah here we go thank you for watching today's episode of the coding train uh brought to you by uh oh wait hold on i have to do this brilliant if you would like to learn all about how to do physics programming and have your face turn into a fiery set of particles you can both watch the coding train and check out brilliant at brilliant the coding train i will see you all next friday i'll be back for another live stream two live streams in june plenty of new videos hopefully we'll come out soon this is me as now a v tuber i have now become a v tuber all i need is like some music thanks for tuning in to today's episode of the coding frame with me your host fiery face i am an ai generated particle system with a nose oh you can't see me scratching my nose or i might have to sneeze at any moment but this is the coding train this is what you tuned in for this code example will be available for you in the discord please join at thecodingtrain.com discord talk to the bot to subscribe to the notifications you can also subscribe to the coding training and watch the nature of code series all about particle systems or a beginner's guide to machine learning with ml5.js all of those things i will see you all next friday on the coding train stay tuned for some new videos being released i really appreciate all of you i feel happy that this live stream ended i assume that any moment now kevin feige from marvel will give me a call because i just won't believe this effect we need it for some new exciting marvel project that's never gonna happen i might get it uh all right i'm just gonna show people um where you can get this code right now before i leave um let's go to i'm taking this uh the thecodingtrain.com discord um if you join the discord uh respond to all the stuff you need to respond to um go to the lynx channel under live you can find it there schedule by the way is where i post when i'll be live streaming next one will be next friday and i will see you all next time on the coding train as always i always forget that this this stock it stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop go stop i just stop this stop this dot this dots on this stop this dot i gonna do this this dot this dot this dot song never forget the this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me coordinate songs it's look forward to cartesian coordinate songs autotune and the internet will fix that for me it's cartesian coordinates unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kittens and kittens and kids and kings of games i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects what else is there unicorns and rainbows and all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is and yes kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens the kittens and kittens of dastada i hope you all enjoyed that that was really fun i will see you next week goodbye you
