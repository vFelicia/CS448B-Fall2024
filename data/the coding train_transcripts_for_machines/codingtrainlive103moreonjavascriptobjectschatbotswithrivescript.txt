coating train Friday afternoon take two okay so let's see here um you guys hear me am I here am I not frozen is this actually the coding train how's my volume what better way to test my volume then reading some random numbers fiftyone thousand and seven eighty thousand seven hundred and thirtyfour 7258 74 thousand seven hundred twentyeight the volume sounds great now wonderful how's the balance between me and the music because it's Friday off the coding train and I'm talking into a microphone with music playing alright let us begin what are you watching just a strange corner of the internet it is true is what you are watching but my name is Dan Schiffman I am here every Friday and I have this like plan where maybe possibly I might also be here on other days of the week sometimes working on that stay tuned for 2018 which is another year after this year I also know from many of you that I've heard that the time that it is now which is approximately 345 Eastern Daylight Time it's the middle of a night for you or at least of the time that you're going to bed and I apologize for that I know that last week I did livestream in the morning my time which a lot of you enjoyed and some of you wasn't as convenient for so I will try to as much as I should probably actually set a specific time I will also try to vary the time using my handy random numbers all right I'm looking the balances fine the music could be louder I turned it down that's exciting to know all right so I am so this is the thing you would think that if only I had the time to like arrive here in this room in the morning and look through some stuff and makes them todo lists and think about things and answer questions and make a plan that this would be an organized helpful useful livestream about learning to code unfortunately what happens to me is I'm like around doing this and this turning out to this email got on this thing on the table and then I just become this room then none of the equipment works and I'm trying to remember which button to press and I'm live streaming I realized like I have no idea no idea what my plan is but I have to keep talking because of that I said we'll be dead air but actually this is video so if I'm silent and I just move perhaps it's fine low music so I'm looking at the chat don't turn the music louder do you Dan do you like Lady gaga you know Lady Gaga I believe let me we shouldn't graduate particularly she was a student here at Tisch at one point maybe she's in the hallway this is a hallway fresh air comes in from the hallway there is sunlight through the windows in the hallway but instead I'll just close this door and be in this strange this is by the way a storage closet I am in a storage closet with some file cabinets where some cameras and desks and computer equipment have haphazardly been set up oh and I've got the glare thing again so let's see if I can just set this light let me move this light okay all right so here I obtained you guys is the light okay this looks it looks I look very dark I will start doing something at some point let me try to fix this light I feel like kind of like extra dark I should you know I should probably do this before I start live streaming right this is not going very well there we go it's a little bit better okay oh oh that's me over here okay now I'm coming back alright so I actually have some stuff that I want to cover today what do I want to do so last week I should do some like introductory like stuff about what this is but I mean I'll get to that in a second last week I started introducing the topic of objectoriented programming with classes in es6 javascript everybody was just waiting to hear about that's what they wanted to spend their day hearing about so I want to continue that I'm slowly making my way through many videos from my introduction to JavaScript programming course that used a previous style of creating objects using a constructor function and I'd like to redo all those videos so I'm gonna at least try to do two or three do two or three of those videos today so I'll try to get a little further with that and introduce arrays with objects I also have been teaching recently about chat BOTS so I have a little presentation that I meant to look at before I got here I want to talk about chat BOTS and program a simple chat bot using p5.js in the browser browser by chat bot I mean just like a computer program that talks to you with text and so that can mean so many different things there's so many different frameworks and I will get to that sort of stuff at some point I eventually whoa there's a little bit hold on a sec don't want to get water as you know on the Kotick train it's always important to stay hydrated however this water bottle which is producing a lot of condensation right now this is very near the electronic equipment so let me deal with that you're watching a person drinking water on the Internet that's what you're doing right now you realize that right there was a point oh yes this was gonna be a prop Alexa what's the weather today oh okay what hey Google is this thing on computer make me a vegan turkey sandwich it's not working so I think I have to get an actual Alexa or something like that up here I will try to do that there's a sort of a weird problem where the flexible connect to the NYU WiFi so to figure that out I want to work on doing a coding challenge building an Alexa skill but before I get to that I want to try to use some just free and open source tools to make a chatbot and have computer talk to you with speech to text or text to speech wherever that thing is okay so that's on my list for today let's see what else this has been a rough week what are some things I went about oh whoa I'm so excited I got to talk about a couple things so first of all you are watching the coding train for more information about the coding drain you can to the coding train calm look at that look the coding trains currently live there I am I don't think he can hear that though so so things that you can do if you want to support the work that I'm doing is you can subscribe apparently YouTube likes it or they give you something they give you stuff when people subscribe to your channel like silver things to hang on your wall you can become a patron which is a way of a crowdfunding system to support the work that I'm doing and I am using those funds to hopefully make more videos and do more things in the future that's something you can do you could also help me figure out how to make this website nicer look at this this is kind of great I've done this stick before with the thing and live and the same time it's going back and forth please more volume so that's one thing I wanted to say now one of the things that I've discovered recently on the coding train is the Hat there's this whole community of people out there make watching and making stuff and me I am so me has come on board to help me manage some community projects where people could contribute code and apparently it's like hack tober fest I actually don't know what that is I should know what that is I guess that's run by a digital ocean and I think that if you do something where it's like at least four pull requests or something you can get a tshirt so anyway I don't know if you're interested in participating in this hack Tober fest you could consider contributing to one of these community projects now community projects what are these I'm very excited to report that the coding train twelve O'Clock project which is a project inspired by hold on a sec I just google to find things because I'm so unprepared by John Maeda worldrenowned artist extraordinaire John Midas 1990s work making these twelve clock designs this is an art piece that's in the permanent collection of MoMA and it only works on an OS 9 machine so Golan Levin who teaches a class at carnegie mellon it would spy helped inspire this clock challenge put up this documentation of these animated gifts he got the the clocks to run on an old emulator and we here we roll we hear me or maybe somebody outside this idea who knows I thought let's see if we can recreate all these clocks in p5.js and I am pleased to report that if I go here and click on this URL I have all of these clocks ported to p5.js now me I am so me and many of the contributors have painstakingly looked at all sorts of details to really see if they're accurate but we could always do more of this this is an ongoing continuing project it's great that all these ports are here and I believe if I click on this we can see here a list of many of the contributors there all sorts of like interesting features that I don't know Oh Topher J and the chat is asking if the stream froze is it just Topher or a Topher's back but what now it's frozen for everybody although the game of life thing is still animating so I think I can click oh look at this I can click on it I get a big I don't even know I could do this I mean I am so music genius and probably somebody else who actually added this feature I could see this clock closer up and we can see a link a referent a link to the github user who helped to port this clock and many of these clocks were ported by multiple users and you can see there even here in the list wow this is incredible this is like the greatest thing ever so this is the clock now community project number two clouds coding trained community clouds so I'm gonna go to this year now now this is actually a project for day processing org so processing Day is a community day to celebrate the community of processing that's happening on October 21st that's the two weeks from today Yanks well it's weeks from tomorrow in Cambridge Massachusetts I will be there I'm apparently gonna do some sort of like live coding Train episode I mean this is live but live in person where my legs will be seen for the very first time let's see if I can make that happen now oh this is gonna if I get injured so then it was nice it was nice getting this like month of live streams there we go okay so I will be there with my legs and on October 21st and so one of the ideas for this conference and the thing that I'm going to do for the live code and train up sewed is making a cloud design but the idea for the name tags and I think this came from Tim choy and other organizers of the event is to have each nametag have the name inside of an algorithmic cloud so this website shows all of these clouds and I think maybe there's a way I can just with the arrow keys I don't know if that feature has been added yet is it like every once in a while changing the cloud oh if I click it just goes to a new cloud so we can see all these different cloud designs oh look at that beautiful and so you still have some time to submit a cloud and your design will be on a nametag at the processing Community Day event so if you want to learn more about how to submit a cloud go to the github repository there are some instructions there just file an issue I will say however that the deadline I mean this is an ongoing project I hope these clouds will live on forever and maybe be reused again another time for a different purpose but were probably going to print the actual name tags early next week you know Monday or Tuesday so let's just arbitrarily say that Monday morning October 9th is the deadline Monday morning Eastern Time like 900 a.m. is the deadline to submit your cloud if you want to make sure that it's has a chance to be printed and maybe will be a little late looks up relate but that's what I'll guarantee for right now okay so now loyal viewer of the coding train Simon Tiger who lives in Europe who is seven years old mind you has created a community project as well called procedural designs now I'm trying to figure out where am I gonna find this we're I'm gonna find Simon's URL hold on let's go let's try github.com slash Simon Tiger what's the chance that that's right no I'm gonna have to look this up somebody in the looking old music Simon Tiger interesting so am I in the right place github calm slash Simon Tiger / procedural designs dunt dunt uh is it like Simon Tiger there we go Simon Tiger so um you can come here to see and let's look at the site and the idea this is inspired I think if by community clouds and but it allows you to submit something that's animated so well as the clouds or static designs and I Simon writes here there will be a new theme every month the theme this month the four elements water air fire earth so this is not an official community project but it is a community project that is created by Simon there's a loyal viewer and if people can provide some nice feedback or try test it out for him that would be wonderful and I would be glad to help with that okay what else I've got ah okay now the other thing is I have done some coding challenges recently and I am just amazed by if I go to whoops hashtag twitter.com hashtag ten print can you guys hear that music I just played in the classroom next to me so I've mentioned this book many times ten print I just have like books turn about the floor apparently here and there have been so many wonderful variations of the ten print design I encourage you to check out the Twitter hashtag ten print and my 10 print coding challenge if you want to keep that going on Twitter and also the new hashtag Ike which I think I need to workshop this a little more for the most recent coding challenge about recursion if I go to hashtag recursive train you can see that we're starting to get some submissions here so here's some nice variations by fire fluid on Twitter of the recursive design stuff that I showed in a previous coding challenge these are some kind of interesting ones it looks like this is combining recursion and ten print which exactly what chaos once on Twitter says this is quite beautiful oh and look so this let me actually click on the open processing link and there goes the camera which means I've been doing this for a half an hour this is called fractal oyd I think I'm not gonna oh this must respond to my microphone hello whoa this responds to sound oh oh here we go as always I always forget to this stop it stop it stop this dock awesome work and though this is a nice one I hadn't seen before by valu thick on Twitter and look at these I see some colorful ones coming up this is exciting look at these whoo I love this is beautiful love the choice of color and the variation of the circles so and nothing like a rainbow sierpinski triangle to bring joy to wednesday wonder if oh this is kind of crazy look at this so there's so many wonderful recursive designs that you can find on Twitter you can also I don't know if people have been doing this actually I haven't been keeping good track but if I go to coding train the code repository for the coding challenges and go all the way to the bottom and look at recursive design recursion there are none yet here so you can also pull requests and add links to your variations of the recursive design coding challenge I think this ends the introductory portion of today's Friday's coding train and so with that I am ready to actually start doing some coding but I will take a minute there's a little black mark on okay hold on there's a little black mark on the green screen if you go to a white page on your computer you will see it around the top right might be nice to fix it okay let's see so let me investigate this hold music please oh yeah look it's right there I see it wait over here what is that this it's not a black mark it is a cable a cable connecting a camera so let's see how do I get this out of the way is it this cable it's this cable it's actually this cable so I have my tricep muscles have fairly rich Burton hopefully my physical excellently there we go this is a good physical therapy live on the floating train a physical therapist I like erasing the whiteboard just good physical therapy cable tape problem resolved all right I feel like I look dark but maybe it's just if I come over here I'm out of the light over here so that's because I turned this light because of the glare issue lemme just see here how how much can I turn it more this way that's not so bad let's do that that's not such bad glare okay all right so I I am how what is it this is like don't tell me it's for oh my god it's four o'clock already it's okay what's the score of Red Sox versus Astros anybody no I'm not gonna watch that game later so I'm happy to be told in the chat baseball fans anybody okay five o'clock Yankees play Cleveland okay now I will take a minute to answer a few questions one of which I already know what it is is hey hey you coding train you had this video series about machine learning what happened to it so let me talk about that for a little bit and actually I think I might edit take this portion and edit it out to make a quick video because every time I produce a video now at least five of the comments are why aren't you making your machine learning videos that's what I'm here for and probably actually I'm projecting more likely the comment is like this you know just wondering I'm kind of interested in that machine learning stuff are you gonna get back to that so let me talk about that so where's my playlist do I have a playlist about machine learning by the way somebody asks why I was not subscribed to Suraj's channel when he was a guest here and it is because I am logged in on some like dummy count which is coding rainbow live at gmail.com don't email that address I'll never check it but why not have why not subscribe to YouTube channels also what's the one three blue brown what's that math channel that's awesome three blue brown Houston is winning four to one fifth inning three blue one brown okay so let me subscribe to that channel to 90,000 subscribers good work three blue brown uploads here we go would you guys mind if we just watch this video together would that be an appropriate use of this light stroking time probably not okay let me go to Suraj's channel and what's the interplanetary file system I have no idea what that is because I have to watch that later let me go to the coding training look how I just procrastinate for max doing any actual coding because I thought I was gonna answer their questions oh I see I'm not logged in as myself that's what's ultimately really confusing me here we go well have you thought I have you thought about exploring machine learning this is the class on udemy taught by an expert instructor you can make bro Busta models you should definitely consider that none of this nonsense here alright so okay so let me talk about this watching hello I'm here I am here mostly to apologize please stop don't throw the tomatoes the green wall will have Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here just to give a quick update about the my machine learning videos that I have a playlist called ten neuro networks the nature of code I was making these videos over the summer then I had this moment where I was like riding along on a bicycle and I was thinking way too much about machine learning I had a bump fell over I broke my elbow I had surgery on it twice I lost a couple months of like being able to make content and then the fall started so unfortunately I was in the middle of this series I was at ten point seven I had made seven videos that's crazy and every time I upload a video now comments asking could I please continue that series and I am planning to continue it what I do here on the coding train is I make videos about stuff that I'm currently teaching at my fulltime job here at New York University and currently what I'm teaching is an introduction to programming course and of course about text analysis so I am going to be making some videos about chatbots which is kind of adjacent to machine learning can be a tool to drive a chatbot I'm also gonna make some videos about hopefully long term short long short term I can't remember I don't have long or short term memory but some of these recurrent neural networks for text generation and then I my hope is that I will be coming back to this playlist again after this semester is over or towards the end of the semester if I finished up some of the content so in the meantime I hope to continue to have some github repositories where I'm gonna be making some new examples so stay in touch with me on Twitter and I would recommend to you well as you've seen as a guest on my channel Suraj has a channel about deep learning and also this is a new video that just came out from one of my favorite channels three blue one Brown but what is a neural network deep learning part one so now we have an internet competition will deep learning part to come out before ten point eight the answer is almost a definite yes so please write all of your complaints in the comments here I'm going to read them I'm going to sit with some sort of like meditative cucumber eye mask thing on and I'm going to listen to all of your feedback about why I should do this right now and the other stuff that I'm doing now and then I will feel guilty for a while and then eventually these videos will come out okay so thanks for watching this short little video explanation and I'll see you soon all right the sound is off everybody is telling me all sorts of technical stuff so that ad was super targeted right right it was like look you're gonna watch some crazy lunatics video about neural networks would you like to watch this absolutely sane you'dyou'd how do you say that you Demi you to me you to me I'm never gonna get them as a sponsor now and their ads gonna be removed from all my videos shortly I'm sure they're wonderful people over it you to me it's like Academy but you to me so it must be you to me so instead of it instead of Academy for the icons it's the udemy for the use you got it now alright um three blue brown you make some wonderful videos support three boob on support Siraj support oh look at this oh my goodness okay oh is the sound sticking off let's try so he's talking to me it sounds like the teachers in Charlie Brown won't long cuz just coming through the you know soundproof room I'm definitely to get to some coding soon swear swear I affirm I affirm I will get to some coding soon I remembered one other thing I wanted to mention I'm changing something here to do multi output device okay so now I think you can hear the audio and I'm going to go to SoundCloud so Christian Petersen or Christian Peterson I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing this correctly is keeping a playlist on soundcloud of coding train remixes best is where the biscuit song originally came from and there is another this song made by f looper the creator of the Perlin noise song which I play a lot and there's some other ones the loading song by Ike Bishop this is I haven't been able to add these to my on board yet so this is a new one called minime me so while I get ready to figure out what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play this song for you guys now a little contest here who can figure out which video this came from the fastest I don't know I don't have a prize for this contest but a shoutout will give a prize all right can you actually can you guys actually hear this oh that was the end of the song okay so let's put on the loading song I like that I'm just reading Twitter okay ah I'm getting ready to do some coding music okay thank you much maybe s can hear the people okay I got I got to turn this off I got a I got a start I've lost my the temperature in here is very wor okay all right so now what I want to do is talk about chatbots so this is this is I'm gonna do the object stuff but I sort of felt like if I did the object stuff that I would never get to the chatbot stuff that I want to do today so my goal is to so let me see here sorry I have to like plan this while I'm here with you guys so if I go to is there a programming with text one here no 15 so let's see here playlists I'm looking for my atoz playlists I really have to be logged into my own account all right I'll figure this out so this is gonna be a new this is going to be a new series of videos for the A to Z course it used to be called the A to Z it's called the A to Z course but I'm from YouTube I'm calling a program in with text because it's kind of an advanced course why don't you use a fan fan working here you think the client I think it's because I'm in a storage closet that there isn't really good climate control in this room so I have a little presentation that NACHA helped me with and so I mean this is a new experiment for me which is to actually like walk through some slides as if I like had a plan for what I was doing and talked a little bit about chatbots then I'm gonna do a tutorial about a chatbot framework called rive script and then I want to do a coding challenge or show you how to use this chat bot framework rive script which is open source with p5 GS and the brown this will lead me to eventually show you how to do speech to text in the browser so your chat bot could actually listen to what you're saying and talk back to you as if you were programming your own Alexa kind of our Google home type to a conversational interface from scratch we've only opensource tools and then I also want to explore using some not necessarily opensource tools like what does it does it need to make a skill for something like a product like the Amazon Alexa so I have materials for all of this already with my A to Z course I'll include links to that in whatever video descriptions I make and yes so this will this probably happen over the next couple weeks a little bit today a little bit next week so let's begin with that now I'm looking at the chat all right so hello welcome to the first video in a new section of my programming with text series so this kind of follows on the Twitter bot series because what I want to look at in this section is how to make a chat bot so now we can just think of that this term bot in a much more general way I mean Twitter bot could be a chat bot chat bot could be a Twitter bot I don't know what's the difference so when I think about BOTS I am this is straight from Wikipedia but a chat bot this is what I'm talking about I want to think about ways that I can make a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods so this could be a onesided conversation I could just be a Twitter bot that just says things every once in a while to nobody or to myself I could be two computers talking to each other I could be a computer and a human I could talk to my ok Expo what's the weather today oh shoot this thing does not actually how many electronics or speeches well but if I add like some sort of product from some company that I'm not gonna buzz market right now for free because he just sponsored me no not really I would show you that so I'm gonna get to all that sort of stuff in these videos series there's gonna be a lot of them this is just the first one so I want to think about where this topic comes from so of course many of you are probably familiar with Alan Turing and Alan Turing's question oh wait a second I'm sorry get the chat but you were looking at the chat I this is the thing I gotta stop I you know there's you shouldn't be stuff it's edited out ever but anyway okay oops I don't know it slides are coming next as I'm not prepared let's keep going Turing test is probably something that you you may be familiar with if not I'll include some links for further reading in this alright hold on pause I just ran what's the seminal paper called the Alan Turing paper it's called can machines think right where where the imitation game is proposed don't look at this machines think nobody's answered my question I do have a reddit AMA but I'm never gonna get through this if I'm gonna like try to like do some research like remember what the names of things are what's the paper called somebody's gonna tell me nobody's nobody's telling me this I'm just gonna keep going okay this is me reading Wikipedia backwards really fat is like it's entering my brain Papa thought yes I'm really looking at this in the wrong order the wrong order Computing Machinery and intelligence that's what I have here no wonder I just couldn't remember that thank you we're gonna get through this everybody you and me together so this idea of a chatbot of a computer that's having a conversation is nothing new we can we can date this research back to Alan Turing the seminal paper Computing Machinery and intelligence inspiration for the movie the the the imitation game can a computer think can a computer have a conversation much like a human being might have a conversation are their imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game eliza is an example of a chatbot created about the MIT artificial intelligence library in 1966 it simulated a conversation using pattern matching and substitution so this is really a key key points here so what does it mean to program a chatbot what are some techniques and styles for doing that and you might be thinking I know deep learning neural networks super artificial intelligent magic computer machine thing but one way to develop a chatbot that's actually quite powerful and is the way that I'm gonna start with some simple examples is by doing simple pattern matching and substitution by that I mean I'm trying to match a pattern in something that the person the human being or the other side of the conversation is saying and I have a database of replies for different patterns that I might match so Eliza's a wellknown a chatbot example perry is another one from 1972 created by Kenneth Colby at Stanford which attempted to simulate a person with paranoid schizophrenia so informally known as Eliza with attitude there is the lobe no prize which is an annual competition artificial intelligence that Awards a prize to the Chatterbox considered by the judges to be the most humanlike you know I think it's you know one could be critical about this you know a little worried I'm gonna I'm gonna it's alright everything's gonna be fine but I keep going through this I'm standing in front of the slides is like I'm not really like meant for this but so I think one question about the Loebner prize is is this is is this really is this is evaluating a computer's abilities to trick a human being into thinking it's a human actually a appropriate metric or measure of some form of intelligence or ability to carry out a conversation or is it just a metric of being able to foolishness way of like you know the best trickery and is there what's the what's the substance behind that trickery so I think which is something a question to ask beyond just is it fooling me or not so Alice is a project from 1995 as inspired by Eliza part of out the Alice project is something called AI ml which is an artificial intelligence markup language similar to something like XML or JSON it's a format for creating a script in essence for chatbot alice is the inspiration for the Spike Jonze movie her and this is interesting because the reason why I bring this up is so this is what AI ml looks like and this is directly from the Alice bot org website so this is great but it can be a little bit unwieldy to work with so what I want to do is look at systems that work in this way with something called a retrieval model so this I want to say that most of this information is from this wonderful article which is from Wild ml calm deep learning for chat BOTS and part one so a retrieval model is a way of creating a chat bot where there are a set of predefined responses and you're doing this pattern matching so you're trying to figure out some kind of heuristic of heuristic as a fancy word for educated guess basically I'm trying to figure out like aha the user said something which slot does that fit in did the is the user saying like what's the weather or order a pizza or what is it does it match some type of pattern and I have some predefined responses for different patterns so now that's heuristic that way of making an educated guess could be a really advanced machine learning system with some kind of like neural network thing or it could just be like regular expressions and pattern matching or looking for exact phrases and so you there's a lot that you can do even with these basic ideas generative model is something I also want to look at which is a way we'll we'll use some type of algorithm a contextfree grammar or a Markov chain a recurrent neural network some type of algorithm to generate the response as opposed to having these predefined set of responses this is very similar to how machine translation systems work something else to consider really is are you building a chatbot that's going to have a short conversation or a long conversation and my and certainly you could think of it's going to be much easier so an example of a short conversation is knock knock who's there chat bot chat bot who I'm making a video about chat BOTS that wasn't very funny so that's a short conversation and you could imagine that that's going to be a much easier thing to program in some long conversation that's going to I don't know talk about some you know Ionesco ZnO exit the play and what it means to you in your life or something like that so and by the way no exit was written by Sartre not ionesco this is really not going well I don't like this whole use a presentation thing I'm just trying it as an experiment I might not use this okay another thing to consider is open domain versus closed domain conversations you know are you creating a chat bot that the only thing the person will ever do with this chat bot is order a pizza and then you have kind of a framework to say well they might say large or small or medium they might say you know broccoli is broccoli appropriate topping for pizza I don't really eat pizza whatever they you know there's a closed domain of possible things that could be discussed as opposed to openended conversation that could be just about anything so this is certainly a much easier thing I think for you to work with in programs what I want to kind of focus on right now in these tutorials are short closed domain conversations that I think is a good place to start with building a chatbot oh yeah deep learning has something to do with this there's some interesting things that we could play with if you're looking at training data to sort of look at if you're going to use a generative model or a machine learning based model there's the internet movie script database which has like tons of movie scripts which are essentially big scripts of dialogue many of them and there's the boo to dialogue corpus which is a large data set from chat rooms that's open source that you can look at with these links and there's some wonderful and interesting projects and papers that I will include trained on friends episodes and all sorts of interesting things so there are some frameworks that you can look at that I would recommend that people tell me are interesting here's a list of some of them but what I want to use in my starting tutorials it's something called Drive scripts so rie script is fertile it's open source I'm pretty sure it's MIT license I will check that I'll have to correct this if it's not it's a simple scripting language for chat BOTS with a friendly easy to learn syntax this is all from write script comm and it's you you can it has just really a handful of simple rules that you can combine and recombine it with some powerful results to create a personality so this is where I'm gonna start I'm gonna look at a variety of techniques for creating chat BOTS I'm maybe even do some coding challenges to try to make some specific chat BOTS and I hope that you will make some interesting chat bots with me now you might be asking oh I want to make something for Facebook or discord or I don't know snapchat can you make a bot for snapchat probably not you might be wondering about this so I'm gonna stay pretty platform agnostic for at least the beginning and just look at systems and principles and you could plug in to other systems but at some point I will try to take a look just like I did with the Twitter bot series of some specific services that you might want to plug into where your thing that you're making has a conversation okay so I don't know if this video was useful or not but you just hear on the internet now and you have watched it and I will see you where I'll actually do some coding soon in the next video where I introduce Rhys script okay yeah pizza really is good I do like to eat pizza it's just you know I tried very I try to be very healthy eater not that pizza is unhealthy nothing unhealthy about pizza but you know if that's all anyway I don't know I'm talking about now okay right lactose intolerance that's really my problem cheese though is that really lactose I don't know it's one of your five a day oh yes it is okay the reason why I got a little paranoid there is that I'm very I like to be incredibly conscientious about crediting sources and this is some slides I made for a my class and I think a bit differently about things that I might show in a class if I'm quoting from something whereas I do versus things that I might show on this live stream so I got a little worried that like is you know did I not properly credit these so anyway so I'm gonna I'm gonna just sort of double check that but okay alright I'm having a little trouble today it's 430 what's the score of the Red Sox game now he's still waiting go Astros alright so let's see here it's so warm in here today I'm going to open this door for some fresh air for a second okay so here's rife script I should just start with the object stuff I feel unprepared for this tutorial is a really important this is a really excellent page and I had some notes I wrote down weird I them so what I'm gonna do is I am going to yeah I'm just scanning through this to remind myself about rice scripts okay all right okay so are you guys ready for this we are going to actually we are actually going to thank you Chris virgin four to one in the six inning okay we are actually going to do some stuff with rice crib now let me go to try it and I think rice script playground might work better yeah okay and all right okay and then what I need to do I think is probably dude this great and this okay here we go ready we're gonna make our first bot so this is going to be a quick tutorial of what is rice script and some of its features and it's bear with me for a second remember what these things are called write command symbol okay command symbol okay here we go everybody hello welcome to my first video beyond my introductory video about making chat BOTS and again I am using something called rive script and open source an open source library for chat BOTS a link to the github repository thank you to the creators and maintainer zuv rive scripts it's a wonderful project I've used it and a lot of things before I really enjoy using it so I'm gonna try to show you a bit about how it works I am not some sort of official representative of the rive script project I'm just a user and fan of write script so the idea oh boy the idea of Rive script is to is pattern matching is a is it it's basically a chatbot system that uses a technique called pattern matching and retrieval oh those are the right terms let me describe to you what I the user says something hello that goes into the chat box brain the brain does something so this is input and then gives a reply hi we could actually make a chat I know it's shocking I know we could program a chat bot that does this any time the user says ha hello and then that could be typed in or spoken in depending on what sort of what our interactive what our what medium we're we're kind of deploying this chat bot says hello and the reply which the word reply has an L in it guess we're wondering it says hi so rive script is the thing that i want to use here I want it to be the brain of the chat bot it's not the only option in the world for programming or creating a chat bot brain but it is one option I am going to start at least by using javascript and p5.js to take my input and display my reply so I'm gonna build a simple chat bot that just runs in the browser programmed with JavaScript in the p5 just library but I'm gonna have its brain driven by RIE script and this brain uses a technique called pattern matching so ultimately there are so many different kinds of things we could put into this brain that are super sophisticated but one thing I could actually do is just say did the users say exactly this word hello or did it say the word hello or hi or howdy can I match one of these possible phrases that the user said and if it said one of these possible phrases that I'm gonna say this exact reply this is the idea of Rive script and so every rive script is really just a markup syntax for configuring different sorts of expected patterns much like a regular expression if you look at my regular tutorials that you might expect the user to say and the replies that should come with those patterns so every so the way arrives and Rui script is modeled off of something called a I M L artificial intelligence markup language which is an XML like tag based markup thing that is interesting you could also use but rive script has a bit of a simpler syntax so in ryf script every single was just a text file every single line in the text file begins with a command symbol so some possible command symbols are an exclamation point plus minus and pound or hash tag so this is just wait timeout how am i doing with the whiteboard today it's the white boy look you can see it everything seems fine there's like a gif of okay sorry okay that looks good what I was saying so for example this chat bot that I want to program would look like this hello hi which means the plus means this is the pattern I want to match as the input and the reply that I want to give to that input is the this is the reply now one thing I could do is I could have two possible replies so the first thing i can do in rai script is configure an input that i'm looking for and then give a set of possible replies and rive script will pick one of those randomly there actually isn't even a syntax for waiting these so I could say 90% of the time I want to say hi and 10% of the time I want to say howdy so you know that's a level of detail that I don't think I need right now for what I'm gonna try to demonstrate but that is possible so you might be asking the question okay if that's the basic idea well how do I learn what all the possible things I could put here are and and hopefully I'm going to show you some of them I don't actually really I don't have them memorized so I'm gonna have to like learn them and figure them out as I go a bit and and and and and how where do I learn that stuff so and and where can I test out so could I test out a brain configuration without having to write my own JavaScript code so yes yes yes all of the above just come over here with me oh look we're over here so this is the rive script website I find if you go to just rise script comm you'll come to the main web page but under here a slash Doc's tutorial this is a wonderful walkthrough of all the possible features and you can see here I'm going to skip some stuff here about you can say here here is the your first chat bot same thing that I've said exclamation point is a kind of command simple for like a configuration thing you can actually store variables and different things like that in the chat pod which I will get to so we want to be compatible with version 2.0 of Rive script and i want a plus to say hello bot and a minus to say i want to I want to look for the user saying hello bot and I want the bot say hello human so let's go and actually test this now there's something called the rice script playground and I'm gonna get rid of this part of it so here is that chat bot in the right script playground and I can say well I'm gonna say run so I can down here say hello bot and it says hello human and I'm going to say hi hi bot and it says error no match reply no no reply match so here's the first thing I want to do I would like to have something that's a catchall of response for anything I don't know about let's add that pause point to the video we're gonna look up how to do that ah catch oh I think it's just a wild card catch all triggers just start yeah that's what I thought okay I was right I didn't have to look that up okay so just like in regular expressions where you have meta characters and literal characters and this is what I'm saying here is like I want to match exactly hello notice there's no capitalization here so capitalization and punctuation don't really play a role in the patterns that you're matching you're just looking for the raw text but I can have wildcards so I couldn't say something like Apple I love apples or apples are delicious so now I'm using a wild card so Apple anything after Apple will give you one of these responses so now if I run it Apple you eats question mark apples are delicious Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple I love apples to see we even got one the different one the second time but if I say hello Apple error no reply matched so this is one way you can use a chat bot to kind of just realize that the users kind of brought up a certain topic so for example if you want to say anywhere the word Apple appears if the user says anything with Apple say like oh let's talk about apples and then I can also use a complete and total just one star as a wildcard to say like I prefer to discuss fruit so now I'm gonna run my chat bot and I'm going to say hello bot hello human and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say let's discuss pokemons and then rock group says I prefer to discuss fruit oh I love apples and oh no oh no what happened here so look at this oh I love apples ROG script is saying I prefer to discuss fruit am i still making a video about chat BOTS in this is actually like what I'm talking about oh boy hopefully this is okay here so I think what's going on here is I have Apple space star and maybe if I did Apple star like that then now I could say oh I love apples oh let's talk about apples so that space was actually matching their the Apple space star I needed to have I couldn't you I couldn't match apples okay anyway so you get the basic idea here this we could see here so this is very little like this is just like all I we've learned so far is I can match something exactly or I can match something with a wild card there are many more things that you can do I will not be able to show you all of them but I'm going to show you a couple more things pause for a second I need to drink some water and think about what I'm going to do next this is what happens right so my intention by the way for those of you watching this live stream the pizza actually so ordering pizza is actually a pretty good as an example that I see a lot on the internet for yes it's gonna make that pineapples or apples it's a very good point so I think it's my intention actually really was this morning to go through all this rice group stuff to prepare and I didn't do it so this is kind of a mess I think I think it's better if I usually I try to make videos after I've taught something in class and I usually didn't get to this in class so one thing I want to look at is variables openended tree these are all these are called triggers I forgot about that so I'll mention that I'm saying input but they're really called triggers oh yeah and that all right remember right okay okay so let's add a few more things to this chat bot now one thing that I would like to mention is that the the the these are the the plus elements without I've been calling inputs are actually called triggers so the term for that is trigger and you'll actually see in some modern chat bot systems this word called intent so we're trying to match the intention of the user what if which in what is their intention and what would i if what is it that they want to do and i need to reply accordingly so one thing that you we can do that's nice about these wildcards is we can also use what the person said in the wildcard in the reply so I can say what if the user says my name is star and I could say nice to meet you and then star so I can refer back to what they said by putting star in the these greater than Alessa so I can say my name is coding train now interestingly enough nice to meet you coding train and it didn't keep my capitalization and there's probably some way that I could configure that we could look through the documentation and that's a little bit weird that my name is coding train but so that's one thing you can do we can also have multiple stars so I could do something like my name is star star and then I could change that nice to meet you star I could be like really weird about this star 2 comma star 1 so like for example my name is Daniel she Mon nice to meet you Schiffman comma Daniel because this is a thought who likes to speak very formally so you can see here that you can match the different different stars in a particular order so again there is nothing going there's this is there's no type of learning or training I am configuring precise patterns for the bots to look for with certain replies okay I'm just looking at the chat and can we make the chap out return dynamit responses like if the user sends Bitcoin price them oh yeah okay so a question is coming up in the chat which is great which is like well what if you what if the user asks something about the weather and you wanted to say well the web the temperature today is blank so this would be some this is why I want to combine Drive script with JavaScript and I'm gonna do this in the next video but this is just essentially the script for the brain but there's no reason if I'm not if I'm using this brain in my own code that I couldn't also inject something like an API call so I will have you know there's not I could write my own program to do a lot if elseis if conditional statements and regular expressions that I don't need rive script before but riah script is a nice syntax for me able to configure a really elaborate set of possible possibilities and then I can combine that with coding to do something much more dynamic so that's really where I'm trying to go with this here so I want to look at a few more features in Rive script so substitutions is an important one let me look for that substitutions this is this can be edited out match yeah yeah I can't spell substitution yeah okay an important feature of Rive script is substitutions because you know you might have something where the the chat bot might say who is there not the chat bot do you the trigger you're looking for is who is there but the user might say who's there or who is there and so something you can do in Rive script is configure all these different substitutions meaning these are equivalent substitute I'm for I am substitute I'd for I would so you can put I m in your chat bot let's do this right here let's put this here I'm gonna add this as a substitution at the top and now I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm oh I'm just gonna change this to I'm oh I am sorry and now I'm gonna run this and I can say I am Dan Schiffman nice to meet you shift in comma Dan or I'm ship I'm Dan Schiffman same thing so now I have a substitution so this is a way that I can have this particular phrase and so one thing that you can actually do that will see is that you can have separate files that make up the brain so this thing that I'm talking about all these files can be a can have the dot rive extension and you could have many many many of these so you could have one file that just has a thousand substitutions in it and you could use that as part of the brain you could use that for multiple projects and and you could just carry that file along with you so once you've made one chatbot or you're using somebody else's chat bar you got an example chat bot you can divide things in different files to kind of keep organized and reuse stuff another key feature is variables so I think there's two more things that I want to talk about one is variables and one is sequencing so how do you do variables so I'm pretty sure that you can just do stuff like var var name equals computer and then I think nice to meet you star and and then so if the if the user says who are you you could say I am named I think this is how this works I'm actually kind of speculating I think you can set up a name and then you can say I am that name so let's see if that works who are you I am blank so that's not right so much for me just making up what rice group does let's look for it in the tutorial variables variables my name is hold on let's hold on Matthew I'm sorry to make you add at this let me so so that didn't work let me find it in the tutorial so hold on let me actually try to find it how do you set how do you said yeah var name equals tutorial and then and then where is it oh yeah this is good these are good all right you can do an or I'm gonna show this you can do optional you can do arrays all these things you can do but what I'm trying to do is how do you put a variable into the thing that's right knock knock is a great one it's an example here my name is set name set age get 8 you say get ah okay oops ah let me find that spot oops there's so many things sorry sorry everybody this is what happens when you don't prepare for class okay okay so I found this spot in the tutorial I apologize you have to if you want to display the value of variable you have to use get as well so what I missed here is I am get name so I'm gonna run this now and I'm gonna say who are you I am undefined how what did I get wrong okay Dwight what did I get wrong here set Nate I know you could say set me variables I just keep looking at the chat like someone's gonna like you I need I don't think I need it in quotes do I but I'm like scrolling like a crazy person here it's like scrolling up and down in this variables okay name yeah look at this huh why can't I just use okay oh by the way pound is not a comment it's slash slash I don't know I said pound how do I use the variable nice to meet you my name is Noah I know how to use set to set the variable know I can't believe someone just used the super chat keep it donation that's the most ridiculous thing ever that just happened thank you green person who currency is euros yeah come on come on come on come on what did I miss var name is it var name equals computer get name so I know I could well let's try putting I don't think putting this in quotes does anything who are yeah I have some examples why don't I go look at my examples so I have a chatbot workshop that I did boy this is really so let's look at this I should have looked at this first far name equals bot this means define that's what I put in my example and then I'm not using it here window botany really oh if it's not something I set it's actually this oh yeah all right thank you me I am so me so it appears that for the variables that you set up at the top you can actually retrieve their values not with get but with the keyword bot get is something that I'm going to show you in a minute that's four variables that you've set in a different way using set so maybe I'm missing a few important details here that I will try to get to but so what I need to do is if I want to retrieve that variable I use bot name so these are like kind of almost like fixed constants or settings for the particular bots so I can say now I can say who are are you and it can say I am computer the reason why this is useful is I could use bot name in all sorts of places in my chat bot and then I if I wanted to change its name later I could just change it at the top so it's a way of setting just like the reason why you might use variables and coding the same reason why you might use variables here now here's the interesting thing sometimes you might want to remember something the user says so for example let's say let's say what you what you though the user says my favorite favorite color is star now one thing I should mention is there ways of setting up specific options only that they're a valid like it has to be a number or it has to be a word or has to be one of these three words then you can have a different reply if it doesn't fit that that but but for right now I'm just gonna say my favorite color is anything and what I want to do is say oh I love and I can do set color equals star something like this too so this is this idea of in addition to displaying back what the user said I could store that in another variable now I might not have gotten this syntax exactly right let's go look at the tutorial so I'm gonna search for the part of the tutorial that's using set so yeah so set Nate set name equal star so actually what I should do is put this at the beginning and then I can say get if I want to actually use that and I could use that later too so for I did that wrong so let's do this was right set color equals star and then I could say oh I love get color and let me give myself a bit more room here so that fits in one line I know I'm gonna be standing in front of it but we can see here okay so now what I could do is if the user says my favorite color is blue oh I love blue but I haven't only spent sent something back to the user what I can actually say I am but who are you I am bought name and my favorite color is get color so this is a way now that the bot will always say back the same favorite color that the user has set so now we can say my favorite color is purple which is actually my favorite color and then I can say who are you I am a computer and my favorite color is purple so we can actually use stuff that the user is saying store that information and save it later so you could imagine if you're creating a pot to have a conversation over a period of time that's gonna remember stuff about the user this could be incredibly useful oh I'm sorry I need because it's a bot variable Thank You Simon tiger so the important thing here is the difference between bot variables which are the ones you set up at the top and other variables that you're setting during the conversation with set okay so there's a few other things I want to cover here let me look at my examples they're random multiple replies this is not so important so wild cards multiple things all right yeah oh yeah optionals is important so here oops so I have a set of examples that will include front links from this video that mostly pull from that tutorial I'm just gonna kind of show you those right now because we could spend forever like showing you each possible configuration but I think once you get the basic idea of how it works you can read through the documentation yourself and the key thing here that the key thing here that I want to demonstrate to you is the next step which is actually using this in your own program in JavaScript which is pretty exciting and interesting so this is some of an example that I have so I already talked to you about star which means match anything and you can you can say you could have different stars star one star two you can have a catchall you can match only a number so if if the if it's not a number you could you could match you could you could say back like oh please give me a number you can match only A to Z characters you can have something optional like if the user says what is your phone number or what is your number optional anything is a nice way to match a topic so if so if the this is sort of us doing this earlier you can see if the user uses the word JavaScript anywhere can you teach me to program in JavaScript you can use in other so if the user says I love purple or I love pink you could say what about red so this is a lot of this you'll notice the syntax is very similar to regular expressions and you can also use an array so I was kind of mentioning this before right you can set up an array of different options and then you could say what if the user says to anything that matches anything from that array so there are so many Possible's possible configurations that's just a little bit I'm trying to think if I missed anything else that I wanted to show you in here learning I mentioned in terms of like saving information oh and you can also have conditionals so so this is really great so one thing let's try this actually so let's try to use I think the age is a good example where the bots think of a number and the user has to like guess the number so maybe actually that's what we'll do when I get to the JavaScript example so let's not worry too much about this right now you can see that if if the if the bot says and if the user sorry if the trigger is it's always very confusing I keep saying the wrong thing if the user says and my older than you if the users age that was set up here is greater than 10 say you are I am 10 if the users age is less than or equal to 10 nope I am 10 so this is like saying that the bots age is 10 and incidentally I could make that a bot variable as well or a user set variable because maybe the user says how old the bot is I don't know so there's so many possibilities here I hope this gives you boy this is a really terribly disorganized introduction to Rive script I you know admittedly I was really figuring it out as I went I don't know write script that well but I kind of did this for myself to remind me how it is and what it does and now I want to take that next step and use rive script in a JavaScript program you could and you can use one of the things I love about writing scripts is it's open source it's MIT license and you can use it in a variety of programming languages I'm the user in JavaScript so I'll see you in the next video where I'm going to do that I saw somebody in the chat say something about this big boring yeah I feel a little like like I'm a little off my game today which I do I say every week but today okay yes rye script does support random numbers I think sort of boring boring boring okay so what I'm going to do now is hopefully gonna do something a little more interesting which is do I don't know whether this should be a coding challenge let's make this a coding challenge and have it be I mean the thing that I made already was a knockknock joke thing oh it was sequencing I forgot to mention sequencing I'm not worried okay good thank you positive feedback cuz otherwise oh this cameras off it was gonna change to that otherwise I'm gonna be reduced to saying talking to you this way to make an s boring okay so she sees all right so let's I think I'm gonna do this as a coding challenge I'm going to generate it's five o'clock and then I'm going to so I'm not going to do the P 5 speed stuff I'm going to try to do some more object videos today eight to one Astros Wow okay where am i I'm a desktop CD desktop p5 generate chat bot oh no no clear make directory chat bot o CD chat bot p5 generate B how about a chat bot one okay so now Python I'm sorry Austin gives me tells me to learn to check out I I term is that what it's called a really really really should do that but I'm just still just using simple HTTP server and localhost 8001 minimize this open up atom and close this and go to I will get there eventually everybody chatbot I think this is lower than it usually is maybe it's not feel so much lower I mean that's too much table for you guys to see in the video okay chatbot one sketch a yes/no canvas and so one thing I want to do is that I'm going to just download the rive script JavaScript library in advance so that's not part of the actual video tutorial that I'll publish as part of this live stream so when I go to write script j/s and what I want is Oh No look I can just do it this way so I can always just link to it this way so I'm gonna do that so that will be there and there we go and okay alright how's the font size everybody font size okay I think feel like it needs to be a little bigger so the thing that I forgot to mention is sequencing oh you know it should be don't you think it should be that the bot has to guess the random number so we're thinking of the random number and the bot has to guess it hmm that's this is gonna be a hard one I should just do the knockknock joke thing I mean that's an example from rive script I actually have no idea how to do this with the guessing the random number thing because oh no it's easy I just check whether it's equal less than or greater than and I have some other stuff about picking the random number and your name and whatever let's do it so who should who should pick the random number I should pick the random number cuz I know I'm saying their number and I have to figure out whether it's bigger or the bots know the bots picking the number is gonna be oh I could have an automatic thing who's the user pick it okay the bots gonna pick the number okay bot thinks of a number okay thank you everybody that's gonna do that all right oh you know what I want to do packages so there's a rive script syntax highlighter I'm so I'm gonna go to packages oh I already have it installed okay so this is I already have this rive script syntax highlighter installed okay and here I'm sketch that yes all right everybody you ready here we go pick them from the book of course so how do I feed it how do I feed it the random number but I could do I have a clever idea I think I know I have I have a crazy idea I've got an idea oh this is gonna be good this is gonna be good this is gonna be good okay I'm excited welcome to a coding challenge where I will make a cheese bot that thinks that a random number and then the user has to guess that ringing them that random number will be thank you very much okay so I already forgot what I said three 7155 so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript I'm gonna say let let dot let dot no there's no that dot let number equal 37 Oh 555 okay I guess the bots gonna think of a number between 0 and 999 thousand and the chat bot framework that I'm gonna use to create this bot is something called rive script and I made a really terrible video about rive script that you could go and watch if you haven't but I would probably recommend just go and look at the right script tutorial which will be linked on the right script website which would be linked in this video's description and so what I need to I need to do two things I need to program in JavaScript I need to configure my chat bot the brain of the chat bot right this is a diagram technical fail this is a diagram from my previous video where I have something a JavaScript program is going to feed input into the brain and the brain is going to give me a reply so I'm gonna do all this input and output in JavaScript but the brain is actually gonna be controlled by rive scripts so in order for that to happen I need to create a rive script file so I'm gonna say a new file and I'm gonna call it a brain drive there's I don't have to call it that I'm actually I have an atom package the atom drive script package which is doing syntax highlighting so I can do things like and I said in my previous video that a pound was a comment it's not so this is the chatbots brain so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give the chat bot a specific number I have an idea for the number to be picked randomly each time but let's just start with specific random number in the chat bot so this is rive script syntax it looks like JavaScript but it's write script syntax and I'm gonna do something that just says so I'm gonna do a catchall so I'm this is a trigger so this is so rife script if you didn't watch the previous video or don't know anything about it is a pattern matching system for chatbots so this is match any the user says that I don't match otherwise I'm gonna say the reply is going to be guess a number between zero and nine nine nine nine nine right so that's what the chat bot is going to say so actually let's leave this let's try to get the whole system working and then we'll come back and finish configuring the chat bot so how do I want to make this work well I want to have let's start putting some stuff in the HTML like chat bot and then I'm going to create a input user gonna call this user input and I'm gonna say say I'm gonna and then I'm going to create I'm going to create so this I'm just trying to put some stuff on the HTML page and I'm going to say reply I mean I'm not being thoughtful about the design here output and then I probably need like some sort of button that's like submit I mean like button ID equals submit button so again I'm being absolutely not very thoughtful about this interface but I'm just putting it let's see if what I wrote here in HTML will appear on the page there we go and the button should say submit great so this is the idea is that I'm gonna be able to say things like hello and hit submit and the chat BOTS gonna say something to me here in the reply obviously it's my hope that those of you watching this video will make something more creative and thoughtful about the design and eventually what I want to do is use a library called p5 speech to actually have all this happen with voice so but let's first make it work with text and I'll do another video to make it work with voice okay so how do I then so now I have my framework and well let's actually look we need to write some JavaScript I forgot about that part so let's go back to JavaScript and I don't need to draw a function and I'm gonna say let button equals select I called it some an idea submit I'm gonna say let user input equals select user input is the ID I gave it and what else do I need I need let output equals select output so now I have access to all of those Dom elements like I need the bunny to know when the user hits the button I need to know in the user what the user is said when they hit the button I need to build to put the reply somewhere so now I need a callback an event for whenever I click the button button Mouse pressed and I'm gonna call function called chat so I'm now going to write a function called chat and all I'm gonna do here I'm going to say input equals user input value so this is me getting the value what the user said and I'm gonna say output dot HTML input so I now have a parrot chat bot I have made a parrot chat bot all it ever will do is put back what the user says I haven't put the ride script brain into this program yet so now let's see if this is correct if I run this hello hello goodbye goodbye what's up question mark what's up so we can see here this is my very basic parrot chat bot I can read what the user says and I can give it a reply now what I want to do is have rive script act as the brain to tell me what the reply should actually be well time out I think somebody's at the door oh hello I'm yes I'm actually live right now you can't nobody can see you but they could hear you oh I got it for Jeff already I uploaded it oh I just haven't emailed it to you guys but I will okay perfect no problem that was a very famous guest star that just appeared on the coding train let's see if anybody could guess who that was if anybody heard that conversation okay so where was I in this video I oh this hasn't happened for you guys in real time yet now I'm seeing that okay I'll say who that was later another time let's see if anybody can guess okay uh was not Lady gaga that was a good lady we was Elijah the prophet no anyway as you open the door whatever okay so where was I okay now it's time for us to add that brain so I'm gonna go to the right script github page and this is actually in this particular repository called rive script J s so write scripts is a generic syntax for configuring a chat bot that you can then use in a variety of different programming languages environments I want to use it in JavaScript so all I need to do and one thing I've done already that I should have mentioned is I've imported the rive script library so here i've imported the rice script library just from a URL i could download it but i must have a reference to that rice script javascript library so i've done that is and it's covered in that github page and then I'm really just gonna say load file so no first I'm going to create a bot so I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna say let bot equal new rye script then I'm gonna say load file and my file is just called brain drive and I'm gonna I need to callbacks ready brain ready and brain error being very inconsistent of my naming of stuff so I'm now gonna write those callbacks brain ready console dot log chat bot ready and then I'm going to say brain error console dot log chat bot error and I'm sure I could there's probably an argument I could get some information about the error but let's just add this right now and let's just see if I now run this uncaught dollar sign is not defined so I have an error somehow let's take a look maybe I need to say at the top of version right I was doing this before let's say version 2 probably I might need this the top of the brain and let's go back no ok debugging time debugging debugging debugging time debugging time hmm what's wrong here dollar sign is not defined let me look at my actual example oh did I type the name wrong name of the file oh my god brain drive Oh brah look everybody in the chat sorry apparently I named my chat bot Brian without realizing it the name is brain not Brian the life of brain okay here we go let's try this now ah oh I know what the problem is I know what the problem is what could possibly dollar sign is not defined mean what javascript library uses dollar sign as a key term jQuery I think that rive script depent the rive script JavaScript library depends on jQuery and I have it imported jQuery that must be the problem right so it's not even loading the file it hasn't even gotten to the air and error in the file yet so if I want to load jQuery let's find a way to do that and I should be able to I don't know jQuery minified copy this copy I need to blow jQuery in my index.html file so and I can do that via URL so oops ah let's grab this come on people help me out here with some copy pasting this should copy it copy to clipboard copied it's not copying it to clipboard I hope this part gets edited out okay so okay so now I've imported jQuery as well here's the thing so JavaScript files that a web page uses can be loaded just like this is the code that I'm writing it's it's get Dutch yes these are some p5 libraries that I'm using but they're actually locally stored on the computer there are some other libraries but I'm getting them from a URL all these things are possible I don't know there's probably some nice good best practices here that somebody who knows something about programming will tell you but I'm just gonna make it work okay so now let's go back hit refresh chatbot ready okay so the chat bot is ready so now what do I do next what I want all I need to do is here in this chat and I probably should make you know if I were being really careful about this I would write some code to make sure the brain had been loaded before the bot tries to reply but I think it's very unlikely that a user is gonna be able to submit something before the bots actually loaded so but I'm gonna show you there's something I'm gonna have to add to this later that I think it's gonna be a little bit of an issue okay so what I'm going to do is I am going to I have code you alright so I need to ask the bot for a reply I'm pretty sure this is gonna this is gonna be here just in this page and oh interesting so I think that I might actually need this the replies have to be sorted to be honest I have no idea what that does but I imagine this is some sort of like processing element so let's add this in and so let's add this in under brain ready I'm gonna sort the replies and then what I want to do is I want to say let reply equal bot reply input now I think this actually isn't going to work I think I need to say I think if I look at the code example here local user I forget what this does but I need to give the first argument as local user so I want to say let input equals user input value and bot reply love it so let's see what happens now I think I did everything hello guess the number between so no matter what I do it's just gonna say guess the number between 0 and 99 99 so now aha so what do i what what else do I need in this chat bot so for example what if the user says any number great guess I like the number star1 so this isn't a star but this is a wild card just like this is a wild card but this is a wild card that only will match number so now if I reload this again if I say anything I'm gonna say guessing number but if I say 100 great guess I like the number 100 let me make this a little bit bigger so we can see I'm starting he could figure the bot to do certain things now what I really want to do is use a conditional so I want to say something like if star 1 is greater than is greater than bot num then I'm going to I need an equals here I don't even remember then I'm going to say pick a higher a lower number and if it's less than I don't know if I've got the syntax right here pick a higher number and again you can go and read the raj script tutorial heart watch my previous video that wasn't very good nothing this one's any good and then I could say oh I'm sorry what am I doing here I'm in the wrong I'm totally in the wrong place oh no no I'm in the right place I just don't know if I have the syntax right and then if it's equal you got it you got it so let's go to the Rice script tutorial which is here and let's look for conditional condition condition additional so this is a way I can have the bot set something and what I'm looking for is like this here we go ah what I get age is greater than 25 this is what you can do so this is what I want I have I want this conditional and I need the equals like almost like the arrow syntax the equals greater than so I want to say equals like this so I think this should work let's see if this is right and let's let's take a look here oh these are stars so I guess I need stars if I'm going to do a conditional and syntax highlighting is doing something weird which and the equal should be double equals I guess there we go so I think maybe this is right now okay let's see and I don't don't need to say star one cuz there's only star so let's see what's the chance I've gotten this right so things are still working is telling me to guess the number I'm gonna guess the number 10 pick a higher number I'm gonna guess the number 9 9 9 9 9 9 pick a lower number I'm gonna guess the number 37 5 5 5 you got it okay we should probably do more with this bot like it should have a name and it should be able to respond to other things but one thing I want to do is so why am I doing this I don't know I've really lost track of that but one reason why I'm doing this is if I combine rye Script and JavaScript I can make use of the powerful pieces of Drive script and JavaScript together so what I could do is I could actually have JavaScript I don't think there's a way for write script easily to pick a random number it probably is but just for the sake of argument what if I oh it's funny how I had this here so what if I actually say let num equal floor random nine nine nine nine nine so and then I'm going to and actually what I'm saying is 100,000 oh and I need to know the parentheses now I'm going to just console.log that number let's just what I want is for JavaScript to pick the random number there so it's picking a random number each time and maybe I need to make this a little bigger so you can see it right so how can I pass something that javascript picked to the bot well I'm asking I'm sending things to the bot from the user but I don't actually have to I could send stuff from the bot from my program as well so there's no reason why I couldn't actually just do this when the chat bot is ready and then what if what I send to the bot is let reply equal bot dot wouldn't it what is what is the function bot reply user lok local is it something like that i don't know i can't remember the local user set plus the number so what I'm doing is I'm sending to the bot I'm telling the bot like a secret message the code is sending a message to the bot not me the actual user typing saying set number so what I now want to do is if and of course this is very easily hackable don't get me wrong set number is a message where now I the bot will set and we don't need this a hardcoded variable anymore set num equal star so this will actually and I don't did I get this syntax right looks like something might be weird but I think I got it right so set Nam equals star and then now I can change this from bot num to get numb so let's see and I don't know let's make this pick a number between but between 1 and 10 just to like make things a little simpler here so this is gonna be a guess a number between 1 and 10 between one and ten and now the number will be here plus one because this is gonna give you a number between zero and nine and so and let's actually let's look at that number so we can cheat so to speak to make sure this is working and let's run this now okay so we'd pick the number four I can see that in the in the in the console so if I say one no reply found so what happened here brain so this is wrong this is clearly the wrong syntax let's go back to the rive script tutorial and we can see here a set name oh you know what it is you probably doesn't want any white space their set name equal formal formal by the way this is a way to keep that the case sensitivity of what the users typed there's all sorts of things and and so I can say set num let's see where was that set name equals formal let's just paste this in here to make sure I'm using the right syntax set num equal star so let's try this pick a higher number nine pick a lower number eight pick a lower number seven you got it too so you know I'm hacking it basically but pick a higher number pick a lower number so probably I don't know if this is the best solution there might be a different way to pass that value to the brain but certainly if I wanted to do it this way I could come up with like a really strange thing that the user would probably never type that's almost like a secret code to set a particular value that I'm getting from JavaScript so so anyway um there's more that could be done with this I've missed so many pieces thing that I actually missed that's important about chat bots are sequencing so one thing you can do is what if I have an example that's a knockknock joke bot and so and that's actually from rive script I encourage you to check that out on the tutorial let's actually look for it but you can see something that's important here is about is the previous command so in other words the wildcard you want to you basically the user in a knockknock joke the user can say anything I could just paste this in the user can say anything but there'd be the chat BOTS gonna say something different based on where you are in the sequence of the knockknock joke so this is saying this is what the user this is what the chat bot should reply with after who is there has already happened and this is what should the chatbox reply after who so that's important okay I went off track there so here is my number guessing chat bot with rice script and p5 I would love to see what kind of different chat BOTS you make with this same framework you know what happens if you like start querying api's and get there like the weather and have the bot talk about stuff and different topics or it's a programming questions or I don't know what you can make this bot do but I look forward to seeing what you guys create from this video to say that again I feel like I look forward to seeing what you create from this video losing my mind I look I look forward to seeing what you create from this video and in the next video I'm going to take exactly this I don't know if I'm gonna do this in the next video but in the next video or two I'm gonna do exactly this but with speech recognition so this conversation this guessing game could happen just purely in an auditory if that's the right word audio way okay things are clicking all over the place see you soon good bye okay oh there's some interesting thing happening in the chat alright so hopefully this was useful for people look at this you can make a chat bot so easy a game guessing thing look how easy that was and I didn't even use any neural network involved with any of this stuff I don't know what are you talking about rounded up to the nearest ten million me I am so me okay so what time is it 535 I how long have I been live streaming am i at two hours already I two hours is generally my limit let me see what I'm gonna do in terms of this object stuff that I want to keep going with because oh you okay topic discussion in the patron live channel I really like it's you totally can you don't listen to me that should be your channel to enjoy yourself to talk about anything you want but those I got confused okay I feel like there should be like a live channel that I should see in a live channel that I shouldn't see close the span what did I miss whoops open recent chat BOTS oh sorry thank you there we go alright 305 a.m. in India and by the way the audio has the audio the audio is good alright let's see here so now you've made a chat but let's I'm right I'm going back to object stuff please hold you know when your hands are covered in flour or ooh chicken gizzard this is these are the new video I'm going through and slowly replacing and leaving online my older videos objectoriented program in es6 so this definitely needs to be redone arrays of objects but before I get to that I also was gonna do this like more on objects video which is remember I had this list let's see if I have it it's whoops go back let me come over here oh sorry this camera went off very hard to erase to use pressure on the board this eraser is also terrible but not so bad grey wizard and the chat will be reminding me to get a better eraser right about now so the things that I wanted to I mean the things that I want to eventually get to are so in this is a video that I imagine that's more on objects what are the things that I want to include let me go to once again here and looking for learning processing and I'm looking for objectoriented programming okay okay and more on objects particle class objects as data for other objects overloading and objects communicating with other objects make a robot already overloading hmm actually what I want to do is clickable so I think the objects communicating with other objects is almost more interesting once I have an array because if I go I'm trying to figure out what videos I'm gonna make here and that's I know I have clicking on objects adding and removing objects deleting objects checking I have all about here so actually maybe I should do all those that's what I did with you could do all those things once I already have an array so maybe that makes sense so is there actually doesn't make sense for anything else to come after these three because the next thing I want to do is a raise of objects okay I think it's still off topic and the chat is about Internet Explorer okay all right so I think what I'm gonna do who who wants to humor me and this is the video I'm replacing so I need to watch this for a sec okay so now I've made two videos one just about what is an array in the syntax of an array and the other video looking at how to use a loop to iterate over every element in that array and in this video I want to unlock this great power to you which is how to take an object and duplicate that object many times into an array so first this is viscera again that's all I need to know okay so that's what I do oh geez that I'm kind of redoing old content but I got to get to this sometime because look at this look at this horrible thing that I've done can you believe this nonsense that I'm making this like literal object and I'm like copy oh nobody should ever watch this video and try to learn programming from it Oh horrible okay so but I did get it just to revisit this is what I'm talking about how would you make so what I need to do now is close this close this close this and I need to please hold okay I am now ready oh is the music very loud sorry sorry sorry sorry I can't like get it right cuz all right sorry about that I just Boston saying advice as well take 10 minutes to install I term actor there's I term I'm gonna do I turn right before I do Chrome extensions no I'm gonna do it it's just it's so hard to like oh no bad me okay um ready here we go hello it's me again your friendly neighborhood coding person who made some bubbles so if you were watching some previous videos a while back I made these bubble objects and there they are they're moving around the street and then there were some videos where I look kind of different which were about arrays just like a raise of numbers and raise of strings and like it's a list of things and things have indices so why am I here now I'm here in this video because I have this goal I have this goal in life which is to say I have defined what it means to be a bubble I made a bubble class I made a bubble object and I made two bubble objects bubble one and bubble two and I would like to be able to make five bubble objects and I would like to not have to do this because I would also like to make five hundred or a thousand or ten thousand I want to be able to make as many duplicate as many objects as I want create as many objects as I want from that template from that class without having to have all these separate variables and wouldn't you just isn't it just so convenient that I'm right here having just talked about objects and arrays if I just put those two things together we'll be in good shape so let's do that I don't think I need to yeah okay so let's just do that oh no don't go over there okay so so I'm gonna change this from one variable to Beryl's to a single variable called bubbles now remember when I want a variable to hold an array a list of information instead of making it equal to something like an object or a number I set it equal to open closed brackets there's other ways you can create an array also but this is a pretty conventional way now what I might do is I might say okay I have this array in theory I have this array that I could fill why don't I put a bubble in index zero and a bubble in index one so I'm going to put my bubble here and put my bubble here make two bubble objects instead of having separate variables bubble one bubble I am going to have a variable bubbles index 0 because remember the first spot in the array is 0 not 1 so it was kind of bad that when I was doing this idea in the bubble 1 and bubble I should really name the double 0 and bubble 1 so the first thing I could do is just change this program to say like hey bubbles zero bubbles 1 bubbles 0 this is bubbles 0 you get the idea right one oh this is all why am I even bothering with this bubbles one oh no look at this this is bubbles zero and one and this is bubbles zero in one ah oh my goodness oh my gosh no wait a second stop the presses I'm so confused I think what I would prefer to do is move 0 and 1 and then chosen one so of course I could do this in any order but I want to move the first one and and by the way this is not going to be the solution because even though this now works and I have the same exact result the only thing that I've done differently is that instead of having two separate variables I have one array but I'm still referencing the two separate bubble objects individually so if I want to have ten of them I still have to keep adding more and more lines of code so what I want to do is I want to use that for loop if I say for let I equals zero I is less than some number I plus plus then inside here I can refer to that array called bubbles instead of saying hardcoding in zero hardcoding in one if I just say bubbles index I this is going to repeat many times with a different value for I I is zero then it's 1 then it's two then it's three so this is a way of me iterating accessing every single element of that array so I can use that too and by the way I know I know there's like a for each sort of thing and maybe I'll make a video about that but I'm gonna just use a nice for loop with a counter variable so I'm gonna today for let I equals 0 eyes less than 2 I plus plus and now instead of referencing the bubbles individually I'm going to just say bubbles index high which means I can now do this bubbles index I that same loop later and draw this is to use a loop to create the bubble objects and set up I can say bubbles index I'd move bubbles index I dot I don't even remember anymore a show is that what it was show we can look in the bubble class if I forgotten where's the bubbles class oh here it is move and show oh boy what happened here wait hold on hold on that shouldn't be there that was like me too guessing something sold on move and show what was that we would show what was what this show is the show mightier please edit this somehow move show was it show we could scroll down and look at the bubble claw MC move and show okay so those were the names of the functions that I used in that bubble class so now let's run this again oops and here we go so look at that ah now I still have two bubbles but one was big one was small before and then one was they were both there were different spots I lost that so one of the things that I had in my previous example if I just go back to here is I had specified exact locations for each bubble object and exact sizes and now that I have a loop I'm in a much happier place in that I can easily make 20 of these but it's what do I do about initializing all that stuff so this thing is here hello welcome to programming the reason why I'm coding here is not because I want to specifically set some exact locations for bubbles more likely I want to come up with some kind of algorithm like I want all the bubbles to appear in a perfect grid or I want them all to appear randomly or I want them to be in a grid that's slightly offset randomly or I want them to appear in a spiral pattern I want them all to start in the same place so what is that algorithm so let me just say so one thing I could do is I could use the fact that I have this counter I and I could say let X equal like well what if I start the bubbles starting on at like pixel ten and then add space them out by like 30 pixels you know so this kind of came to me and immediately because I've done this so many times but this is now a formula that when I is 0 X will equal 10 when I is 1 X will equal 10 plus 30 times 140 and if I ever got to to which one in this case it would be 10 plus 1670 right so this idea of spacing the bubbles out so I could made 3 of them and by the way and then of course instead of hardcoding this value here I could say X I could use this variable to pass in which is calculated everything and then by the way this is really so one thing that's bad about this is now if I if I'm creating three bubbles all of a sudden right then I left this number two here so what I want to do is say bubbles dot length so this way however now I can't use bubbles dot length here because the array when I first started was empty so I'm adding things to the array a certain number of them then I can retrieve that length later and again there are different ways you can approach how many spots there are and how you store the length but this is just a way that i'ma do it for this example so now let's look at this you can see look at them they started now let's not move them just so we can see you can see there they are spaced out and I could easily just say well actually I want to space them out by a hundred pixels and I want them just to be 20 pixels in and you can see there we go and I want them to actually start at least 20 pixels in and you can see there they are and then I want to have ten of them there we go but I can't really have ten of them you get the idea and now I could put back in move and there they go so this is a way and I but what hello do you do something kind of exciting about this video which is that I haven't once changed any of the code down here this idea of a single bubble has remained exactly the same the thing that's different now is that I can create them and put them in an array and however many there are I could just move it show over so I'm gonna show you a few more things here now here's another thing I could do let's actually just make them let's let's just sort of prove this point let's give them all random spots and again I could set them randomly in the constructor but I'm just going to do it here so I'm gonna give them all a random I'm going to just create a whole bunch of bubbles with random locations and we can see in random sizes and you can see there they are but this is what I'm talking about now I have this one program here it makes ten bubbles I want this program to now make 100 how how many keys on the keyboard do I need to hit in order to make this change one if I programmed everything correctly all I need to do is at a zero here and suddenly I have a hundred of them and if I add another zero suddenly I have a thousand of them now my program is slowing down because it has to render and draw a lot of stuff hold on did I mess something up oh no people you guys are just distract me in the chat like I have a mistake in my code but it's just the autofill that Adam is doing that for you're talking about yeah why is it doing that okay sorry now my program might be slowing down because it's drawing a lot of bubbles and it's a lot to draw and you know I could sort of start thinking about what I really want to do here maybe actually what I want is for these bubbles not to have a stroke but I want them to have a fill with quite a bit of alpha and I could take this out of here and now I've got this sort of like cloudy thing going on so again I can use this idea what I'm really doing here is I'm kind of on the way to building something called a particle system I'm building a system of many individual elements that together make some sort of effect like a smoky cloudy thing but I could just with a with one variable now with one value change how many things are in there now here's the thing what if I'm gonna do one more thing in this video and I'm gonna I'm gonna actually put the bubble back to have that so let's just go back to where I was with just start with ten bubbles ten bubbles now what if what if I take this out of setup entirely it's gone what's gonna happen what's my program going to do nothing emptiest no but no emptiness no bubbles what if what I want to do is add bubbles when I click the mouse okay let's think about this the first thing that I might want to do is figure out where I can wear code executes when I click the mouse so that is that I want to add function mousepressed now whoops sorry now what do I want to do I want to make a bubble let be equal new bubble and I want that bubble to be where the mouse is and maybe it has a random size between 10 and 50 pixels so I've Nate I've and I don't love these 1 character variables I should do better than that but I've picked a random number and I've made a new bubble what if I want to put that bubble in the array well I could say something like bubbles index 0 equals B right I could say I the first spot in the array put that bubble when I click the mouse look I only have one though because what I'm doing here is every single time I'm making a new bubble and putting it in the first spot but if this were a counter and it went up every single time I could put the first bubble in the first spot the next bubble in the second spot the next bubble in the third spot but I could do even better than that there's actually a function there's a lot of functions associated with arrays arrays are actually objects too that allow you to do certain things I'm gonna get to them I can delete stuff I can move stuff around I can shuffle I can sort but what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use this function called push push is a function that means add something to the array push it to the array and actually by default it's going to push it to the end of the array so now that I have that every time I click I add a new bubble and what's interesting about this is there's no there's a there's no limit to the number of bubbles I can have other than the computer speed and memory and interestingly enough I might just as a little effect change this to Mouse dragged and you can see now and I drag the mouse I'm kind of drawing this this kind of array of bubble objects okay so this is all about making an array of objects so if you're following along maybe you had an object you made some variation of the bubble you made a bouncing ball you made some kind of flying pig I don't know what it is you made a rainbow heart take that don't don't make any changes in your class at all try to write a program where you duplicate it in an array and you can just change one number and you can have 500 versus a thousand versus 10 see if you can add them with clicking the mouse or hitting the keyboard or some type of maybe what happened what if you try to like add every 10 seconds how would you do that what kind of event can trigger the adding of an object and then what I want to do in a future video which maybe will be the next one is how could I delete these when I click on them or how do I even know how do I communicate for all just a couple things how do I know if these bubbles are intersecting with each other so I want objects to talk to other objects and I also want to be able to talk to the objects bubbles you bubble hello bubble that's me talking to the objects I guess but I don't miss a alexa that's not a bubbles name's not alexa anyway what was I talking about oh so I want to be able to figure out how do I interact with the bubbles 10 each bubble have its own mouth pressed kind of like event how does that work so I got to get to that sort of stuff and that'll come in a future video thanks for watching ok so here's the reason why I don't like using for each it's confusing it's confusing to beginners it's it uses a callback which is not even a concept in these videos that I've covered yet so if you're in this sequence oh I should do a video about for each and when you learn to use it but also the asynchronous aspect of the callback I think can be problematic and there's so many times we're having the counter is also just the index is incredibly useful so that's one of my reasons why I don't like using a for each alright so that was pretty good where was it 6 o'clock I think I'm gonna have to go this like desire to like but I'm not gonna say it I'll be it'll be if alright so we're so how did I how did I do there what did I get done I lost my playlist and if I go to my playlist here I told my dad yeah so weird whatever am I so I basically did this 7.3 this goes away so this year did gone there's no reason for this video to exist anymore in this playlist and then these can stay adding and removing objects and clicking on objects deleting objects using splice what's the difference between oh I made those two separate videos I think I've done this one oh I haven't done the I don't think do I do i I have to investigate this whether this actually I remove objects in this one but whatever's I'm in a slightly different sequence now because I did both push in this so what I need these can stay right now this should go away these can stay and the next things I need to do are clicking on an object and there's all of these deleting objects that sort of thing all right oh hi Sean Vann every Oh Sean man every so I forgot I opened I opened this live coding train episode with a sketch that Sean ban ever he made and this had crashed so let's try that again history oh how come it's not in this history show full history because it's I restarted the computer where wherever here we go here we go there we go all right Sean this is for you okay this is what the sponsored for not actually any money but this is this sponsored portion of my live video yes I that here's the thing I have no fear about showing my browser history because I'm logged in to a separate account that I only use for live streaming although I don't know who knows what I was doing earlier today in that account while I was setting up no that was not Sean Vann every at the door somebody else was at the door and I don't think anyone's guessed it yet okay so hello I'm here to tell you about something called interactive media arts which is a new BFA program at Tisch School of the Arts New York University right here in New York my name is Dan Shipman I am from the coding terrain YouTube channel but I also teach at a program called ITP which is a twoyear graduate twoyear graduate program master's program which still is here and it's still deep there and it's been around since 1979 so ver do the math I can't do that math but you can do it a long time and so next year we are starting a new undergraduate program and we're looking for students to apply if you are a high school senior junior I guess we can apply it whatever whatever you if you are the appropriate age to apply to college and are interested come and study here with us you can learn more at ITP NYU edu slash ima and you can there's all sorts of more information there and get your app there's stuff about how to apply and you can watch them Cody train videos to get a sense of what happens at ITP at ima and what will happen in ima it's gonna be great so please join us and tweet me at Schiffman if you if you need any if you have questions about or you're thinking about applying and we're seeing who will come here and and make the world a better place with code and other stuff to thank you how'd I do Sean Sean in the chat by the way is the director of undergraduate studies for the new I am a that's starting next year we have no idea if anyone will apply so I'm trying to do a little outreach we'd love for anybody from anywhere with any background who's interested in being creative maybe you are a maker or artist or you're a thinker engineer but this is really this is the button you should be because you should be defining yourself that sort of thing Gerald hunt says no one will acknowledge this comment but is there an upper age limit well I don't know that's a good question maybe Shawn in that chat can answer that question okay yeah me too Joseph okay you know by the way it's very bad practice when you're doing like a live stream to answer quote things that are in the chat without actually saying out repeating what they are but I just did it anyway and yeah you know so Austin writes and other people have writing the same things oh I wish I could go you know I can't afford it and this is a that is a really important and valid response and I hope that stuff that I'm doing here in this YouTube channel and other another innovative ways that people are thinking about to reduce the cost of Education I would love to be a part of that discussion and you know it is true that New York University being here this is a very expensive place and anything I could do to help make education accessible and more affordable for people I would love to do alright so I can't talk about the thing that I can't talk about because I was talking about it and then the whole thing crashed so right if you have a bachelor's degree already you should apply to ITP by the way if you're interested in hold on I did make some some videos that you might like if spring show ITP Schiffman coding train let's try this so that's the archive so this is a video that I made oh my god that's that music in it like I'm Dan this is a special coding training episode this what playing behind me spring show that's weird that's really weird so I won't play all this but you this is a video compilation that I made I don't know if you can hear me over this video show about a hundred I should do those like commentary like things where I like watch somebody else's video and I just like comment on it this video is terrible who's this idiot so this here like there's a bunch of projects that I show on different students and this is a graduate program and so and this is Michelle is amazing and so oh so you get you guys can you guys can watch this video it's online separate I'll link to it that you can learn a bit more about the kind of projects that people make it ITP by watching that video look there's also look at all these videos you could watch that are being recommended oh look at this what is ITP all right here we go dude I don't know this is so fancy what's he gonna stand for Oh program program program the video is too quiet still have no idea what they did here it's like humans plus technology or plus humans plus technology plus humans plus technology probably a lot of people still have that notion I have no idea what they do in there but it's something very quite a while ago I have a figure it's a problem it was a problem in that was a know something you know what he does oh so would you believe like things around the floor that I triple repeat oh it's that potage beans well I'm going to med school you know it's just it's hard to describe rob has 2006 gainfully tried to turn condensed to give us a I guess a mission statement all right at least a working description of the place which he thought I'm really enjoying them this has got to be at least ten years old we should insert that now we're trying to teach students that how to describe the program when they can describe the program to their parents they graduate ITP has definitely changed his personality over the years you guys recognize that voice dude Redbirds who I've talked about and I have Reds developing no this is a great video actually this is the origin actually I was fortunate with a colleague to get some money from the market foundation to start said about the college and the media center in 1971 and so when I was doing that that I realized there was no graduate department anywhere that provided this kind of opportunity for people to play with its tools and so in 1979 IP was started with 20 students it became apparent that the whole structure of communicating was radical there was again the spirit of pioneering and trying and you know they ran with it when I to be started in the nineteen the late 70s there were no computers and they were using closed caption video to do a lot of conferencing and stuff like that Twitty interesting stuff right video okay watching this I can watch this on my own time yeah okay and it became alright that's pretty interesting okay now where was I so I think I'm kind of wrapping up here I don't know if anybody has any I think I'm kind of done for today it is 610 to the Yankees game start what's the score the Yankees game and but but maybe I can answer a few questions or I don't think that I think I guess I could do one more of these they're short and I could get another one out of the way I could do the clicking maybe I should do the clicking so so Lubin's asked it so everyone's asking about the machine learning stuff again how to solve this problem but I'm gonna get to it I'm just I'm trying to doing some other stuff now I mean III talked about this earlier in the livestream so I'll come back to that yes sorry I'm not questions Annie's entertainment says where do I send you money send all of your checks to actually you should really donate to maybe a good cause like I saw that linmanuel Miranda did is doing a fundraiser for Puerto Rico hurricane relief so that's where I would put my words right now today if I were you okay all right let me do one more because let's see what if I what have I actually gotten that will get published in the next week out today I did this tear I did this video where I tried to make a presentation about chatbots that I think maybe isn't any good I kind of did an introduction to rise script it was okay but not so great then I did a chatbot coding challenge which I thought turned out pretty well and then I I did this one so I've done four four things that it can get edited out of this and possibly a three or four depending on how many I choose to publish separately so so oh and I should really stop so Simon and I would like to do some kind of like marathon livestream at some point you know health was a concern of course I don't know that I could do something for 24 hours which Austin suggests plus the ima promo yeah yeah that's very sharp I just did it during the livestream I hope that was okay but and yes I do have a patreon that is correct so let's see let's no no clicking I should just go maybe I'll just go I'm gonna do the clicking I wish I had an idea for like you know how did the room well let's stop timeout I'm taking suggestions right now for anything similar to hi so I'm a harmonic motion again and I could really really make it super simple and just have something oscillating and I could make it color or size so what I'm looking for I'll take other suggestions but what I'm looking for I've been enjoying doing these so far these the 10 print and recursion this is nine minutes and this was twelve minutes they barely anything in the content of the video but the amount of creative things that people have created out of it has been really exciting to see so what's clicking the clicking the clicking was yeah so physics engine is no good that's too complicated Austin's telling me to set up I term make the ITP scrolling effect from the last video I don't know what that is harmonic motion is one recursion I already did game engine to complicated Hanoi towers to complicated anything the matter that's too complicated so so far I've got simple harmonic motion that's the only one that I've did I think and I term but point point box baking a pizza WebSockets to complicated if you click on the p5 homepage it makes a purple dot similar to the circle recursion do recursion and body simulation to calm the pacman to complicated sine wave that I could do it could be a sine wave yeah let's do the sine wave Armand let's do the full I sis now that I have these array two toriel's kind of done let's do that okay here we go everybody Chrome extensions good one okay we're gonna do one more coding challenge then I'm gonna go home for the weekend cuz I can't bear to do another objectoriented programming video particle system I could do aa simple particle system look at that alright everybody last coding challenge we're gonna do a nice little poll simple particle system and when I say simple particle system I really mean Oh smoke like smoke effect okay and or us sine wave / simple harmonic motion and I should really just do both of these I'm just gonna do one okay here we go rb8 1d kak and now while I'm waiting for you to enter the straw poll 6240 to 3244 16,700 oh that sound is so loud see this is the problem I don't have the laptop sorry everybody sorry 25 ok I've lost my energy okay that was your one minute to vote so I should really give you a little more time though because you guys are a little bit behind me so if I had three of these I could juggle them I bet nevermind ok poll is dead let's see here we go okay this is pretty clear oh I'm surprised nobody's watching is anybody watching these two loud again that's too loud I don't hold on I don't know what's going I should love to listen to I don't know I'm sorry the sound is all out of whack alright this even though only three my popularity is waning but it's pretty clear it's not too hot okay they're messing with you oh thank you it's fine I control you all so I could just do this for the next hour and never do the Cody challenge alright this is the last thing I'm going to do and okay so let's do this okay okay all right let's see here now and I'll get rid of this okay we're ready everybody I don't know how long I've been streaming for it's got to be like two and a half hours now I would guess so this is gonna be it for today I'm just gonna do I don't know why I'm doing one more thing it's really no reason for me to but I am I feel like guilty like I don't I'm not doing enough okay here we go oh wait this views hello welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna try to vary in a very simple way in a quick way program a simple particle system that resembles something like smoke so I'm gonna do this probably in a way that has very little visual interesting quality to it whatsoever it's my hope much like with my recent temperent and recursion coding challenges that I see a wide variety of clever beautiful remixes of this simple idea and what kind of beautiful particle system ideas can you make out of what I make so let me just start by making it so what I'm going to do the idea of the particle system by the way is creating something out of many particle things that's like the worst ever definition of a particle system but incidentally the term particle system was coined for originally for the movie the Wrath of Khan the effect the Genesis effect there's a effect where like this thing gets shot at a planet that doesn't have anything on it and kind of planet kind of catches fire and then all of a sudden it's all green and life is there and so anyway I think it's William T Reeves there's a paper I'll link to all that the history of particle systems in this video's description but but the idea is I want to make and I'm gonna do this as a class so I just recently started using es6 and I made a bunch of tutorials about classes and objects and I'm going to use that technique in this video so I'm gonna make a class anytime I make a class I need to make a constructor and this particle now I could use if you look at my nature of code videos I use this thing called a P vector that's in processing in p5 there's something called a p5 fector but stay simple here and I'm just going to make this X just an X a separate X which will be 300 and this dot Y which will be 3 380 so the reason why I'm doing this is I want my particles to in this idea you know I could do anything but I want them all to start at the bottom and kind of come up word and fade out which will hopefully give me a somewhat smoke or fire like effect it probably will not look like that at all but that you're gonna then you're gonna modify it make something much better okay so I want a function called show for each object and in it show I'm just gonna you know like loading images and using textures to draw the particles would be a nice technique to create more interesting visual effects but I'm just gonna draw them as circles this dot X this dot Y and I'm gonna give this I'm gonna have it be a diameter of 16 and I don't if the width and height are equal I can just use one I'm gonna say fill and I'm gonna give it some alpha and I'm gonna I'm gonna say stroke 255 just so I can see it really well now and so the Alpha will be like 10 so now let's just try making a single particle I'll just call it P P equals new particle and P dot show so let's run this there we go there's that particle now I does it a little bit so there's this is it I have one particle there it is at the bottom good so now what I want to do it's obvious I'm going to need many of them so I'm going to change this to be an array and what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to say in draw let P is equal a new particle and then I'm gonna say particles dot push P so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use the push function which adds an object to the array and let me put this in setup now just for the sake of argument so I'm going to put one particle in the array so that now if I write a for loop that's in you know q2 complaining about not a for each loop where I iterate over the array using a counter variable like eye and say particles index where how do I get up there particles index I now I kind of have the same program this should be the same I should see just that one particle I created it and setup I added to the array and I'm showing it same exact program but now let's make that particle move so let's write a function called update let's give this particle variables like VX and V Y and I'm gonna give it an initial random like I'm gonna give it's random VX for velocity so I need a speed or way that it changes along the xaxis and a yaxis so using p5 vector could be helpful here and if anyone wants to do a port of this with p5 vector you're welcome to and then I'm gonna give it a random velocity going upward so what would that be upward is negative so something like between like negative 5 and negative 1 so an update I'm now going to say this dot X plus equals this dot V X this dot y plus equals this dot dy so the idea here is that I'm going to change the location by some random amount and so I can now for all those particles I can say update you can think there it goes it goes up so I actually now I'm realizing a couple things here but what I want to do right is instead of just having one particle I mean when do I want to add particles do I want to start with a burst of them so I add 100 and set up so I want to have them once every 5 seconds so I add some sort of timer there's so many different ways but let's try for the sake of argument just adding one new particle every time through draw so I'm getting somewhere this is kind of you know perhaps somewhat like the idea smoke doesn't really look like smoke but I've got a particle system here so things that I would want to do yeah and then way I could stop here and I could say hey you make this more creative and interesting but I'm missing some key features that I really need to have here so first of all one thing that I want to try doing is I want to give these particles a transparency so let's actually give them a variable called alpha and we'll start it at 255 and I'm going to use this variable here in its fill this alpha and an update I'm gonna say this dot alpha equal one or or something so each one will fade out I don't know equal five let's have them fade out pretty fast so it's gonna lose some alpha with each frame so you can see there this is gonna hopefully help me have something a bit more like smoke and the stroke is is there so I'm still seeing them all so what I want to do is let's actually take out the outline color we can see okay how did I do oh let's roast a marshmallow by the white circular fire delicious okay so actually in a way I'm kind of done but there's there's some more things I should really think about here number one is hmm after I run this for a while it's gonna start really being really really slow for example particles I could look in the console here particles dot length there's eight hundred thirty particles right now but I don't need eight hundred thirty particles right and if I look at it now there's a thousand fifty particles I'm adding new particles every frame but I'm never getting rid of them so I want to make sure that I remove particles so there's a different ways I could do this I think one way that I'm going to try to do this is I'm going to remove the particles when their alpha becomes less than zero so one way to do that is with the splice function and so if I come back to this main loop I could say if so one thing I might add I'm gonna say if particles index I is to delete iterative function that's kind of a weird name I want this function to delete tell me true or false whether I should delete it it's like a question delete delete finish maybe I'll just call it like finished then I want to remove this particle so let's write that function first so I'm gonna call this function finished and basically I'm just gonna return this dot alpha less than zero so it's a little bit weird I'm just writing return the results of this alpha less than zero so this not alpha is less than when it's less than zero this will evaluate to true or it will evaluate to false so this function is either going to return true or false and it's true when alpha when it's faded out I don't want to display it anymore so let's actually put that stroke back just so we can see it and then let me how do I remove a particle why could actually say particles dot splice I comma one so I happen to know this already but the splice function is a function that removes an element from the array at position I and just that one element so I could put it two there and remove that one and the one after it that's not what I want to do so now look at this you can see them getting removed now something weird is happening you see this like weird like flickery like thing so there's a little bit of an issue I've I've covered this in so many different videos I'm not sure if I should cover it here and just point to it but I'm gonna I think I will cover it here really briefly so I just realized you need to erase this so there's other ways around this and in many ways if I took out the stroke I wouldn't have this problem visually but what's happening here is if I have an array that has a bunch of spots in it and I call these like people a particle a particle B particle C particle D particle E and these are in spots 0 1 2 3 4 well what happens is if I'm iterating over this if I'm saying check spot zero should I delete it nope check spot 1 should I delete it nope check spot two should I delete it let's say yes I should delete it so I delete this one and now I have the array looks like this it has instead of having 1 2 3 4 5 it has 1 2 3 4 things in it PA PB P D and PE 0 1 2 3 so the next one I should check is number 3 right which is the last one notice what happened I was here so these shifted over and then I went to the next one which actually I ended up skipping PD so so this could be a problem and a way that I could deal this is just go backwards because I'm going backwards I check this when I check this one then I check this one if I remove it these shift over it doesn't matter I'm not affecting the beginning of the array and in some ways this is less of an of an important issue right here but it is this is the thing you need to be thinking about if you're using a counter and iterating over the right like if ideally we're on adding stuff to the array that's also really good be a problem never get to the end and I'll be stuck in an infinite loop so here's a way around that I'm gonna start at the end of the array particles length minus 1 then I'm going to say greater than I'm gonna go down to 0 and say I minus minus just gonna go in the array backwards and now you can see was the stuff fades out it disappears there's no more weird flickering there's a little weird that they just disappear suddenly but this is mostly just because of the fact that they have this stroke on them now I'm only removing them when I can't see them so now if I look at particles dot length is only 51 particles and I run this for another a few seconds while I'm talking and there's still only 51 and there's still only 51 so the timing is working out such that there's only ever going to be 51 so how could I make this look more like smoke well one thing that might be important to play with is how many particles do I want to add each frame so this is now five particles per frame whoops and oh sorry this needs to be inside the loop so you can see here you know does this look more like smoke left like smoke but so that's one parameter here that's important to work on but here is really what I think is important number one is oh I didn't even add any acceleration so like adding some type of acceleration so I'm not going to do this in this video but this is what you want to think about what's a different way that you could pick initial velocities should those velocities change over time what are you actually are using color what shape are you drawing do the size of those circles vary are you can you make it feel like something that's not smoke or fire but more like a confetti bursts or something fireworks I have another coding challenge where I do fireworks which is pretty similar to so there's a lot of possible things you could do and so I'm gonna end this here with this code and I look forward to a thousand particle flower systems blooming please share them with me hashtag on Twitter particle train particle trade particle train particle train no what's that song particle it's particle man's that they might be done the particle train is good so hashtag particle train on Twitter I would love to see love gifts and animations of all your particle systems that you make share your code and I look forward to seeing you in my next coding challenge alright everybody I think this is the end so I don't know how did I do I did an extra thing it is now 635 and it's time for me to go I will happily answer a few last questions I'm looking at my phone I'm getting updates about the Yankees game I need to show the eye what equals one in the forloop oh oh yeah I could also so this is a good point another strategy thank you for this another strategy I could do is just like as I'm going through the loop and things shift over I could just set I back and like no and say I minus one so I could have done that that's a very good thing did the sound oh you guys are okay alright everybody thank you to everyone I appreciate all of your comments even when you're asking when I'm gonna do the Agha Rio part 3 or a machinelearning school the Chrome extensions is the one I really could get to and I term those are all those things I'm coming they're coming there's only I if I could do this every day think about how many things they could get through except I have to there are certain things as you know as with the chat BOTS that I have to kind of research and practice a little bit I think it makes the tutorials a little bit better to be honest and certain things I could kind of do offthecuff like like this particular one so goodbye song people like this alright alright so this is going to go for two and a half minutes and I'm gonna just sort of read the chat and see if I can answer any questions plans for the next livestream so next Friday I'm hoping to continue the chat bots stuff to do the p5 speech thing and maybe an Alexa skill as well as more object and Ray videos get those done Yeah right it could pop removes the object from the array but can we push at the end yes Lorenz and is asking which is the firework one if somebody could help out and post a link to the fireworks coding challenge in the chat that would be great it's the couldn't challenge number something to just go to the coding challenge playlist there's 70 some of them now you'll find it yeah before I do the Alexis skill I want to have the Alexa in here working and it doesn't work on the NYU wireless unless I authenticate it in some way so when are these videos going to be released so what happens is you have more gaming challenges I know people are interested in that working on these videos so what happens is after today Matt at math blank on Twitter helps edit them and release them as separate videos this live stream will stay archived forever you know it's available immediately after this end it goes to unlisted so you might have to be clever to find the link or ask me for it but it'll be probably made public tomorrow or the next day and the videos will come out I can't try to release one new video per day I don't know in theory like spreading them out is better than replacing them all at once API is definitely something I would love to look at papa bane I would love to keep track look at your particle system yes can you allow links to your own videos I have to add dot because of the spam filter oh yeah I don't know if someone tells me how to do that I'm happy to do that right now it has to be someone who has moderator privileges great so Topher I mean I cover it not you know there's a lot to making Alexis kill button if we need to go over the basics is p5 shader support on the way there was a lot of work I really need to do a video exploring WebGL again somebody helped me remember that but there's been a lot of work over the summer that I mentioned by Stahl Jia and Kate and apologize for missing their full names or the Twitter handles but did google Summer of Code about WebGL mp5 and I think probably someone needs to volunteer to really help work on that shader support there is some of the progress worked I don't know where this Alexa skill Alexa is the Amazon echo product where you can create a your own chat bot you can release on Alexa for people to interact with okay thank you anybody uh one last question I wonder if your pupil students watch your streams I really hope not I mean I have fun doing this and I'm glad that people appreciate it but sometimes I worry about it okay anyway so thank you everybody I will see you next Friday for another coding train episode and enjoy your weekend and your week and take some time away from your code do something nice for somebody and all that stuff okay thank you dolly for posting Kate Holland back as her last name installed gia also has a last name two students who did google Summer of Code you can check out in processing org medium ok pacman pacman probably needs multiple parts it's a longer project I'm gonna have to dedicate a whole session for that probably alright goodbye everybody it's a different time rembu sighs it's a different time every week you check Friday morning Easter time I usually set the time it's usually midafternoon but I like doing in the morning if I can alright good bye everybody have a good rest of your time okay stop straight
