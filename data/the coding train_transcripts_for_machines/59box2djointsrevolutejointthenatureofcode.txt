now that we've looked at a distance joint let's look at another example of a joint a revolute joint okay I'm excited about this are you excited I'm excited okay here we go so a distance joint now here's the thing a distance joint remember we had two bodies let's say we had a square and a triangle we combined those with the distance joint which connects each body together with a given length one of the things about a revolute joint that is incredibly different is that a revolute joint binds those two bodies at a singular anchor point what is that anchor point that anchor point is the point around which those bodies revolve so you can think of it essentially as you know if we have this if we if we have this fixed plate and we attach this triangle to it and we put a little screw in it's kind of loose we could spin that triangle around that plate that makes any sense and you can see in the example what we're gonna use this for is to create something that it resembles like a windmill so something spinning around spinning around a singular point okay so how do we do that well we do the same exact thing we did with the distance joint we have two bodies ready to go we define a joint definition a revolute joint definition and then we set all the parameters what are the parameters for a revolute joint now there are a bunch but one of the things that's really key is when we initialize it is what in addition to setting the two bodies we've got to set where that anchor point is so we've got a we've got to make sure we set where the anchor point is and so that's one of the parameters the anchor point other parameters we're gonna set R is the motor on now motors you ask yourself what there's a motor so this is one of the cool things about box2d is it has these concepts built into it that you can suddenly kind of like there's like electricity in the world and systems are gas burning something whatever but we can actually turn this motor on so then this autonomously will spin and will spin with a certain force with a given torque which is you know if you wanted to have itself a driving car or some type of spinning windmill this is where you can use revolute joints and motors which is pretty great to see so we can turn the motor on there is a motor speed parameter there is a motor torque parameter and the other thing we can do is we can limit the angle so this is the thing there's so many possible ways you could kind of configure and set a revolute joint the key thing for us to really be comfortable with is the beginning we have two bodies we make the joint definition we set the anchor point and we let it go now we could also constrain the angle we could turn a motor on and off and we'll look at that stuff when we look at the actual code and once we've set all that we can create the joint okay so let's see if I forgot anything crucial let's go over here and take a look at it so here's the example running and we can see we have one fixed body and one body that's not fixed both of those are attached with a revolute joint now the motor is not on so as the particles just hit the thing you kind of just seesaws back and forth based on the force of where these are the particles are randomly hitting it but if I click the mouse the motor is going to be on and you can see it's like forcing itself to spin now in a clockwise direction and we can affect them the motor speed so what's going on here in this example one thing I should point out is we have a particle class and let me move this off to the side here we have a particle class which is all those circles right so though that's the object that controls the box of these circular body that's falling from the sky we have this box class which describes a box a sink which is used for both of these bodies that are connected with that revolute joint so then we're doing the same thing we did in the distance joint example where we have a class this class has a reference to two box objects and a joint so we're using a class to kind of describe a multitude of box2d bodies we could say every time we want a windmill we need this box and this box and a joint that connects them so if we look here we've got these steps again define the joint revolute joint has a nice function called initialize where we say hey here's the joint this body and the it's going to connect box one body box to body and then here's the anchor point the anchor point is that box one center so that's really key to see in the initialized function the third argument is the anchor point which is the point that where the two are connected to each other then we can see here are some properties we can give it a motor speed a motor torque is the motor on its off at first so you can see and you can look up in the manual there are great that a longer list of properties and when I have this system that I imagined that it'll be this magical thing we're below you will see the list of properties just appear that I'm talking about but anyway that's so that's gonna happen in the future when these videos are better anyway so one thing that you can see that's a little bit different about this than the distance joint example is we are keeping a reference to that joint object why because we want to be able to turn the motor on and off we might want to affect its speed its torque all that kind of stuff later and we can see that's what we're doing in the main program when we click the mouse we say hey toggle the motor and in that function we we can call we can set the motors a status to false or true which means it's off or on okay so hopefully this gives you kind of an overview again there's a lot of details here that I'm just kind of kind of glossing over and we'll see what's missed and what's confusing but the point is here it's the same thing we need two bodies we need to create a joint object between those two bodies and set a few parameters and then letter up and see how it goes so I would say as an exercise I can't think of one that one prepared but you could for example try to create the wheels of a vehicle with a motor joint see if you can get it to drive itself there's actually something called a wheel joint in box2d but try using a revolute joint first see how that works and yeah I remembered I forgot something in the previous video but maybe I'll go add that back in real quick okay so yeah thank you
