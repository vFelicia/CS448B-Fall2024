yes my event is starting oh wait maybe I shouldn't be showing this yet that's fine it could be back here right hello I think I've started screaming welcome to the code big train live on a Friday so this is a special Friday coding train episode I have a very special guest and this is my special guests project that this about approximately one hour livestream will be about you should know audio is low this is good so I have a to mic sit set up going and so when we debug that a little bit here before I get started I'm opening up the slack channel which is for patrons so make it louder so hold on special guests I don't know why I'm making this like some sort of like surprise reveal but special guests just say like a couple sentences and let's test your audio hello testing testing key do a cut to me well in testing audio I can actually hello what's a special hello testing deep thinning thinning there all right so is it just my mic that's low I can hear him but I can't see him know that you know is it is my mic lower than my special guests bike because you don't know who it is it's gonna take a minute the one H one issue with live streaming is the chat is about 20 seconds behind us in real time so that question they won't actually hear it for about 20 seconds I love it I'll make is fine high minus low Mike is low only is my mic low is my my ten years was fine and I can actually turn so first of all I'm kind of ok with my mic being low first of all is it actually registering my mic if I'm happing on here you hearing like a tapping both mics are fine I'm gonna mine I'm tapping mine now cuz it could be on low just cuz they're only hearing it through your mic no no it's mine turn mine up a little bit okay I hear tapping on both I can hear you both fine okay hello welcome I have a very special guest here in the coding trade studio I'm gonna cut to special guest welcome to gibreel if you're not familiar with Brielle's youtube channel i probably just google j ABR ILS on YouTube it's also I learned how to say it now f stuff stuff stuff you're wrong no joking yes that's the FD stuff on YouTube gibreel has been teaching himself machine learning for the last around nine months and has discovered they made all sorts of exciting and interesting projects has made a bunch of videos about those projects happen to be in New York this week is actually doing a shortterm residency at ITP which is a program where I teach and as taught a workshop here this week and gave a presentation out his work so it's Friday afternoon coding trade time and so I thought it would bring him here to talk about a new project that he's making so before I get to that let me just do some housekeeping today it's going to be a shorter livestream than usual there won't be any coding challenges or tutorials from me I hope to make that up with a bonus livestream next week or the week after but happy whatever holidays that are happening today and this weekend you might be celebrating I have to catch a train in a couple hours so what look it's funny I have to catch an actual reallife train in a couple hours the head out of town so this is just going to be a guest live a guest session I will say though that if you don't subscribe I don't know why I'm like pretending I don't have a computer here YouTube let's search for stuff stuff so this is hey you have but you have to YouTube I have a million a billion to me I kind of knew that but I forgot about that is are you are you do you work on all of them no so this is the one you're activists to bros okay so this is Jibril's youtube channel and you can see just memorize this channel ID I'll read it to you capital u capital C getting this town capital q you're cheating when your numbers book today oh yeah I've we're gonna have you read some random numbers so what was I saying so you should definitely subscribe you should click look I'm gonna subscribe so this the reason why I'm not subscribed is not because I'm not subscribed it's because this is a fake account that I set up just that I bought YouTube red with so if I look at stuff on YouTube on my livestream that ads don't show up it's also a a YouTube channel an account that my kids use when they watch YouTube because I don't want them to watch have to watch the ads either so you can see what kind of videos they like to watch look gibreel visits the coding train okay now let me go back and I'm gonna give you a clue here you're gonna what you're gonna want to do is you want to go to his channel you're gonna want to click Subscribe then you're going to click this alarm bell I learned about this today I actually already knew about this but the alarm bells gonna if you could do this with my channel too if you want I guess you probably already subscribed if you're watching do it but it'll give you a it will give you a notification as soon as there's a new video and the reason why you might want to do this is there's gibreel gibreel will be publishing a new video on Sunday mmhmm I think you're gonna want to watch okay so if you want to get that notification it's gonna be on his channel so you're gonna have to subscribe there okay I'm looking at the chat so I think that oh these are look at this these are some great let's look at these oh look at your friends oh that okay so also by the way this I learned about recently to gibreel is doing live streams I guess I could let you talk about your own stuff I don't know why I can't stop talking my this is my channel I guess I'm in charge here this channel is where gibreel does his stream archives get published here right your live streams are actually on Twitch rictus okay and then also some nice the physics girl is an awesome channel coding trainers it's kind of okay and I don't know some of these other channels but I'm definitely gonna have to check them out they look cool all right so and here you can see here you can see YouTube real real life real okay if you're reading this you've been hacks okay alright he's like a real live a real life youtuber in person I don't think of myself as that because I'm like an old person but useful energy okay I have alright so I think okay let me mention two other things number one is there's a lot of live streams going on right now I saw that just normally I would tell you to watch something else if it's just me but since this job really should stay here but there is no there's the glitch channel this is totally giving me the wrong stuff Oh glitch code editor YouTube I don't know why I saw that they were livestreaming I can't find it nevermind glitch glitch I don't know why I'm plugging glitch but I love glitch it's a code editor not an official sponsor or anything but they they're they have a live stream going on today and then there's also the tensorflow dev summit this in particular I wanted to mention let's see if we can tune in to the live stream really briefly what are we learning about all right you see it now you don't hear the audio from this except through my mic so maybe I should just do a voiceover saying these workers servers and there's very little going on same to estimate I can't do it anyway so you the tensorflow dev summit is going on live right now I don't know what this is about but and I think earlier already today there was a very exciting announcement if I go to Jas tensorflow dot is at work I think yes so you might have heard me talk about a project called deep learn Jas on this channel what happens if I go too deep learn Jas org it's still there but it now says exactly what I wanted to tell you is that deep learned digest has become tensorflow Jas so that's pretty exciting like it graduated it grew up it graduated it's a teenager now maybe in whatever computing years opensource ears and how that translates a dog ear but member ask them the chat can we get to the point very unlikely it's gonna happen and so that's really exciting that how this project is growing to be able to unlock and make possible more types of machine learning algorithms and possibilities in the browser and I have been working on a project at ITP with a bunch of researchers I know Jabril has been experimenting with it for maybe an upcoming project if I go to github.com /ml 5j s and i'm gonna go here so this is a machine learning library kind of like a higherlevel simple basic library to do some machine learning stuff that was built that is built on top of deep learning is wherever that and now that deep learned dodgy ass has become tensorflow digest this means we're going to do a lot more work on this to support all the new possibilities that are unlocked from tensorflow jazz in particular most of our examples in this library involve using pretrained models and if you want to train your own model you've got to go and like set up your Python environment we have some tutorials for that but now we're gonna start to be able to make some examples and things where you can actually do the training in the browser so I'm slowly getting to it but this is I hope gonna be a big focus of my channel April May June however long I have that energy to do the service so that's that's coming let me see if there are any questions in the chat is it efficient to learn in the web and I have a question it does not it it's what what the researchers at Google have done in making tensorflow jazz is nothing short of heroic in getting all of the matrix operations that need to happen to happen in with WebGL using the GPU of the computer in the browser but its performance is still not going to be as fast as kind of native C++ tensorflow but it's remarkable how fast it is and the ease of not having to set up an environment just go to a webpage to execute a task to program something to make an animation I think there's a lot of exciting possibilities there okay so let's let's transition now to our guest and so I'm gonna let me see so I don't remember trying to remember you could step into the frame welcome to brill so i'm looking over here cuz i have a monitor of here so one thing by the way is that I have to practice is that the people we are speaking to are there but you'll notice I do this a lot like blah blah blah blah because I'm staring at the monitor I was observing very Pro okay so I'm trying to think when I first discovered to Brill's channel and I wish I had a good memory of this or story of this but I definitely remember when I first saw his video on the run forest project so I'll let Jabril introduce himself and say more about his background and how he got into this machine learning stuff if you like rather than try to do it myself but what I loved about that I have a book that some of you might be familiar with called nature of code where I have a kind of a chapter on neural networks and a chapter on genetic algorithm and they're kind of old and outofdate and I've kind of been wanting to expand that and do more with it this is now you know you're experiencing this live and so when I saw that project a run forest project which she hasn't have if you haven't seen it's a unity based simulation that trains a simulation forest gump amazingly character to run around to me is using both neural networks and genetic algorithms and it was really like I looked at like oh this is the perfect kind of demonstration example in the kind of creative coding or game making or art making context of how to apply machine learning to as simple it's not that simple but to a graphics motion based simulation so I was super excited to see that inspired me to think about some new stuff and where I wanted to take some of my tutorials to JavaScript I don't know the Internet's put the internet puts people in touch huh I've been watching his videos I think he's watching sometimes and so so welcome to the coding train so what I'm gonna do awkwardly is I'm going to take my coffee and my laptop and I'm gonna slide out of the way and go sit there's a chair over there and then I'm just gonna turn over to you we might mute my microphone and you can talk about your project and code and I'll watch the chat to see if there are questions so after a like a little bit of time I'll come back and ask you some of the questions people have asked sweet make sense very cool okay I'm shuffle awkward shuffle awkward okay all right howdy everyone how is it going so yeah I'm gonna give a little brief overview about Who I am for those of you that do not know what I'm sure as all of you so my name is Jibril I run a little YouTube channel called Jibril's here on YouTube and recently I converted my channel to focus on computer science that happened in September and that was probably one of the best things I've ever done because I learned that you know I had a great passion for writing code and write and making products and projects that were based on computer science and so yeah I mean obviously if I had a passion for that it was easy to show that in video projects as well and fast forward so one of the the biggest projects that I produced to date is the run forest project that got a lot of I is really grateful for and that really harnessed the power of machine learning which is a really big buzzword these days and yeah that's that's pretty much overview I spent nine months learning on how to write you know narrow networks from scratch or iPhone so I'm gonna pause you for a second people tell me the audio is low oh okay so let's let's do a little I'm sorry to interrupt you in the middle it's not no worries is my replacing good you know it's because it's going through it's fine you're good you're good okay I got it I have an idea let me just check a couple things okay I got a feel time so I'll dance I actually muted myself okay all right just let us know if this mic is still too low but yeah that's pretty much the overview I spend about nine months learning how to write machine learning algorithms from scratch because it was something AI is really cool to me I think and so yeah the run forest was released and today today what we're gonna do is we're going to examine this really simple JavaScript machine learning application kind of how it was done it's another machine learning application written wrote from scratch so we're gonna take a look at the code and all that good stuff um so let's let's get into this so here we have this example it's what I call a color predictor network to demo and it asked you a simple question does white or black look better over this color and so the color is within the circle and it's randomly generated so what so there we use a what kind of the do is press two two that's it okay okay and I just walk that's it no ok so what's important for us to start before we can get into the application let's understand the the main computational part of this application so we have a color and as you know colors are they're represented as a vector of three or sometimes four if you include the Alpha but we're not including the Alpha we're only going to use the RGB values so we have our inputs which is three is that own frame yes all right so we have red green and blue and these are values between 0 and 255 for each input so we need to build a neural network that will be able to take these inputs and then do a computation on them and then pass into an outputs to predict if it looks better over black or white so let's first draw our outputs just make sure it's all in the frame yes that's good and this is gonna be it predicts black and this predicts white so now we need a hidden layer is what we call hidden layer with artificial neural networks in the middle that does the computation part and this is our guess and so we are just going to arbitrarily just duplicate the same size of our inputs for our hidden layer nodes we're just gonna say three it's a good place to start if we're really serious about this we could expand it try five try seven and just log the results for all of them and see which one works the best but we're going to say three for this example make it nice and simple and so we have our RGB and if we go back to our example what's happening here is there's a computation that happens within our network to three one two three one two three and Dan feel free to interrupt if you think that I'm little offbase with anything uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh okay so this what did I just do it looks really confusing but it's actually really simple so we we need to somehow get our inputs computation and into our outputs and the way that we do that is we use what I'm using bubbles to represent what are called weights within our known network and so every single node within our hidden layer has the same amount of weights as there are inputs so what that means is there's one weight for this input there's one way for this input and there's one way for this input and the same for the rest of them one weight for this input one way for this input one weight for that input and repeat I didn't do that right boom boom and so what that happens is that we pass this through we do our input times the weight and then plus our bias and we can repeat the process this will give us a value let's say that we after we compute all these sum them up add a bias it will give us let's just say 0.5 and then we'll pass that to our outputs which is three huh huh passes to our output and then that will give us a value for each of these so let's say this is 0.3 and then this is 0.7 and then it's just as simple as we'll just say that this is higher 0.7 so it's guessing white so that's a quick overview on what's going on here with we're Daniel's gonna post a more indepth tutorial on this or you already have or well so I have tutorials yes this is you know the same kind of structure that I've used in my network library correct yes and I'm I was thinking at some point maybe next week hopefully I might try to recreate your project as like a coding challenge okay so we can put a link to yours okay so we'll put a link to Daniel Shipman series and what she goes indepth with this so if you want to learn more about what's going on here but that's a quick overview on the math on the computation so our inputs it gets times about weighting biases then we get a value and when we pass that to our output same computation and then gives us a prediction so yeah let's do it all right so people are asking we're using libraries give you a bunch of questions just because the Chad's gonna scroll too fast okay actually no it's fine I stopped it from scrolling so what for question umber one are you using any libraries or are you building this from scratch okay so yeah so this is a from scratch computation we're doing this completely from scratch and it's not necessarily important that you do from scratch no networks but if you want to get a good understanding on how to debug networks this is a really good it's a really good a way to go about ensuring that you can do that yep okay next question is is does the input have to be from 0 to 255 okay sure the inputs have to be normalized what's the from 0 to 1 yes great question great question so again I just glossed over this but so normalizing inputs for colors is actually really simple and it is always best to normalize your your input data so because we know that the the domain for a color value is always going to be 1 the 256 or in computer language we shift that by 1 0 255 we can simply just divide whatever this value is over 255 and that will remap this between 0 and 1 and so essentially when you're writing your program you would just pass the input through a function that would just divide about 255 so yes great question hmm so I'm curious about this too I sort of think it's probably okay the question for you asked it but is there a benefit to having two output nodes yes so there's a lot of debate on this and I I and I agree with the side that it's easier when you have like classifiers versus like if you have just one output node that is map between negative one and one and right and then if it's if it's above one zero then it's going to be white if it's below zero then it's going to be black yeah based on the research that I've read it's always best to go on a classifier yeah maybe this would be fine in the case of there's only two right the correct correct correct and the whole reason for that is because what what happens when you separate them is you get probabilities versus like you get a map of between zero and one which again if it's one output you can get away with that but if you try and encode your outputs using this for like 30 different the neural network might not make good sense of that oh cool so let's let's continue on because we need to get into the code part so let's look at some of the code as to how we went about writing that parts of our neural network and write down is up I keep forgetting I'm new to Mac so please forgive me here alright so and you beautified my coat no fries no worries beautified and zoomed okay so we first need to define all of our variables at the top so RGB is our input and then we have the amount of choices which is a variable that we use for our output just getting one second to skim this make sure I don't give you the wrong information here sweet so we set up our variables are jeebies our input data and then so one thing that's really important that I should go over just the just to make sense of what's going on here is two wrong computer on this one like that so so it's really important in order for you to write your algorithm you need to you need to know how to compute this compute both of these so this is really just an array of values so we can call this array G of I right so this is G of zero and this is G of 1 and G just stands for a guess I put 0 0 1 right and so we want to know what does G of I or what does G of 0 or what does G of 1 equal how can we get that equation well if we look at our diagram for our neural network it's actually quite simple so this is in frame right here so we can do G oh my goodness can I write okay so let's do it over here so G of I which again is this array this output layer G of I equals the summation of hidden layer this is going to be a hidden layer of I and this is going to be inputs of I that's how we define each of these vectors so G of I equals a summation of H hidden layer and then we have to go into another loop because we can't use the same indicee of I and J because it yeah it won't return the right value so hidden layer of J which is just gonna be 0 1 2 times the weight of G of I right and then we simply just add our bias of G of I and so this is the equation that we can use to compute each of our output nodes and so just to clarify what's going on here this is summation symbol which simply means to add up all within the the array so hidden layer J times the weight this is a function which simply just grabs the weight of whatever output node you're on so if you pass G of 0 for example to through this weight function it will just grab whatever bias or I'm sorry whatever weight of G of I is there so that's actually G of I of J actually hereby up J huh so now we have this equation that tells us exactly what these values equal so now we don't know what HL j equals so we also have to define HL of J and we go about doing that by doing the same exact process after this will be L of I for indices same exact process summation of our inputs right inputs what I use I NP and puts J times weight of HL of I so the same exact input we need H ll by mmhmm and then we simply just pass our bias and again this this right here is a function all it does is it grabs the bias for whatever node that we passed through it so bias of HL y mmhmm and there we have it we have our entire equation because we know exactly what inputs input of J equals it's going to be simply the random value of our color and so this is what we need to write in our software how we on time dad cool I keep forgetting up is down that's okay so same exact thing that you see on the board is what we write here in our code so first before we can get the what the guess no Zico we have to first forget what the hidden layer nodes equals so simply put as we did on the white board hidden layer zero equals we'll get to what Rayleigh was in a second but hidden there zero equals we did our input encoder which was a question that was asked earlier about normalizing our input data so this function simply just divides our input divided by Oh 255 and then we'll times that by the weight of our of our hidden layer so this this is an array function that I will go over really quickly that we instantiate to hold all of our weights so color predictor 0 0 0 I'll go over this I think it's important so so the function color can you see this I think so okay there's a lot of data that you have to remember this is interesting color predictor variable uhhuh so there's all these different dimensions to it and I think it's interesting or it's important to go over what the dimensions mean so let's just get to and then let's just do I don't know one so what does this mean if you have color predictor isay row two what does that mean well well so we want to store these arrays into our color predictive variable and we can go about doing that by defining the location of all of these so if the hidden layer is going to be 0 and then the guess is going to be 1 right and so all the notes are then going to have their own assignments so 0 1 and then 2 same here this is going to be 0 and 1 and then the weights are also gonna have their own assignment as well so 0 1 2 3 and the same day 0 1 2 3 and we repeat that for every single weight inside of the nodes right and so how this works is our color predictor is if we want to get grab reference to 0 that is going to be hidden layer and then 2 is going to be the last node and then 1 is going to be the the second way because start 0 1 second way so this variable is grabbing a reference to this way that's exactly what color predictor is 0 to 1 is doing and so you see this eye that's an extra dimension that you might be confused about so let's talk about that real briefly so a lot of information there's a lot of information but bear with me here Oh switch camera' okay all right I need that all right so this so you see this extra eye and what does that mean so traditionally traditionally with such an example you would use back propagation to train this no network however time was a factor and as well as that we wanted to go over lesson of both neural networks and genetic algorithms so why not combine them together so what we did for this example so that eye is actually just grabbing a reference to what predictor we are currently using so genetic algorithms real quick you have to have a population you have to assign Fitness scores to every single what's sorting for the creature within the population and then you have to mutate them and breed them in X Y & Z so we have a population of 800 predictors at four at start and then they all have randomly initialized weights and biases which again just to make sure it clear are all of these values waitwaitwait by swim away bias these are all randomly initialized the function that we use for this program is randomized between zero and one and then they all based on their randomly initialized weights we'll make a guess on which one they think is correct and so the most of them said that black is the correct color that looks best over this randomized color and then we simply just use a genetic algorithm to train this this predictor to converge on the best possible predictor and yet that's it that's a general overview on this the code is available on github and I left a lot of comets however that it will require a bit more in depth if you if you really want to like get a full grasp on this from learning have fun knowing absolutely nothing if you already know some stuff about no numbers between learning I'm pretty sure this example is pretty straightforward from you but the benefit of doing of writing neural networks from scratch is that you really have a good grasp on what's going on behind the scenes versus using libraries and you're able to debug you know different problems that might arise when you are writing your neural networks would be it from scratch or using libraries yeah and that is pretty much it we we do have plans to update it with the actual back propagation algorithm in there so that you can learn from that as well and okay where did that my hat go oh the cap the KY I picked it up I held it in my hand I put it in my pocket oh very cool so let me come over here a few more questions okay let's see what I can find here okay four so first people had asked to is the code already at github or you're gonna on github are you gonna update it yeah I I slept a little bit so stay tuned whenever whenever it's on github I will come back and edit the description for this livestream and put a link to but they can currently go to Steph's of the comic slash color oh that link that I use right yes so you can go to let's let me zoom in here and show you so this one yes if you want to grab the code right now I don't know why whenever I paste links into the YouTube chat they don't seem to work for that answer so but anyway so I would paste this into the chat but that wouldn't even work so you can see it yeah up there that you can grab the code now but I will also include a link to github repository or whatever that and it is my intention I think one of the reasons why I love this demo and people are kind of asking this a bit in the chat was like oh like do you really need a neural network for this right and I don't I think to me that I mean that's a perfectly valid and interesting question and probably the answer is no you don't need a neural network for this but when learning about neural networks when trying to build your own machine learning project if you can start with a welldefined small and scoped problem then you can really figure out and because you in some ways I do this similarly with the Juniper so my genetic algorithm prom projects I take a example where I know the answer right so I can see if the genetic algorithm worked because ultimately what I want to do is use a neural network or a genetic algorithm in some domain where maybe I don't know the answer I couldn't solve right so easily but to figure out how those things work I've got to come up with and so this is a really nice problem for that because it's simple small and for people who want to do creative coding graphics and design stuff it's got color and then and not to mention once you learn how to do this stuff from scratch this is easily scalable for the most part you still have to worry about some other stuff like vanishing gradients and stuff like that but for the most part you can take this and scale this up and it'll work just about the same so there's also that benefit as well so there were a couple of questions that came in on Twitter asked Jabril hash tag hash tag people there were a lot of questions like how are you speaking with your mouth there was a lot of moving I am a BOTS how can I become like you I don't know if that's an answerable question but that was the question that came in from id AXI so on Twitter I'm so here's a question from I am rashon on Twitter this is a big question ok let's do it I don't know I think this is a question I've certainly touched on and but how is AI let me read the question how it actually is written how is AI different from a neural network or deep learning or machine learning they often seem to be used interchangeably and cause confusion so first of all I want to say like question and I struggle with this question all the time because there's all these different terms so we so let me list those terms artificial intelligence deep learning machine learning and then I might put neural network in a like different category but that's another term as well I don't know if you have a kind of like way that you describe these the terminology of people when they ask those kind of yeah I'd like to start with English is difficult I like to start there but for the most part AI is it's like a grab all for everything a I like you can hard code AI you don't have to use machine learning so that's kind of like the grab all for at all and then what was the other the code words would so oh boy all these things are coming in AI machine learning deep learning yeah and so machine learning I think it's like the next level down so you don't need to use a neural network to do machine learning there are different ways you can go about teaching the machine how to learn one really good example is decision trees people haven't developed really complex decision trees and the machine just kind of explores the space and learns the best way to use this this is injury so that's another way of applying machine learning and then would you say neural network and debugging yes yeah so neural networks is essentially what we showed and even that's kind of to the bay because like recurrent neural networks are no networks but they're not really you know neural networks you know that make sense so I don't know it's it's if you say no network people will know what you're talking with most part I'm gonna try to give my take on this let's do it let's do it well I think I would put neural network in a different category than those other terms because to me neural network need oh look at the cat I don't know I'm so bad I don't have a good I wanted to get like between the ferns like set up in here where I could get like a camera and some like chairs a little coffee table and can have like a conversation but it's no just the awkward standing thing somebody in the chat told me to put a mirror behind the cow and then we're like talking to each other but looking at the view I like that that might be weird though there's nobody else here I'm kind of egotistical all this I used to have a screen over there and I would always stare at that but anyway I limit so so the reason so neural network to me is a particular algorithm that involves connected nodes that and data flows from one node to the other and there could be different architectures and styles and so that neural network data structure or algorithm can be applied in the field of artificial intelligence machine learning at deep learning but neural network is an example of a particular algorithm I would say you could sort of think of it also as a data structure but there's an algorithm there in terms of how the data flows through the structure so that's what that's what I think and then I think that artifice to me artificial intelligence is this umbrella term mmhmm that is really just like hey or can computers and candy have intelligence like humans do and what does that and apparently my technology is not intelligent enough to record video for more than 30 minutes at a time oh so I think that is a very broad umbrella term for just the big field of like simulated intelligence rather is that is it real intelligence is that the illusion of intelligence is that the same things like I'm a deep philosophical question and then I machine learning to me as a subfield of artificial intelligence involving making sense of data mmhmm so you have data and that's input to a system and you have some output which might be making sense of that data whether it's a prediction for something it's gonna happen in the future or a classification of something and then then I think of deep learning as a kind of almost like a modern rebranding of neural networks it's like hey we have bigger datasets now and faster computers now all of a sudden the things that people researched many years ago called neural networks that nobody thought could really do anything or they thought good but couldn't now all of a sudden we can do more of them with and so it's really just like I mean it's not meant to be marketing but it's kind of like marketing this idea of big data a neural networks and yeah I agree I think it's a lot of the marketing side of things because you'll reach so many different posts like they're deeply needed machine learning yeah it has two hidden layers that's it yeah like literally I think it's more the marketing side my personal opinion but that's awesome cool let me see if we have any other oh yeah neural network I like this definition neural network is a universal function approximator oh really this is actually like a really this is Robin I'm gonna hello let's try this oh this is crazy talk now now I'm coming over here I actually think this is really kind of a good way to think about it I was thinking about this the other day because what if we made like function color predictor and we just had like an if statement in there like and you give it a color so if the brightness blah blah blah that color is greater than some value then you should put black on that color or white on that color so this is like a hardcoded function that takes inputs and returns an output right and so we could we could write a lot of if statements where you get really crazy complicated about this we could come up with a whole set of rules and a neural network in a way as a thing that you could put in here to kind of learn to return the value according to in a more mysterious way in a way like in a sense it can learn it acts so in a way like does do neural networks in machine learning replace coding right I don't think of them as we're plate maybe someday they will in some weird way but I think of it as like they don't replace coding but they can replace our act as a function in your code so that function that you might have hardcoded a lot of if statements can have a machine learning system in it take some inputs and generate an output yeah I agree I mean when it's all said and done algorithms are input instructions output yeah and you're just replacing the engine bird you know totally I believe Suraj I already did a video on that I think Suraj haven't already done a video on that it's probably the answer for everything we might ever talk about in this cuz he definitely has a video a new Simpsons coding train are you gonna show us the working code or is it just a discussion so I think we're wrapping up here this is really just a discussion the code is here something I'd asked us to scroll the top ok tendency was at the top but I don't know if that really matters but I'm standing in front the code anyway but this code is available at that URL there'll be a link in this video's description and I think I mean I I don't know like I mean I feel committed to doing this I just don't know when exactly it'll happen but hopefully sometime next week I'd like to make my own version of this project which I'll do like in a coding challenge from scratch so we can and then we can kind of compare and contrast that and I have a feeling that you'll probably gonna have some other video content about this project at some point yes did I mention that you should subscribe there's gonna be a special guest did I mention that you should subscribe me a special guest I don't know I have no idea who wait how do I YouTube you need what do you know you can get one of these vanity URL things now so you can get like this ah I don't know because I have one now any alone I don't know maybe you have to be like very special and YouTube to get that unlocked for you I think you're special thank you but so I'm just gonna search for you again if you just do Jabril as it comes up oh well then you that I don't think URL though oh you have to search it and they come captain is shipped yes okay so here once again subscribe yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna just show you them an unsubscribe this is terrible unsubscribe now I'm gonna show you how you do this you go search to brill's and the search bar then you click Subscribe then you click the alarm bell because if you want this special surprise video that might come out very soon you'll get a notification okay you need a hundred subscribers to get the vanity URL so I got some work to do yeah all right so I'm let me just check to see if there's oh yes people are asking your twitch so let's see if we can let me say if I do this what do you think the chance that I'll come up it's just a real CPU yeah oh well so if you go to twitch.tv gibreel CPU that's drills twitch and actually so I was gonna say in this free but whoa whoa all right they can't hear this bunch I mean they can if it comes through our mics but the audio from this laptop does it seem us freaking out but actually I'm curious so tell me about your because I'm always I always feel like I have no idea if I'm doing I don't think there is an answer to this like my process of this weird process like I do live streams are in YouTube uhhuh then I cut up an oedipal I streams of separate videos also on YouTube it's a nice I think oh I should be live streaming on Twitch should I not be posting we're done so what's your how do you separate those you have the YouTube channel you have Twitch and then you have a second YouTube chat right Jim real CPU alright what are those pieces yeah so I'm keeping my focus on the dubrow's channel like yeah so I'm literally livestreaming and then whatever comes out of that isn't being straight uploaded to YouTube and YouTube but it's a separate YouTube channel like the lyric the live streams on Twitch don't show up in the Charles correct gibreel a YouTube channel they show up in the gibreel CPU you'd correct unless I do like really special live stream yeah so do you have three things to subscribe we live stream YouTube live stream archive and and the main jet oh well thank you I know at least subscribe to the main channel definitely a main channel yes Bruno clarifies you don't need a hundred K subscribers only 100 and then you can do the channel main thing so you could get youtube.com slash come I can't say that alright so let me see let me just check the ask tube real hashtag on Twitter maybe that's do you think if there's anything No okay anything else there actually somebody used this earlier in 2012 or some weird going through I should have made this ask let's see tube reals with the S let's see if that shows up oh yeah so next time you're not seeing this but next time we'll do different hashtag anyway cool um so what time is it it is 4 o'clock that means I have to leave and go catch my eye hand coding train so I will be back for sure next Friday I hope that we'll be able to do more collaborations like this to Brill is based in San Diego right so we do not even know San Diego sounds dreamy to me so that you have to go to trip there but awake me asks when is the next coding challenge so I'll probably do coding challenges again next Friday if I can get it together I'd like to try to at least tackle this caller predictor idea before next Friday already show one thing ok you can I don't know where you want you could stand here because I wanted to mention people most recently I did a coding challenge about quadtrees hmm okay so github.com slash coding training slash quadtree and so if you remember the code demo this this was what I did in my tutorial so I just made a whole bunch of random points in space 2d space then I registered them in this quadtree data structure which you'd have to go back and watch the videos to find out what that is and then I had an algorithm that in a hopefully faster way that iterating over all the points pulls out selection of points within a certain radius and actually I didn't do the circular region in the tutorials somebody sent a pull request in after I uploaded the code for the circular region so then what I did not and I want to do this as a coding challenge but I did it in class my NYU class earlier this week I did a collision detection test so let's look at this so this is just a simple example that has I believe there are one oh yeah it's down here there are 1000 particles I think if such a nice smiley face 1000 particles and I'm testing if they are intersecting and when they're intersecting they're highlighted white when they're not intersecting they're just gray and you can see I'm getting a pretty reasonable framerate I bet you I'm getting kind of a lower I was getting 60 frames per second no problem when I tried this so maybe it's just this computer or because it's hooked up to the streaming system or there's other things in the browser like the twitch channel going but anyway the point is I'm gonna uncheck this using quadtree so as soon as I uncheck this using quadtree it's going to it for every dot iterate over all the dots instead of using the quadtree and you can see now I'm at 4 or 5 frames per second so we can see how the quadtree at least even though you know I did get a lot of comments along the lines of you're doing your quadtree incorrectly if there's ways of making it better and more efficient and to is like why are you doing a quadtree in JavaScript that's sort of silly like it's not going to be very fast and so while all of those points are valid and true I would say you can see that even with all of my failings as a programmer and using javascript I'm still getting like an incredible speed performance and look if I go down to like if I you know I can see even with like three thousand particles I'm still getting like 15 frames per second and if I uncheck this I mean just forget about it I don't even you know oops didn't even couldn't even like like oh you can't see what just happening like some checked it no it's okay oh so you can see like the framerate is officially zero right now so if I if I can manage to check that again we'll see so there is certainly I'm sure like more optimizations that I could do but there is a benefit so I have a challenge for everybody watching if anybody right now everything is in this github repo coding train slash quadtree and you can see links to the video tutorials the pseudocode Wikipedia page and then these are the two examples you're fine you're fine there's some other quadtree libraries and javascript that are down here but i have a challenge for anyone which is that i would love to have another example here that is flocking with quadtree so i will be accepting pull requests if you want to make a flocking demo with this quadtree of code you know i mean i'll make this myself at some point but i love to have people contribute so that's one thing to see like can I get a flocking simulation in JavaScript with like 600 agents that's gonna run reasonably well okay whoops I'm getting a notification here Oh jump thank you 66 e and the chat says don't forget you have to do this before you leave this means we're wrapping up oh you have to read some random okay alright unfortunately I don't have the sound board from any lullaby music you can pick a page read whatever you like I'll take your time enjoy I'll check the chat for any last important questions yeah you know what this is silly to have the quadtrees thing behind you so let's so I guess what probably makes options are your own website or just like the full let's just give you the full do I get the soundtrack I don't have it hooked on dang it I can't it we can do if we can edit an overlay oblate okay that's why people can now the other thing I could do is this is fun sometimes people want to make their own nice remixes mmhmm and then they can overlay music and whatever they're gonna step out mmm seven nine five zero point three three one one point seven one four one point eight eight nine point eight five eight point four zero one one point two one five one point five two six point six nine two point five six seven point four one zero beautiful that was beautiful my tears to my eyes people are telling me that that it's very dangerous to stand in front of a greenside all the time and nobody ever I made a hole like I like dance the for the reason for like I like 45 minutes straight nobody ever did okay there's some applause all right so quadtree neon so I think we can wrap up thank you so much Brielle's for being here and ITP this whole week thank you thank you for coming and being a guest on the coding train thank you to many more future collaborations and things yes I got a free spring there I was just glad I didn't like messed up you can't do like this or like that get my face back or something cuz that's all right so I'll just say goodbye Thank You internet for watching now go it's a if glitch project is still live streaming or tensorflow dev summit still live streaming or I don't know go watch somebody play some beautiful music or something something noncoding related all right turn off YouTube go outside be with friends and family I feel anyway anyway you do you choose what to do don't listen to me we're gonna leave I'm gonna I don't have a good system for this I just have to only take me dude I use this mouse and you go over here to click this stop stream and then we disappear okay so I need like a little outro video or something I do have like I do have an intro video right I can actually just go straight to the infra ok here we go goodbye cookie
