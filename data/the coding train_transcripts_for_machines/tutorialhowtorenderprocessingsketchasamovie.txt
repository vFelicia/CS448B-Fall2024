hello and welcome in this video I'm going to show you how to take a processing sketch and render it to a movie so this comes up a lot and there's probably a variety of ways that you could do this but I'm going to show you a particular technique that hopefully will be useful to you so I you know I picked this arbitrarily it's one of the examples from my nature of code materials um it is a a simulation called The Game of Life a cellular automata system automata boy I'm never going to get that right ever in my life um and it's just it's a a an AR animation but anything anything at all that you draw to the screen in processing you can render as a video out of processing why would you want to do this well there's a variety of reasons one is uh you might want to upload something to Vimeo or YouTube or some other um website to host a video uh you might want to bring this into another project maybe you're working on an animation in in something like after effects and you want to have some elements that you've programmed in there I can think of some I'll try to include some examples of people who have done this kind of work in the a YouTube description below so you might want to take what you're doing incorporate into another project in video form another thing might be actually that you just the thing that you made is beautiful but it runs incredibly slow and you want to you don't need it to run in real time so you could render it as a video so that it could run at 30 frames per second and play back as at a as an installation or whatever it is you might be doing so let's look at how you might do that and there's there's there's a bunch of steps to it um um and I'll try to go through them so the first thing that I will show oh and you know what this font is remarkably small so let me just show you in processing 3 I can go to the preferences I'm going to change the editor font to 36 and I think that's going to be a little bit better hopefully you can see that um okay so what's the first thing that I want to do to this so what I'm going to do is save so there's uh there there may be some other uh processing libraries you you can get to render directly to a movie file but what I'm going to show you how to do instead of rendering directly to a movie file you can always just save what's on the screen as an image so for example if I put save um the function save and I say um go.png right I'm just going to put that in draw and I'm going to run it you can see first of all I don't know if you can tell if it's running slower or not maybe it is maybe it's not I'm going to close this and I'm going to go to that sketch folder and you can see right there there now is a file called go.png and you can see it's a snapshot of what was on the screen now I was doing that in draw so it was doing it over and over and over again and what we're seeing now is just the last frame that it drew so the save function is way and you might put that in Mouse press or attach it you know you might at some point just want to use Save just to save a snapshot of what's on the screen but if you use the save frame function what the save frame function allows you to do is include the pounds symbol the hash symbol and what it will do now is autonumber the files so every time you call Save frame it's going to save goore one goore 2 so this now if I'm executing this in draw every time through draw I'm going to get a new image file and I'm going to run this and I'm going to try not to run it for very long oops did I leave it running because now I'm going to go in and be like oh my goodness and you can see there here it is I have a image file for every single uh thing that was saved uh every single frame now I don't like this this is kind of a disaster because I have a zillion files and it's polluting my file system here so I'm going to delete these and I'm going to show you what I think would be more useful to do I'm going to make just a directory I'm going to call it output SLG pound pound pound Pound and I'm going to run this and I'm going to let it run okay that was enough time and and uh now you can see I have this all here and I can just cycle through it and you can see there it is every single frame and by the way I'm using the PNG file format which will save uncompressed so this way the full quality is there in each and every frame this way later on you could choose to compress it or different codec whatever you want to do with your video that's a bit outside the scope so now the question is what do you do with these files so you could bring them into Final Cut Pro or iMovie or EG Studio 159 zy Pluto magic thing rainbow I don't know is there rainbow in there whatever it is you can find your own software lots of software can take an image sequence After Effects will do this for you and render to a movie it so happens that if you want the sort of quick way of doing it processing up here under the tools menu under Tools there is a Movie Maker tool so if I go to click here Movie Maker and select it it opens up an interface that says this tool and you I don't know if you can read that this tool creates a QuickTime movie from a sequence of images blah blah blah it gives you a bunch of information all sorts of thing you can do what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go to the finder I'm going to find this output folder and I'm going to drag this output folder right here and then I'm going to look here and say like okay um my uh it's it's it's giving me a default height of 640 by 480 but I want to change that because my processing window it's self was 640x 360 what's the frame rate that I want oh and I guess I could have clicked same size as Originals in which case it would just use the size of the the file um and then I can pick whether I want to have some sort of compression I'm going to pick animation which basically means no compression so I'm going to get a very big file but I'll be able to bring it into some other software again if I'm using this in After Effects it's going to need to be recompressed later so I don't want to compress multiple times so I could also bring in a sound file if I wanted to include some sound with it I'm not going to worry about that and I'm going to hit uh create movie and it wants me to save it somewhere I'm going to uh put it on the desktop as testm movie. moove and hit save and did that already happen did it just like do it so fast normally it shows a little progress window but maybe I just had so little a test movie. move I'm going to open this up uh come on quick time and yeah oh so it just happened so fast you can see it there it is so now I have a movie file that I can save uh wow amazingly if it was longer you would have probably seen a little progress bar for it rendering it and you can see this is just a QuickTime movie that I'm playing fantastic so that's the basic gist of it uh in six minutes I kind of showed you the main piece but I think we could do a little bit more here because you might be in a situation where you want to start and stop the rendering to a file um you might want to uh be able to see some information on the screen whether it's rendering or not so I'm just going to add a couple more um pieces to this program just to make it a little bit more sophisticated okay so so one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create a Boolean variable called recording and I'm going to assume that we're not recording When the program first starts so Boolean recording equals false so and then I'm going to say if recording this is where I should save those frames so the other thing I want to do by the way now that I finished and made that movie maybe you need backups and stuff but I'm just going to go and delete that folder because I don't want to save the previous uh I don't need to save those previous raw files I have everything that I need right here in quick time now and I will just save that um the the the movie file again um so now only if only if the Boolean variable recording is set to True will it actually save those frames that's a useful thing now what I'm going to do is say let's say what I want to do is uh have a way okay so if I say you know this isn't that interesting let's use key pressed so uh if I could say if key equals r or key equals capital r recording equals not recording so what this is going to do is when oh I I'm in JavaScript land I wrote function void um what this is going to do is it's going to say anytime I press r on the keyboard it will start recording or stop recording it's going to toggle the Boolean state of recording if Rec not true is false not false is true so recording equals not itself if it's false become true if it's true become false so that's going to happen there anytime I toggle it and you can see like if I run this program and I go to the files we can see that it's not record recording if I hit if I click in here and I hit R you can see suddenly new files are appearing if I hit R again those new files will have stopped so simply by adding a quick little something to the program I can kind of turn on and off the recording now also what would be nice here is for me to be able to see some visual indication on the screen as to whether it's recording or not so what if I just WR here I say okay um Phil uh red otherwise fill green and draw a circle I don't know at the middle of the screen towards the bottom that's like a circle so if we run this you can see there's a little green this is like terrible visual design but there's a little green circle there when it's not recording and when I hit record that Circle turns red when I hit record again that Circle turns green I don't know if those are the right colors the visual indicators you want but you get the idea I can toggle the color of that Circle and know whether I'm recording or not very useful but but are you thinking in your mind oh no there's a big problem I don't want a big ugly green or red circle in my video but one thing that's wonderful about the save frame function is it's going to save the current view of the processing window and guess what the circle is drawn after I call Save frame so save frame is going to save what's in the window window and then draw the circle on top of that that Circle won't get saved to the file so we should be able to see if I go back to um here and delete that I'm going to run this and I want to start recording for a little bit it's recording it's recording it's recording recording I want to stop recording and then I'm going to close here I'm going to go and look let's just look at these files no green or red circle so we've done it we're we're able to add a little visual indicator into to our window as to whether it's recording or not um I think that's the gist of it I've tried ah so let's just like show something sort of nice that we can do here which is that if I were to run this at 1920 by 1080 like super high resolution um and I'm going to uh I'm just going to put print line uh frame rate in here so I'm going to run this you can see that processing is not able to render the game of life it's might be hard for you to see this in this sort of like captured video tutorial but it's not able to run this super fast at such high resolution and um it's actually quite fast you can see the frame rate is about 14 frames per second but I want to make this glorious game of life simulation that runs at 30 frames per second so now if I do this and I hit record you can see by the way it's slowing down also while recording because there is there's some energy and computation and time that it takes to render these to a file if I run this now run this to uh render this to a file and I stop recording and I skip out of the program and I go back to tools Movie Maker and I uh uh whoops go up here and I get this output folder and I drag it into here it's the same folder uh now this needs to be 1920 by 1080 and of course I could just select this same size as Originals frame ratees create movie and I want to do Test movie n 1080 and hit save and you can see now you're seeing the little progress window it's just not doing it as fast this time it's creating the movie and then uh it's finished and I'm going to go to the desktop uh to look at what I've rendered and Test movie 1080 I'm going to open this up converting um so that quick time can render it come on quick time okay there we go I'm going make this full screen I'm going to play it you can see I've got my 30 frames per second game of life simulation all programmed in processing so oh I don't know what just happened oh you know what I left some old files in there so it like rendered at the end that so it stitched two together it stitched like the high resolution one with the low resolution one together that's kind of interesting so anyway you can see um all sorts of possibilities I hope that this helps you um with things that you might be making in processing you can do this with 3D uh you can do this with just about anything um and let me know how it goes for you um so thanks for watching this video and I will be back soon with more videos
