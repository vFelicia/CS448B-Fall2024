do do do check one two testing my audio i had a little bit of a just bitty disaster as i tripped over the hdmi cable connected to my camera and uh i had to go find another hdmi cable but amazingly i'm barely late so uh i will be starting in just about a minute and a half let me know how my audio is thank you very much hello welcome to the coding train it's a kind of a miracle that i am here for you on camera slightly off to the side because i actually had no idea what i would look like when i pressed the button to switch to this camera right here to broadcast and live stream this if i move over this way because i tripped over i knocked the tripod over the cables went flying when the hdmi cables got bent i had already pressed start to the music actually no that was right before i pressed start i got another cable then i pressed start anyway it was like a mad rush in the last five minutes to get started here but i'm looking over and the lighting seems fine i'm assuming people can hear me uh i see audio coming through and i'm sitting here i wore a a slightly nicer shirt than i usually do on a saturday for you today i hope you appreciate that you don't need to appreciate that but uh i appreciate you i should be the one appreciating you um i do want to maybe make some adjustments here but before i do any of that i'm really excited to tell you about a new sponsor i have for the coding train live streams and so i want to very quickly let's see if i can press the right buttons to make this happen i'm going to click over here ah and i'm excited to tell you about today's sponsor of the coding train curiosity stream so launched by media visionary john hendricks who founded the discovery channel you know back when it was actually good um you know it's lot of reality tv on there now uh qrsd stream is the awardwinning destination for documentary films and tv shows covering every topic from space exploration to adventure to the secret lives of wild animals so you can sign up see that link that's above me there curiositystream.com codingtree uh if you sign up at that link hopefully somebody can post it into the chat um it's also in the video's description you'll get a 26 discount on the annual hd plan it's 14.79 for the entire year which is kind of mindblowing to me i know money means a different thing to different people all over the world but i was thinking about how much i'd spend on just renting a movie time to time um and so uh um there's just a huge library of stuff you will also get access to the streaming video service nebula that i've talked about on several occasions here on the coding train um you can also see coding train videos on nebula a lot of other original content and from youtube creators when you sign up for curiosity stream using the link that's above me and hopefully by now it's gotten posted to the chat and i see that nico thank you for posting to the chat so um back to here so i'll come back and um we'll maybe look at a couple interesting recommendations i have for you i was watching last night a documentary on the on moose and there's like moose i think it's called moose on curiosity streams with my kids because we love to watch nature shows little cute little moose babies they were so wonderful um anyway really helps me out if you consider signing up so um i what am i gonna do today today is a day of coding that's ostensibly what i do um and i want to open today with looking at some of the recent video tutorials and by the way my glasses are incredibly dirty i can barely see a thing is there any way that i could possibly clean them maybe before i start live streaming for all i know there's like a giant piece of like jelly on my face i was having a peanut butter and jelly crepe earlier is that a weird thing to announce on live youtube in any case um i'm a little bit discombobulated even a little bit more so than i usually am i am enjoying looking at the chat i'm going to move this document out of the way uh and go over here and am i in the right discord channel i am oh have you joined the coding train discord let's see if i can open that up um oh good you're not seeing it because i want you to see it in a second i'm going to go over to here this is where the coding train community uh hangs out um during the times in between my live streams uh there's a wonderful community of folks there we've added some new moderators recently thank you to everyone who's come aboard to help moderate the discord um but mostly the reason why i mention it is as i'm doing stuff today on the live stream various things that i might be coding or talking about i will post links to them so i mean obviously i could post them to the youtube chat maybe that would be more efficient but i don't have easy access to that i like to kind of keep things um the youtube chat could disappear and who knows so i like to post things to this discord channel as i'm going so um i would love for you to join you can go to thecodingtrain.com discord or i have this button here when i press it it puts an invite to the discord in the chat i love my elgato stream deck it's over here it's really cool i'm looking at you elgato um let's see what else do i want to say so i'll be here till about three o'clock as some of you who might have watched my other recent live streams um saturdays uh one of these days i should really like not live stream and do the baking class with my kids but my kids are taking a zoom baking class today i believe is a pear tart so it goes between one and three they're not completely unsupervised in the kitchen there's another adult present uh making sure you know nothing light's on fire they're you know they're nine and 12. so they can handle themselves it's not like there's a you know twoyearold turning the oven on anymore it's uh that's just that didn't happen if it did i i apologize to all the other twoyearolds who am i even talking to anymore sometimes it's very hard to just keep speaking words continuously when you're in a room by yourself in an attic really staring at a camera i do see the outside world there's a nice window over there and i see brooklyn i see little rooftops of buildings and looks like the sun is coming out uh the snow is sort of melting although we're supposed to get four inches of snow tomorrow what was i was i but but i'm gonna jump right in because time is a wasting and i have a limited amount of time so this spring if you've been following me recently and i'm i'm you know a little bit crawling through the mud here and making progress although i am making progress this spring from now until probably through the summer really but at least until uh april or may it's not the spring yet it's clearly the winter if you look outside in new york city but my focus is the nature of code so let me uh say a few words about that first of all you can check out the nature of code book i'm not trying to sell you something here this is actually a um you know there are ways that you can support the project if you feel so inclined but this is a uh an open source uh book project with 10 chapters about creative coding and physics simulation um that um i really should figure out what i always want to say that i published in somebody fact check me on this i think i think i published this in 2012 that's my guess right now i had to guess um but i haven't and i've been talking about publishing a second edition of it probably for like the last four or five years so you can see how well this is going um but i am really trying to double down on that make that my sole focus i'm teaching a course at nyu right now called guess what drum roll the nature of code um and i'm going to go over here and one of the things that i'm really excited about that i figured out how to do is we started using um at nyu well we nyu is now using a learning management system it's called brightspace i don't know if any of you use it for your schools or if you are involved with schools but i i really want not wanting to use learning management systems because i don't want the content that i work the educational content that i work on to be locked into a proprietary system um at the same time students privacy is a big concern um there's often a lot of you know postings and chatter and sort of administrative stuff that goes along with running a course that i don't want to be in an open platform so what i finally figured out how to do was keep all of my notes for each week so if i go here i'm just going to go to module 1 vectors keep them all as in an open source repo this is basically the assignment the videos and uh reading material some of this right now actually unfortunately if you click on this pdf maybe i can remedy this as only that's when the draft pdfs i've only made available in google drive if you have certain permissions but i don't mind sharing those more broadly but the point of what i'm saying is i have figured out how i can embed this markdown file into brightspace so the students can the reason why i mention this is i would love for any of you who are out there to follow along with this material feel free to complete the assignments yourself i'm going to show you where you can share them on the coding train website um i'm going to show you a bunch that some people have unknowingly done i mean they know that they did them maybe they don't know that they did them as part of like this course and um i would like and i would love your contributions so for example something that's really missing here on my notes are uh additional supplemental readings and material that might not be authored by me um in particular um you know i tend to uh most of the resources that i've researched and created with nature of code come from a kind of western american white male perspective and you know i try to be mindful of sharing um diverse artists especially uh black indigenous people of color and so if you have artists and references that you think would be relevant you know i don't want each one of these pages to be you know you know thousands of links long but i do want to curate and add and continue to update it so if you would like to continue the issues are open the pull rook continue if you'd like to contribute the issues are open the pull requests are open i encourage you you can see right now um there's nothing as of module 3. obviously the material for the modules exists on the internet and other places but i'm slowly putting them together you know i i'm not asking anyone to do my work for me but if you want to make a little fun project see if you could create one of these readme files for one of the later weeks based on all of the things that's in different places on the internet you could certainly do that and i would uh happily review it um this is my main focus right here so the updating the book is going along with this that's still on a little bit of hold i don't really have time to look at the book text too much but what's really happening live in motion going going going going going is the new videos so while i know it's disappointing to some folks that these coding challenges are few and far between i will i'm excited to say that there's a couple that have been recorded that will come out as part of coding challenges um my focus has been on um the nature of code uh playlist and what you'll see here is this most recently there are now four videos that go along with chapter three angles in motion angular motion angles and vectors polar coordinates i see that um kuntal in the chat is asking for these links so thank you for asking um kunta i am going to show you how i share links uh it's very hot and stig is actually a question about the platform for publishing the book so i'm happy to discuss that for a little bit i do have a tendency to like take up a half an hour when i start discussing that but let me see if i can return to that in one second so let me just offer some of these links um i'm gonna put them here in discord so remember this is in the live uh i can just zoom in on this in discord there is a category called live um i try to post updates to my schedule here and schedule um and links are where i'll post links of things i'm doing so here is that repo here is the nature of code book and one more link i want to make sure i share is this page that has all of the videos so far uh and then um i think let's see if this comes up yeah i can usually find it it's the the playlist on youtube uh is also the nature of code too and i've you ever some of you have watched my recent live streams know that i i feel a great amount of pain when i look at this page oh i just like my soul aches for the features that youtube implemented and took away oh i almost i mean i'm not gonna move off of youtube but boy certainly it's not helping me feel you know i have lots of mixed feelings about youtube as a platform there's the benefits for me right now outweigh the the the deficits um but the lack of the learning playlist uh structure that they had implemented is really it really makes me sad anybody from youtube is watching this thank you for listening to me and by the way everybody that i've worked with at youtube is absolutely lovely and has taken feedback graciously and works really hard so it's not a criticism these are big complicated software systems people are working on with a lot of different incentives so i don't mean that as a criticism i'm just i'm just sad a little bit sad i'm gonna read some random numbers that makes me happy what was i doing ah pasting this link in here all right so that's the link to that particular playlist i will tell you that chapter three um if we're looking at chapter three there's actually a 2.6 video that i made back in march like basically the day before uh well it wasn't you know there's no exact date to really pinpoint when the pandemic hit but at least it was kind of the day before everything shut down in new york city i mean i never got to releasing it it's also like it was kind of a mess that video so there's a 2.6 coming i think i should release it um and then uh 3. 3.5 6 7 and 8. there's four more videos for chapter three as well as two coding challenges so there's a lot coming it's all been recorded just putting it together waiting to publish it um all right i'm looking at the chat and juan says i got the physical nature of code book for my birthday last year and it was a great gift juan i'm so happy to hear that um i don't know if i could ever i mean it's far be it for me to assume that me signing anybody's book is something anybody actually wants but if i could ever meet you in person someday and you have your book with you i would be glad to write you a nice little note and hopefully i can remember and say i remember when you wrote about this on chat on the youtube live stream um okay so the first thing that i wanted to do today um is just look at some things that people um just remind you about the community contribution system that i have which by the way i have some i have some kind of secret plans nobody knows about this not even some of the people i really need to fill some people in um um there's been a the website the coding team website is a community driven project um and i have some plans for it so i'll be in touch with those of you who spend a lot of time helping to maintain the website um but what i wanted to remind you is right now for every single video and don't worry too much about am i posting this in the right place just share what you're making if you go to any particular video uh page first of all the code is there this is really important and uh sometimes there'll be more than one example with each video so you can see web editor um you can just you know if i'm looking at web editor and i just click right here on this one and then run the sketch this is a particular sketch that i demo demonstrate in the video and the code that goes along with it so i wanted to make sure everyone's aware of that um and then i also want to just highlight this community contribution section so if you make a sketch oh actually sorry if you make anything honestly it could be you made a sweater you drew you painted a picture i it doesn't have to be a code contribution a p5 if you if you um are uh putting something out there and you want to share it with me and the community this is the place to do it it's not the easiest thing to do uh requires a little bit of comfort with github a little bit of willingness to like put yourself out there we i hope that i and the rest of the folks who are helping to manage the repo are friendly and welcoming and inclusive so don't worry you can't do it wrong it's a learning opportunity for all of us to participate in these systems but um you can look at this guide uh for how to add your sketch i also have a little video that i think is still up to date and some information about how to do it um and then let me go and find one where there's one actually there so for example here we go uh lemur daniel great name daniel wow what an excellent name you've got there this coffee is very hot i've burnt my tongue on it at least three times while streaming and i'm now trying to drink it very slowly talk amongst yourself delicious so sometimes i will pick a contribution across everything and show it but i thought i wanted to really kind of want to like highlight these videos to make sure people are aware they exist and getting your feedback and that sort of stuff so let me click here on uh fortune wheels and let's take a look at oh cool so this is definitely based on one of the examples i remember referring to and making where you kind of have this wheel and i by the way this comes from my example it's a very awkward um kind of like dragon release interaction code there's probably a much more elegant thoughtful way of maybe doing a running average over time of how you're moving the arrow so that when you release i think i'm just taking like the last two frames of the p of the draw loop and looking at where the arrow is and then seeing how far apart they are and kind of applying that as a force but you can see this is called wheels 4 sector count 10 audio off so oh oh my goodness this is wild sector count oh whoa i had no idea i looked at this earlier audio can you hear the audio i think you can that's pretty cool great work uh daniel an excellent name by the way i just want to make it clear you're quite allowed to publish a community contribution to the website even if your name isn't daniel just putting that out there uh okay um so now let's see if we have any more i think they might all be from lemur daniel uh angular motion none yet you could be the first um angles and vectors oh we've got two from lemur daniel thank you lemur daniel let's take a look at these quickly asteroid game vector thrust um whoa cool um ah oh this is fun so this is like so one of the things the videos talks about is how to use of the angle of a vector to apply a velocity or a force as well as how to um have an object you're drawing like this ship here point in the direction of motion so those are some of the things i'm covering in the videos cursor control oh that's cool oh wait a second this is like a steering behavior like basically i can oh my god i don't know why i've never thought of this is this a thing that other asteroid games do like i'm able to like apply the force um by just using the mouse cursor is it like stronger the further away i go oops kind of looks like it is like if i'm really close yeah it is it's proportional that's well great work ah this is a great train whistle for this one all right this is great very impressed um now um let me look at um vec was that what i was looking at vector thrust or asteroid game i think was looking at asteroid game oh this is just oh cool so one of the things i love about this is also like showing the vectors so you know i could do a better job of this um oh thank you abe is sharing something with me um which i will uh pull up in a second um so one of the things that i could do a better job of is having some of the examples be selfdocumenting or selfillustrative that's a way to say it like by including drawing the vectors that are part of how it works can really help people understand and see um i so the red vector is the current velocity i would assume and the uh white vector is the force that's being applied thrust instant progressive i don't even oh that's interesting friction on off testing oh this is wild look at this that is so cool i mean it's not just annotating a system and diagramming out what all the pieces are and notating the angles and the lengths this is this is really cool to see thank you for this so i hope you all check that check out these projects and hopefully if you're like trying to figure out how to make something like this yourself the video tutorial will help you let's see what else do i got 3.4 i just published this morning so i don't think there are any community contributions but i will point out to you that if you've ever wondered how to kind of do things like this like think about the asteroids game this is actually drawing a circle using polar coordinates and then moving every point along that surf i'm offsetting all the points along the perimeter of a circle randomly closer or further to the center and then putting it together as a polygon so um lots of fun stuff here that you're welcome to do so actually one of the things that i was this is a little bit backwards but the kind of first thing that i want to do today um is for and let's see if i can find it so um in the coding train sketches if you ever want to like figure out what's coming up in future videos you could probably just go to the coding train sketches because you can see all of these things like i'm working on a selfavoiding walk i actually recorded a video but it was uh i i think i have to throw away the footage unfortunately it should have like a second channel with like all just rough blooper cuts of everything by the way though if you want to join coding training as a member um some of my recording sessions i broadcast to have people tuning in to give feedback and that's one of the benefits of joining as a member which is somewhere a button somewhere on your youtube page um so but ah soft pendulum spring i'm looking for recently i recorded a video tutorial about a pendulum january 20th 2021 this seems right which is this ah and so one of the examples in the video um that i mentioned oh oh oh i meant to share abe's sketch as well but let me finish this thought um one of the um example one of the prompts that i mentioned in the video is what if you had an array of these pendulums kind of like all swinging together and so often what i'm doing now with these videos is when i talk through an example and then give an assignment prompt i'll kind of like show the results of that assignment and then link to the example and so i thought like it's a good thing for me to actually like code some of these up during often i just do it like i have i have 15 minutes here i need to create this extra example for the video but i would like to do a lot of these during the live streams so that's kind of like a little extra coding challenge today bonus um where i'm going to attempt to make a version of this with like more pencil it's a little bit backwards because i haven't even released the video that explains this code yet so i don't know you may make a mental note go back and watch that video when it comes out come back and watch this later who knows just enjoy this right now go and do something else right now i have no idea but that's what i'm going to work on while i'm getting set up um let me see if i can find um abe's sketch i'm always hesitant to open up uh discord channels without uh permission um and i'm gonna open this one up oh my goodness oh right this is the stuff that abe and simon are working on together also i believe so you'll have to tell me um the sketch that i'm about to show whether this was one of your collaborations or not but this is really fun so i'm excited to show this to you here it comes all right this deserves a nice little uh uh snare drum ready everybody we're gonna see some exciting spinny springy thingy my bobbers cool so this is a by the way i it's not a big deal and uh i like to look at the sketches um at the the with the full view because it keeps um the most chaotic thing ever it keeps the link to the code and uh noting that it's part of p5 here on the top but look at this so this is coming i have a video about um doing like these springy things so this is actually an example from one of the videos i believe yeah this is the just this like soft stringy thing is the coding challenge that i do pretty debris recently and then um angles and rotation and more springy stuff cool i'm going to just put on a little music thank you for this abe great job and um i am just gonna put on a little music for a second while i get myself set up do so i i i'm looking for i need i need a pendulum class for what i want to do i'm noticing like there's some things that i want to update with this example but um i will do that right now so let me save this and we're going to call this video the pendulum video is going to be coding challenge 159 coding challenge 159 pendulum um exercise so and i think i can turn the music down so the first thing i want to do is i just want to kind of look at this for a second to figure out if i want to adjust anything um before i start to make multiple pendulums um and we can see this is uh the result of this code and i can see a couple things i want to do um this always bugs me i prefer to create an object with an x y rather than make a copy of a vector um so that i'm going to do angular velocity angular acceleration this is all fine let me just look here and say sketch um i think i can take out some of these comments just to like simplify this is i'm going to use some es6 magic p dot go that always has bothered me so first of all i also don't like i mean i can use a slightly shorter word like pendulum um and i also i used to make my examples and maybe i don't know why where um in this go function i call update and display so it's like one function to do all the steps but i've recently i prefer not to do that in my examples and i have found that i prefer to just actually explicitly call update and explicitly call uh display and i i've been calling those functions show also because i think display is a render is another good word but display i think is a key word in some parts of javascript um so let's make sure this still works what if i break oh i broke something no error it completely broke oh okay i remember uh so now i want this to be at uh width divided by two um and uh zero that's where the pendulum is there we go okay so in theory what i'm looking to do so actually the prompt that i give in the um so wasim akram let me answer this question asks will this go and abe says by the way that was a collaboration um with simon so one of the things that i have the capability to do is um in the members discord channel uh the messages there i can bring up on the screen so this is from abe who i mentioned that this was a collaboration with simon okay um so wasseem's question is a really good one will this coding challenge uh will this coding challenge be available as a separate video in the future so i don't i always it always bugged me how i had live streams that then got like edited and repurposed as separate videos and then during my live streams i started really thinking about the editing and i would stop and start and i just i don't know it felt something about it didn't feel like the way i wanted to do things and so i right now i've completely separated these things now that experience is still available because when i record a video that i know is going to be edited um um that those those are streamed for members so people can join and kind of like tune in but there's a lot of stopping and starting and me just like thinking and then i like to go for a walk and take a break and come back so um whereas the live streams now are just live streams they are what they are they have a start a middle and end they're a mess they're great they're terrible who knows uh they're archived in theory i would like to time code them and have good solid descriptions and eyes and all that kind of stuff so this will always be available but i'm no longer editing out stuff now i maybe i should go back to that other way i don't know so at least for right now that's what i'm trying um but uh to answer your what you might have been asking is the how to code a single pendulum i recorded a coding challenge of that which is currently being edited and hopefully will come out soon and it can't come out until i finish this piece of it that i want to include at the end so maybe i'll include a clip of me coding it or something so that people can understand how these things tie together but there you go um all right cube video people are saying they like the cube video i gotta return to that rubik's cube stuff i always do keep a ruby's cube nearby when all else fails i either can try to solve it or um read random numbers i wonder if there's there must be some uh rubik's cube documentaries on curiosity stream by the way i bet i should take a look for that um all right now so what i was saying is the prompt is actually to um if i can just zoom in here for a second is to fill uh pendulums across the top and across the sides and the bottom so let me um let me see if um let me see if i can just start with the top and and steinov is saying would be cool if you edit recording of live stream have some transition between clips yeah that's what i used to do but i also would love to have like highlight videos blooper videos but uh right now there's enough work for i mean the main video editor that i work with is matia um who um i i would be open to like having more content i don't know when i start my tick tock i'll make 60 second little clips for my videos to post on tik tok never gonna happen might happen next year i have a uh i have some plans for next year we'll see if they come into fruition all right let's just start with um making this an array just i'm gonna start this way uh and then oh well first of all so actually before i do that i just want to save this as exercise oop so i think um one of the exercise prompts is also just to make in the coding challenge i don't make it object oriented um so now um i want to duplicate it and say pendulum exercise um i'm going to say array by the way there's this wonderful video on youtube that i used to refer to which has like physical pendulums and somebody like using a board to like line them all up twisting the board and letting it go so they're all slightly offset from each other and it's quite beautiful um is my chat not scrolling here totally it's not scrolling there we go i fixed that okay um so let's see here i don't want to sit in front of the code so move this over a little bit let's change this to an array um and let's make let's let's let's make a variable called spacing how much am i going to space them out let me space them out by 20 pixels and then um i need to what happening to my mouth uh i need to say uh the total number of pendulums is the width of the canvas divided by the spacing and sometimes i want i might want to have one at the beginning and the end so this could actually be plus one and i should make sure that's an integer value plus one then i'm gonna say let i equal zero i is less than total i plus plus and then pendulums index i and then i need a separate x position for each one um and that x position should be i times the spacing and then i should just hear i can say four i'm sitting in an awkward way today let every pendulum of the pendulums uh update and show let's see what happens here there we go so this is what i was looking to do but i need to i want to make this more interesting uh visually visually uh dynamic so there's a few things one important thing here is i feel like whatever i do i want i mean color is maybe something i want to think about here but right now i'm just going to at a minimum give the pendulums alpha so that um and of course now you're probably thinking about a newton's cradle and having to bang into each other that's another that's another project for another time not what i'm doing today uh i think so it's bugging me how much little space i have um let's go to um let's let's space them out a bit more and also have them be not as tall um i think i should make this a square for what i'm trying to do so let's make it 600 by 600 okay so this is more along the lines of what i was expecting to see and want to see um i guess i i this happened by accident but the size of the pendulums must be 50. that's what i'm spreading spreading them out by r equals r so i should probably where do i create those pendulums it might make sense oh there are a hundred what if i say spacing here oh that's no that's the length that's not the size of the where is the size of oh ball radius is 48 it's arbitrary um it's actually called a bob let's call it bob r um let's um put that in there because i think i would like that to be rel something relative to the spacing right now great okay wonderful all right now i'm just curious here what is the first thing i should try in terms of having them should i give them all a slightly different phase should i give them all a slightly different like what's the best way to make this slightly more dynamic um so what are what are some of the the angle that they start on is pi divided by four so what if i were to give them a starting and yes thank you uh harvard natural sciences lecture demonstrations thank you let's see if i google it harvard natural sciences lecture demonstrations pendulum this is 100 um the video that i was looking for let's just watch this for a second oh they're different the heights are the lengths are different does this have sound can't tell if it has sound i don't hear it now i hear it of course now now this leads me to want to do this with a uh the pendulums all yeah okay oh boy oh i really want to make this uh wow that's that's cool so now now i'm sort of tempted to rethink the problem is my exercise prompt i probably shouldn't make the thing that i actually say in the video but i also kind of want to make this uh uh later on so let's let me go forward with what i was doing but i'm realizing here that actually something that might be interesting to try is actually just have their length be uh different so here i could say i times like you know 10 plus i times 10. like what would that do yeah that's basically i mean it's not maybe i should say you know 50 plus i times 20 just to like make it a bit i don't have the auto refresh on and is what i really want to see like many more of these and the damping is a bit of a problem right now because they're all coming to a stop so what if i if i just take that out completely that's pretty cool circular gradient on each circle to make them so steinov is having some great ideas in the chat about adding a gradient um so this is what i'm really hoping other people will do i'm going to leave this fair i might add some color to it just to make it pop a little bit more when it appears as an example but i think thinking about gradients and trails and how to visualize this um yeah put them in the same position that's exactly what i should do um distribute them vertically yeah so this was like a big this is interesting but obviously i'm totally now realizing that the way to make this more interesting is would be not more interesting but another way to think about this would be to have them all just right on top of each other and it's much more about this vertical spacing so um the vertical spacing is uh so i times spacing and the total is the height divided by spacing i don't need the plus one and i might say spacing plus i times spacing let's see if i get this if i remove the circles and flip them upside down i have a laser show i think i need some damping here i should just have it be incredibly subtle so like if i go back to this i think also this will make this much more interesting if the spacing is much less and uh i mean let's go all out with this people uh uh window with window height so whatever i do oh and then this needs to be width divided by two well this is a cool result i'm not sure what i expected um but i'm pretty happy with it i actually think i might want the damping to be even more now it's so exact it was kind of looking i like this idea by the way of thinking about like how i'm drawing this there's not really any reason necessarily to draw the circle um and um just to like add some color to it i'm very color i i always have trouble picking colors but i have this like coating train color palette so let's try adding some of those um i might have to record something to break into the video we can try doing that today and see if how that works um what was i trying to i'm in the wrong sketch um let's go here to the sketch let's set this to be the background but i'm going to give the background some alpha and then let's have the lines be should we try this like like like blue or this pink maybe um so let's go look at the pendulum lines and have them be this and let's just make the stroke weight one and now the question i think also becomes like what's the starting angle that i want like what happens if and maybe these colors are too similar here i don't know how well this comes through over the over youtube but um what if i by the way this is totally like a cozy coding live stream now if you don't know about aaron davey on twitch if you like what i'm doing here i feel like aaron davey does this all the time on twitch just sort of tries out weird stuff um what if i make the starting angle 90 degrees yeah and then i feel like this damping should actually be a bit more that's too much i think because you can see it's it's almost like a cloth or something let's give it another nine by the way it's crazy to think that i just started from this like this is the example and just with like adding an array basically i now have this what if you kept the circles and didn't draw the lines i do like this idea let's try that um okay keep the circles take out the lines let's give the circles also the same fil the same fill that is pretty crazy also like now i'm sort of thinking well i think maybe i want some i want like a little bit of a higher contrast in the color just to be able to sort of visually see what's going on so let's go back to the pendulum and use a different color there's also no reason why i couldn't make this uh like bigger just curious um and also um have the background alpha be a bit more extreme it kind of has like a sonar ultrasound like quality to it for sure like a tree also has a tree like it's quality to it it also really feels like the circles are traveling like oh they're traveling down or traveling up but they're not they're individual ones going but it's a total illusion total illusion i'm sure those of you watching with a flair for design could think about all different ways to apply color and blending um to this flip it upside down and you get the wifi symbol i am interested to see like what happens when i flip this upside down um i guess that would be just a matter of maybe i should is gravity a variable somewhere here yeah so i'm going to take this out and make gravity a global variable this is an arbitrary constant by the way that really affects the behavior quite a bit like we could see like if i make this much high twice as high or if i make this very low wait i'm not noticing a difference i feel like this value should be playing a more significant role um yeah it is negative one times gravity that's weird did i do did i not hit like running oh yeah okay i must not have restarted so this is with a very very low gravity which is actually quite cool um it's more it's it's like oozy oozy wavy um well i really went off a little tangent here oh but what i was trying to do and let's go back to the sketch is if i do this and i make the gravity in the other direction well they're all falling up so now i just need to put their origin at the bottom so this is uh upside down amber says these would make a great screensaver yeah that's my i'm happy with that all right i think i just should stop i have other things that i wanted to do today i've already forgotten what was on my list um and i i should take oh kim perfect timing kim welcome to coding training membership with your membership you will get your very own random pop random number and here we go we're on page 247 of the million random digits book we're in row 12 330 and we are in column 51 and the random number is 51 525 thank you for joining so kim make sure that you uh link your discord and youtube accounts and you'll have access to some of the coding train member stuff in the discord um all right now what if you have four of these pointing in different directions from the center yeah i have to stop like the point of this here let me just save this and please go and make the stuff now and all of these can go on the coding challenge page when i publish it all your contributions so i'm gonna go i'm gonna just move back to here for a second because i don't know what i'm gonna open here in discord uh links um this is i am now posting um the code to discord so go go have fun play with this make something beautiful you know i love it especially when you um share it with me on twitter um there is a coding train uh codingtrain instagram that you can also tag um that's managed by psy um who's done a wonderful job kind of um building the community there so ah so this is perfect timing because it's two o'clock and i could take a break so one of the other things that i wanted to do today which uh you know admittedly may not be as exciting as this and just to just to like really um finish this off here let's make gravity 2.5 just curious if i go here to full and do this what we get wow um um what um um what i would like to do when i come back for my break is work on i have a bunch of sort of ongoing projects and i probably should uh i leave i have a bad habit of leaving things unfinished so i probably should go back to some of these other ones but i wanted to build a system where um we could have the discord bot keep track of people's random numbers because i am working on this is not one of them but these custom train whistles uh with a pattern that's generated from the that it's your random number so i'll come back and explain all of that first i am going to just take a moment um this will just take a few minutes to thank today's sponsor and i'm gonna play you a 30 second video from today's sponsor which uh is curiosity stream and hopefully if the sound is not on during this video please let me know in the chat so but i'm pretty sure it works from the founder of discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service curiosity stream home of groundbreaking documentaries and awardwinning original series follow your curiosity this is curiosity stream i'm back so um as you might have heard me talk about before i'm part of a group of educational creators that teamed up to build a platform where creators don't have to worry about demonetization or the youtube algorithm and it's called nebula and nebula i'm really excited to mention is partnering with curiosity stream so nebula here i have up here um here has a lot of wonderful um channels it's kind of like when i'm looking for something new to watch on youtube i'll often like sort of check out what's on nebula i think i could probably find coding trains somewhere on here um but there are one of the things there's a lot of fun stuff original content that's only available on nebula for example tom scott's money but you might be asking yourself like what does this have to do with curiosity stream so curiosity stream loves educational creators and supporting more educational content so nebula and the creators that involved that project worked out a deal so if you sign up for curiosity stream with that link not only do you get curiosity stream but you get nebula for free so it's a bundle um it's not a trial you're going to have nebula for free for as long as you are a curiosity stream member so and for a limited time curiosity stream is offering 26 off um its annual plan so that's less than 15 a year for both a year by the way i'm not saying 50 a month a year the entire year for both curiosity stream um and nebula so here i can just open up the curiosity stream website there are thousands of documentaries um oop i've got another member or something joining my lights are blinking um and uh oh look i'm gonna let's click on the sneak peek of the library you can see science history technology nature so i'm really partial to the nature one i was mentioning i was watching this moose documentary with my kids um and you know a lot of us are staying inside these days hopefully that's going to be changing more and more we can go into the real nature but you can watch some really amazing nature documentaries you might as well be soothed by daytona david atvero's voice watch chris hadfield um or just watch tom scott torture your favorite youtubers on nebula watch chris hasfield in this space station that is so click to the link above um to get both curiosity stream and nebula for 26 off it's a great way to support the coding train and educational content as a whole for 14.79 per year um right that's 26 off again that's for the entire year so if you're already a curiosity stream member i'd love to hear any recommendations of things that i should watch because i've really been enjoying um checking it out i think um dr hannah fry has a wonderful series about maths um on curiosity stream that i also i just like watched a little bit of and i'm excited to really um dive into that as well so um so yeah so i'm gonna take a short break um you know maybe you want to sign up right now i don't want to be so bold but i'll be back in about three or four minutes and i will continue with looking at some discord bot and database stuff do do do do do do do all right i am back thank you again to curiositystream check out curiositystream.com codingtrain okay um so what's up next i've got about 45 minutes or so and i think the timing is really quite perfect because if i'm not mistaken we just had two new members join so welcome to um ronnie and joseph thank you so much for boarding the coding train where we make strange yellow upside down pendulum patterns yes and for your membership you will receive your very own random number so rather than give you um ronnie and joseph your random number right now why don't we over engineer an elaborate software system to keep track of a random number for you in a very unnecessary way so um what am i going to do here let's go to the youtubes and see um this youtube channel called the coding train and maybe under playlists am i logged in i'm subscribed who am i i don't even know anymore um i'm looking for i think i'm just gonna my discord bot tutorial series so this is the most recent one welcome back to so this is uh my most recent discord bot tutorial i do intend to make some followup um videos um that continues showing other aspects i know working showing embeds and maybe is that the way to say it an embed because i embed something i'm going to embed this onto the web page i'm going to embed this nugget into my mind but if there is a if it's a noun if it's a thing like that's posted in discord it's not an embed it's an embed i think this is really what's important yeah that's kind of genius i wish i could share that more broadly just post a nice little meme about how i just moved from one old side project onto a new one but this one's really important because it has to do with something that i'm on a mission to do and you'll have to indulge me for a second because i don't know how many of you are new today and i'm i'm looking for something that i would have shown like quite a while ago ah here it is perfect um so um what this is and let me zoom in is a uh test run of it's not this train whistle but it is a blank wooden toy train yes this is what i'm talking about people with the coding train uh train etched into it and then on the other side will is a random walk pattern um where and actually i just have a i have a new idea now for the random walk pattern which i just realized nuno thank you so much mwah um for signing up for uh curiosity stream that's nice of you um so um the idea here is that every coding i would like everyone in the world who wants one to be able to have one of these i always say because i don't like this idea of the sort of like exclusive thing but you know i've got to start somewhere so right now everyone who joins at the conductor's level and eventually hopefully the passengers level we'll see if i can get to that um will receive their own custom etched coated train train whistle with a random number pattern generated from their own custom random number got it so so far i have done one one aspect of this which is that if i go to github.com codingtrain and this needs a lot of work by the way so your contributions to this are welcome as well but i think here under the random whistle uh repository um and then if i click over here we'll see it this is a you know i don't know if we'll pull if i don't want to pull this from the database or not but we have a few few tests sort of people in here so if i go to rnav for example puts the rnob's random number there i'm going to uncheck the download click the generate button you know no elegant and now this is arnhem's uh custom random walk pattern based on that random number i don't know maybe this isn't and i'm still working on the maybe i could see that i didn't i don't remember all the details of how i've got at some point i've got to like finalize how it's generated um so they'll start the same place also i'm just using the builtin um the random number generator built into p5 which actually i think is fine i might want to like put the random number generator in the code itself so we can know exactly what it's using or why am i even doing this this is completely insane this is what it has to be a new side project so um i think violet shared with me a link to the uh pdf of this book but i should be using the sequence of random numbers in this book what am i even thinking so i need to first get um so i'll find that we'll redo that i'm not gonna do that right now that would be much more fun because i gotta get this discord thing started um um and so yeah and stig that's a great suggestion for stig actually stig if you have some design ideas i know that's your one of your passions i welcome them and sort of helping figure out how to make this um work i'm also working on um uh um a a video about a selfavoiding walk i think i mentioned that let me just pull that up and and run it so that's like this and conceivably i could actually we could do the selfavoiding walk as the random walk um which you know creates more distinctive geometry i think i can make this more obvious by going to sketch and making the step size like 10. so this is a selfavoiding walk and when it gets stuck it just backtracks to try to go a different direction in theory if i let this run for a very long time it would uh find a path that hits every point on the entire grid um but you know the amount it's doing a brute force algorithm so i got to make a video about this i love this uh kind of pattern this um i i yeah so this could also be a different option for if this sort of visually is not as compelling let's just try it like some of these other ones like hunter parks see what we get right i like this one so this is what i was sort of more imagining that's like a fractal like brownian motion quality to it but but i what i need to be able to track this i need a system by which i can keep track of who the members are um what their um random number is and um their random number and maybe the discord bot itself should actually be like rendering this i don't know who knows um okay um oh and thank you um prathamesh uh highlighted a question from the youtube chat who does the illustration work for the channel so um those animations that you saw the interstitial animations those were made as a onetime thing and i am blanking on the person who made them so i can look that up and i can share that at discord later but the the source material of that is all from jason heglund and just to plug jason stuff for a moment because he really does amazing work and he's working on um um this video of the the train whistle is uh from his shop um out and we can see we were trying different patterns um also as well to see what they look like um but jason heglund if you're interested in learning more about jason um and i think um you can find his website here the coding train stuff is all here coding train expansion it's like another project of all these characters and everything you can find um here with all sorts of ideas but the thing that i was going to highlight for you is jason also has his own shop this i'm called hi hello there co um which has lots of really fun cool little like if you like the coding trade stuff you can get all these like really fun similar style kind of um shirts and shops and things so um wow this is really i haven't looked at this recently it's really really nice so um jason's amazing fred the ghost actually one of the one of my dreams is to make a little coding children's book and i think jason would be a great collaborator for that so if anybody has any ideas or contacts or anything like that um let me know all right let's see when am i gonna have time for that i don't know all right so oh this has been way too long of an explanation let's get to doing the discord bot so let me go to and um let's go to coding train choo choo bot choo choo tweets no discord bot choo choo think this is the current note no because this doesn't have the command handler all right let's go it's weird i i should have prepared this in advance strange uh let's go to the coding train learning uh discord bot by the way uh and now i'm really all in that's why i have a a project in the pipeline about redesigning the coding train website with the loss of the learning playlist on youtube i've given up and i'm just gonna like really try to build a separate website that really helps organize all of the videos and content and code so coming soon um more to come about that but the website that exists right now is amazing and it's been developed and designed by a variety of people that you would probably see here in the chat right now um but i have some ideas for some upgrades all right so what i'm looking for if i go to command handling and we go to view code so this is the code um from that's this is the code that i thought i had this i'm totally confused let's also go to glitch and now as i spend the remaining 40 minutes just finding the code that i was going to work with choo choo bot discord this is the actual bot oh i think i never updated it to use the new command handler code so let's do that dane this is very dangerous what i'm about to do right now but also all sorts of api keys i'm sure are going to be revealed so let me work on oh this is a little bit scary but let's try this uh thank you for indulging me and letting me do some like open source maintenance right now right this is the this is the repo that goes along with the videos and it does not have the latest code in it which is strange but do i have it on the desktop like in a folder called like discord bot choo choo tweets does anybody see it no let's all right let's just clone it we're gonna bring this repo down um i'm going to shut off so actually if somebody i don't know if kobe or david or anybody who's a mod in discord right now i guess i could do this myself but there's that bot testing channel if you could lock that channel down for a moment just make it only like admins or mods can post it um that would be good because i'm going to run some tests in there in a moment um and if nobody does that then i will do that um all right so now i have a what i'm actually going to turn off the bot in theory it'd be good if there was a better way to do this but they're just going to comment out the code right now this is my way of just saying the bot is deployed and running on glitch which also i need to make a video about how to deploy it all right so um the block now the bot is shut off uh david said done thank you um so now i am going to uh open this up in visual studio code so you know when uh whoops no let's actually go into the repo boy that pendulum stuff was fun wasn't it well we've got about 35 minutes here before i've gotta move on with my day so let's see how things go um so this is the discord bot code and this is dot env sample so if you haven't watched these tutorials um one of the things you need to do is have secret keys and tokens and codes to run your bot so i need to i'm going to save this as dot env so i'm going to have the real env file then i'm going to go over to discord and i'm going to click and copy the contents from this file into my local repo but i don't want you to see that so i'm moving over to here and i'm doing copy again it's not a coding train live stream i'm going to definitely going to show these to you by accident at some point but the fewer times i do that the better and now i copied i'm going back to dot env and i'm pasting um and um i am now closing that and going back to index.js okay so now i'm back in this file now here are my secret keys for this particular discord bot and i'm gonna try to run it right now ooh weird oh but this code is oh this is so weird this code doesn't match or maybe it does hold on i'm so confused this is like some really old code all right hold on let's also go back to glitch and grab this a little bit more recent why not i don't know what's going on i obviously haven't been keeping up with what i'm doing all right so now i've got the more slightly more recent code but i'm going to get even more recent code in a second then i need to go and do npm install to install the node dependencies and then let's try just running it okay now i'm going to go over to discord where's my discord and um i i'm gonna go here and then i'm going to go to the bot testing channel which is where it's okay i'm so troubled now so many channels i'll close this uh stage oh here it is spot testing okay uh choo choo hmm ah okay wait we got an error missing permissions what i like the little hearts popping in by the way well this i really meant to set this up before i started today missing permissions have i lost my mind and this is not the correct so hold on so let me quit this pretty sure this is the discord bot is this not do i have multiple glitch projects and this is like an old one that i found that's not actually running beep beep oh oh okay it was david's mistake my bad removed messages from the bot too okay phew should be fixed okay good good good good good all right all is right with the world um so let me let's try it again um and now i'm gonna go back to discord and i'm gonna try this again same issue tick tock tick tock let's see oh i'm not running the bot anymore so let's see maybe maybe i messed up oh there we go we're back we're back in business we're back we're back baby okay um all right so now then i can also say uh gif and we'll get a gif from uh the coding train and i can do things like gif um uh you know uh kitten and i will also get so that's these are the features that are in the discord bot so far i'm literally gonna get as far as like getting set up to add some code that are gonna be done with the live stream uh we'll see um all right so um now what do i want to do the next thing i want to do is go to the more recent code which is here and actually get the code that involves the command handler to work from there so i'm going to go here then i need to add um a folder called commands commands right is that what i do and then i'm just updating the code from what i actually did in the tutorial commands.js oh and then this is then i also need to make there's got to be a more efficient way for me to do this commands.js and a command's folder got it so now i'm going to make a file called commands.js not that needs to be out in the root directory move paste this code in then in here in commands itself i need choo choo dot js and uh what's the other one gif dot js right uh that's what the files i'm loading choo choo and gif and then you know i can go here and get the choo choo code which goes here and by the way all of this code is i you know i go through it in lots of detail in the video tutorials so i don't understand why where it went but obviously it was somewhere and here it is i'm just recreating it and now let's just see what happens if i quit and run it again and is it still working i'm lost i'm lost where do i go discord uh choo choo great and gif right all right so everything's still working um thank you code guppy and marianne i'm keeping it up appreciate it very kind of you um so now next step let's create a branch called command a handler i'm going to check out that branch and this is new code from the command handler tutorial and let's push this to the command handler branch and i realize some of the stuff that i'm doing is going to be very unfamiliar to people who are in the audience right now hopefully just sort of seeing this process is helpful to you um i uh my get github videos could really use a refresher um and now i'm just gonna say um updating the code i should write something more thoughtful but this is a note to myself i will just keep it short and sweet and you're all watching i'm going to create this pull request and this we can see everything that i changed here all of the new code and the changes um um i can merge this then i can just go back to uh main and grab the code merge code and now for my grand finale i'm gonna i'm going to go back to um glitch and i'm going to go to tools import and export import from github and just go to here and import from github paste this in here let's see what happens it's basically rebuilding the project with all the code from github so this is kind of an awkward way awkward highly manual way of deploying a project but it's actually kind of working fairly well for me um you can see there's some log messages where it's kind of booting up and installing node and all of that let's wait for this to finish so now the updated code is deployed to glitch uh oh ah i messed something up so i forgot that i need for it to work on glitch i need to have a start script so i think this would be start and it needs to be i would just say node index.js so i need to add that i'm going to skip a few details here and just do uh i'm gonna uh i'm gonna do something really awful but uh i can't help it i'm pushing domain everybody look away everybody look away i'm not actually doing this look away i'm not doing this okay uh then i should be able to go back to glitch go to tools uh import import from github and just say okay again by the way i have not this is the only way i've not been able to get it to work where i could just push to glitch from from terminal i should be able to but i just pushed to github and then i just manually hit import on glitch and now hopefully yes i think it is oh throw error cannot find module node fetch what have i like messed up here uh the dependencies are wrong that's so weird hold on so strange what what is going on okay i don't know why that wasn't in my package.json what did i do to like remove it adding node fetch everybody look away again look away turn off your computers avert your eyes hide under your desks oh my god oh this is terrible all right now go back to import again import from github by the way no no no no no no this is very bad i don't like seeing that big red message here don't don't don't do something bad to my bot i don't think you can see it i don't think the whole git url was uh available to anybody if it was somebody let me know could i use a github action to automatically export to glish when glitch when you push the main joseph i i hope so um so i you can do this with a lot of other like with heroku or amazon or netlify or versal um so i i should get better at these kind of deployment systems aha there we go beep beep with a little sparkly hearty thingy that means my bot is active and running on um high code guppy um is running on um is running on glitch 237 folks we're making progress here welcome to what act coding is actually like oh i'm gonna add a new feature to this piece of software i'm working on but first i need to spend about an hour just to remember how i got it to run in the first place and also realizing that i didn't update the code in this place and then i have to deploy and then i have to check this and i have to not reveal my secret api key on a live stream welcome to software engineering everyone so flowstriker is asking why should you push domain directly i'm sure some other folks probably can offer some helpful thoughts in the chat i would encourage you to do so i you know i think there are everything you know context is key here and um i think there are scenarios where um you know if this discord bot were being used by millions of people around the world and it was a collaboration that i was building with tens of other people or like lots of collaborators um i would want to have a system with checks and balances where you couldn't just automatically override the sort of main branch of a source code repo without running some tests without having a code review without deploying it to a test server so in those there are like that in that context um you know pushing directly to maine would be a huge problem so in my context of like um keyboard smashing talking on the internet weirdo person like making a bot that posts gifts to a uh to a discord server that i own i'm happy to like bend the rules here but um you know it's important also to try to like set up some good habits but you don't want those hat over engineer those habits that they block you from your you know creative exploration so it's a fine line where to find that balance i definitely lean towards the side of just like keyboard smashing and experimental coding and uh you know really release early release often kind of stuff in the sort of creative coding art and expression education context but i do want to be mindful of good practices and people who really um uh um i hear of the pitter patter of little feet which means i think that pear tart might be ready soon i'm gonna have to go very soon uh but eric is writing um um eric wrote in the chat the idea is to work on branches and commit only when you know it works um i seem to know it works before committing which is not the case is the pair tart ready all right i just need i was gonna finish at three which is 20 minutes from now is that acceptable yeah okay all right everybody start your countdown clock let's see if i get a little bit further here i love actually having a hard out and that my kids come and tell me to stop because as you know i tend to just stream for the whole day and uh it doesn't help nobody's happy in the after two hours um which language am i using to make this bot this is in javascript um with node.js okay so where was i i'm going to go back and comment this out and i want to add a new feature there's no way i'm going to get very far with this right now so let's at least add a command um and we'll i'll be working on this more outside of the live stream with some contributions and then maybe make a video about it but let me add a command so the way i do that is by creating a new file i'm going to call it a number.js maybe i should call that randomnumber i don't know let's just get the chuchu one as a good starting point um and so if this message comes in i'm just going to say um i'm going to reply back with god uh i see you um so i'm just going to i just want to make sure the new command works and then in the commands folder i need to add another variable called number where i import number.js and then that is also a command so that should be good then i just want to redeploy not redeploy sorry i just want to run the bot and test it so choo choo and number oops number i see you okay great excellent so now the question is should the discord bot oh there's a lot of shouting going on downstairs should should the discord bot um offer set the rent let's let's make it so that you can set the random number for yourself so um so just as a quick feature um just to add a little bit more here so the arguments come in um so console.log let's see all right so let's just again i'm gonna have to be more thoughtful about this let's just say if oh yeah let's just say if there's an argument or just um i'm just gonna use one argument so um if args is greater than args.length is greater than zero and args index zero um i need to do a regular expression real quick so um um i think i can do like backslash d plus test um one two three is true uh it's also true so it needs to be the full thing so this needs to be this regular expression i'm skipping around to kind of get going here uh there we go okay so this is my regular expression to check to make sure it's a digit and um if there is an argument and that argument is a num a valid number uh then uh we're gonna say i set your i set your number to args zero oh that doesn't go there otherwise i'm gonna say uh i need a number why i shouldn't have the bot be saying i oh my goodness muhammad is upgrading their membership thanks mohammed um i um i'm going to say number number set to please provide please provide a valid whole number so this is now what i want basically is to test to see did i get a number or not so let's uh rerun the bot what what kind of error happened there commands command is not a function oh it breaks if there's not a command that's interesting i should definitely need some error handling there and there's an error message i guess i need another parenthesis there so now i should be able to say uh number hello please provide a valid whole number number one two three four five numbers set to one two three four five awesome so you can see though this is good i've got a feature going here i wanted to do a so now i'm going to try to set up a mongodb oh well no chance i have time to do this um what's a good way to wrap up in the next 15 minutes well let's get started i'm gonna get started on it um now everyone tells me the last time i did something like this i was told i should be using mongoose but i have no idea what that is but i'm gonna look up mongodb atlas which i believe is um previously i've made video tutorials on how to do this with firebase um but recently i was playing around mongodb atlas and i kind of liked it which is their like cloud service now i think i might have already created an account with my so i'm just going to try to like i'm going to move off here and try to like log in with my account for a second oh password manager so hold on a second uh talk amongst yourselves the number of times i do this while i'm live streaming is insane i should really have this as like a favorite or something here we go show enlarge type somebody told me i should mute myself when i'm typing in my passwords because you could figure it out from audio all right back to being unmuted all right yeah oh right i've shown this because this is what i'm using for the other side project that i failed to keep going uh the forrest gump 500 project i really love some contributions and help with that because i feel like um um so but we'll see uh uh gjoe jijo says i think that if someone knows your password from the audio they 100 deserve it i kind of agree i also have two factors so what's it really going to do for you so i think what i need to create is um um uh solar liner is saying i'm just curious about this comment um you should talk about deploying with docker2 a dockercompose.yml file along with a simple server would solve all your deployment problems okay i'm interested in this tell me more tell me more about solving all of my deployment problems i don't really know very much about docker so that would be really helpful and awesome uh all right um so what i need to do here is create this is like the gump 500 database how do i make a new one create a new cluster no i'm in a cluster this is definitely a cluster what gum 500 how do i make what is gump 500 is that a like um if i go here project i want a new project right random what should i call this uh i'll just call it random numbers okay next um knock i will add some other people later maybe i'm the owner create the project then the idea here is that do i need to build a cluster i need a cluster okay or do i do database grade data lake what's a lake there's a lake with data in it do i click build does anybody know let's create the cluster ah oh no no no wait free free free yes yes yes for learning mongodb or small applications yes okay um i guess i don't need to do i need to do another one i'm so confused um aws i do have this looks good fine okay connect i got 10 minutes i think i actually could do this because to be honest i'm i'm um this is going to be skipping some steps but just to get a little further here if i go to the gump 500 project which is a twitter bot that i am working with mongodb is i kind of have the code for all of that here so i can just grab this code but let's um so okay so i think i need to now um i think i need to click on this connect button and this connect button is maybe going to give me some secret information um and so i'm gonna also switch over here this is why by the way recording video tutorial is as good of this stuff because then i could just like keep everything in but blur out or reset all the tokens afterwards but live streaming is typical difficult connect by the way i really have no idea what i'm doing here and this might be completely overkill but i've really been looking for a simple free database as a service cloud service um and in my experience i guess i'm still creating that cluster so unfortunately we're in this sort of like wait waiting so while we're waiting let's go um back to here and um in index let's require let's see hold on um let's go back to gump oh my cluster is complete of course this happens so now i'm going to click on this connect button but i'm taking you away because i don't know what's going to pop up no it still says it's what this is so weird didn't it just say it was finished now it's saying it's being created again this is so bizarre all right let me go back to here and go to here and i want to require mongodb so i know i need to add to my bot require mongodb i need to say npm install mongodb so i'm adding the mongodb javascript thingy the node package then uh inside in the to connect to the database i'm going to just connect catch i'm going to just add this exact code um which will oh it should really be in the numbers yeah i'm gonna you know what i'm gonna do well so tricky here right now i'm going to assume i'm going to do something to make the assumption that this mongodb is only for that number command so i'm going to take this out i'm going to put it in here and i think this kind of like to the database when it boots up thing will still happen if i put this just into the number file right so um so i could have made a new database i could have made a new database with a dif with the same cluster some i don't understand what the cluster is versus the database versus the collection i've got to figure that out but let's just um so i'm going to create a uh a numbers db and uh we'll call this numbers people i don't know uh numbers db i want to connect to um oh and there's uh i want to just connect to that database so let's see i just want to successfully connect to this database so back to the page that might have my hopefully my secret connection stuff yeah okay so first of all it's definitely live now it's connected now i'm really going to hit this button collections i didn't i don't understand can i use the same i'm so confused someone will explain this to me but let me just click connect okay allow access from anywhere set up security choose a connection method okay the first user will have keep credentials handy okay so i i can show this to you so i'm going to create a database user with allow access from anywhere which is probably a little bit scary to do and i'm going to make a user called coding train and then i am going to auto generate a secure password i assume it's going to let me regenerate one so i'm going to i'm going to click that a bunch of times then um i'm going to hit create database user keep your credentials handy let me let me try to save that password i'm saving that password in my env file right now and then i'm going to hide it so now i can go back and hit create database user choose a connection method connect your app so this is where i don't remember which one i pick i think it's connect your application oh javascript interface no i think it must be this one yes okay i shouldn't be showing this to you but at least i'm not showing you the use the password but i think even this like this cluster address i probably should be keeping secret but i'm going to copy this oh look at this and it gives me this is definitely right node.js i could actually get a full driver code example but i'm going to copy this and i'm going to put this into my env file i'll show you in a second so db um mongodb so i'm going to i just want to zoom where the the and put this off the screen so i what i'm going to do is in my dot env if i'm ready db and i'm putting this um url path oh i'm showing you my tenor key i didn't realize my other key was there good job everybody thank you thank you and good night thank you thank you thank you and that's the end of today's go we showed it's 2 58 pm i showed you one of my api keys and we're done uh the cluster is a server the server can have any amount of database the database can have any amount of collections so i should have done this a different way um you know have fun with my tenor key i'm gonna just reset that pretty soon so good luck move fast people i'm gonna do that right now um let's see tenor api key i mean i don't know what you could do with that uh sign in i'm resetting that api key really i don't even know where okay it's going to take me a while to find how i even logged into tenor in the first place so i think that api key just lets you get gifts so um you know all right uh the funny thing is i seriously am done the cluster is a virtual machine that runs the database so i should have done this right it's three o'clock so you know welcome to the new coding train where i just cut myself off at a certain time let me just talk about what my intention is to do next um and if anybody wants to help uh contribute i think i'm gonna make a branch so let me make a let me let me finish off by um making a branch with what i've done so far i'm just going to close the dot env file i'm going to here so i'm going to um here i'm going to go back to here i'm gonna do git branch a number db get check out number db um git add git commit um new code for random number db so now that branch i'll even make it like a draft i'll show you something that's that you can do so i can make this a draft pull request starting to work on a database of random numbers um this this is for the coding train custom random number whistle project and i should um i should link to this repo as well and then i think i can do this create draft pull request so this isn't done but the code you can find it if you want to look at what i've done so far by going to this pull request and i am going to add that back into discord under links um i'm gonna say goodbye so i will continue to work on this uh maybe i'll revisit it next week's live stream uh maybe i'll just do it on my own or you know some other contributors will add to it um just as a reminder um as i wrap up here um you know we did have some successes today by creating this sort of pretty interesting examples of this like whole collection of pendulums that are like upside down swinging back and forth i actually really think i want to leave this this it's lovely but i kind of really liked it with the lines so i actually am going to change it back to the lines so we can just remember what that looked like oh take out the circles um so we can see what that looks like with just the lines so if you just joined recently this is what i did earlier in today's live stream um if you make a version of this please share with me right now the best place be shared with me at twitter shiffman on twitter um i really want to encourage you hopefully the next one will be out later today or tomorrow but i really want to encourage you to follow along with the new nature of code video tutorials um add your uh community contributions here uh leimer daniel doesn't have to be the only person with community contributions add them here and um i really also want to remind you to um check out this syllabus that i'm actively working on that i really welcome suggestions and pull requests um here as well so i'm going to put on this goodbye song and just answer maybe one or two last questions from the chat and then i'll be saying goodbye and uh bot testing is reopened i think that i should reenable the glitch spot so let's oh it actually it's not running so let me put uh the coding train bot back on um do you speak oh no i'm just looking socket servers so people are talking about sockets and node um and i'm just checking out the chat there's not really too many questions there right now of course you're all a little bit behind so uh oh i didn't give the random numbers to our new members so who are those new members i'm scrolling up boy there's a lot of chat by the way thank you to marianne marianne marion and code guppy for all of your support it's very kind of you uh we've got um ronnie and joseph i didn't even read any random numbers today so um i'm ronnie your random number that i just this is cool that's the first three numbers of it or the first three digits of pi well not the first yeah i mean if you count the three as a digit um so from page 137 6 000 row 6825 your number is 31 413 right and then we could just set it in discord but can't do that yet so that might give people new rand what's one random number versus another now for joseph joseph oh this is kind of a cool random from page 27 row 1 325 88 890. that's your random number joseph thank you to joseph and i'm ronnie for joining um i'm checking out the chat which now i have scrolled up a sixpoint snowflake generator why don't you make a playlist of all your live streams so this is oh oh i feel kind of sad about this no so i just need to do that i really would like to have a nice solid playlist of all of my live streams well annotated and it's just a lot of work to maintain and do that so um if i can um you know get somebody from the coding train team to allocate some time to work on that or if somebody from the community wants to sort of volunteer to help with that that's definitely something i would like to do but it's i'm just like i fell so far behind and it's not something into my sort of weekly work practice of like going back to the live stream adding time codes adding a description linking to all the things i talked about but it would be so helpful for people to be able to go back and find things like even just that one little section about me coding the pendulum so i would love help for that um abhay writes you didn't see this one dan but i'm not sure what that's referring to a very auspicious number i would agree a very auspicious number all right everybody goodbye thank you again to uh curiositystream for uh sponsoring today's live stream and i will see you all hopefully next week stay tuned for all of the new nature of code videos that are coming whip to be released click the like and subscribe stuff don't you don't have to though you really don't have to i just thought it's a thing people say i'm looking for the song that i'm going to play there it is as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm going to do this stop this stop i'm going to do this this stock this stock is stopped this never forget this dot song never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward coordinate song it's the forward new cartesian coordinate song autotune and the internet will fix that for me see it with me it's the polaroid song unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids the kittens kittens and kittens the kittens kittens the kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effect what else is that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes kittens and kittens and kittens at dust medina you
