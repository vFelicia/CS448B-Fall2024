hello welcome to another WebGL p5.js tutorial in this one I am going to actually don't even have this on my list of stuff but I'm gonna look again at the texture function and previously I looked at how to use an image or a video as a texture in this video I want to look at how to make an offscreen graphics buffer essentially like a 2d canvas that I'm drawing somewhere else how to make that a texture in the 3d world and the way to do that is where the function called create graphics now I should mention I have an another video entirely just about create graphics that'll be linked to in this video's description if you want to go look at that but I'll also explain it in this video so you can just keep watching ok so I'm starting with a very simple WebGL example the only thing for this example is a sort of empty space with a spinning cube and the cube at oops the code is here there is a single directional light there's an ambient light and I'm kind of rotating this box using the box function to make this cube now we know that the texture function works in a previous video as well so I also have here unloading like an image of a kitten so just just to see that texture works let's add texture and then that kitten is that what I called it kitten yes so if I add that we now see the kitten on the side that same kitten on the side of every of h9 the box now one thing will be an interesting exercise is how would you make a different image on each side you're gonna have to make this a custom shape maybe you make it a bunch of planes maybe use begin shape and shape I'll come back to that in another video but right now and we should make the light come from the front actually so I'm gonna have the light come from the front just directly from the front this directional light because I want to be able to see the beautiful bright kittens as they face forward ok so but what I want to do is not have to be an image so a way that I can create create canvas is a function that makes a canvas and I've made a canvas a WebGL 3d rendering canvas but I can also use another function and I'm gonna call it I'm gonna create a very bob it's gonna call it graphics and I'm gonna say graphics equals create graphics and now I'm gonna make a square image to 200 so I'm now making a graphics object that's 200 by 200 and this is something that can be textured to the box so this graphics object it's like a canvas I can texture to the box so let's look now let's refresh now I don't see anything why do I not see anything because when I make a graphics context the first thing it is is just the transparent pixels but I can call any of p5 2d drawing functions on that graphics object so I could say graphics dot background and say background 255 and now we see that is there and you know what I could do I could even say graphics dot background and now this is gonna flicker so a little flickering warning here in advance random color you can see this is now just giving it a random background every frame so whatever I would draw on it so for example I could also do something like graphics the ellipse Mouse X Mouse Y Mouse Y 20 and I could say fill oh no graphics dot fill 255 0 255 now watch what this will do look as I move the mouse around I'm kind of drawing on that graphics object and it's still texture to the each side of the cube now what when would you want to do this number one is just what do you want to do something kind of goofy or interesting uh yeah I'm sure you can think of creative uses of this more than I can but here's a reason why you might actually have to use it at present I don't know that this will always be true but at present the only way to render text in 3d is to actually use that with the text function is to take that place the text on a 2d 2d graphics context and then move down a texture so for example if I wanted to have a message like let love equal I'm gonna make another graphics context graphics equals create I don't love equals create graphics graphics so my kids used to say instead of breakfast breakfast or breakfast I feel like every time I say graphics I'm saying it wrong we should believe graphic anyway create graphics I don't know I've lost my train of thought haha 300 comma 100 and then I'm going to say love dot fill 255 and I'm going to say loved textaligncenter and then I'm gonna say love dot text 100 the word love 150 comma 50 so this now should be an a twodimensional graphics context that's 300 by 100 that has the word love in it so first just to like see that this is working let me texture it whoops all right what happened what did I do wrong here create oh you know what hold on a sec interesting whoa ok so one thing that just happened there which I wasn't aware of would happen and let's say love dot text size 64 to make it bigger is that so here we go now one thing you'll notice is again the image a texture a graphics thing is transparent by default so I'm actually just seeing those letters on the side but the rest of that cube is transparent if I had said love duck background and I said zero for example this now I don't see that cube as transparent anymore so that's an important thing to notice and I could make it semitransparent like I could say 255 255 255 comma 100 so now it's like semitransparent so there's a lot of possible things I can do here ok but there was an important thing I wanted to mention which is that when I made when I made and I wanted this to be more in the center there we go that's more in the center when I made the graphics context not a square like 300 comma 200 it broke so I'm not sure whether this is a bug in the p5 WebGL at present or whether this is just something that you actually really have to be conscientious of but because what I would have expected it to do was take that image and kind of like squish it onto the onto the side of the cube but it's not doing that at present so something I might have to investigate in the future but what I wanted just like what I was actually thinking is what if I let's just take this out for a second what if I just wanted the text to appear and almost look flat the way that I would probably do that would be to say texture love plain 300 comma 200 so a plane is a flat surface with a given width and a height so if the text itself is exactly if the if the offscreen canvas is exactly 300 by 200 if I make the plane 300 by 200 it should map directly so let's take a look at that and that also did not work so what's the issue look at this so it looks like the issue is at present p5 WebGL can only take square textures this is a bit of a problem so to me I feel like this is a bug because I know for a fact that this kitten image was not a perfect square image so there's no reason why p5 can't figure out how to take a non square image and kind of squish it or stretch it onto a non square or a square piece of geometry so but I'm gonna leave that aside maybe sometime by the time you're watching this will be some information in the comments or the video's description about how that's fixed but no matter if all I wanted to do was display text there's no reason why I couldn't just make you know I could for now what I can do is I can make my graphics object and plane and plane object match size I can position the this in the center the way that I want to I can make it have a transparent background and I can say use that as a plane and here we go whoops what have I done so I need to say text align whoa okay hold on I'm missing a couple things textaligncenter the creek graphics I wanted it to be 300 by 300 I messed up some stuff oh whoa cuz I changed that this was something I was using previously sorry everybody and now there we go so and by the way if I take this out now I have just text in 3d that appears 2d the reason why I'm showing this to you is because now if I put the rotation back in if I put the lighting back in we can see this is now just appearing like text in 3d which is what I wanted to show you in the first place so here's an exercise for you find some interesting 2d animation generative designs for example you could take this fractal tree design that I do a video about where to witch cook the code is over here I'll link to both of these in the video's description can you make this tree a texture in on a 3d piece of 3d geometry what happens if you texture to a sphere a torus a cube that's a good thing so give that a try and see how that goes thanks for watching
